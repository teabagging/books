If you are a fan of the series, I would say read and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"When i read the first Anita Blake book, i was awwed. Mystery, action, humor, REAL HORROR in such a small package, and i haven't stopped since. Now i get to Cerulean sins. quickly:The ardeur is just lame, the harlequin novel men with long hair, and the LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG DRAWN OUT sex or sexual-ish ness is just boring to no end. Its long, drawn out and dry like some \\"my first threesom\\" documentary done by married woman who long to be with another man than the one their married to soooo badly. Like someone stuck in the country who longs for a visit to the \\"BIG CITY\\" so they make this drawn out housewife fantasy with vampires instead of wind machines and big boats and swelling music. Mrs. Hamilton, thank you for you work, but i have NEVER skimmed through pages of your books until this one. I've found myself fighting off mean words as i mumbled to myself reading this. Oh, and Richard??? Please kill him, how you've made him this annoying is....well? He's not an Ulfric, he's become and ul-BITCH!! Him with his hissy fits, and anita humping the puppy and plants??? OH COME ON!!! What happened to the Horror, Mystery, humor and action? It feels like three different books. A book for horny 40something housewives needing something to keep them from shagging the bag boy at the local pigly wigly. ***sigh***. Now having let that out.....thank you for your work Mrs. Hamilton, there are moments in here, but they are...well, just that: moments. smalllllll, lil'moments. *sigh* Reading this led me closely down the path of the DARK SIDE. cheers."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As with all the books in this series, the character of Anita Blake is a fascinating character and what really makes the series work. As always in the more recent books in the series, the character of Anita moves farther and farther away from the character who we met in the initial few books, at least on the surface; that evolution is what makes some people love this story and the few that have come before it, and others hate them. But she's still Anita, and still enjoyable to spend some time with, even if some of her attitudes have changed markedly from what they once were. (Of course, it doesn't hurt that her attitudes are becoming MORE, rather than less, like mine; I'm sure that the objections are mostly coming from people for whom that isn't true.) In this book, we even see that she's learning to play vampire politics when necessary; she still hates it, but she's demonstrating a remarkable talent for it when necessary.The one thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is that it is noticeably less well proofread than the previous entries in the series; there were more typos and sloppy mistakes in the first third of this book than there were in the first ten books of the series put together. (After the 1/3 point, the problem mostly cleared up.) Things like using \\"breath\\" instead of \\"breathe\\", \\"bare\\" instead of \\"bear\\", \\"calvary\\" insteadof \\"cavalry\\". There were several misplaced commas, too, one notable example of which being \\"Until somewhere in the middle of it all, I begged, Asher to enter me, take me.\\" There were other examples almost as bad that I didn't note down. I know Laurell is capable of better than this, because the first ten books of the series were ALMOST flawless in this regard; I have to assume that her publisher/editor fell down on the job. But it still detracts a bit from the book; I can't give 5 stars to anything with this many sloppy mistakes."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's books used to have amazing plots, interesting mystery and believable character development. Recently though, in this and her new fey series, her books consist of lots of meaningless sex and little else. This book had two interesting things: a new assasin and the Mother of All Darkness. Unfortunately, it seems that these pieces were mistakenly not edited out of the final copy. I say that because it seems that Hamilton originally planned to make them the center of the story, but she moved to other things and forgot to take out the pieces that no longer fit. I was very disappointed because we had only a few references to each, and then they disappear and there is no real closure (or pretend closure). The real storyline was nonexistent and seemed more like a subplot than anything else. I was so mad I bought this book in hardback. I knew that with the fey series I'd just get an erotic fantasy porn book, and I'm dissapointed Hamilton has gone that way with my beloved Anita Blake as well."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"'Cerulean Sins' has delivered everything I was hoping for and more. I couldn't put it down. I love this book, I love the character development. If you haven't read the earlier books in this series, go back and do so. I continue to be amazed, each character has grown and changed so much. Each one impacting Anita's life, just like each person in my life impacts my decisions.The titilating history between Jean Claude and Asher gets kicked up a notch in this book. Giving this reader, exactly what she'd been hoping to see. Anita exquisitely rides the fence of the moral dilemma she faces. While, Ms. Hamilton knows how to keep the sexual tension at a fever pitch and uses it to it's best advantage.I for one, can't wait for the next book. The author hints that Richard and Anita are headed for something explosive, no matter which way the relationship turns. I'm sitting on the edge of my seat.Thank you Ms. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This version of the series of Anita Blake was horrible! Laurell K. Hamilton has added so many men to this series that it has become laughable. The \\"ARDUER\\" is an excuse for Anita to end up in bed with so many different men I can't even keep track of all their names. The once difficult yet fun triangle of Jean-Claude/Anita/Richard has been kicked out the window and unlike most fans I see it as gone forever. Anita even mentions at one point the bond could become her/JC/Asher/Micah. Micah in this novel is her steady boyfriend when in a previous novel they'd had one of the most violent sexual encounters that it bordered on rape for my taste. Now suddenly he is just another yes man in her arsenal.Asher speaks his mind once saying that Anita does things sexually with men and then once the passion or ardeur fades she tosses them aside wanting distance. I found this added item a horrible addition to this series. I don't understand why in order for Anita to be with Jean-Claude Laurell K. Hamilton had to take away so many of the aspects that made Anita great by making her nothing more than a whiney sex starved creature of the series.Richard and Jean-Claude together had enough to carry this series, but now we have a cast of characters I personally can't keep up with half the time. Richard seems to have become the bad guy because he refused to deal with Anita having a harem of men who do her bidding with no questions asked.An interlude between Anita/JC/Asher has Anita once again whining over the fact that JC asks her to leave after she once again cries that Asher has used Vampire wilds on her. But eventually they all give in to her.This version in the series is shallow and doesn't hold up to the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This is a very bad sequel to the previous books. This book appears almost to be two ideas badly stapled together and never really gels into a coherent story. It opens with a client interview and a graveyard scene, which look like the lead into a nice plot based story. However, it suddenly segues into a boring and not very novel vampires and sex story arc where the characters do little beyond have sex and threaten each other. Right at the end of the book it suddenly swerves back to the original plotline and suddenly introduces a bad guy to kill for end of the book.This is a poor book and I found it a boring read."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book has a little more plot than most of the other later Anita Blake books, but only a little.It's about half sex. Stale, repetitive sex at that, too. I can't recommend any of the recent Anita Blake books with a good conscious. Hamilton was never that great a writer, what made her books worth reading was the character: Anita Blake. But, now, it's only the same character in name only. There really isn't anything else recongnizable about her anymore."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I couldn't finish this book only because I have no interest. I have faithfully read every LKH Anita Blake book, rated them ALL 5 stars. Every book I believed just got better than the one before it. I was glued to Narcissus in Chains, and my gears came to a grinding halt after about 1/4 of this book. Just so boring, and pathetic and way way too much useless needless dumb sex that means nothing. I am scared for the next book - \\"Incubus Dreams\\" I am hoping that the plot will come together (or that there will be a plot. I am hoping that Anita begins to get her mind back together and I am hoping that this is just a bump in the road of this series. Very dissappointed."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First off, I admit to loving Narcissus in Chains. It wasn't perfect and I think the sexual overtones probably could have been toned down a little bit, but it didn't seem to me to be so completely out of place with the series. It just seemed to be taking things to the next level. Anita has been evolving so I had no objections. Plus, I like Micah. No, I love Micah. Who we never see enough of... He really needs to be developed.I feel that Cerulean Sins did not do what I expected it to do. I still very much enjoyed it, which is why I gave it four stars(I would have given it a 3.5 if I could have.) But there was a lot missing in this book and I'm really hoping that it's simply because the series has come to a point where it needs a transition between what has been and what will be; this book very much felt like a transition, kind of like how the second book in trilogies tends to suffer. The other books feel a lot more whole, but this one... It felt short and a bit rushed. And I too am getting tired of the ardeur. It is a plot point that has been stretched too far. One of the great things about each book has been the introduction of something new, but this book didn't really seem to do that enough. It simply continued plot points from previous books. Ok, it did introduce a few new things, but not major enough.One would think that, after the critisism that Narcissus in Chains got, she would veer more toward the style of the older books. I'm not saying get rid of the sex. I love the sex. But I miss Edward and Larry and I miss seeing more of the crime scenes and I miss the fight scenes and watching Anita battle her way out of a sticky situation. It seems like she tried to put too much in this book... There were little glimpses of interesting things but not enough of any of them. This should have been a much longer book, I think, to have made it better. Or she should have left out some things for a seperate book.Unlike many others, I am not giving up on this series, because I still love it. I was just a bit dissapointed by this one, but I have faith in Laurell K Hamilton. I'm looking at this book sort of like the eye of a hurricane. Things should be getting much better and more exciting soon."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This was a fun read. Great airplane-type stuff, although all the back history is a bit thick for someone (me) who has not read other entries in the series. And too much endless annoying talking about relationships. But the real problem for me is this book contains a truly appalling number of mistakes. It's riddled with typos, misspellings, incorrect punctuation and unintentionally incorrect grammar. I'm really very surprised it comes from a major publishing house; don't they employ people for the specific purpose of cleaning such things up? It may seem a small point, but after several chapters of this it becomes distracting, annoying, and detracts from the author's, well, authority. It makes the whole package seem juvenile and poorly produced. Shame on Berkley Books. (Now I just hope I didn't misspell anything in this...)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've read all of Hamilton's work, and I have the feeling she's been reading the reviews from readers. Although a lot of the aspects of NiC IS still present, there are some big differences, and they happen to be all the ones we complained about.Really the primary one is, well, the amount of sex. There wasn't a \\"four guys, one girl\\" thing (thank GOD), but there still is a lot of it. Hamilton can't seem to keep her hands off the erotica stuff, and, having read the \\"Gentry\\" stuff, I think she's trying to find her stride in the \\"Blake\\" novels. Frankly, I don't think that it NEEDS all the sex, but OKIE-DOKIE.In the \\"Gentry\\" novels, there's a lot of men literally begging to have sex with the solo woman, and she is okay with it, in a whole \\"sex is okay\\" kinda way. I suspect Hamilton is trying to do that with Anita Blake, because there was a lot of discussion on what exactly constitutes \\"sex\\" and the differences between the \\"American\\" and \\"European\\" definition. Also, Hamilton seems to be making Anita take \\"control\\" of the ardeur, which means it may not show up in the next one! (My personal hope)I'm also glad there were more vampire, and less were- politics. Richard thankfully improves in this one, another saving grace, and Damien finds a new purpose (I guess hanging around looking pitiful wasn't good enough).Anita is ACTUALLY BACK AT WORK for this one, and by that I mean she's raising the dead, but Hamilton also loosened more of the strings that controlled Anita's sphere of influence by making her a \\"Federal Marshall.\\" Plot device, ahoy! Let's see where she goes with that one.Any way, the head of RPIT, Dolph, loses it in front of EVERYONE, and international terrorists are after Anita for some reason. (You're going to just have to read this one; it's kinda flimsy.)BUT... I don't read these things just for the plot anymore (otherwise, I wouldn't have read NiC, really). I REALLY want to see where Richard, Anita, and Jean-Claude go. Hamilton also seems to be gearing up for a HUGE slugfest with the Vampire Council.There's a therapy session with Jason that was sort of interesting, but Anita does some more \\"woe is me; no one can love me, just for me, not even me.\\" She's hopefully getting out of this, or she was towards the end of the novel.If I seem to be complaining more than praising, it's because there is a lot to like and a lot to get discouraged about. Hamilton always makes the fight scenes interesting, the relationships of the various characters make it worth reading, the connection of all these individuals is fascinating, and it is, in its own way, a reminder than one person can make a difference to a lot of individuals, who, when counted together, are many thinking as one. She kept the humor and the complicated nature of relationships intact.I also like the introduction of more vampires (Belle Morte and Musette), and Jean-Claude finds a new power. Jason gets more of a spotlight, and there's definite indication that he and Nathaniel are growing up!Ah, but Musette doesn't get enough time, there's a lot of ethereal hocus-pocus that's just not as interesting as the physical trouble (like when two servants of the Mother of all Darkness show up), and Anita doesn't get to really kick anyone's ass. When will she get to be physical, like she used to be, and not rely so much on her magic or her gun? It's this bend on self-reflection that's going to get Hamilton in trouble, because I didn't start reading Anita Blake to get a pseudo-therapy session. Anita's got a lot of hang-ups, and Hamilton is slowing turning her into someone else. Character development, I suppose, but it doesn't FEEL like character development. It feels like betrayal because it's happening so fast, unlike the changes in Nathaniel and Jason. Hamilton is pushing Anita Blake, and it's taking its toll on reader, author, and character.I hope the next one is even better. I hope that CS is the first step towards a better Anita Blake, with less emphasis on sex and the purely magical (when you read the whole \\"Mommy dearest\\" stuff, you'll know what I'm talking about), and more focus on the tightly written plot and the physical. I want more of what brought Anita Blake to my attention before, which was a clean plot structure and good character development, and I'm willing to wait for a long while if it means that I can get a better book for it. Still, this one was SO much better than NiC, with more humor and less trauma, it's good to see Hamilton is trying hard to keep Anita alive."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Enough with the increasinlgy pornographic sex (and how many times can she use ardeur in a passage anyway?). Enough with the ridiculous accumulation of superpowers. And, gawd, enough with the flowing, nearly feminine locks of all non-human males. I've read all of the Anita Blake, and while I once was very entertained with the feisty Blake who used wit and luck to survive, I'm now puzzled by the character that Hamilton is creating. I just can't relate to the ridiculous developments. And if I wanted to read about wild sex, I would just buy a Cartwright bodice ripper instead."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been a loyal Anita Blake fan sinice...well, since last August. I bought Guilty Pleasures, and instant fell in love with the series, and devoured the next nine books by November. Although Narcissus in Chains was...wow, really different to say the least, I couldn't wait for Cerulean Sins. Hm.It starts out good. Anita is actually back at her job for the first time in a long while. Then sex seems to take over again. Although I wanted to see her hook up with a certain male character whose name starts with a \\"J\\" (not to spoil...) I didn't actually think it would ever happen, and now all the fun is taken out of it. Why Anita has to sleep with some of these men is sad. The Ardeur is just an excuse for gratutious sex. Thankfully, there is more plot inbetween the sex than there was in \\"Chains\\", it still isn't enough. The basic plot is Anita feeding the Ardeur, Musette coming to represent Belle Morte, and lots of vampire politics. And some murder Anita that is supposted to be helping figure out, wich is concluded in the last few pages of the book. It almost seemed like Hamilton thought, \\"Well, I'm not quite sure how to solve this case, so I'll just throw some stuff together that leaves my readers feeling cheated\\"Not to say I didn't like this book. I did, in fact, like it a lot. There are some good plot points. You feel pain for Asher and Jean-Claudes past. And as for Richard...I coudn't bring myself to hate him until this book. I'm glad it gave me a reason to, I was getting so sick of him. He is awful, and a certain thing he did to himself [made me very angry].I reccomend this to loyal Anita Blake or vampire/supernatural creature novel fans only. It doesn't have that same multi-genre appeal that the earlier novels did."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Here we go again!Ok, I'll try to keep this brief. Ms. Hamilton, you've managed to thoroughly destroy the character of Anita Blake. With Merry Gentry, we knew we were getting sex, amoral morons, and really ridiculous amounts of the supernatural.Sadly, you have decided that this is the direction in which Anita Blake must travel as well. Which is a shame. Anita had conflict, Ania evolved, and Anita was a person. Now Anita, JC, Richard, et al, are simply charicatures of a once-enjoyable series. The only character experiencing any growth is Jason.What could have been an abolutely amazing and mind-blowing plot was relegated to a few parts of the book. What bugs me is that the publisher had the audacity to state that this was a main part of the book. Please, don't insult my intelligence! &lt;sigh> Instead we get a shot to the head in the middle of a mall food court. &lt;Yawn>Anita spent sooo much time griping about the lack of morals of everyone around her, she failed to notice that she doesn't have a whole lot left herself. Part of Anita's charm was the fact that things like her faith or a stuuffed penguin or her boyfriend could be her refuge, her sanctuary from the big, bad world. And the struggle to keep from becoming Edward was a huge plus. There was passion, and drama, and well, everything this book lacked.First, enough with the ardeur and the sex. It's tedious, boring, and dull. Do we really need to read about Anit'as sex-capades? NO. This whole ardeur/incubus/succubus thing could have been handled much less graphically. And with better writing and more effort on LKH's part. Instead, we get the lazy attempt which is this book.Second, Micah needs to be shot. So do the following characters: Nathan, the wereleopards, the werewolves (I think that's enough). Oh, and please stake Jean Claude, Damien, and Asher. Then please put Anita out of our misery. Probably the only way to save the series.Third: What happened to Animators, Inc.? Where are the fun bunch from there? The human element of Anita's life? What happened to Ronnie? Burt? Anita's zombie-raising red-headed trainee? His wife? Their kid? C'mon, all these perfectly good characters going to utter waste.Fourth: Resolve the Dolph sitch. Or spend more time on it. It was handled very poorly. Period.Fifth: Enough with the \\"Super-Anita\\". Able to make all men love her, constantly develops new powers through judicious use of the sadly overused \\"deus ex machina\\", etc. I understand that Anita has to grow and evolve as a person, Animator, triumverate member, pard leader, werewolf enforcer, girlfriend to the Master of the City, Federal Marshall on all things supernatural, and I think that about covers it. Too much going on, LKH!What this book needs is for most of te characters to be cut. There is talk that Edward will be returning, and hopefully that's with enough grenades to take out the Circus of the Damned, the Thronnos Rokke Clan, the Blooddrinker Clan, and any spare freaks left laying around. LKH, you've gone completely over-the-top, and I'm not sure how you plan to resolve this. Or are you just laughing all the way to the bank as we, your fans, spend out well-earned cash on this literary masturbation?"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a big-time Anita Blake fan. Yes I am one of those who waits with anticipation for her newest novel. From my first reading of Guilty Pleasures I was hooked. I was still very happy novels 2 through 4. Novels 5 through 8 started to become whiny and melodramatic, but I hung in there, hoping the newest addition to the series would improve. I AM DONE! This is my last Anita Blake Novel! I not only spent my hard earned $22.95 plus tax to purchase this novel, but used my free time to read this smut.Now where do I begin? First there is our hero Anita Blake. Imagine a comic superhero gone wrong. Give this superhero the attributes of Superman, throw in all the skills of the entire X-Men cast and the strength of the Incredible Hulk. Now take this overblown superhero and then try to turn it into a workable character. Well you have Anita Blake in a nutshell. She has now become a twisted cartoon character from hell. And if that is not bad enough, a miserable whinny, self-centered cartoon character from hell.Anita Blake, who is not only the best necromancer in the world (she not only raises full cemetaries of zombies with the wave of her hand, but can raise sleeping hundred year old vampires with another wave of her hand). Take that and add the fact that she is part of a very powerful triumverate which gives her more power than most of the other powerful creatures who are working alone. On top of this, she is becoming a master vampire with her very own little vampire follower. Now throw into this mix, the fact that she is the queen of the wereleopards, and has her very own wereleopard pard that follows her around with devotion (even though she can't change into a complete wereleopard. I'm still not done! She is also the assigned enforcer for the werewolves. Now you have the new and improved Anita Blake on steroids. (Is she going to grow a penis soon I wonder or is it already there and coming about in a future novel?)Take this overblown cartoon character and now throw in all her followers which include: (1) a pack of wereleopards who spend entire novels on their hands and knees just to rub against her and acknowledge her for being a mini cartoon god. (2) the enforcer for the werewolves (because even though the werewolves are a powerful race in their own right, there is not one other werewolf in the entire world who has the power to fill this job which of course makes the werewolves fear her. (3) Throw in her necromancer/zombie raising skills which make vampires tremble at her feet (I mean she can raise you from your coffin with the wave of her tiny little hand) and finally (4) don't forget she is also Ms. 5'3\\" commando unit with her own set of guns with silver bullets that she can spray and kill you with if you look at her wrong. Who could handle this much power? Only Ms. Anita Blake, sterioid super hero extraordinaire!Now that the main chracter is set, you get to watch her interact with all the other characters in this book. Please note all characters are one-dimensional so therefore not worth naming, and there are only three types of chracters in the novels anyway: (1) Powerful Men that Anita is having sex with (this of course includes orgies but not anal sex because she is a lady); (2) Male characters who want to sleep with Anita; and (3) a couple of male characters who do not have the privilege of sleeping with Anita at the moment. Of course, these two chracters have the most problems.Now describing these one-dimensional characters in more depth. First there are the most powerful men in the book (master vampires hundreds of years old) who follow Anita like puppets on a string, waiting for her every command because they can't make her angry or she won't have sex with them.Then you have the characters who Anita sleeps with as one night stands who follow her around and worship her hoping they get to have sex with her more than once. Of course, there are the other male characters who want to have sex with Anita, but because she's having sex with everyone else in the book, have to worship her without the sex. Still like dutiful one dimensional characters, they follow her around like puppets and give in to her every whim. Then there are the last set of characters who are not having sex with her at the moment and do not worship her. And, in this entire Anita Blake world of course it only amounts to two people. Now because they do not worship her and are not having sex with her, of course they have to be either a suicidal depressed werewolf who wants to die because he can't have sex with Anita, and a racist psychotic cop.So for over 400 pages you get to watch Anita have sex, have group sex, walk around naked, and then have more sex. You also get to listen to her whine about her life and her moral values and then you get to watch her have more sex. While all of the powerful vampires and weres follow her around and listen to her whine. Still, don't piss Anita off, or she'll pull out a gun and shoot you with a silver bullet. Vampire writing at its best!Now I know this is a long shot, but do you think somewhere in this world of Anitas there is a manufacturer out there that maybe has a second gun with silver bullets that someone in the novel can buy and go on a hunting spree and kill every chracter in this series and then shoot his or herself in the head so this depressing sickening waste of paper and space series can end!!!! Good bye Anita I will miss the woman I met in Guilty Pleasures, but there are too many good authors out there for me to waste additional money and free time on you.

Theme: \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"Here we have Anita Blake, an interesting and sympathetic character. With each book she gets more power. Each villain she goes up again, she defeats. The eventual result is a complete degradation of her character. The Anita of Cerulean Sins is indistinguishable from the characters from the earlier books whom she so reviled.Had only this character assassination been intentional...but it seem as if the only thing the author is interested in writing is repetitive sex scenes...I used to love the series.

JC becomes a Master Master vampire and Asher learns some new tricks. The Mother of All Darkness is introduced and Belle Morte is sort of in town. Sounds cool, huh? Well it would have been if she spent some time developing these plot lines rather than having Anita screw anything with a heartbeat.

It addressed plotlines that were alluded to in previous books. (I've read them all, in order, and at this point in the series, I think that helps.) There's a steady, overall story arc going on, and every character in LKH's large and complex cast was skillfully drawn down the line of their own particular development to my satisfaction. In fact, I've gone back to some of the earlier books and have been browsing them for fun, just to see how far the main characters have come -- it makes you curious about where they're going next. My fascination with this series just doesn't end. Hamilton is one writer who'll play you along like foreplay and doesn't neglect to deliver. Get it. Get them all, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a big Anita fan but this one felt like Laurell K. Hamilton wrote down absoultely everything she was thinking and then they published the book without editing it. I liked it better than Narcissus in chains but it's still not on par with the earlier novels.This one made me realize why I liked Obsidian Butterfly so much. In that novel Hamilton got to write a story with some new characters without having to parade out every single person Anita has ever met. Is it really necessary to bring up every living preternatural in the St. Louis area? It felt at times that the personal lives of every wereleopard were more important than serial murders, assassins and the first vampire.The sex bored me. I like sex, I think it's ok to have sex in the novels but it should really be interesting. And why are the gentlemen not taking on a very active roel in the foreplay? I'm not a fan of the ardeur. I thought it was interesting to give Anita's powers some complications but making her stop every 20 pages to have sex just so she can let off some psychic energy was too much for me.It's been said before but is there any doubt in anyone's mind whether or not Hamilton likes long haired guys? Why is every guy Anita meets described as being very close to but not quite feminine with amazing eyes and long flowing hair?All of the conversations felt like they could have been edited for brevity's sake. There seemed to be pages and pages of unending dialouge any time Anita made any decision.I felt that the villains were underused. Musette was billed as being Belle Morte's right hand vampire and she doesn't do much but act as a psychic surrogate for Belle Morte."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The 11th book in the Anita Blake-Vampire Hunter series continues in the footsteps of the last book, Narcissus In Chains. If you hated that book, I doubt this will be a marked improvement for you, though I thought it was very slightly better. I don't think either book holds a candle to her earlier efforts that were far more rich in action and character development.It seems to me that Ms Hamilton has decided that Anita's sexual travails will be the centerpiece of the books. I find Anita's ever increasing stable of submissive hunks becoming tedious. Some of these male characters started out wonderfully. The enigmatic, manipulative vampire, Jean-Claude. The good guy, honest but angsty werewolf, Richard. They took time to develop and I love how they stood toe to toe with Anita, and how she struggled to deal with her love for both of them while being the the fiercest executioner in town. Now, Jean-Claude is completely subservient to Anita, submissive in nearly everyway, and Richard is a manic-depressive basket case. And Anita's merry-go-round of love interests now includes the underwritten \\"yes\\" man Micah, the pouty Asher, the child-man Nathanial, the vampire servent Damian, and the wisecracking werewolf Jason. Her relationship with all these men is intimate on some level, and its just too much. All her connections seem so shallow because there are so darned many of them. I miss the original triumverate. Now, I find it hard to believe that Anita truly loves anyone.The crime part of the story is much better then in the last book, where it didn't exist at all. I was sorry to see Dolph trashed, that anyone that disagress with Anita tends to go down in flames, or disappear from the books altogether, in short order. I did think Anita was a bit obnoxious with throwing her federal marshall title around too much, and was incredibly reckless in her pursuit of a bad guy."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita Blake is back on the job, but not back to her old tricks. Long time fans of the AB:Vampire Hunter Series will not find the Executioner in these pages. They will find a new, and perhaps, not improved, Anita Blake, one who engages in a great deal of self-examination and cares more about flashing her \\"undies\\" than flashing her Browning.An incredibly long book, CS spans 62 chapters. It's as if a short Anita Blake novel was written, and a second novel was then quickly typed out and stuffed into the middle of the original book. Events become confusing as Anita fights Belle Morte, the Council member, and head of Jean-Claude's line. The mystery and crime briefly mentioned at the beginning of the book takes a back seat to Anita's inner angst and a new \\"awakening\\" of her personal relationships.Cerulean Sins reads more like a fantasy/romantic adventure than a noir detective novel with a preternatural twist. Numerous, and glaring mistakes and rule changes, compared to the previous novels, leaves the familiar reader scratching their heads. Characters we've come to know and love seem to have sprouted new personalities between Narcissus In Chains and the new offering. Many beloved characters are almost unrecognizable, including Anita Blake, Executioner.Cerulean Sins is not in the style we've become accustomed to from Ms. Hamilton. If fantasy romance is your style, and you are already familiar with the Anitaverse, you may find Cerulean Sins an interesting read, if you can ignore the glaring and numerous YABBIS (Yet Another Anita Blake Inconsistency). New readers looking for a kick detective novel with a preternatual bent will only be perplexed and quickly bored by the disjointed, dual plots and bloated cast.~Not Reccomended~"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I enjoyed the earlier books in the Anita Blake series - a strong female protagonist, biting sarcasm, an interesting cast of supporting characters. However, Cerulean Sins is essentially a series of mediocre porn shorts connected by a thin plot. The supporting characters have been largely reduced to one-dimensional hangers-on. There's a ridiculous overuse of certain imagery (metaphysical beasts roaring through psyches like freight trains, for example). I started to really dislike Anita in this book. That the other characters remain so enamored of her is totally unrealistic. It's time to put Anita to rest; LKH's talent would be better used inventing a new hero."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Just finished this book. Definitly not what you would expect comparing to the first books in the series. Anita's character has moved along in a good way. She does alot of things that you would not expect from Anita Blake, but is backed up by the character she has always been. I do think this book and the last one (Narcissic in Chains)has moved her to be TOO comfortble with too many people, but at the same time im definitly not complaining. Asher has recently m oved onto my 'character i like' list, and i was very happy to see him in this book.I would definitly suggest reading, but start at the begining of the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been an avid reader for over 40 years and the paranormal, alternate universe stories have always captured my interest. Laurell K Hamilton has created the most amazing, complex and original culture for vampires, werewolves and other preternatural creatures that I have ever read and, in my opinion, she is the person most responsible for creating the urban paranormal genre as we know it today. This is my favorite book in the Anita Blake series which is saying a lot, but it's the culmination of a building love story from the first ten books and you will lose the best part of the story if you don't read those first. Many Laurell K. Hamilton fans did not like this book because the early series was not sexually explicit and starting with Narcissus in Chains, the book before this one, the series took a very sexually charged direction. But for me, Cerulean Sins was not about the sex, but about the relationships between Anita, Jean-Claude and his former lover, Asher and about trying to save the ones you love. Jean-Claude is the sexiest, smartest, most manipulative, vulnerable, iron willed vampire in literature. Anita is a complicated, cynical. strong alpha female with abandonment issues. Jean Claude woos her over ten books using romance, guile, honesty and whatever other tool he can find. These books are witty with some great one liners and contain complex, well developed characters who grow over time. They are a mix of mystery, romance, and horror and the paranormal which at the time they were first published, was an unheard of combination. If you like urban paranormal, you will love these books."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Have not been mailed the book, have writen once to sender and have heard nothing. As of now very unhappy."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have read Cerulean Sins, along with the other ten books in the Anita Blake series, and so far I think Cerulean sins was the worse. In the beginning of the series, Anita was such a strong character, had strong morals, and she had to fight for things. Once I hit the tenth book, Narcissus in Chains, I thought her character went downhill. I thought there was too much sex and not enough plot. But then I read Cerulean Sins. In Cerulean Sins Anita's morals seemed to deteriate all together. She didn't seem like she had to work for anything anymore. Anita has so many ties with the vampirs and the wereanimals that she never really has to actually put up a struggle.There were only two main plots to the book, the vampire council that comes to town, and the man that Anita has to catch. Most the book was filled with sex scenes, the vampire council doesn't seem like much of a plot to me, because it's the same sexual vampire bull that always goes on. So that part just blended in with all the useless sex that I had read earlier in the novel. Then, the thing that I was actually interested in, her catching the man. Which, honestly, I don't remember why she had to catch him. But that part of the book was at the end, and only took about 50 pages. It wasn't even if those last pages were exciting. Anita just seems to powerful now that it's not very fun to read."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I read this book, and was disappointed at the end, when I realized that all that was in less than 24 hours. It was entertaining and all, but I felt kind of cheated at the end, like the book wasn't finished, but the words stopped."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as the previous 10. Anita, is still growing and becoming more rounded. There is always something new and exciting happening in her life. I just keep wondering what's next for her and her friends. I can't wait until book 12 comes out."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I woudl not call my slef a book critque but I am very impressed with this series. The main character Anita has a very interesting time dealing with the twists and turns her life takes both personal and professional. This lates enstallment you think that the wold is going to come crashing down on her casue there are 3 problems at leat happening at once. I cannot recomend the books enough. Have a good read."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In most series, the title character remains fairly static--they are agents of change, but do not change themselves. The remarkable think about Hamilton's Anita Blake is the way that she has changed dramatically over the course of the series. In each book in the series, Anita seems to find herself compelled or seduced to \\"cross the line,\\" whether ethical, or (in this book) sexual. And each step brings her closer to the monsters she once feared, hated, and hunted. This far into the series, she has become so close to the \\"monsters\\" that she is beginning to have serious difficulty relating to normal human beings (and vice-versa). I have no idea where Hamilton is going with this, but it adds an edge to the series that makes it very different from any other that I've read.In this book, Hamilton lays in some foreshadowing about her own \\"Queen of the Damned.\\" There's even a child vampire. Yet there is not much of an echo of Rice. Hamilton's vampires are very different from Rice's--and in many ways, more disturbing.There are a few loose ends in the plotting. A subplot regarding a serial killer is tied up a bit awkwardly at the end--it seems to exist mainly to display the tension between Anita and her human friends on the police force, but it doesn't integrate that well into the plot.This book continues the explicit sex of the last few. This is clearly fundamental to where Hamilton is taking the series, and important to the \\"seduction of Anita\\" but some may find it more disturbing than the violence."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I think my first review got eaten...so...I loved the early Anita Blake books. NiC was only fair. This one is a little better, but not a lot. The graphic sex has stepped up a notch...which is fine...at the cost of the story content dropping down a notch or two...which is not! I hope the trend doesn't continue as graphic sex in books is a whole lot easier to find than good thrillers.The plot is a bit uneven, with subplots jumping around. The final resolution of the main \\"mystery\\" seems just thrown in at the last minute and is a bit anti-climactic (no pun intended). The opening story bit is entirely forgotten until the last page or so and then resolved by just dismissing it.On the other hand, an interesting start to a new, major storyline. An end in sight (hopefully) to the subplot of angst-torn Richard. Jean Claude-As-Major-Vampire-Power storyline progressed quite nicely. The Asher story doing well enough. Zerbrowski a [heck] of a lot more fun than Dolph.I'm hopeful that things will get better and I'll keep buying for the moment...but I hope we're not going to bury [awesome] Anita under novels that would be better published by Black Lace."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I think Laurell K Hamilton has done it again... Cerulean Sins, is a fantastic read and was very hard to put down. If you've loved any book in the Anita Blake series you are sure to enjoy this one. The only reason why I gave this book a 4 instead of a 5, was Hamilton came to an ending too fast, it was like she was writing and all of a sudden she realized she was coming to a page limit and had to end it soon. The vampire politics was very nicely played out, but the additional side of police and murders seems to be more of an addition to the story because it is expected not needed... I fully recommend this book to every Luarell K Hamilton fan."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I still enjoyed ths book, it was a fun read, but come on. The focus of this one is hard to find. I think Hamilton needs to review her concept. Where is this all going? Characters slide in and out for no apparent reason than to confuse the already nearly invisible plot line. I will continue to read Anita Blake because I really enjoy the world Hamilton has created but please try to define some plot points in the next one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am an avid fan of Laurell K. Hamillton, and when I read the reviews on Amazon, I was expecting to be disapointed in the novel. But, WOW, I loved everything about the book including the steamy sex scences. I felt all of this had to do with the developement of Anita in the Vampire world. Richard is a bit disapointing, but did readers expect him to change overnight? I loved the ending, because Hamilton has left us with the next story line. Anita is still sexy and kick ... and I loved the book. I also loved the inclusion of Asher in more depth to the story. Way to go Ms. Hamiltion, I think the book is great and eagerly await the next one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've waited for this book to come out for two years and wasn't let down. It made me squeal, get angry, and of course laugh. If you want to learn a lot more about Jean-Claude and Asher, don't skip this one. You shouldn't skip any. You may find Anita frustrating through some of it but keep your faith in your hero. Cerulean Sins is worth whatever price you pay for it, and the time you spend to read it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First of all, this book will not appeal to everyone. Explicit sex and increasing involvement with the 'monsters' may turn off fans who loved the original kick-ass style of Anita Blake. However, I believe that this book shows a major improvement over the past couple of installments. Anita's directionless and complicated personal life becomes even more complicated but at last has some rules that she can understand. Richard the reluctant werewolf finally seems to be coming to grips with the reality of his own existance. Most important of all, we see that the humans may be just as monstrous as the 'monsters', which anyone reading a newspaper probably already knows."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"most of the books in the blake vampire series have offered something new. not this one. i still plan on reading the next book(s) in the series, but very little happened. the excitement peaked in the middle, and the ending was a let down. also, the plot was not extended much at all, leaving me wondering what Ms. Hamilton was trying to accomplish. In that respect it reminds me of Robert Jordan's latest, i read it so i can read the next book, but felt like nothing happened. Wait for paperback or till you can borrow it from someone.the only reason i rated it 2 stars instead of 1 was that it still involved characters i liked, and it was easy reading, just like the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Well after reading the book in one night, as it seems most of us lovers of the Anita Blake series do, I dont really know what to think. I loved the book but was a little disappointed. I found myself sighing and saying to myself..oh here is the heated sex again. Now dont get me wrong as I love the heated storylines, but sometimes too much is overwhelming and boring. I just think there was something missing from the last two books that I loved from the first 9 books. This series will still be my absolute favourite, and I am always recommending them to others. So hence, another year to wait for the next one which I will not hesitate to buy.So my verdict is..read the series you wont regret it, but start from book one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If you haven't read any of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novels, this one is not the place to start. There are too many events and characters that would not make sense unless you know their backstory. However, for devoted fans of Anita, you can't skip this one.Some threads finally come together in Anita's personal life, and some get unraveled in her professional one. But Anita is finally beginning to grow up and come to terms with herself as an emotional being. All of the characters show consistent development, something that Ms. Hamilton does with such ease and aplomb. We feel as if these are real friends, growing and learning, rather than imaginary characters in a book. It's good to visit with them again and see how they're doing.Anita Blake doesn't show her muscle much in this book. There were hardly any gunshots at all, and she barely beat a few people up. It was a little disappointing for her to be behaving herself (perhaps just because I'm PMSing), but then that is another sign of Anita's growing maturity. And after the bloodbaths of &quot;Obsidian Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Narcissus In Chains,&quot; perhaps we needed a bit of a break from the gore. Although there is still enough violence that it isn't a complete departure.There are things revealed in &quot;Cerulean Sins&quot; that will be essential to the understanding of any future Anita Blake novels. The only real detraction is the fact that the proofreaders at Berkley Publishing need to pay a little more attention to their job - there are some glaring typos that are like speed bumps in the story. But besides all that, the novel is just a great read. I highly recommend it.Thank you, Ms. Hamilton, for giving us another installment in a very entertaining series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I greatly enjoyed this story!! Ms. Hamilton has done a wonderful job on this book!! I picked this book up after work, got home and read it non-stop and finished in under 5 hours!! I'm sure you'll love it!!!Why I liked this book... Vampire politics is always interesting to say the least, add into the mix a murder mystery, a good dose of unease all around as the full moon is coming (when isn't it?). A load of erotic tensions, a menage a trois and new critters. Well thats just part of what makes this book the latest and greatest of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series!!!Jean-Claude and Anita must find a way to save Asher from Belle Morte, who is out for revenge upon Jean-Claude and Asher. Anita finds out that she does actually love her vampires even though she tries not to. A hitman wants to hire Anita to do a annimation, and Dolph needs a vacation bad before he goes over the line! And Anita learns that she still can be afraid of the dark when the Mother of all Vampires lets Anita know that she really isn't sleeping, just waiting for something \\"interesting\\" to come along, and that she finds Anita fascinating.The world of Anita Blade is a dangerous, exciting and twisted one. It is the very fact that this \\"Anitaverse\\" is lightyears distant from our own, yet right around the corner at the same time, is what makes the Anita Blade series such a wonderful read!This book was definately worth the reading time!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I first started reading Anita Blake because of the mysteries in each book. Now there's just sex."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"It used to be that television tried to be like books.Today, it's more that books are trying to be like television!When I set out to write a story like my vampire novel, Those Of My Blood ...I think in terms of tv series such as Buffy, Angel, Andromeda, MutantX, Smallville, Enterprise.So in P. N. Elrod's \\"The Vampire Files\\" series and here in the \\"Anita Blake\\" series, and in a mundane detective series like Faye Kellerman's \\"Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus\\", you are getting a Babylon5 (or Dallas) style \\"story-arc\\".Some readers find that confusing, distracting or diluting, while others thrive on it. \\"Anita Blake\\" is one of those series that moves at the pace of a soap opera, with about a year's progress in each novel.In the first novel, Guilty Pleasures, 1995, Anita Blake is possessed by her self-image. One cornerstone of the identity she thinks she has is her idea of who she will or will not sleep with.In Cerulean Sins, we struggle with Anita through a collapse of that entire cornerstone of her identity. She was so sure of herself. She was willing to die or to kill rather than do what she's doing in this novel.Why is she doing this? Because over the course of these novels, Anita has acquired aspects of the magical creatures she's been dealing with -- vampires, werewolves and were-cats. She has not become vampire or were-anything. But she has these traits magically rooted into her identity, and that magic is forcing a change in her identity.Now, in Cerulean Sins, she is a victim of a kind of sexual esurience as powerful as the vampire's bloodlust. If she fails to have sex, she will go mad with it and force herself on someone -- possibly on someone she cares for or someone she hates. She will have no conscious choice.The very thing we originally marveled at in her character -- her absolute refusal to be anyone's or anything's victim -- is gone. She is a victim of her own esurience for sex. Worse. This esurience has been forced upon her -- not exactly against her will, but still forced on her.She is helpless against the results of the choices she has made. Karmically, she has come to exactly the place she was headed to in Guilty Pleasures.The sense of \\"confusion\\" and the difficulty in following the plot that some readers have had stems from the way Anita's internal loosing-battle has left her essential character in tattered shreds. Anita is \\"confused\\" so we are confused. Anita can't \\"follow\\" her own life, so we can't follow the plot.Anita was a \\"winner\\" -- she's \\"won\\" every physical battle in all these books. But with each win, she's lost something of \\"herself.\\" And in this book, she's more loser than winner, very much aware that each win is an irretrievable loss. She is on the edge of despair. Considering who she used to be, that is massively confusing.The background of this series is \\"fantastic\\" -- vampires with civil rights, werewolves who teach high school, weretigers, necromancy -- all of it is so \\"unreal\\". Therefore the psychology of the characters must be impeccably \\"real\\" to the reader so that the fantastic will seem plausible.The classic test for whether a novel is science fiction (or fantasy) or not is whether you still have a story when you remove the \\"science\\". The \\"science\\" in the Anita Blake series is psychology. Psychology is the core science behind all magick, as Dion Fortune and Marion Zimmer Bradley describe it.If you remove the psychology from the \\"Anita Blake\\" series, or from P. N. Elrod's \\"The Vampire Files\\" series, you no longer have a story. Therefore, these series are in fact Occult Fantasy -- just like Buffy The Vampire Slayer.If you can't follow the psychology, you won't find any story here that you can get your ahem teeth into.Live Long and Prosper,Jacqueline Lichtenberg..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"OK. I have to admit: I wish Anita was still the gun-slinger from earlier books. However, as with most series, the characters grow and evolve. Is there too much sex? In a way, yes. However, as far as the storyline, it is what WOULD happen. Honestly, this is fiction and you must suspend disbelief. In doing so, this book is a great read, even if you roll your eyes a few times!!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The whole Anita Blake series is simply amazing!!!

The famous desk scene with Jean Claude and Anita this leads up to one of the most important revelations in the whole series ( you will have to read the book). Each character is unique and brings a depth of humanity to the series.

But at the same time I am embrasing the Not-so-celebate-get-the-hell-away-from-me-kick-ass Anita Blake.Yes ok...arduer is annoying. But what you fans gotta realise is that characters need to grow and change. If Anita had stayed exactly the same from book 1 to 12 then the series would fall apart. All good books move and change - you just gotta go with it! I-ching and all that jazz.What I am annoyed at is that all the revies seem to be focusing the on sex (there wasn't even that much of it!). What about the brilliant plot? What about all the exciting new facts and bits of vampire history we learn about?After being a wee bit nervous about reading books 10 and 11, i dove right in and found them to be wonderfully entertaining! The plot in 11 is fasinating and I LOVE the vampire politics! That's what i think I liked best about this book - the vamp politics. To be honest i was getting tired of all the weranimal law and customs (Richard is such a boring cry baby)...but learning more about Belle Morte, Mother Mercy (the Darkness) and vampire customs was frightfully intriguing and some great new characters are introdused.After all, this series is at heart,a vampire series. I honestly can't see how reviewers found all this vampire history boring! CS is fast paced and a real page turner, constantly keeping you on your toes!All in all:I went in thinking the book was going to be bad and came out knowing it was brilliant.

I think it is so funny the reviewers who say this will be the last Anita book I will read, guess who still writes new reviews for the new Anita books? The author has said that she is not going to change the direction of the books so all prudes need not apply! Obviously they are still doing well since they still make the bestsellers list every year. There is a lot in this book: vampire politics and murder. All plot lines get tied up in the order of their importance to the story.

It gets on my nerves that everyone tries to tell Ms. Hamilton where to go with her own imagination. She is the author and you can't tell her what to write. Having got that off my chest, Anita faces the same moral delimas that we face and make compromises and decisions based on love. Anita would never be happy sitting at home knitting a sweater for Richard. She is living life day to day, not knowing if she is going to live or die and making choices based on that mentality."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been an avid fan of the series until Narcissus in Chains. I had hoped that Cerulean Sins would prove the last book just a fluke. Sadly, it seems someone has convinced Ms. Hamilton that she must change from writing fast paced, character driven action novels to becoming the latest Ann Rice clone.Changing Anita from a character of relatively stable morality to simply sleeping with whoever is close at hand is also a disappointment, as are the gratuitous insults of conservative Christians."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've read all of the books and half of this one and got to the point where I didn't even want to pick it up and that's rare in my case because I love to read.

I've stopped after only halfway through and have decided to move on to a different author and series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"When it started the Anita Blake series were stand alone adventures written in the pulp detective/film noir type where the baddies were vampires and other monsters in modern St Louis and the hero, was Antia Blake, a tough, self assured, legal vampire executioner who would have been right at home in the company of other litterary detectives like Nick Charles and Sam Spade. Unfortuntely in later books Antia became a self doubting, whiny, self indulgent twit, more concerned with her personal life than the 'crime.' This made the reading pretty poor. But as a CD with a lot of tracks, it is easy to skip over the poor parts to the good. Most books on tape have maybe 16 tracks on a disc. This book has maybe 70!In this book there is some of this but the crime she investigates, a cold professional hit, somehow linked to a depraved were-serial killer who reduces his victims to offal. Add to that some one following Antia by day light and the visit from a high level vamp from europe and her retinue and there are lots of balls in the air.This book was better than Narsis in Chains before it or Incubus Dreams and Danse Macbre after it, but the indulgent sex scenes are still a bit of a bother. The CD lets you jump these and stay on track in a way you wish the author did on the written page. For what it's worth, the final conflict between Anita and the serial killer, is Anita Blake at her best, and some of my favoirte chapters in the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita's come a long way since we met her in Guilty Pleasures. Her moral high ground is not so very high anymore - some might argue she's even standing in a small hole she dug all by herself... Anita will do anything she had to do to help her friends, even if it means sacificing some of her own morals. But the way she's going, soon she won't have many morals left. Like she says herself: she's becomming a good little sociopath... But if you read them in the right order you understand why she's becomming what en who she is. It all seems so very logical at the time she makes her decisions. And she knows she's being really unfair to the men in her life. And yet they keep hanging on...Although the books changed a lot since the first one, I still love them, always looking forward to the new one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I can't really pan this book, because the first chapter grabbed my attention, and because (unlike the last few books I read) I didn't need to force my self to read it. However, throughout the book, I kept thinking \\"Been there, done that\\" or \\"Wow, is she really going to go THAT far? The basic plot involves a visit by a representative of the vampire counsel, which threaten's Jean-Claud's position, and tries to mark Anita. It also involves a sociopathic assasin...A vampire dignitary who wants to dine on Anita and the weres...and...sound familar? It all does. Just once, I'd like to see a visit from a member of the vampire counsel not end up a bloodbath. At one point, Anita says \\"let me kill her now....it will be simpler in the end, you know it...\\". Actually, I agree.Also, Anita's sex life finally crosses the line into total absurdity as two new lovers are brought in, raising the total to 4. The whole book is about sex, yet contains nothing that interst me in the slightest...a difficult feat.Also, there are several plot elements that are just dropped for most of the book, and never tie in to the central plot. I get the impression Hamilton is no longer trying...Despite all this, the book was kind of fun."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I agree with the other readers who felt that this book seemed rushed. It starts out with propulsion and then when we should be gearing up for the climax...it sort of just fizzles and sputters through some simple wrap ups that are just too well, simple.In her previous books, Anita has a definite mystery to solve, as well as moral dilemas to muddle through and sexual appetites to satisfy, hers and others. But she is always strong for those she cares for and is always able to move in that space of emptiness to get the job done. In this book, she has sort of a mystery, major sexual appetites, and almost non-stop moral dilemas which come out in lots and lots of crying and hair-pulling worrying about jeapordizing other people's safety. I personally enjoyed the extra character development of her feelings, but wished she would stop crying and go karate kick someone because she was making me depressed. The \\"mystery\\" isn't a primary point, her feelings are, and so it gets \\"solved\\" in a rather perfunctory \\"I have a deadline\\" kind of way. The plot can't really be described more than: Musette shows up early and bad things happen, and oh, some women are being raped and brutally slaughtered, and oh, Dolph is in a very bad mood. Beyond that, I would ruin it for you. But I will say I like Richard less and less and this book is no exception.This book just has a sort of unfinished feel, but I give it four stars because it brings in interesting new characters and situations and opens doors, the better for everybodys favorite Executioner to shoot through. I recommend this for the serious Anita Blake fan, but suggest newbies start with Guilty Pleasures. Make no mistake, this has not dettered me from this series at all and I eagerly await Number 12 (which I hear is slated for release October this year)."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Ok, I really liked this book. It could tone it down a little (or a lot) on the sex, because it's beginning to get to the point where plot is just an interlude between sex acts with random people. Also, who edited this book? Does anyone realize that halfway through the book, Hamilton changed the spelling of Jason's last name? Also, she needs to work on her comma usage and occasional sentence structure. It was yet another distraction from the plot. I don't remember the other books being like this. I love the series, but this book needs some work."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I simply adored Obsidian Butterfly and Narcissus in Chains had me jumping. The struggle between Anita's inner morality and the world she's joined gets more difficult to follow in CS though.She goes from \\"no touchie the monsters\\" to being one of them. Glad Richards out of the romantic picture, but there are way to many guys in and out of Anita's bed. A few more main female characters might go a long way in helping here- really, Jean-Claude, Nathanial, Micah, Asher, Jason and occasionally Richard- for a \\"Good Christian Girl\\" she sure gets around the block.Did love Mussett though and can't wait to see if Belle really does try to kill the \\"Gentle Mother\\" or \\"Mommy Dearest\\" as Anita calls the ancient one.Missed the Dr. Seuss analogies this time though the Charlot's Web ones were nice. I've reread again to pick up anything I missed- still think she needs to give the relationship stuff a break and get back to hunting the bad guys- loved that about the prior books! Will be buying the next in this great series!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Hamilton's latest novel has everything her past novels posses...and more. Her eleventh installment of the Anita Blake series progresses the series' into something much bigger than St. Louis' city boundaries. Though we have witnessed the Vampire Council before and their macabre politics, this is the first time we have seen firsthand Jean-Claude and Asher's, our favorite vampires, \\"sourdre de sang\\", the fountainhead of their bloodline, Belle Morte, but most importantly we are also introduced to the Mother of Darkness (Mommy Dearest). There is also the detective/police case Anita is invovled with, but this time Anita is a Federal Marshall, though it felt like it wasn't as prominent, but what was prominent was Dolph's out-of-character scenes. I was definitely surprised. But it just shows you how much the characters are growing and becoming more \\"real\\" for the readers, more intimate.Also, unlike NIC, where it was understandable that the \\"ardeur\\" was the main plot, but where there was A LOT of vividly sexual scenes, where there could be a page or more of gratuitous sex in CS, there are passionate scenes that prove to strengthen the book and the characters' personalities.Last thought: One of the best Blake novels I've read."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Being a huge fan of LKH and the Anita Blake books, Cerulean Sins was a must read for me and I wasn't disappointed...much. While CS follows the seemingly departure of NIC, all in all Hamilton's characters remain true to form. Anita is still Anita with all of her flaws and all that makes her fantastic. Some of the supporting characters step up and are fleshed out a bit more and we learn more about Asher and Jean-Claude.Richard continues to annoy me to no end until the end when I become intrigued because he finally seems to get it. And Jason, well that's one wolf that seems to be coming into his own.Overall, another hit. My only complaint is that the end seemed rushed. It was as if there was so much more to the story that got edited out to fit into a required number of pages. Whether this is true or not, only LKH and her publishing house can speak to. But when the last page turned I was again left wanting more. Well done!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have read every book LKH has written and loved them until CS.This had a great start which captured your interest but sadly fell into a mish mash of stories. Gregory and Stephen should develop into their own story and so should Jason who finally has come into his own. I am glad Richard has given me a reason to really dislike him. I was never interested in a man who could not accept both his good and bad sides with out sounding like a big whiner.I also would like to see Asher with his own storyline as he and Jean Claude are both such powerful figures.I have never been able to put down a LKH book until it was finished but with this one I could. Please LKH give us another Guilty Pleasures."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"While these books have become somewhate formulaic, this is still a rollicking good read. There is, of course, a monster reeking havoc in St. Louis that Anita must track down and kill. She must also deal with Vampire politics, moody lovers, and protecting her pard. Oh! and don't forget the Mother of all Darkness touching her psyche, too.Our girl is sleeping with just about anything, but she feels guilty about it (sometimes).As ever, Anita realizes a new power that neither she nor Jean-Claude knew she had. There seem to be more humans in this book, and some very interesting human reactions to situations.Not for everyone, but far better than the previous installment."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Like the 10th book in the series - Narcissus in Chains - the focus of Cerulean Sins is very much on Anita Blakes emotional conflicts with her lovelife. It is almost as if the action has taken a backseat in preference of detailed and lengthy description of Anitas erotic encounters. The book is not badly written, but I soon found myself skipping large parts of the book to get on with the plot. And talking about \\"plot\\", there isnt much, if you look past the emotinal and erotic stuff. It is allmost as if that IS the plot. Before long I was thinking: \\"If I see the word \\"ardeur\\" ONE more time, I'm going to scream!\\" If you have read the book, you will know what I mean... :-)I have been told that mrs. Hamilton has twice as many female readers compared to males, so maybe she is simply adjusting her style to fit her main audience. In the later books Anita Blake seems to have changed her personality from the Marlowe-Gumshoe kinda toughie to a whiny gothic drama queen. Character development is a good thing, but to me \\"the new\\" Anita Blake is far less entertaining than the old one. Despite this, I find mrs. Hamilton to be an excellent writer and I will continue to follow the Anita Blake series to see where it goes in the future. If for nothing else, then because I've been a fan from the beginning.But so far I consider the first nine books to be vastly superior to the last two. Therefore I would recommend that new readers start with book nr.1 - Guilty Pleasures - and work their way up. Book 1 to 9 are brilliant, book 10 is a bit slow, but sums everything up nicely. Cerulean Sins is the worst of the bunch so far, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Complications that have been added will definitely thicken the plot, esp. in Anita's lovelife. I can't help but being dissappointed as to how far down Hamilton has taken Richard's character. It's just sad, but meanwhile, Anita is experiencing a frantic loss of control in her life. There is endless drama, and problems everywhere, very stressful on the main character. Dolph takes his anger about problems going on in his peronal life out on Anita, and Asher offers her an ultimatum. She has to include him in a meange trois with JC, or risk losing him, and having JC be dissappointed in her. But Anita is not entirely copmfortable with all this sex she's having. Also, she gets emotionally closer to Jason who offers her some surprisingly wise words of advice. Overall, it was a good book, but I'm hoping Hamilton takes it in the direction I want with Richard in the next book. It wasn't exactly the best book in the series, and sadly, she made their relationship( Rich and Anita) deteriorate completely."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I admit that I prefer the Merry Gentry series, but have always read the Anita Blake books with interest. That is until these last two.... In the Merry Gentry series, at least she is trying to get preggers to win a throne, and some of the interuptions are amusing and there is a storyline to a certain extent, but in the Blake series everything has to... want her, desire to be with her. ...There was no plot, .... This is too bad, since in the first books, Anita has interesting problems, and situations to deal with. .... Why does she have to be the focal point of all lust, desire and power? Shouldn't others get a chance? Perhaps Anita offering leadership lessons to take off some of the burden of all those weres who are her responsibility. My question is however, is our author so frustrated that she has to create an all powerful being to compensate for her own lackluster life?... And it is getting rather boring that she is invincible - and that everyone who comes under her aegis becomes invincible also. There is no mystery left,..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Guilty Pleasures, the first Anita Blake novel, was an apt title for me because I enjoyed the book and its successors as a fun read. Though sick to death of the romanticized vampire I enjoyed the alternate reality world, the mixture of crime, and supernatural. What I enjoyed most was the strong female character of Anita. Her initial dislike of vampires and the creatures of her world, made for great conflict as she got to know these \\"creatures\\" as people, and the hints of her childhood troubles with her mothers death, her step mother and half siblings gave a depth to the character as did her slow moral ompromises made in the interest of survival. Cerulean Sins, like Narcissus in chains, suffers from Anita becoming less a character and more a reputation. Conflict in the book consists of a vague psychic kind of mind battle that becomes dull and repetitive and can only be fought with a ghost-in-the-machine solution usually involving sex, sex and more sex. Instead of a story we have characters had feeding us the events through dialogue, its not enough to have every character comment on how tough and uncompromising Anita is every two pages, show us. The many supporting characters each require their share of back fill slowing the novel and the characters them selves have become redundant. I know there are at lest two or three long hair submissive, damaged, sex toy types, a few sadomasochists, a couple \\"beautiful\\" androgynous male vamps and werewolves that have that woodsy feel. They all have one thing in common every guy wants Anita, they all run around her mind, and the girl who once would save her self for marriage is now a rampant nymho. We know that many vampires all are eye-catching, posers because we are reminded every few pages. The only compelling slice of the book for me was the disintegrating relation ship between Anita and Dolf of the crime unit. Her embrace of the \\"monsters\\" is alienating her coworkers and friends. This is interesting stuff. The rest felt like i was reading some soft core porn novel.I miss the detective angle, the once expanding world creation that made it so much fun. For example: the rescue of comatose Vampires from the burning house in an early novel gave us a fun moral twist. Fire fighters questioning the rescue of creatures they fear and hate. The politics of this New World were vampires have rights, discrimination takes on new allegories. Lacarthrophy as an AIDs metaphor; as when Richard feared losing his job as a schoolteacher if he was \\"outed\\". But poor Anita spends half the book as a sex maniac and plot points such as a new case and murder are all but forgotten for the next two hundred pages. Laurel K. Hamilton has given me much enjoyment, her books are fun, scary, and action packed. Her last two offerings in this series seem to be forgetting what made these books fun. I owe her some loyalty but next time I am waiting for the paperback."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"i liked the story, but it didn't make me go wild. i don't know what it was missing. when i figure it out, i'll edit my review. i just hope that we don't have to wait more than a year and a half for the next anita book. i want the next one already. with more jean-claude goodness."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In this book Anita's powers are not as obvious. The emphasis is more on the arduer(spelling?) All that really happens is finally two of the more interesting characters(I won't say who!) finally get some action. I don't have a problem with all the sex scenes, there were only like 2 or 3 but I do have a problem with her moral hand wringing afterwards.She did what she did and can't undo it, so let's move on. Her psuedoboss, Dolph's, attitude was one of the scariest moments of the book because it was so realistic. At a certain point though, if I had Anita's powers, I would have cleaned his clock big time.Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't blood, guts, and gore and sex so, if you don't...then don't.

When I finished the book I was craving more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After reading the previous book Narcissus in Chains, I knew I was starting to dislike this character, for most of the reasons mentioned in the prior reviews. This book started fine, but then before you know it, Anita's off to Jean Claude's place once again (doesn't she ever sleep at home anymore by herself?) for more contrived and convoluted sex and S&M; situations. Of course, none of this is \\"her\\" fault because she's been stricken with some metaphysical spanish fly thingy called the Ardeur, which makes her want to nail every guy she meets. Constantly. All at once.When I got to the part of this book a few chapters in where she decides to do a threesome with bisexual vampires Jean Claude and Asher for no good reason except the lame excuse to keep Asher away from Musette, I closed the book in disgust. And it wasn't even the Ardeur's fault this time.I hate the pards, every one of them. They should get some therapy and stop being so frickin helpless.I've decided that Anita Blake is really dead. A few books back, right about the time she channeled the munin in Blue Moon I think, the ghost of Raina--former werewolf lupa and sadomasochist, killed Anita and took over her body. I miss the old Anita Blake -- the one who would run out of her apartment with not enough sleep after being called to a crime scene by Dolph, locked and loaded for some new unknown beastie, not caring that much about what she was wearing or the color of her underwear, as long as she had that one perfect cup of coffee. Anita went from sleeping with no one to sleeping with everyone--why does it have to be all or nothing? I miss the woman that had self respect and self restraint, that tough girl who knew how to take care of herself and slept with a stuffed penguin instead of strangers. I miss the Anita that used to say things to Jean Claude like \\"enough of this leather and lace sh_t\\" and \\"stop calling me ma petite.\\" RIP Anita Blake, I mourn you.Update: I just got back from the bookstore to buy a couple of books by Kim Harrison and JR Ward since I'm looking for some new series to get into. I had planned on spending the holidays finishing the Anita Blake books, but after reading this book, not gonna happen. I was talking to the girl behind the counter, who helped me locate one of the authors I wanted, and she is also into these types of fantasy books. I told her I had been reading the Anita Blake series but decided to quit after Cerulean Sins.

Enough is enough."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins is a decent Anita Blake book; and that is quite disappointing, since I got used to them being great. The things I like most in the series are the combination of hardboiled detective and magic/vampire/werewolf, with a little sex tossed in and bloody s/m to make you dislike the bad guys and feel sorry for the victims. Unfortunately, Anita's sex life and problems are taking up huge numbers of pages in the more recent books, except for Obsidian Butterfly. I understand that Anita is growing in directions that she (Anita) didn't expect and that is a major series plot point which needs to be dealt with, but I do wish that it took about 1/3 the page count it did in Narccisus In Chains and Cerulean Sins, so that there could have been more time spent on the other major plot points for those particular books.If I wanted to read vampire/werewolf erotica or romances, there are numerous other authors and series out there, including LKH's other series about Princess Merry. I've generally read one or two of the books in a series and quit because they aren't what I want to read. I don't want a vampire/werewolf erotic romance, I don't want blood/terror/s/m with my romance. Nor do I want a book with a supposedly tough, smart protaganist who is always having to be rescued.I want a book with a tough, smart main character who will pull the trigger when required, solves crimes/problems, and rescues others. The fact that the character is female and magic/vampires/weres are included are major pluses. The fact that she sometimes needs help herself means she's human, not a cartoon charcter. I'm hoping that the Anita Blake series will return to that."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Of all the Anita Blake books, I found this one to be the most disappointing. I have read the entire series, and I feel that the series started to fall apart aound the same time she slept with Richard in Blue Moon. The endings seem rushed, and there are too many sub-plots to ever really wrap the books up nicely.That said- it bothers me that now it is alright for her to just jump anything in sight. Part of what was so fun about the earlier books was it was just Anita, there wasn't a penis on hand at all times. I think the ardeur was really only an excuse to add an extraneous sex scene here and there.The book could have been good, as with the last couple books (not including obsidian butterfly- best one since bloody bones) the general idea of the plot was good, but execution was faulty.I am disappointed that I spent the money on this book that I did."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"When I saw the low star rating this book got on Amazon, I wasn't expecting it to be good when I got to read it. Maybe that made me enjoy it more that I was expecting it to be bad, but I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a lot better than the last one, Narcissus in Chains, especially since Richard's appearances were kept to a minimum.This book starts off with Anita raising a zombie, with Asher appearing at the end of the ritual to bring her bad news. The representative of Belle Morte, Musette, has arrived several months earlier, and both Asher and Jean-Claude are afraid of her. To make things even more complicated, Anita is having trouble with the ardeur, because even Micah, Nathaniel, and Jean-Claude can't handle her feeding twice a day. She ends up adding Jason and Asher to her list, which we all know makes Jason happy :). Of course, an Anita Blake book wouldn't be complete without a few other problems, so Anita finds herself being followed by assassins. Richard decides that he wants all of the werewolves removed from Jean-Claude's control, and a rogue shapeshifter is running around St. Louis brutally slaughtering women. Dolph's life is more complicated than ever, and he completely loses it in one scene, which results in us seeing more of Zerbrowski than Dolph. Anita also has several encounters with Belle Morte, and even one with the Mother of All Darkness, the first vampire ever, who is beginning to wake from a long sleep. I basically thought this book was great, a lot better than Narcissus in Chains. It's basically about the vampires, though, and appearances by the wereleopards and werewolves (except Jason and Nathaniel) are kept to a minimum. The main guys in this book are Asher, Jean-Claude, and Jason, so we don't see as much of Micah and Richard. Overall, though, you should definitely read this book, it's a true Anita Blake story!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins by Laurell K. Hamilton is the last Anita Blake I will read. Very few times have I not finished a book, but all I could do with this is skim the last half. I couldn't get past all of the gratuitous sex, the \\"I am so...,\\" and the whining. They have steadily become less action and more sex and sex and well, sex. The sex passages are simply absurd. Anita Blake's language is that of a 13 year old rather than a college educated professional. It is as if LKH is trying to make the books more \\"hip\\" but it just comes off as silly. Her internal whining is tedious. It appears that the only way to save her male friends is to have sex with them, which she appears to do with frightening predictibility. There are no females in the book other than psychopathic vampires or angsty female cops. Why can't there be a werewolf or vampire, or for that matter a human, that isn't a stereotypical female? The attempt to make the books more literary by quoting poetry is wasted. This is a disappointment as I enjoyed the first few books in the series, they certainly weren't great literature, but they were very entertaining."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Honestly I thought there was too much sex in this book. I'm used to a solid plot line from Anita, and then everything else added into the book well. This had a very weak plot involving the police investigation. I was highly dissapointed on how that turned out, it was not the whole big climax scenes I'm used to. Do you remember when Anita was all chaste? With JC it was cute. With Richard it was expected. But everyone else? Anita went from pure little innocence (well, almost, pretty close) to being like the town whore. I loved the idea of the arduer but this is a little much. When the whole plotline revolves around who's in who's bed it grows old fast. I did, however, love Jason and Asher's involvment in the story. I do think it went a little far, but the \\"Adviceish\\" scene with Anita and Jason was very well written and I loved it. I think there could have been interaction with Stephen and Gregory's father, or that could have been focused on a bit more or something. It barely took up three pages of talk and never really finished. I think the two new baby vampires will be good additions to the cast of Anita Blake and I will continue reading to see where everything will go. But, overall, I expected a lot more from this book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been a great fan of Anita Blake up until Narcissus in Chains.

I enjoy a little nymphomania. As usual I could hardly put the book down. It was a fun read, with fun boys and lots of sex. But I have to concede the point, there was hardly any plot.Scene one... Anita meets with suspicious guy who wants her to raise some dead guy. Very mysterious. Plot thickens. And then... a zillion pages of sex scenes and vampire politics. End of book... first guy shows up, admits something hinky was going on, but no need for Anita to raise the dead guy after all. End of story.So rather than a story, this was simply a couple days in the life of Anita Blake. Sort of like what Hamilton did with the second book of the Merry Gentry series.

This book also had one of the better villians, and I'm not talking about Musette. In Sins, as well as Narcissus, Hamilton over-shared on the sex scenes. I want more story and less ardeur. If the scenes gets much more detailed, the bookstores are going to have to file these books with paranormal romance instead of SF/F. Let's give Anita and the guys some privacy and concentrate on fighting the big bad."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Vampires, werewolves and other preternatural creatures share the same civil rights as human beings, but when one commits a crime, licensed executioner and federal marshal Anita Blake kills them. Her lovers are Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire of St. Louis, and Micah her co-leader of the loyal shape-shifting leopard pard that looks to he or protection.The Regional Preternatural Investigation Team asks Anita to help on the case of a murdered man nailed to the wall in a mockery of the crucifixion with Nordic Runes painted nearby. Anita is positive that this is not a magical murder. When a woman is ripped apart, Anita knows that this is the calling card of a shape-shifter. Meanwhile, the woman, who turned Jean-Claude and his second-in-command Asher into vampires, Belle Morte has the sadistic Musette come to town to learn why her boys are so infatuated with Anita. Anita knows she must do something to stop Belle and Musette from taking vengeance upon her loved ones, but whatever she decides will leave her in peril.Anita Blake is a great character who has dramatically changed from a deadly vampire killer to a person who realizes that some non-humans are more humane than mortals are. In CERULEAN SINS, Anita realizes she is more comfortable amidst the vampires but especially with her pack of shapeshifters than she is among humans. However, the key that makes this novel a standout in a tremendous series is Belle Morte as frightening a villain as one will find since even her own species fears her. Fans of Anita Blake will want to read this tale and see the direction Laurell K. Hamilton is taking her heroine and readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I waited anxiously to receive this, the latest Anita book, set aside a weekend just so I could read it uninterrupted, and yet, curiously, found myself reading only a few chapters a day. I have found it like having something so delicious that you want it to last as long as possible, so you only allow yourself a nibble at a time. This book takes the foundations of this story line and makes it richer, deeper. Anita is finally maturing from the self-absorbed girl to a powerful woman and accepting that, while she maintains great courage and great power, the world simply doesn't always adhere to her rules. She has finally begun to take some real responsibility for her feelings and to appreciate how blessed she is to be surrounded by so much love and devotion. She has also begun to heal the wound Richard has left on her heart and to realize that she is much more suited to a lover who accepts her just as she is. All this, a secondary story line in the form of a murder mystery, and the introduction of a new, very powerful, threat to everything and everyone she loves. Laurrell K. has given us another wonderful tale, and I find myself once more a willing, even eager, captive in Anita's world."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Actually I would give it 4.5 stars if that had been an option. I have read every Anita Blake novel and have enjoyed them all albeit some more than others. I read this one in a day.Some of the back fill does slow the story, but not so its too distracting. Anita is more vulnerable in this volume and its kind of a nice change to have her not entirely sure of herself. She doesn't always have to be right, especially when she knows she's wrong, and that comes across in this book.I love the story-line with Asher. I have loved him since the start though, he's second only to John-Claude. I don't really get Micha but maybe that'll come too.I don't want to give the story away - read it for yourself. As always its more than worth it. Hope we see more of Asher and John Claude --- I didn't miss Richard and his angst at all."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In the 11th installment of the Anita Blake series, Belle Morte, a member of the Vampire Council has sent her second in command, Musette, unexpectedly, to scout out the situation in St. Louis. At the same time, a rogue shapeshifter is slaughtering women in the area. Jean Claude and Anita have to deal with Musette and her entourage, while the third member of the triumvirate, the werewolf Ulffric, Richard is on a self destructive downslide. The only question is, will he destroy himself or them all. To make matters worse, the oldest vampire of them all is waking from a thousand year sleep, and noone knows what that will bring.This is a very intense novel, even more so than the last. The characters become more and more interesting as time goes on. Anita's character is vastly different from the first book, but she has grown in a natural(supernatural) manner with the development of her necromancer powers and just her life experiences in general. There is so much action here that it is difficult to put the novel down and I will definitely read it again very soon. This series keeps getting better and better and the first book was outstanding."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Yeah. I admit it. The sex is a bit much. Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable as all hell..but if you're squeamish or straight laced...this is definatly not the book for you. Having said that, you have to admit it. Cerulean Sins is a really fun read. This was actually the first Anita Blake book I read (I'm working my way through the series backwards) and even as a first time reader I got completely sucked in. What is it about the bad boys...Whatever it is, Anitas boys have got it in spades, and Laurell Hamilton definatly does them justice. In addition, it's a good book. It has a smart, involved plot, good charector development, and atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere. You're either gonna love it or hate it, so unless you're a confirmed Anita Blake fan, borrow it first."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After reading all the negative views I won't rehash the plot. But I will say people fell in love with the prudish Episcopalian Anita Blake who was almost 2 dimensional and flat. And people, remember, always remember how young Anita Blake is.Through the series she's been growing and so to read this one first would be a jumbled shock to the system. Read them in order and you'll see how she grows.Admitedly Dolph's anger and Richard's depression are, well sad and useless to me. I've always hated Richard the gorgeous but wimpy boy scout who can eat your face. I wish he'd just slink off.This one is as good, if not better than NIC, way better than and I mean way than OB. But if you liked the first eight you might find this one disappointing.It's very long and poorly edited but the ideas are gorgeous and it's a good escape. I've been a fan since GP and I'll read to the end.PSto REALLY understand not only character development, but Laurell's development as a writer, read Guilty Pleasures through Obsidian Butterfly. Notice in OB how Laurell AND Anita have gotten sick of the whole scene. Then read the first two Merry gentry novels, then go back to Narcissus in Chains and read on. It flows seamlessly and you'll get Anita Blake a lot more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have been avidly reading the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series since I first discovered Guilty Pleasures around Christmas time 2003/2004. I have literally been reading the books one after the other and It seems like they are going downhill! Anita used to be more of a PERSON, someone that readers could relate to in some ways, and now she is just a negative, overwhelming, bitter person, that is hard to like. I don't like what has happened with Richard in the last two books of the series, and I am not very happy with Micah's character coming into the plot. I couldn't believe there was a two page descriptive of Anita giving Jean Claude Oral sex! I was shocked! Anita needs to stop calling herself a Christian too...She doesn't act like one, behave like one, or inherit any characteristics of being a Christian in any way! She's a hypocrite! She seems to be getting in way too many arguments and conflicts that are totally unnecessary and her personality has really started to suck! I like the old Anita better...this new, cold, hardened Anita has way too many issues and It's utterly mind boggling to keep up with her various personal problems. I am dissapointed in this book and am HOPING that the next book brings us back to a more likable, relatable, familiar Anita. Get rid of the Vampire Humper and bring back the Hunter PLEASE!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Another good story by LKH. I loved Anita and her contuining story about her struggle with humainty in the Anitaverse. It's good to see that LKH is brave to write original sex scenes and brave enough to allow a woman to have a sex life."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita's once again in the middle of some heavy vampire politics. She's still trying to work out just what her relationship is with all the men in her life, including Asher. Works been busy. Old friendships are wavering. And to top it off, Anita has met the mother of all dark mothers...not a fun experience in the least.Anita Blake is a complex, compelling character whose stories always keep me guessing. And, as always, with Cerulean Sins, Laurell K.

I love that Asher played a bigger part in this book. No complaints."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels, though I liked the first few the best. As many long time fans have remarked, things have gotten a little out of hand, and no more so than in Narcissus in Chains. I'm glad to say that they have calmed a bit in Cerulean Sins. Though there is a plot about someone murdering women, and some international terrorists drop in, the novel is primarily about many of the characters working through their neuroses. While this may be off-putting to some, I was relieved to feel at the end of the novel that some of them had actually come to terms with what they are (Anita, Asher, Richard, for example). If so, thank God! I hope in the next one we can move forward without all these hang-ups to revisit yet again...That said, I am looking forward to the next Anita Blake with real hope that we are now past the intensive psychotherapy phase and back to vampire politics, vicious monster crime, and yes, lots of sex (I kind of like it, as long as it is not followed by all those neurotic regrets). And maybe Jean-Claude, Anita and Richard can come into their true power. With what seems to be on the horizon, they're going to need it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As usual, LKHamilton keeps us panting for more with Anita, her love life, and her work life. I was glad to see that Anita is coming more to terms with her special abilities and her needs. (I was getting tired of her always being so wishy washy and \\"oh no what have I done\\"). She should be a little tougher emotionally, accepting the fact, that her lifestyle has certain needs, let's accept it and move on. And with this story, I think she might actually be on the way for such attitude adjustment.The book held a few surprises for me (in relation to her friendship with the police) and some new anticipation of a new 'man' in her life (the assassin, maybe he'll be back).It also looks like Anita may be going \\"international\\", depending on what Jean-Claude's, Belle Mort, is going to do. There's diffidently going to be a big brouhaha with that story line.Over all, Cerulean Sins lives up to my expectation of Anita Blake, and as always, leaves me panting for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Fans of Jean-Claude and Asher will revel every moment spent with this book. I am, so I did. This is definitely their story. This book provides a lot of insight into both their characters--something LKH has only dropped intriguing hints at in previous books. LKH has also taken pains to develop Anita's character more and the result is a mature, thoughtful, and methodical heroine. I really liked the Anita in this book. She seems much more poised and capable of dealing with situations with a lot more finesse and intelligence than she had before--where normally she'd just pull a gun on anyone who [made her mad] and start shooting. Our little executioner is growing up. This book also sets up the plots for novels to follow and hints at trouble on the horizon, so I wouldn't advise skipping it. The pace of this book is fast and the plot intricate without being confusing. The story revolves around already established characters, which was a flaw of Narcissus in Chains, the previous novel. It's nice to have the main characters developed more thoroughly here. The sex within is explicit, but I didn't find it gratuitous...All in all, an enjoyable read for fans, but I wouldn't recommend anyone starting the series with this book. In order to understand the characters, their relationships, all the whos, whats, whys and wheres, you need to start with the first in the series, Guilty Pleasures. But be warned, once you start this series, you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Very enjoyable addition to the Anita Blake series.

A definite step up from Narcissis in Chains."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As a huge fan of the Anita Blake series, I was disapointed to find that Cerulean Sins just wasn't that good. The plot was weak and riddled with loose ends. The characters did not move forward as they have done in previous books. Some of the best characters were mentioned very briefly or not at all. ... Although thankfully Richard had a very small role in this book, his chronic depression and unhappiness are getting old. I found myself wishing Anita would just [destroy] him and put him out of his misery. This book reads like a set-up for the next one, which is a shame, since all of the other books have had enough material to stand alone. Here's hoping that Ms. Hamilton gets back on track with the next one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Having read and re-read all of Hamilton's books in the Anita Blake series, I was kind of disappointed that she didn't stick to the regular style that she uses, she almost completely avoids some of the more interesting subplots that she is notorious for. I enjoyed the book, just not what I expected."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The latest installment in Anita's life is not to be missed! Fans of the series will enjoy the combination of L.K.H.'s signature bad-guy butt-kicking and the newer focus on Anita's emotional relationships with those around her. \\"The arduer\\" is still in full effect, so those who didn't like Narcissus In Chains because of the added sex scenes will probably not like this book as much as some of the earlier works in the series. Overall, this is a solid addition to the Anita Blake saga, and it follows Anita's natural progression. BTW, if you are lucky enough to be able to see Laurell K. Hamilton in person, DO NOT PASS IT UP! She's an amazing person to meet."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I became hooked on LKH recently and can't get enough of her \\"Anita\\" series. Cerulean Sins is a great book but I wish there had been more on the serial killer. It seemed like it was cut off quickly. I did like that Jason was given an adult outlook but was disappointed that other main characters were made to look bland. Of course the sex is great and I'm not complaining but touch up on it - don't make it the main focus. LKH did leave quite a bit open for future stories and I can't wait for \\"the shoe to drop\\" from Micah. I do like him and think he is necessary for Anita. I'm hoping that Damien will be brought to the fore instead of a backdrop. But these are my personal feelings and LKH has the best imagination I have read...It will be interesting to see what direction the Wolves will be going in. How long will Richard's followers follow? I did like this book very much and read it until the wee hours of the morning! Here's hoping that the following books get back to the \\"darkness\\"!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins wasn't that entertaining. I've collect the entire series of AB books, but this book was the most uneventful novel. Anita's personal has become a disaster. Yes, the roles of the supporting characters around her have finally been defined, but I felt like I was in the middle of a sex therapy session instead of the usual LKH fiction. Everything from the usual crime mystery to the preternatural threat seemed VERY secondary to the main character's love life. And since that was the case, LKH's attempt to add the usual sub-plots (RPIT, the spook conspiracy) in the book seemed almost inconsequential and moot. Truthfully, it seems LKH has a problem eliminating the male characters she creates around Anita, the last and only other one being Phillip from Guilty Pleasures. This book has become more cluttered than NIC with relationship problems. LKH needs to start trimming away the male competition at some point. The cliche\`, handsome men chasing Anita around is becoming monotonous."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"How much can you flog the same formula and get away with it. This book is the same as the last four books of the anita blake series. It starts the same way and ends the same way. It has the same soft pornographic content all through. It potray's a really wrong role model in Anita - who though a hard nut and very independent has no morality and a twisted sense of everything."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The 11th book in the Anita Blake Vampire series seems like Laurell Hamilton is running out of ideas. The stories are feeling more and more like a daytime soap opera. She has to understand that a soap opera is on every day, but we only get a new Anita Blake book every year! It should be important and mean something - make it count. Anita's character seems to go along with the flow of everything happening around her, instead of making decisions for herself. Yeah, I enjoy the sex as much as anyone else, but not at the expense of a compelling story. I also think the author desperately needs an editor with the courage to stand up to her. What Ms. Hamilton has written in 500+ pages, could have easily been done in 200 or so. Note to Laurell - keep the action moving and tell an interesting story! Don't worry about quantity, worry about quality."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I, like most people, loved the first 10 books. I loved that Anita was a strong female character that could really kick ass when she needed to. She was strong and capable. But the series has turned to a whole new focus--EVERYBODY WANTS ANITA. Her main boyfriends, her extracurricular boyfriends, and all the bad guys--that includes international vampires and international terrorists--want her. Only a few people don't and they seem to have jealousy issues. The whole book seems to be more of a teenage fantasy than a slick vampire story.Anita is offered up as such a powerful female figure and I like that. But where are the others?? Anita has no real women friends... Ronnie, Cheryl, and Claudia all have bit parts--although no Ronnie in this book--and do nothing that advances the plot. They are all only token. The books are all about Anita and her harem of men. In some ways, Anita is beginning to remind me of the vampires in that she suffers no one that could be any sort of competition. It almost seems to me that Anita, and perhaps LKH, don't care for other women. A few more people not in love with Anita would really air out the storyline.I wish the series would change with the next book, but from the reviews I have read it seems to be more of the same with more typos. The whole \\"ardeur\\" problem needs to go away. I am okay with Anita having sex with whomever she wants, but does LKH have to give her such a silly reason to do it? How about she just wants to? It reminds me too much of the woman that must get drunk in order to give herself permission to have sex.I am losing hope for Anita."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Like NIC this book has a lot of sex in it, I don't know if thats becoming the main focus of the Anita Blake series or not but in the last 2 books it seems that it is. Don't get me wrong a little sex isn't bad. The main problem I'm having with it is simply Anita, she's all high and mighty when it comes to feeding the ardeur yet when she has to kill she just pulls the trigger, no thinking to it. Her moral high ground is getting on my nerves and I'm glad to see with this book she lets it down a little and just has some fun with it, although afterwards its a whole chapter of nothing but being pissed that she did it. I loved the whole Asher/JC/Anita trio. I'm glad to see Asher devolping alittle. And her episode with Jason was WOW and a long time coming. Nathenial is finally becoming a MAN and not a whimpy \\"yes dear may I have another\\" boy. The plot is lacking like, nothing much to it. The whole book is mainly \\"feed the ardeur, kill something, feed the ardeur\\" which is getting frustrating. There was this whole Mother of All Darkness bit but didn't last but like 3 chapters, would have wished that had been the man focus of the story b/c that would have made it readable again. Buy it if you love Anita although its the same plot as the last few, nothing grand is happening. I hope with Incubus Dreams a lot of things change for the sake of Anita herself. Series is dwindling, pretty darn fast!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I read those unflattering reviews and thus held off buying this book, big mistake. I should have just trusted one of my favorite authors.I love this Anita, she is not such a hypocrite in this book. She seems to have mellowed out a little and is trying to take care of her people. Yes, I do miss the wise cracking shoot them first Anita, but I don't miss the Anita that was just such mean sprited self-rightoues ... to those around her. This book dealt with things that had been sitting on the sidelines for too long; ie., Asher/Jean Claude and Jason. Despite what was written by one reviewer concerning Anita's new Federal Marshall status, I think she handle it quite well and wasn't pushy just professional. Yes, this book dealt a lot with the arduer but that is also where NIC left off, and showing her dealing with it and controlling it is important so that by the next book she can have it more under control like JC does. Also people complained about the amount of sex, the way I look at it is: 1. she is not having sex with strangers, the two/three people that she is with are long time friends and confidants. 2. if you don't like the sex scenes (which there is not a lot of), skip that part.Now that things have been worked out and through for Anita in this book, I too would like to see a lot more action (not in the sexual form). The way I look at this book in comparision to the rest of the books in the series, is that she needed this time to come to grips with her personal life, instead of running away like she had done it the past. And as for those who are uncomfortable with her sexual nature, then realize that this is a fantasy realm and either don't read that section or just lighten up.Overall I wish that I had read this book sooner!!! I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"...that isn't saying much.Gone forever are the Anita Blake novels of old, and I for one grieve for them. I like character evolution as much as the next reader, but switching genre's is perhaps going a bit overboard. The overall emphasis on Anita's sex life makes for tedious reading, especially since Anita is still an unbelieveably immature and self-involved character, and blissfully ignorant of that fact. I was sorry to see Richard run further into the ground, but not suprised. I'm betting he's gone in another book or 2. But I was even sorrier to see Jean-Claude come off so lifeless, pardon the pun. Much emphasis is put on Asher and Jason, 2 interesting characters that I was happy to see explored, but they just get turned into 2 more adoring worshippers of Anita. And the original two men that were so integral and fascinating in earlier books, Richard and Jean-Claude seem to be yesterdays news. Its depressing. Maybe one day Ms Hamilton could actually be bothered to give Micah some character and inner-life. She certainly seems to be hitting the reader over the head with the wonderfulness of him. After 2 books, he's about as deep as a puddle and about as interesting as watching paint dry. Or perhaps men that look like women *and* can share their clothing, while never having a contrary thought, are interesting to Ms Hamilton. I suppose its possible.The mystery side of these books had potential, but Anita waving her federal marshall status obnoxiously in the face of local police was really nauseating. I understand its fiction, but if she acted that way towards a real officer of the law she'd last about 5 minutes. Shouldn't one have some general respect for the law to carry a badge? And I won't even mention the incredibly reckless actions Anita takes which puts innocent people in danger. No worries though, Micah tells her its OK, so then it must be so. Oh please !!!I think I've hit the end of the road with LKH. I was really hoping that NIC was an aberration and this book would return to the form of old. But Anita Blake has turned into the classic \\"Mary Sue\\", and there can be no denying that. Its obviously what the author wants which is her perogative, so this is where I get off.....sadly"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I remember reading Guilty Pleasures, the first Anita Blake novel, when it was first published, and revelling in the way Laurell K Hamilton had invented a character who was funny, bright, and tough, but still had a deep moral streak, which prevented her from becoming a simple killing machine.As the books progressed, we saw a natural change in Anita, which was quite understandable. We understood as she struggled with her attraction to the 'monsters' she fought, and cheered when she finally succumbed to the charms of the delicious Jean Claude.I'm not sure what happened along the way, but by the time Narcissus in Chains arrived, these wonderful novels had become nothing but cheap porn, without care for plot or characterisation.Cerulean Sin in slightly better than NiC, but only very slightly. It seems that any effort to include a plot has been spared, and we're subjected to an endless tirade of sex scenes, which quickly become dreadfully dull, and repetative.Someone really should explain to Ms Hamilton, the meaning of 'overkill' and that often, less is more. Also, that there is a fine line between 'erotica' and 'bad porn', one she unfortunately crossed two novels back.I hoped that after NiC, this series would get back on track, but I fear that it won't.I personally won't be buying any more Anita Blake novels, and that saddens me immensely. I'll just reread the old novels, and remember what once was, with fondness and regret."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Okay, first things first, Hamillton has really orchestrated the old bait n'switch with this one. After Narcissus, a mishmush of gratuitous plotless sex and magic, I thought Cerulean would save the day. Then I started to read, the first part of the book promises good things, the sex was toned down, the magic tolerable, and some of the fan favorites showed up. She went to work (she still works right?) and then to the police. But then as if to deliberately tease us, the annoying ardeur rears its head and we are then travelling down the porno tunnel to over the top magic land. And what about Anita? Where is the bitter, independent creature that fans loved?Where are her weapons? Her hideous ensembles (boyfriend jackets, golf shirts etc.)Where is her shoot em up attitude? Now Anita travels with a full entourage and plays a damsel and a victim. She cries, she faints, she pukes. But she doesn't save the day really. Anita has been so compromised that when Hamillton tries to reel her back in she sounds like a total hypocrite( her issues with nudity and nakedness, her prejudices toward lycanthropes, her complete inability to comprehend Richards plight). And another thing, when did Anita become the lust object of all male characters? There has been a rapidly declining number of women in the books or when they are present they are either 1. evil, 2. lesbians, or 3. in a monagamous relationship and therefore no threat. Thus leaving Anita in a pig-pile of horny femme guys in spandex with creepilly long metal dude hair. And then the chest licking...So I have some ideas for the next book...get rid of the ardeur, I don't care how (oh its magic wednesday) then, resolve some things from the days of old. (Olaf? the government? Richard?) Then Anita needs to get dumped. She needs to be spurned and isolated therefore reverting back to the recognizable and coherent character that she started as. All the men can have a meeting and say 'Anita is no good for any of us' and dump her, and Asher and Jean-Claude could get together, then have Ronnie get engaged and the book center around preparing for the wedding where Anita is the maid of honor and Richard would be the best man (forcing them to spend time and reconcile in some way) How about the climax of the book involve Anita running around with guns and blades in a hideous bridesmaid dress?....well I think it could be fun...."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Enough is enough. This book is not sufficiently different from porn to make a distinction. When Hamilton starts describing the mystical transcendence of having a different male in every orafice of Anita's body I just wanted to weep for the series. If you haven't yet read this book. Don't. In fact, stop at Obsidian Butterfly and then pick up \\"The Dresden Files\\" series by Jim Butcher."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I think that Anita Blake as a character has grown up in this installment of the series. As her powers evolve so does Hamilton's characterization of Anita matures. I have been reading The Vampire Hunter novels since Gulity Pleasures and one of my biggest problems with Anita early on was her 'holier than thou' attitude.Though Hamilton's unique take on vampires and shape shifters is still engaging and fascinating, Cerulean Sins suffers from a story line that gets lost in too much stuff going on at once and villians that seem more annoying than menacing. I have to suggest buying a used copy or waiting until it comes out on paperback."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have read all of Hamilton's books as soon as I could get my hands and them, and loved every one of them. So it was somewhat of a disappointment that after only eleven books Hamilton wrote one that wasn't as good as the ones that came before it (scarasm). Normally when you open one of her Anita Blake books, the \\"monster\\" that is terrorizing people is the focus, and each book could be a stand alone story. Anita, the police, and 'friendly' pernaturals (vampires, faries, etc.) all interact with this being the biggest worry of almost everyone. Instead, for this book Hamilton focused more on the charcters themselves and the \\"monster\\" only actually comes into the story enough to do some bodyguard work at the begining and to get shot at the end.This book seems more to be a transtition book between the past and what is to come. The charcters are getting older (Jason, Zane), some are dealing with their problems sucessfully, others (like Richard and Dolph Storr) are letting their personal problems devour them. Real people change over time, so has Anita and the rest of her friends. So the focus of this story is how everyone is changing and settling in to their less than normal live. Anita is learning how to handle the Audor (a kind of curse that forces Anita to feed off of people, not blood like vampires but sexual energy and lust), Storr is not handling the fact that his son may become a vampire in the near future, Asher is getting over his psychlogical scars, Jason is becomeing an adult, Richard is becomeing sucideal.... The list goes on.And that was just the main plotlines. There was alot of set-up happeing in the backgroud. Someone set some very dangerous men to draft Anita into zombie making for them, Storr may not be the head of St Louis Pernatural police division in the next book, people may think that Anita was pregnant, and Bele Mortum (a very powerful member of the vampire world government) is going to try to become THE head vampire in the world...\\"May you live in interesting times\\" is an eastern curse, but for Anita and her friends, I hope it is not any other way!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I do not understand why so many people are giving such a horrible review for this wonderful book. I LOVE every single book in this series, and each one keeps getting better and better. Anita has developed both mentally and emotionally, and so has almost everyone around her (everyone except Richard, who I see no hope for at all, and that doesn't bother me.) This book is very fast paced and edgy."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I must say, that CS was a disappointment. You wade through a truck load of emotional hodge podge to get to nothing. The plot was incoherent, and there was no real character development. I feel that Anita is becoming such a weak character. She really is losing her sense of self. And it's just such a sudden illogical change. One moment she's superwoman and the next she's a weeping damsel in distress. The plot is getting so immersed in this emotional garbage and sex that it's just plane boring. It's abosolutely ridiculous! After plowing through a whole book of this in NiC, you would expect something spectacular, but no."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In her usual style, Ms Hamilton ends each chapter with a reason, a desire, a need to read the next chapter. I especially like the wit and banter between the characters in this book. Reading CS was like getting back with your friends or family. You might not like everything about them, but you still love them. I can not imagine trying to pick up the series / story line without starting at the beginng.I do agree that some of the sex is past erotica; however, it is the beasts and learning to deal with these animal instincts that makes the character development so interesting. If we readers are having a difficult time with the level of sex; imagine how Anita is dealing with this (Dolph certainly expressed his opinion, do we want to be as closed minded?)I still believe that Richard is being a \\"baby\\". He needs to grow up and deal the hand he has been dealt, but then that is part of his growing process and he has the most potential for character growth and development (at this time). Also I am glad for a main character with short hair (ops sorry! spoiler-he cuts his hair); I do get tired of the detailed descriptions of the long hair on the men. (give it a rest, please!!)I feel that this is one of the more exciting books (yes I agree similar to Burnt Offerings) but a very enjoyable read. A lot has been set up in this book for future books. I eagerly await the next in the series (which is what? about 18 months away?). Being from St. Louis, I do enjoy the references to the Landmarks and areas. I live between Chesterfield and Wildwood where the murders take place."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I don't have any problems with Anita's sex life, but where was the story? NIC was kind of lost until the ending which was great. This story doesn't even have that. If you so love the series (and Asher) buy the book, but you might want to wait until the paperback"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If you haven't read an Anita Blake book, go away. Shoo. This is book eleven and you need to start at the beginning with Guilty Pleasures and read them in order like the rest of us. These books are so good because of all the character interactions that have been building and changing over all the books. This book won't make sense to you.This is written for those of you who, like me, have been waiting, and waiting, and waiting for this book. While I was disappointed that one particularly annoying recently added character lives, I have to say it's MUCH better than NiC. The actions of the characters make SENSE in this book. No sudden character turns in implausible directions. And while there are some extremely hot sex scenes (my finger tips are still singed) they too fit in with the plot. No group sex just for the sake of group sex. And unlike NiC, LKH does not spend the entire book in bed; she brings back the gore factor in a big way. So if you are like me, if you were giving up on Anita and friends to focus on Merry & Co., this book will change your mind.P.S. A note to fans of Asher and Jason: you will LOVE this book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was not one of those who read Narcissus in Chains and then immediately jumped back in horror. Sure, LKH had managed to surprise me with the unexpected twists, but i thought that it was not too below her usual caliber. And so, i was willing to read Cerulean Sins.I was glad to see Zerbrowski and the other cops, but i disliked how LKH changed Dolph into a hulking, vampire-hating pain. That just really annoyed me. And i'm not too happy about Anita's numerous bed partners.but that wasn't the worst part. the worst part was how much paper and space LKH wasted with anita's angst. every other page was filled with, \\"No, i can't have sex with all these men... But i have to, the munin and JC's sex hunger forces me to do it... Oh, my goodness, i can't believe i just did that... Oh screw it, i'm gonna do what the hell i want to do... Oh wait, did i really just do that?\\" Halfway through the book, i honestly had a headache from the way anita battered her situation from all sides mentally. i mean, at least in the Merry Gentry series, paper isn't wasted on how internally uncertain she feels about sleeping with all the men. she accepts it as something she has to do.Not only that, but most of the action/plot in the novel was basically present only in the last...fifty or so pages. And they were not soooo good that i was willing to forgive the not so likable parts of the book.for me, the anita blake series ends at Obsidian Butterfly. I highly doubt that i'll be willing to venture into any new AB books again."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I admit that after reading Narcissus in Chains I was ready to give up on the Anita Blake series, but I thought I would give it one more try and read this book. I'm glad I did. Don't get me wrong, I still like the earlier books in the series better, but Cerulean Sins is not as bad as some make it out to be. It actually gave me hope that the series could get back on track. If you are reading this and wondering if you should give up on the series or read CS and give it one more chance, I recommend reading CS before writing off the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was really excited to read this book. I heard rave reviews of the Anita Blake books and Cerulean Sins sounded really intriguing. However I was sorely disappointed to find this book pornographic!! I mean I'm not prude! I read Kim H. and I've even dabbled in Highlander books but OMG it was an atrocity!Some of the plot and mystery to the book were passable, and LKH needs to continue on that route. But the sex scenes were ridiculous and tasteless. LKH made up excuses to have Anita have sex with anyone in the book! And a threesome? AND a power that heightens your sex drive 800%? Look. Anita Blake has promise, has a future. But not if you sell her out to every waiting, \\"pulsating\\" penis.I'm disappointed. I've vowed after this book to never read a LKH book again. And I warn my friends with similar interests away from the series unless they are interested in porn.:|"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Marginally better than the last but very cluttered. There are too many characters, so every chapter requires pages of clarification on relationships, most of which are really stupid. Vampire politics continue gangland boring, a page and a half each meeting of \\"Tell me again why I can't just shoot them?\\" Because we need to stretch this book another hundred pages.The \\"ardeur\\" continues to be a dull feature, lots of unconvincing and un-sexy sex. Hamilton has fallen into the trap of increasing Anita's powers and adding several relationships with nearly every book, and seems compelled to account for every nonhuman Anita ever met in every book. The series is fizzling as a result.I miss the zombies, and I'm disappointed that Richard has devolved into an annoying stereotypical \\"I love him (why?) but he is too filled with self-loathing for a relationship\\" ex.

Anita's morals are highly challenged throughout this book. With the ardeur, her needs to feed it through sex challenges her morals.Richard is struggling with his own depression and the triumvirate suffers due to his problems.

Negotiations are not complete and Musetta demands Asher as her \\"treat\\". In order to protect Asher, Anita will test the bounds of her morals which will bind Jean-Claude, Anita and Asher closer together than ever before.

She is curious of Anita and her powers, the mother does not love, hate, or feel any emotions, she is darkness itself."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I had no idea how to rate this book. If you've followed the series, you'll probably want to read this one. Unless you've hated the direction that last book or two has taken in which case you may wanna skip it.Before I start complaining about all the kinkiness, let me confess that Anita's priggish-ness in the early novels aggravated me badly. She wouldn't so much as kiss Jean-Claude (her would-be boyfriend who was near perfect other than the whole vampire thing.) No intercourse til marriage she tells Richard-her other would-be boyfriend who was near perfect other than the whole werewolf thing. Who by the way has turned into a rather nutty self-loathing guy who barely appears in the book and when he does you just wanna smack him. The whole leader of the local pack apparently is seriously not agreeing with him.The story starts out promisingly enough with Anita on the job with Animators Inc. Soon she has a mysterious new client and the bad news that the Vampire Council-specifically Belle Morte the found of Jean-Claude's and Asher's lines-has taken an interest in St. Louis's vampire/werewolf/Anita goings-ons. Pretty soon this devolves into a yet another tale in which every man she encounters wants to get carnal with her even though she is annoying as ever, with pointless arguments that go on for pages that make you wanna throttle her and anyone who would wanna get busy with her. And naturally she just has to enter into a menage with JC and Asher so Asher isn't forced to return to Belle Morte. Uh yeah, that makes sense to me. And I haven't even mentioned the Ardeur that needs feeding. Who hasn't Blake had relations with yet? Let's see...well there's Willie the vamp and Irving the werewolf reporter. Then again they've been missing for a few books now. Maybe they were afraid their draft notices were coming up.Other bad news for fans of Dolph the police lieutenant-he's as buggy for Richard and hates all supernatural types now since an event occurred in his personal life.This book isn't entirely bad and honestly I'll run out and grab the next one as soon as it's...available from the public library. I haven't reached the point I have with Anne Rice where I've just completely given up. There's still hope for Laurell and Anita."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After the shocking change of the mood and complete destruction of the series in \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", this book was somewhat bearable. There is a story to follow (weak but better than the previous one), there is a crime scene and even though Dolph has gone completely mental, he is included in the story.Unfortunately Anita is still jumping everything that has a pulse, and each scene takes up pages and pages *yawn*. Everything seems to be only about sex, and it is really tiresome. The crimes, whatever is happening outside the bedroom walls, seem to have no importance. They are just there .... Quite sad !!!The book is not awful (very close though) and it's not good either. Just .... bearable !!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Don't get me wrong, this series started off good, and I have reread all the books up to Blue Moon several times. Obsidian Butterfly pushes it, but I didn't mind it. I wish this series had ended with Obsidian Butterfly, because now when I think of it there is that awful taste of needlessly bitter disappointment.Anita Blake was a great character. Strong, feminine, and kick-ass. Her wit was the best part of the series. Now, I can't stand Anita. She is whiney and, I am sorry to say, skanky. Normally I don't care about a person's sex life, but Anita has so little discrimination, a realistic plot twist would be that she contracted herpes, and that isn't sexy at all. Her sex scenes just feel UNCLEAN. More like animal pornography than sex. I loved the love triangle between Anita, Jean Claude, and Richard (although I have personally always favoured JC a bit more) but now there are so many extra men thrown in I can't even keep track. It seems to me like Laurell K. Hamilton has turned a clever, sexy vampire series into an excuse to write boring, tasteless erotica, at the expense of her readers. And yes, her erotica is boring.I read the entire book of Narcissus in Chains, just to be faithful, and by the time I finally closed it, I couldn't even remember what it was about. I could barely glean a plot from such a big, thick book. That alone is sad, considering how rich her first books were. They also sported little to no sex. I can remember even that there was once a time this lack of sex between Anita and either JC or Richard frustrated me, and I suppose this is the classic case of \\"Be careful what you wish for\\" because it is once they start having sex that this series goes downhill. I can pinpoint it to a certain scene in a bath tub.I am not even continuing past the first few chapters of Cerulean Sins. It's quite simply awful. I have lost all the respect for Anita that I once had, and I used to come pretty close to idolizing her. I desperately hope that Laurell creates another series with a new heroine and doesn't destroy the heroine like she did to Anita, and Merry Gentry, because Merry's series is even worse than Anita's. Gawd, servicing a roomful of policemen? And countless other people, all in the same book, which takes up only a few days of her life? I consider myself extremely liberal, and even I find that repulsive.For a more promising author, who manages to balance the supernatural and steamy sex scenes without ruining the entire book, try Kelley Armstrong. She started writing books at about the same time Laurell started writing trash, and Kelley's books are my consolation."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"OK, this is book 11 in the series and I am sure its starts to become taxing on the author to grow the story and character.

This story focuses on Anita's romantic entanglements, with a few small subplots thrown in--namely, a murder mystery and the threat of a very powerful vampire coming to town.This book is so badly written, it was a chore to read it.The writing is sloppy, tedious, badly edited, and confusing.Ditto for the plot.Ditto for the characters.The book is mired in convenient plot devices and tired and uninspiring sex scenes.There is no suspense in the book, despite its mystery/horror angle.Bottom line: this book contains no redeemable qualities at all, unless you're looking for a book filled with sex scenes. Then CS *might* be worth your while. Other than that? Leave this book well alone, unless you're planning on using it for a doorstop."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"My first Anita Blake novel was, I believe, Bloody Bones. Bought it at the airport before a flight. I liked it so much, I purchases the rest of the series. Narcissus in Chains had just come out in hardback. I loved all of them, except this last, where I first realized that Ms. Hamilton was losing touch with the character Anita Blake. But I remained convinced that Cerulean Sins would redeem the character, and Ms. Hamilton. I am 3/4 of the way through the book, and am both bored and frustrated with lack of a coherent plot or a believable Anita Blake.I was sure that Hamilton's proclivity to write soft porn was channeled into her faerie series. Don't get me wrong, they're a hoot. But I expect more from this series and its characters. Where is our strong, ... heroine with her array of powers that have, until recently, grown and matured with each book? I'm sick to death of whiney, self-loathing Richard and psychotic Dolph, and I miss Edward. I am tired of a series that has turned into juicy romance novels, one that seems to be going the way of Robert Jordan's series... What I miss most of all is Anita, the preternatural detective and necromancer. I feel like I should say good-bye to someone who has been a long-time friend, but who has gone down a path from which they will likely not return.I don't know if I can get through the last quarter of the book, but I feel compelled after purchasing both the hardback and the audio set. What a disappointment..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita Black was a great series for a long time. It was funny, sexy, action-packed, and creepy. Anita was a cool tough chick who did things her own way with style and self-effacing wit. That was the good old days, all right, up through Obsidian Butterfly.But something's changed. The books are no longer sexy, but just sexual. Anita is under a curse (\\"ardeur\\") that forces her to do something sexual every twelve hours. It's absurd if you think about it--what if she's on a long plane trip? What if she gets hurt and has to stay in the hospital? What if her family comes over to stay with her for a couple days? But the author takes this curse, which seems more like a cheap porn setup than an actual plot, with deadly seriousness.The end result is sad. Anita, once tough and in charge, is reduced to a porn cliche, sleeping with people she used to hate, writhing about on the floor and begging every man in St. Louis for more, more, she must have more sex! I liked the erotic bits in the previous books, but they coexisted with action and horror--as erotica alone, the series just doesn't work.The usual murder mystery plot takes place entirely in the first 10 and last 10 pages of the book, and is ignored completely in the intervening 390. Too bad. It's got potential. The vampire-politics plot runs all through the book, but it's paced at about a development every five hours, so good luck staying awake."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"It's been some time since I've picked up an Anita Blake novel but I have read most of them. My favorite of the series is still Guilty Pleasures because of Blake's handling of the monsters, her own budding necromancy and the detective aspect of things.Cerulean Sins is a far cry from that! I was quite disappointed in the direction the book was going. We are going to have sex and a confused relationship with Anita. That's a given. But this becomes the main thrust (sorry) of the book! Richard wants to be normal and is a werewolf. OK. And Jean-Claude loves his petite. Swell. But the triumvirate gets invaded by Bella Morte, an old-school vampire who wants Anita for herself. There's a struggle and there's some cool vampire powers. Great, back on track. Except... Asher. Asher, the vampire who was disfigured by holy water, needs protection from Bella as she wants him back too. The snarky arrogance of Bella is quite gross. She brings in a gift of a painting of Asher designed to make him feel like mud. And we go through several pages of this kind of covert hostility that is hard to read.Anita's solution is to get the boys in bed and screw them good. The book at this point takes a turn for the near-pornographic which was disappointing as well. Hamilton can usually write a decent love scene without the gross imagery as she has done in earlier books.Relationships: Dorph goes off the deep end and refuses to work with Anita. He really hates the monsters now and feels Anita is corrupted. She makes a few less-than-tactful remarks and he goes off the deep end. This thread is never fully wrapped up at the end either.Oh, there's a few gruesome murders from a serial killer, Anita meets a hit man who wants an ancestor risen, and she meets an international killer who is following her. Great, huh? Except that's a minor, oh so minor part of the story. The book is really all about Anita and that's a real shame. A story of Anita struggling to find the killer would have been a lot more interesting than a story of Anita struggling with the mind games of vampires and her adoration of Asher's long, flowing locks!Hope the next installment is better!Other Books:Graphic Novels!Marvel Comics-Anita Blake Vampire Hunter-Guilty Pleasures Handbook (Anita Blake Vampire Hunter-Guilty Pleasures, Handbook)Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter: The Laughing Corpse Book 1 - Animator (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter (Marvel Paper))Book Sets!Laurell K.

Cerulean Sins, for all its flaws, is a better book than NiC; a lot better &#65533; because I actually enjoyed it. Yes it's still sexual, but for some reason, it wasn't as unacceptable as it was in Narcissus. Here&#65533;s the breakdown:The plotline: Ignorable, which is NOT a bad thing. There is a whole truckload of character development throughout this book, and a highly convoluted story would detract from LKH&#65533;s purpose, I think.The main characters: Well done. They all seem to come into their own, even Anita. She&#65533;s gotten a lot more comfortable in her own skin and has come to terms with what she is. It&#65533;s a welcome change. The vamps are great (as usual &#65533; Asher is my secret love), and Jason&#65533;s grown up a lot. Laurell basically keeps Richard OUT of this book, which is a little sad, but it&#65533;s understandable. My only fear is that she&#65533;ll replace him with that stiff Micah, who I don&#65533;t care for, but we&#65533;ll see what happens.The supporting players: MORE EDWARD PLEASE. He&#65533;s a great character. Larry&#65533;s missing, the werewolves are basically not around, and Cherry and crew seem to have just disappeared &#65533; excluding Nathaniel (And I will admit that I freaking hate Nathaniel). That&#65533;s sort of a let down, but she does make up for it with a neat little subplot that includes Dolph and Zebrowski. I liked that a lot. It was cool.The overall skinny: Good stuff. Choppy, and too morally twisted, but this is great set up for Queen of the Damned (*COUGH* I mean The Mother of Darkness). Sorry I let that slip. It&#65533;s just that I&#65533;m seeing a few creepy similarities to another vampire writer and it&#65533;s making me nervous. But anyway &#65533; BESIDES THAT - happy reading, folks. Enjoy the book. Be thankful it&#65533;s not Narcissus in Chains. My only advice? Don&#65533;t get your hopes too high for the next one. She didn&#65533;t completely redeem herself yet, but she&#65533;s getting closer to it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book continues the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series. It is the 11th in the grouping. Anita and her vampire lover Jean Claude are faced with the serious threat of Belle Morte Jean Claude's creator. It was planned that a visit would occur from a group of Belle Morte's other children. They were being sent to see how Jean Claude was doing as the New Master of the City in St. Louis, but when they unexpectedly arrive three months early tension and the threat of violence is imminent. Life is far from normal in Anita's life, and this threat to the ones she holds dear seems just up her alley.Out of all the books I'd have to say this one went the fastest, the story felt too short. I can defiantly see that it is an introduction for a much larger plotline but I still feel slightly cheated out of some of what I've come to expect with an Anita Blake novel. The side story, the murder investigation, felt like an add on. It was thrown in on the side as a way to further some interpersonal relationship stuff and for the bigger plotlines to come. However, even any head way that might have been made with the interpersonal relationships(Anita and Jean Claude, Jean Claude and Asher, Anita and Richard, Nathaniel and Anita, Anita and Jason, Dolph and Anita) seemed unsteady. It might just be me, but all the talking and soul searching seemed to have taken Anita nothing more then a baby step further. I guess what I'm basically saying is that I did enjoy the book, but it was like reading \\"Cliff Notes to Anita Blake Vampire Hunter.\\" It was just too short. But my dedication to the series has not wavered, I think I can see what Ms. Hamilton is doing and I expect that with the next novel there will be many surprises.Of course there were things I liked about they story. I liked how Ms. Hamiltion continues to breath life into the supporting cast. I like Jason and Nathaniel as much as I like Anita. I have always liked how she tires to give them life, feelings, and personality.I like the passion in these books. If your put off by sex, then mayhap you should go with something else, or skip the scenes, because they are hot, steamy, and very vivid. In her work, not only the physical side of sex but the emotional side of love is a strong part in the story. There is almost a fascination with the physical form of a person, sex, sexuality, and how emotions react to all of it. It's an exploration of the hang ups we have about sex and the breaking of those barriers."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"ok, so let me start by saying i LOVE the earlier novels. however, this one and some of the ones behind it are up to LKH normal standards. i probably would have given this 2 stars if it wasn't for how much i love the series and keep hoping that it will rebound.what was wrong with the book? well the biggest thing is the indiscriminate sex... lots and lots of meaningless sex. the plot revolves around anita and her uncontrolable impulses. there is little to the mystery. that is my main gripe with the book. i miss the suspense and mystery and actual plot. to be honest if this was the first of her books i picked up i wouldn't read any more of them.however, it is still a decent book, mostly well written. i love jason, and like anita and richard and other main characters less and less. i hope that LKH returns to what made this series so popular, and it wasn't the sex.

Hamilton's Anita Blake series, takes its name from the silk sheets covering the bed of our heroine's love the Master Vampire of St. Louis. By choosing something associated with Jean-Claude's bed the title reinforces the controversial direction of the series towards the erotic. For several volumes now the climax of each novel usually involves Anita discover some new aspect of her power, which helps save the day and propels her further into the ranks of being a monster, to the amazement of her circle of friends and the strong disapproval of Dolph the cop. This also further complicates the vampire politics in which she is embroiled. However, that transformation seems rather insignificant compared to Anita's sexuality. The change wrought by the \\"ardeur\\" in the formerly prime and proper Anita is the most radical of all, and one that is not embraced by many fans of the series. In \\"Cerulean Sins\\" the \\"ardeur\\" plays a key elements, so that Hamilton can at least claim she is not just writing soft porn.As is usually the case, the novel begins with Anita juggling the responsibilities of the human and the magical world. A mysterious guy shows up wanting a dead ancestor raised and she has to bring back another corpse to settle whether or not the death was a suicide. Then there are the series of gruesome murders apparently committed by a shape-shifter. But all of this becomes back burner concerns because Musette, the emissary of Belle Morte, has shown up three months early and it is clear that the \\"sourdre de sang\\" of Jean-Claude's bloodline is making a power play in which Asher is a pawn. Once again, Anita is caught between what she thinks herself capable of and her absolute commitment to protecting her people.It is probably about time that somebody puts out a companion guide to the Anita Blake series that will help readers understand the increasingly complex rules of the game when it comes to vampire politics. Anita can cross-examine Jean-Claude, Asher and the others as much as she wants as to what is expected and allowed in terms of all these intrigues, but when everything explodes in the final scenes it gets a bit difficult to follow all the pieces coming together in terms of which vampires can call which were-animals, what constitutes an insult, and how to translate ancient vampire traditions expressed in French into the down and dirty vernacular of the America of Anita Blake.Looking back over the series from this point we can get a sense of how the original current through the early novels, which started with the stormy relationship between Anita and Jean-Claude, and which evolved into the most dysfunctional love triangle in horror literature when Richard, Ulfirc of the local werewolf clan entered the picture, has now given way to Anita ongoing evolution and an ultimate confrontation with Bella Morte (or something worse) down the road. For the first time in \\"Cerulean Sins\\" we have the notion of prophecy entering the picture, which would indicate that Anita Blake is more than just good at what she does, and while Richard is still in the picture doing the wrong things for (usually) the wrong reasons you have to think he is old news at this point.Fortunately, Anita Blake remains an engaging character and her sense of humor remains intact. I have to admit that I am glossing over the sex scenes much the same way I did years ago reading John Norman's Gor novels, because as much as Hamilton is trying to make them integral to the novel the problem is not that I am bothered by the sexuality but rather than it pales in comparison to the gut wrenching horror that filled the earlier novels. Any Anita Blake movie would have to be rated NC-17, not because of the sex, but because the horror and violence was on a level that exceeded \\"The Exorcist.\\" At her best, Hamilton makes Stephen King, Clive Barker and the rest look amateurs, and it is because of the heights that she has scaled in the past with her heroine that we will continue to wade our way through the sex to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I didn't expect alot from this book after reading Narcissus in Chains, and it lived up to my lowered expectations. Anita is not as interesting as she was several books ago. She has become superhuman with her various powers and is now boring and flat... The character has completely changed from the one that existed in the earlist books of the series.It's then left to the other characters to pick up the slack left by the main character. Anita's main boyfriends all go flat as well. Jean-Claude and Richard are in the book, but are both weak and stale. Her newest boyfriend, Micah, is barely in the book, probably because Laurell didn't know what to do with him. Jason gets a bigger role and matures, probably in line to be Anita's next boyfriend. The minor characters are the most interesting, especially the assorted wererats, wereleopards, werehyenas, and werewolves.The best part of the book is the crime Anita is working on with the police involving an extremely violent werewolf that might be into the occult. Unfortunately this plotline takes up less space than Anita's sex life and even more vampire politics.It's time for the series to [end], or Laurell to get back to the roots, although it's probably too late to make Anita into what she once was."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The Anita Blake of the first few books is gone and seemingly not returning. If you like vampire romance novels this may be a good book. If you like vampire mystery, it most definitely is not.I'll not buy another book in the series unless there is some indication that Anita is going back to her roots."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have loved this series from the beginning and enjoy how much the characters have grwon and changed. However, if you haven't read the series, do not start with this one. They need to be read in order.That said, Anita Blake and friends are about to have the &quot;honor&quot; of a visit by a representative of the vampire council. Right from the start things go wrong and they are only complicated by the consequences of Anita's acceptance of being bonded to a master vampire and an alpha werewolf.I would give all the other books in this series five stars. However, this one only got four as there were several continuity errors that disrupted the flow of the story when they cropped up. Aside from those errors, this was a fast read, engrossing, and a great addition to the series. I can hardly wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Well, the book had all of the requisite Anita Blake plot point items. It's like she has a list - dead bodies, check. Police snarkiness, check. Vampire politics, check. Mystery, check. So she put the minimum amount necessary in for each required item, and then spent the rest of her pages on boring and pointless introspection. Nothing is better at the end of this book, and some things are much worse. The bones of a good novel are in there, but the way it's fleshed out, the character development, the action...Nothing hangs together. The times of day are all wrong. Going from one place to another takes too little time, or too much. It's like the editors just didn't care, or were too anxious to get the book on the shelves to insist on anything like a consistancy check.I know the author is capable of much better writing. I don't think I'll be buying her hardbacks until she returns to the level of quality she showed in Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"My past reviews of the Anita Blake series have been back and forth between one and three stars because the series was developing, finding it's footing and developing of the character. There are still flashes of the old problems here but it's far more under control. This book was not only good in the places but pretty much as a book as a whole. Though I will say I hedged my bet by buying it for 60% off and I will admit that there is still a lot of conversational psycho analyzing going on in the character's interactions.There is a really interesting point of Anita having to open herself up sexually beyond simply a puritannical/Christian sense of one woman, one partner which is an interesting dynamic. Also the concept of fluidic sexualities within the sphere of people she's around, there is a true pushing towards omnisexuality. That's a great element of this book and how everyone's powers---vampires, werewolves, wereleopards, etc.---is so intrinsically linked to sex and emotional intimacy. And that the literal focal point of all of this is someone who has prudish values to such free love and sex.While Richard, teh werewolf king may seem like the stick in the mud to them truly being a team, the ultimate kind of family, I think he is the most human of them all. He doesn't like what he is, what's around him, what he's been forced to become----there was no choice in it for him and I realized in his hesitations and depression and anger he is the most human of them all. Unfortunately everyone else has made it so mandatory that he accept this whole lifestyle eventhough none of them else have regular lives outside of all of this weirdness. It would be nice if the inherent selfishness of the group is explored in that it's ok that someone doesn't want to be a part of this world.Onto the villainess, Belle Morte!I'm glad she didn't get a bullet in the head and is being saved as another problem for the future and this whole Mother of All Darkness is very interesting and it looks like it's part of Anita's destiny to be a link to all of these supernatural tribes to deal with this evil. What I do find interesting is how everyone is pushing in their \\"vampire worlds\\" this ultimate Uber Evil (Angel, Buffy, here) and at the same time here in the book the government (rightfully so) is taking an interest in all of these factions and using them for their own means. It's about time.I hope thatteh series doesn't shut down after a book or two because their are international dilemnas out there. It's also a pet peeve of mine that for all of their talking and constant emotional analyzing they never TALK to each other. They talk abotu themselves and push and pull but there are a couple of times in the novel where it would've been nice for Anita to pull Jean Claude aside and sit for a couple of hours to understand the vampire rules. Sometyimes her ignorance is used as a device to tell the reader things that we don't know about this world but it also serves to keep the exposition going on for tooooooooo long.As always the criminal investigation of the book doesn't get underway until page 100-125 which if you pay attention to the pacing of previous novels is how it always happens, the predictability caused the loss of one star. The hitman aspect of this was a little thin, thinner than most of the criminal plots of the book and more of harked back to characters that appeared in the beginning of the books to wrap up the end. That was the weakest aspect of the book in that this whole other sub-plot was developed as something that I expect will ultimate appear in future books.I was very pleased with this book, it has much more polish and isn't as reliant on Anita being able to shoot anyone and anything to beat it. That showed a maturity of the work and it's nice to see Anita enjoying and accepting having so many varied lovers and the bonding of being part of a pack. As I was reading the book, aside from the romantic part of this and the erotica, it was great to see Anita growing and questioning why she loves as she doesn, why she pushed people away. It would be nice to see another female in the book to give another perspective on her---what ever happened to her best friend?The children vampires, Valentina and Bartolome are an excellent addition to the cast of what is turning into a very unique \\"family\\". I was thinking that this sort of village living and loving would be a great thing."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I loved the series. I love how its laid out so you don't have to read from the beginning. I went back and read the beginning book and realized there was still a ton of things she was still talking about that had already happened. Anyway, she gets laid a lot in this one. There is this spell or something french making her really really hungry for love, or blood, or flesh,,, of course the boys are only too eager to help out.I thought the first few books were lacking sex. I mean we are all adults here. And hello? To the people who said \\"Just full of meaningless sex\\" Well let me just say that some meaningless sex might do YOU, some good.LOLBut if you read the books and know the characters it is not meaningless. She sacrifices her virtue to be with them, and in turn the others sacrifice for her right back. This French thing is very powerful and brings her to her knees, everyone is banding together to help out.Laurell K really is in love with her characters. She knows them well, and as I said before if you were paying attention to how Anita has grown and changed not only as a Slayer, but a WOMAN, then you \\"get it\\".Shes been carrying around this terrible hurt and mistrust for a very long time. She's getting over it, (wink)Laurell writes a lot like myself and I just love to see authors that aren't so worried about what everyone else is going to think.Also shes smacking into her sexual peak so hey, give the lady a break will ya LOLNicoel Suzanne"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I stayed up all night reading I just couldn't seem to put it down Laurell K.

I thought this book was great, I couldn't put it down and have read it twice. It's different but hey sometimes you need that in a series story line. Anita is herself but she is opening herself up to different avenues, compromising and accepting change while liking herself. I think that's great. Good bye Richard. (What a whinner.) Jean-Claude is his normal charming self. (Yum) I can't wait for Incubus Dreams if it is like this one I will really enjoy myself."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"...almost all reviewers make it out to be. At least I don't think it deserves the one-star ratings and heavy bashing that it's gotten here. Anita Blake is back and this time she will protect her monster friends from the leaders of the vampire council. This one picks up right where Narcissus in Chains left off. Musette arrives earlier than everyone had anticipated, and she is there to help start out Belle Morte's revenge against the only two men who had dared to walk out on her. Belle Morte is top dog of the vampire council and the most desired woman of all time. She was the one responsible for all the pain and suffering Jean-Claude and Asher endured as sex slaves many centuries ago. She has sent Musette to reclaim Asher -- something that does not sit well with Anita. In order to stop Belle Morte from taking Asher, Anita decides to claim Asher by sleeping with him and Jean-Claude at the same time. Thus, starting a menage a trois not unlike the one the two vampires had many centuries ago with Julianne. Anita might save Asher from Belle Morte, but could she save him from his inferiority complex? To make matters worse, there's a killer werewolf on the loose, an international terrorist is after Anita, Richard has become suicidal, and Anita has to continue to feed the ardeur. There are various twists throughout the novel...As said earlier, the novel isn't as terrible as some of the reviewers make it seem. I for one was entertained. However, there are various things that I did not like about this installment. I didn't like that LKH devoted almost the whole middle part of the novel to metaphysical contacts. LKH centered various chapters on a rather long drive to the Circus of the Damned in which Anita fights the ardeur and has mind conversations with Belle Morte, Richard and the Mother of all Darkness. That was not the highest point in the novel for me, to say the least. And as much as I enjoyed the ardeur in Narcissus in Chains, here it comes across as mere plot filler. I hate to say it, but the subplot centered on the ardeur does come across as a blatant excuse to have Anita sleep with various characters. The ardeur wouldn't have bothered me if it had been remotely relevant to the overall storyline in this novel. And I hate what Hamilton has done with the character Dolph. She's turned him into a bigot. He used to be one of my favorite characters. Oh well, at least Zerbrowski is still a fun character. I won't even deign to comment on Richard. I don't know what to make of the ending. It just seemed rushed. And last but not least, I still don't like Micah. What I do like about this novel is that Asher finally plays a more prominent role in the series. He's become one of my favorite characters. I also got to know Jason in a deeper level. He too is a favorite character of mine. And of course I loved the threesome between Anita, Jean-Claude and Asher. JC and Asher are scrumptiously described in this series and that scene was a real treat. There are of course a few twists and creepy moments in that scene as well. I guess you'd come to expect that from Ms. Hamilton. I also liked the erotic scene between Anita and one of my favorite werewolves. And I finally got to read about Anita doing an assignment as the Executioner. I can't believe it took LKH eleven installments to finally delve deeper into that part of Anita's work. All in all, Cerulean Sins isn't the best Anita Blake book, but it isn't the horrid reading experience I came to expect based on the reviews. I guess the reader will either love it or hate it. The storylines and characters have evolved -- the series would've become boring if it had remained in the same vein as the earlier books. I advise AB fans not to give up on the series. Well, I for one can't wait for the release of Incubus Dreams..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If you like Anita Blake you will love this book.yes, she changes into a completely different person since thefirst book. but like another reviewer said, with so many booksthe characters need to change. would you rather have Anita notdevelop at all? A LOT has happened to Anita since the first book. how could she not change?the sex is great but so is the action. as far as I'm concerned,these books have developed into something wonderful. did people actually not expect Anita to develop into a \\"goddess\\"? it was only a matter of time! she still is kick-ass, but now enjoys sex with many men- so what.I praise LKH and look forward to even more of Anita.since I picked up the first book I have not been able to readanything else- all of the books are great for any true Anita Blake fan!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Okay so Anita isn't all JC's out to get me, I love Richard, vamps are all evil blah blah blah. In fact the character is evolving and becoming more and more 3 dimensional if you will. In fact I like this incarnation of Anita. She's strong and tough and mature. I feel she's grown as a person and is more in touch with the nature of herself and her personality. So what if part of that is that she's more comfortable about sex, it's about time I say!! I liked this book because it shows her dealing with her power and the power of those around her, especially JC. I also can't help but feel that Ms Hamilton is building up to a big bad which means that Anita has to deal with her problems now instead of later.All in all I enjoyed this book. If you're a fan of the series then it's a worthy addition to the line of books. If you're new then I recommend that after reading this book you go back and read all the others.

Be snarky, be a snob, be a prude, be whatever you want, but don't deny that there are some wonderful scenes in this book. I personally happened to love much of the dialoge, and thought there were some great personal developments with the characters. Get off your high horses people. There were touching moments, moments that had you swearing, and moments that were laugh out loud funny. I loved the character interaction, it flowed, and showed new dimensions to character personalities.I think this book excellently sets up future plot turning points and twists, not just for the next book, but in whole scheme of the Anitaverse. It's really hard not to write spoilerish things, so all I can write is: be prepared for the not-so-expected. (what you thought I'd say unexpected? By now I know better than to assume what can or won't happen).Happy readings. rock on."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I should first say that I am a huge fan of the entire Anita Blake series. Having said that it is no wonder why I enjoyed this book so much. It is always great to see characters that you have become attached to come alive within a book. Sometimes the characters don't always act the way you like but that is an exciting aspect of reading one of LKH's books. You are never entirely sure how things will play out. I tried to draw out the reading of this book so that I could savor it, but that was asking the impossible. I certainly enjoyed the book as I believe most of the fans of the series will. I suggest that any new readers to the series begin with the first book, Guilty Pleasures. This way they can see how the characters evolved into the place that they are. I am almost envious of anyone beginning the series because they have a lot to look forward to."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I feel as though folks aren't giving Anita or Laurell the credit they deserve. Remember the person Anita use to be? And why has she changed? Because of her powers growing, because of being in love with two people, because of loosening up and losing control, yet getting stronger and more fierce. I feel like it hasn't turned into porn; it has turned into a gripping storyline which shows us that anything is possible when love, sex and magic are involved.After all, she was wound a bit tight and got less tight once she saw that you have to experience life in the moment. PLUS, the arduer is totally messing with her... that takes away more of her control (which she hates) but thats the way it is... she got sucked into the 'monster' world, slipping in between the lines of being one and just visiting and is on an adventure.I think it's still as gripping and entertaining as in the beginning... it's just gotten more complex.Heck, that's life. It gets complex. And stories should get more interesting, not have the same ol' same ol'."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was disappointed in this book and regret that my first review of an Anita Blake series novel will not be flattering. To offset this, I will revisit the earlier novels and write a more apt review for the series.First off, I found this novel less entertaining than Narcissus In Chains. The plot was weak, non-directional, and did nothing to develop the main characters. The only redeeming quality it had was to leave the door open for future story arcs. This, in and of itself, is something of a weakness also, as it leaves the resolution of the story is somewhat flat.The basic plot of Cerulean Sins does not even follow a previous model, as nothing really happens. Oh, there is the office scene at the beginning with Anita interviewing a rather unsavory client that Bert sent her way. In this case though, there was little follow up to it, even though she initially took the case.There seems to be a lack of focus, almost as if it was rushed to publication, without regards to direction. There is not a good supernatural mystery, as so little time is spent developing the story, almost as if Hamilton was sleepwalking through the composition. This is not to say there isn't a supernatural mystery, it is just that it is more of an afterthought than an important aspect of the plot. There are some new characters but they lack the depth of character development that was present in earlier novels.Overall this was a weak effort on Ms. Hamilton's part. It is perhaps an indication that she is losing interest in this series, or perhaps an indication that she is very busy with her new series. Though I will purchase this book, when it arrives in paperback, I can not honestly recommend this book to anyone but a truly hard core Anita Blake fan, and even then I can only recommend it in the hopes that it is a prequel to a better novel, a deep breath before you plunge in to icy water.Some Plot Items- not really spoilers -Some baddies come to town threatening Jean-Claude's power base.Richard continues in his self-righteous meanderings, but seems bent upon self-destruction.Some people tail Anita.Anita questions herself about her own monstrosity, though not convincingly.Anita gets angry and threatens some people, disregarding the political situation.Edward does not show up.Ronnie does not show upSome more plot items-- may contain spoilers --Sergeant Zebrowski is more professional than Lieutenant Storrs.Anita does not kill a master vampire.Jean Claude begins to come into his own.Asher and Jean Claude are again intimate.Anita is forced to take another partner."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I won't go so far as to say I think this is one of the best in the series, but I will say that it is much better than the last two offerings and that it has renewed my faith in the series itself.If this installment had been like NiC, I would've walked away from the series and quit wasting my time and money. I'm glad to say that after reading Cerulean Sins, I'll be coming back for more. Yay! This makes my fan heart happy.While this title does have flaws, the main criteria by which I judge \\"fun\\" books was met and that is--does it hold my interest? At the end of each chapter am I anxious to read on? The answer? A resounding YES.True, the plot got a bit thin into the meat of the book, and there's still a lot of sex with a lot of folks, but it was believable to me and handled in a way that made it acceptable.And the minimal amount of Micah exposure certainly helps this book.I don't mind sex. I'm not a prude. But it has to be handled tastefully and it has to be believable. Micah was not in the least bit believable.For disheartened fans of the series, I would recommend this book. I think that, in spite of its flaws, this is a great read and offers hope for the future of the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I'm a long-time fan of the Anita Blake world. I relate to the characters (some) and the books have become a comfort-object for me. Nothing makes me happier than taking a bath with bubbles and a couple of Anita Blake books.But NiC and this last one are just not up to par. Below are several spoilers and if you don't want to read them.. well.. don't!This book is mostly about Anita's personal life, just like NiC was, and it's not even a very dangerous personal life anymore. It's all sex. She has sex within the first fifty pages with someone new. Later on, she has more sex with another person she never wanted to have sex with. The mystery, the blood and guts and suspense that I've come to love, isn't really dealt with until the very end of the book.There wasn't very much character development. As the new 'guy' in her scene, I would have thought Micah (I like him!) would be in the thick, but no. The only time you see him is when Anita sends him off on another errand, or when she wakes up from passing out.Out of the new characters introduced, again, not developed, none of them brings out anything new in Anita. Fear, rage, territoriality, some pity. That's it.In conclusion, read the book, if you're a fan of the series. But don't expect too much. We can always hope for an improvement down the line, though."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"First off the sex in this is great, sex wasnt the problem for me in fact its the part that made me finish the book, if your like me and you like some sauce in your reading then the series is starting to deliver in this regard.Unfortunately there is problems, while the series was getting 5 star ratings from me from the start it is taking a slide in the last few books and heres whats losing it for me.* This is probably the main flaw and some of the others stem from this, Anita's powers are getting excessive. The series used to be full of tension and fear and some of the best bits were reading about Anita about to enter a dangerous situation. There are no more dangerous situations anymore and regardless of whats thrown at Anita and her endless powers of necromancy, Lycanphropy and vampirism along with her small army of vampires and wereanimals, Anita will shrug off all challenges with little fuss. If anything manages to survive this onslaught she also happens to be one of the best assasins in the world.* Everyone is in love with her, lusts after her fully and without exception. If there world does not revolve around Anita they are one of the following...- a negligible character and will be killed by Anita in the next few chapters.- A star character in the first few books who crossed Anita and is now suicidal/biggot/tool or all of the above.- Once a big focal point but now are non existant see Larry, building up to a very likeable and strong character, he got involved with another woman besides Anita and is now gone.* I do not like Anita anymore, her personality has taking a tumble along with her silly prudish ways. The men around her would literally take the shoes off her feet and lick them clean yet she always finds reasons to be nasty to them. God help it if any of her friends or lovers deem to stand up against her in any small way, fortunately this is an event that is yet to take place thanks to the frantic bootlicking of the cast.* Micah? Who invited this guy? Why is he here? He seems to serve no actual plot purpose except for maybe a small part of the one book, send him the way of poor Larry now please.*Jeane Claude, noooo what happened to the proud devious calculating vampire of old, whenever Anita needs his advice she retrieves him from her handbag where he is kept, uses him, and places him back for when he is next needed.I havent read Incubus Dreams yet though i shall now astound you with my cunning predictions as to its plot.Anita will beat up the Vampire coucil, steal all there powers and becomes God. Meanwhile Richard finds new ways to be depressed over nothing, Jeanne Claude waits at home till Anita calls for him, Micah justs hangs around doing nothing useful except nod his head approvingly whenever Anita looks his way. After the hiding they received the council join Anita's retinue and take up the cleaning duties around her house as Nathaniel has had a terrible accident after being crushed to death by his hair.Anyway back to Cerulean Dreams - 2 stars to any book that i finish and dont regret reading, and 1 for the hot vampire orgies."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins has the same flaw as Narcissus in Chains: They both lack balance.

Hard to say, even for Anita, and that's just one of the many \\"interesting\\" parts!I have thoroughly enjoyed this series from book one, but this book...this one is something else again...all I can say without spoiling your fun is that I'd suggest you buy the hard copy, because if you've enjoyed the \\"in's and out's\\" of the relationship between Anita and Jean Claude, you'll be reading this one twice. To use an analogy that Ms. Hamilton has used in other ways, this book is like candy, it tastes so good you want to gobble it down, but if you do it won't last long enough!On the more \\"philisophical\\" side, I really enjoy how Laurell K. Hamilton can take the most outrageous situations, and through Anita's self-analysis, make us take a look at our own selves (even if truth sometimes seems rather mundane compared to fiction!); our morals and values, our individuality, our levels of security and vulnerability when it comes to how others view us, and the lines we all draw in our own sand that circumstances and feelings may make us question at a later date. She makes US think, as we read Anita's thought processes, about how we live with who we are...the good parts, the not-so-good parts, and all that lies in between. Whether we'd cross the lines that Anita does or not is not the question, for many of her choices are based on purely fictional \\"stuff\\". On its own however, to be able to look at one's self as directly as Anita does is a very revealing process, if you allow yourself to go that deeply into who you are and what you are about. Even if you're not into thinking that hard about yourself, observing Anita's personal dilemmas is interesting, entertaining, and allows us to harmlessly fantasize about being a \\"little naughty\\"!If you're looking at this for a first time peek at the Anita Blake series, don't start here...give yourself the treat of starting with the first book and proceed from there.

Her prose seems to have gone down the tubes compared to the punch-packing flow of the earlier stories.

Poor Jean-Claude and Richard. I can't continue to support a series that continues to destroy what was once a very exciting premise. What are the problems? Several but mostly, the mystery is missing and the days of waiting for a new book are gone. Good luck to you Ms. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I must agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is not worth your time. In the beginning of the series we got a good supernatural murder mystery, some great character building and interaction, great fight scenes, witty dialogue,and some good supernatural politics. Anita was much more \\"real\\" than she has become and thus this series has lost my interest. I own the first 8 books in the series, but have used the library for the last two books and I am so glad. I used to recommend this series to friends, but would no longer do so."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I thought book 10, NIC, was an anomaly ...NOPE, shear suckage. If you didn't like 10, don't bother with anything else.The author continues to trash this series, we have the Vampire Humper meets the Hardback Whore. Kinda reminds me of some concerts when the the guitarist smashes his instrument at the end of the concert ... you know that thing will never whisper, or scream, a sweet note again. Yep, that is the fate of Anita Blake, nothing worthwhile will every be produced again.What a pity.I strongly recommend you try something by any of the following authors instead: Charlaine Harris (I love her Shakespeare series), Jim Butcher, Wen Spencer, Patricia Briggs, Rebecca Bradley, Lilith Saintcrow, Rob Thurman, Tanya Huff, Lois McMasters Bujold.Life's too short to read crap.RIP Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurel Hamilton is a great author.

She now has the complete set thanks to Amazon. Definitely have to be a reader of vampire stories to enjoy these but they are a great set. We are already looking forward to future releases in this series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"\\"Most people don't find me funny at all.\\"The book starts as most Anita Blake novels do: in Anita Blake with a gentleman who wants to hire her to raise a family member. She sets up an appointment, then heads off for a zombie raising. While she is there, she learns that Musette, a vampire representing Belle Morte is in town. Anita Blake hurries over with Jean-Claude and Asher, to speak with her. Meanwhile, murders are happening in St. Louis, apparently from a shapeshifter.It's sad, because amidst all the sex (the act of it, talking about it, prepping for it), arguing about vampire politics, arguing about werewolf politics, posturing contests, misogyny, and bad fashion shows, there IS a good story. The zombie raising at the beginning of the novel (while barely, by a tenuous, subtle thread, connecting to the \\"main\\" plot--whatever that is) was one of the best in the series. I felt, for the first time in this series, that I had a clear idea of what Anita did and how she did it. The shapeshifter murder mystery isn't half-bad. And for probably the first time in the entire 11 book run (that I remember--and for a book about a vampire hunter, that seems a bit odd), Anita actually gets a Court Order of Execution and IS the Executioner (she even gets a delightfully cheesy one-liner that Arnold Schwarzenegger would have been proud of). And then we have probably my favorite character (at the moment), Jason. While a lot of the other characters have made sudden, startling changes, Jason is pretty much the same guy. And he also calls Anita out on some of the plot holes that have bugged me from the third book--namely, why Anita even bothered to date Jean-Claude in the first place.If you take the above items into account, \\"Cerulean Sins\\" (which doesn't refer to any building, but apparently the memo everyone got to wear Cerulean Blue) is actually better than \\"Narcissus in Chains\\". I mean, CS did have a plot; it hasn't been THAT long since I finished NiC, and I can't give you a plot summary to save my life. But in many ways, this book is just as bad as the previous books.Anita Blake might as well rename herself \\"Mary Sue\\". I've forgotten how many titles she has to her name now: Nimi-ra, Animator, Necromancer, Jean-Claude's human servant, succubus, Federal Marshall, etc. I've forgotten how many men are lining up to get into her bed: Jean-Claude, Asher, Jason, Nathaniel, Micah, Zerbrowski, etc. I've forgotten how many times she's been a hypocrite, demanding to be called \\"Ms. Blake\\" but not respecting a woman's CHOICE to be called something other than \\"Ms.\\". And despite Anita's comments about being a \\"feminist\\", she reveals her misogyny constantly by calling herself a \\"girl\\" while calling males \\"men\\":\\"If I'd have been a man, I'd have let it go, but I was a girl, and girls poke at things more than men.\\"Not to mention, Anita seriously needs to check into the hospital. I didn't bother to count the times she had difficulty breathing and other delightful problems:\\"I was blushing so hard, my head was beginning to hurt.\\"\\"...I felt like the only thing keeping my pulse in my mouth was the tight line of my lips.\\"I kept my mouth closed; I was afraid of what would fall out if I opened it.\\"The other thing that is really obnoxious about Anita is how full of herself she is. She spends paragraphs about things that she obviously thinks are very pithy and smart:\\"I think that's why dogs are so [darned] popular. You can cuddle a dog as much as you like, and the dog never thinks about sex or pushing your social boundaries in anyway. Unless you happen to be eating. Dogs will invade your social boundaries for table scraps unless trained to do otherwise.\\"\\"Guns don't care if you're psychically gifted; guns don't care about anything. They don't b**** at you about the rules in your life, either. Of course, neither does a dog. But I don't have to use a pooper scooper after I'm through shooting my gun.\\"\\"Sometimes love makes you selfish; sometimes it makes you stupid; sometimes it reminds you of why you love your gun.\\"Sane happy people don't hack their hair off at home with scissors. Cutting your hair like that is usually a substitute for hurting yourself in other, more permanent ways. Any counselor will tell you that.\\"\\"It didn't matter. Nothing mattered. Because for anything to matter, I could not have gone back into that room. I had to go back into that room, so nothing mattered.\\"What is probably most groan-worthy is the silly plot device that \\"forces\\" Anita to have sex, the \\"ardeur\\". Anita has to feed it every 12 hours or she will die. This leads to a large portion of the novel dedicated to sex, relationships, who is going to have it with whom, and so on and so forth. It bugs me that this \\"ardeur\\" basically strips Anita of her choice in the matter; if it is supposed to be a metaphor for women's sexuality, it fails.Other than Jason, I didn't care for any of the other characters. Pretty much all of them have been reduced to their one attribute and nothing more. Asher whines about being ugly; Richard whines about being a monster; Dolph suddenly gets all aggressive and offensive to Anita, when before he had been nothing but professional. Nathaniel is creepy and disgustingly submissive. And Jean-Claude continues to parade the bad fashion that makes this book a riot to read.Because it is an Anita Blake book, I need to talk about the fashion disasters in this book. By this point, I tend to ignore all the endless descriptions of clothing. But there were a few that tickled my funny bone (and I doubt that was the author's intent):\\"[Jean-Claude] was wearing skin-tight leather pants, tucked into thigh-high boots so it was hard to tell where the pants left off and the boots began.\\"\\"The hair was like a living accessory. For a moment, I thought [Jean-Claude] was wearing leather pants, until I realized the black boots ran up the entire length of his leg. He was wearing black pants, but they were barely visible.\\"Probably the best part, in that unintentionally hilarious way, is the writing. I've said it before; Hamilton's writing has never been high-brow quality, but some of the zingers here are particularly painful:\\"Asher was afraid. I could taste his fear on the back of my tongue. I could swallow it, enjoy the bouquet of it, like a fine wine to whet the appetite.\\"Jason lowered us both into the water. It felt wonderful so warm...Jason moved me gently in the water...The warm water was so warm, so warm.\\"\\"He ate those sounds straight from my mouth, as if he were tasting my screams.\\"And my absolute personal favorite!\\"The room was red. Red as if someone had painted all the walls crimson. But it wasn't an even job of painting. It wasn't just red or crimson, but scarlet, ruby, brick red where it had begun to dry. A color so dark, it was almost black, but it sparkled red like a garnet.\\"I am almost nostalgic for the early Anita Blake books. Anita wasn't nearly so aggressive, there was a plot (or twenty) and some pretty interesting action scenes. It seems the books now are just Anita being hostile, sex, boring politics, and a hasty mystery wrapup.Classic Anita Blake fans, the ones turned off by Narcissus in Chains, are probably not going to enjoy this. Newcomers to Anita Blake are going to be completely lost amidst intricate, overly complicated, silly paranormal creature politics. And if you were ever hesitant about the series, I sincerely doubt this book is going to win you over.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Whilst I throughly enjoyed it I was hoping for more character development than what was given."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I started with this author a little differently than most others. I am a big fan of fantasy/science fiction and I was really looking forward to the Merry Gentry novels. I read all of them and I really liked the idea, but there was just way too much sex. It seemed like she was making up outrageous scenarios just to include more sex. I started the Anita Blake series and at first I thought they would be better. The first novels were not all about Anita and her sex life. Then I hit Blue Moon. Half of that book was nothing but outrageous situations for Anita to have sex, especially that horrible munin thing. Obsidian Butterfly was better, although a little boring and too much detail spent on things that just were not important or interesting. Then the rest of the series so far has been sex, sex, sex. There is nothing wrong with sex, but like others have stated, if that is what I wanted to read I would pick up some of the cheap romance books out there. Some of them involve supernatural creatures too but they don't pretend to be anything but porn novels. Hamilton's books are getting to be like that. It seems like she is trying to create a story just to write in the sex scenes. It doesn't work and this is the last novel I will be reading until she writes one where sex isn't the main focus. I have read many reviews in different places about these books trying to figure out if the rest of the series gets better and it doesn't appear that it does. I feel like the author is trying to make her fans angry and just keeps including more of the things people don't really like."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The book starts with Anita raising a Zombie. Very imaginative, very surreal, very cool.Mussette shows up uninvited and Anita's cavalry arrives, it was so intense when all the were animals showed up. And the writer does such a great job at reminding us about the details of each pack. I just knew things were gonna turn in our favor when they showed.I totally got the title but I'm not gonna spoil it, all I can say is poor Asher I feel so sorry for him, seeing his scarred face and body and seeing Jean Claude perfectness and all the power around them that Asher can never have. But the things Anita says about him makes him more wonderful to me.I very much enjoyed the new and improved Anita, she doesn't question her every move anymore. I feel like she is trusting her instincts at all times now which is refreshing.I can't help but wonder where does Nathaniel's thick auburn hair goes when he shapeshifts? We may never find out...When Richard helped Anita push Belle Mortes mark away I felt that destiny keeps bringing them together and I feel the same way Anita does, just when I thought I was over him he comes back looking better and even with all his demons I just love him and I understand why she can't stop loving him.I cannot comprehend the change in Dolph, he was one of my favorite characters and this book made me almost hate him.I am glad the dinner at Jean Claude's didn't happen because eating in the floor would have been so humiliating for the shifters.I also wonder if we will ever find out why the stairs down the circus of the damned are so wide?"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have read all of L.K.H.'s vampire series, aside from Obsidian, but this is by far the best. It has been a while since L.K.H. has progressed this storyline, and now she has left it open to go in so many directions. I received the first book in her series as a fluke, and now I can not imagine having never read them. I can't wait for the next installment."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I pretty much tore through the early Anita Blake novels and enjoyed them immensely. Cerulean Sins was a bit of a disappointment for me. The graphic sex has been stepped up a notch and the mystery/thriller/story line component has been stepped down a notch. I still enjoyed it, but I hope the trend doesn't continue--graphic sex novels are a dime-a-dozen, good vampire thrillers are a much rarer commodity."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I love this series and Cerulean Sins has exceeded my expectations. Laurell's books are always fast paced, page turners. How many times can you say that about such a long series. No book drags they keep you entertained page after page. Not even Stephen King can say that anymore. He just rambles on and on. Thankfully that's not Laurell's way. I only wish she wrote faster and bigger books. Write Laurell, write!I highly recommend all this author's books. If you've never ready anything by her go purchase the entire series now. Believe me you will be rabid for the next book after you read the first one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The turmoil and angst that we've come to expect of Anita continues. The book was a good new edition, but not my favorite so far. It was very sexually based with only a small part going to Anita's professional life as an animator/necromancer and detective. We do get to see the executioner in action, which was a nice surprise, but are otherwise caught in a soap opera of personal anxiety and indecision. The good news? Anita learns something about herself from a surprising source. I enjoyed the book, as always, and didn't want it to end, but was looking for a little more than I got out of it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laruell K. Hamilton writes the sexiest and most interesting vampires, vampire hunters, werewolves, and other preternatural characters in the business.Cerulean Sins, like the other recent additions to the Anita Blake series, focuses more on developing Anita's relationship with her men and less on solving external mysteries. Although the triumverate keeps growing stronger, there are still bigger baddies out there. The relationships between the main characters and continually growing supporting cast get even more complicated.New readers of the series will probably want to start with The Killing Dance or something published before that. Otherwise, it's harder to understand and appreciate the plot/character development that happens in this book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins finds Anita Blake back at work as an animator. She's also been given federal marshal status, so she's back on the job. For those who found Anita's last outing to be too constrained, this is really good news. The plot of an Anita Blake book always seems better when Anita is balancing work with the more supernatural aspects of her life.Mussette, one of Belle Morte's lieutenants, has arrived unexpectedly for a visit with the Master of the City. Before long, Anita and her preternatural friends are up to their eyelids in vampire politics. At the same time, Anita has to come to grips with her feelings for Asher, a new string of brutal murders, a coworker who is losing his grip, the problem of the local Ulfric, the definition of sex, and a group of assassins in the city. Quite a bit to juggle in one book, but Hamilton succeeds well. The weirdness just never stops when you're Anita Blake.I found this to be a much better, more involving book than Narcissus in Chains, and would have rated it at four and a half stars if it were possible."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After Narc. in Chains I was reluctant to buy another Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Book, but figured I'd give LKH the benefit of having at least 1 bad book. I should have stayed with my instincts and left this book on the shelf, I was happy to give my copy away to get it out of my sight.Put Anita Blake out of her misery, the series is dragging on with no end in sight and no plot or character development worth reading.The introduction of new characters has not been well thought out, new the characters are not very well written or very interesting.LKH's Publisher should put a stake through the next novel and kill the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I hope that this is the last in the series and it seems to be. The Anita Blake series has been a wonderful ride and we believe in her world - a Laurell K. Hamilton speciality. However, as far as story arcs go - geez! Anita ends up as a succubus (she needs the sex kids or things go south), Jean Claude is losing his cool factor and poor Richard is down right suicidal.Then again, perhaps she is planning on writing another book. I just hope it's better than this one, because using explicit sex as plot points does not make for the best of stories."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If this series keeps on as it is, Anita's ego is going to have to have its own book. To be so short, she spends half of her time bossing people around. Her sex drive has gotten to stupid levels, she will almost do it anywhere with anybody. I am still trying to understand why Micah (one of anita's many boyfriends) was added to the cast. He just another one of the many yes men in Anita's world. In the beginning this book was so dry that i had to force myself to read it. In the end I was angry that i had. The plot was too predicable and too packed, there was too many crisis's happening at the same time to really be able to enjoy the book. If you want a good read, read the Southern vampire series, it is delightful."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Honestly!!! all i read about in the anita blake stories is sex sex sex, that and tortured, cut up bodies, not to mention really BAD french.

Her series has grown and changed; it has gotten progressively finer. Writing this I consider it an oxymoron, bearing in mind, her first book was one of the best I've ever read. With her newest book, she has continued the tradition. Anita Blake is a tough, savvy, character. Her most recent role as guardian in the story is a role I enjoyed immensely. While some people might be disappointed because the newest book has continued in the vein of the last few books I believe that Hamilton has just begun to plumb the depths of this winning streak. Of any author I have ever read Hamilton is the most capable of bring the characters and the very story to life. The story is so life like we can almost see the blood fly."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've gotten so caught up in this series it should be a crime. The gradual evolution of the main character, and the richness of the supporting characters makes this a hard series to ignore."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita's come a long way since we met her in Guilty Pleasures. Her moral high ground is not so very high anymore - some might argue she's even standing in a small hole she dug all by herself...Anita will do anything she has to do to help her friends, even if it means sacificing some of her own morals. But the way she's going, soon she won't have many morals left. Like she says herself: she's becomming a good little sociopath... But if you read the books in the right order you understand why she's becomming what and who she is. It all seems so very logical at the time she makes her decisions. And she knows she's being really unfair to the men in her life.And yet they keep hanging on...Although the books changed a lot since the first one, I still love them, always looking forward to the new one."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"LKH does it again. Thank goodness for an author who can consistenly put out interesting books, each with a new spin. Lately it seems that authors with series just keep spitting out the same book over and over again.Of course, even if it was the same book over and over again, the main character would make it worthwhile, she's a necromancer and succubus with a leopard beast inside her. How awesome is that!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Unlike some others, i think the \\"evolution\\" of Anita Blake is interesting. I think a number of her supporting cast try to \\"get inside her head\\" in this one and I think it opens her up as a character. I came out feeling like her knew her better than before and with more understanding of the complexity of her character.Yes, there is some sex (which I never minds esp when it's with Jean Claude) and some of the time it's with guys she doesn't love. If that bothers you, you might not like this one too much. But, as usual, I almost couldn't put the book down and my sleep suffered for a night or two. (I might have ignored my kids a few times too!!)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I found the book interesting because of the ongoing internal conflict of Anita. It is nice to find a vampire novel in which the main character is not the vampire but the adjacent. The outside view this gives makes us mortals understand, somewhat, internal organization in this society.If you are looking for a real woman with problems and lots of guys worshiping her, you really have to read Anita Blake. If anyone says that they would not jump into her shoes if given the option they are most probably lying.It has several underlaying plots going on at the same time, the one that jumps to our eyes might not be the best one in the book; search deep and you'll find intrigue, love-hate relationships, loss of love or obsession; Wait this is all on the main plot!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have ready all of the Anita Blake Series so far.

This has been responsible for Richard losing Anita. I, personally, would like to grab him and say, \\"Get over it!!!\\" Anita's relationship with Asher has further complicated her life, but what a complication!!I have titled this review \\"Doubly Pleased,\\" because whenever possible, I purchase the audio books of my favorite authors. I purchased the tapes of \\"Narcissus in Chains,\\" and was very disappointed in the editing/chopping that was done to the story. Characters and scenes disappeared. The audio CD of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" is well done, and worth every penny. Hopefully Ms. Hamilton will have \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" recorded again. I wish that she would have all of her previous books recorded.I recommend \\"Cerulean Sins\\" to all of Ms. Hamiltons readers. You will not be disappointed.

Unlike the last book, Narcissus in Chains, this one is about Vamp politics, not shifter politics. Unlike Burnt Offerings, it wasn't edited with a weedwacker. Rather, it is smaller (400 pgs hardcover -- substantial but not mammoth) and much *tighter* on the plotlines.This one moves forward with the Vampire Council/Belle Morte plotline, and does so very nicely. Also, a lot of attention is paid to Asher and Dolph and Jason, as well as Anita herself. There was a lot less of the &quot;Anita gets a new power this chapter&quot; stuff that has been in the last couple, though a few new things pop up. Lots of good developments on the Asher/Richard/JC/Anita front, and some insightful therapy for Anita from, of all people, Jason.This is the best of the recent books, as LKH seems to be blending very nicely with her editor in this outing. And the introduction of Belle Morte &amp; the new baddie -- sweet.The Dolph plotline is *very* interesting for how little screen time Dolph gets.This is easily my favorite entry since Bloody Bones which is my very favorite. But I am a bit biased as I am all-over tired of the Richard/shapeshifter angst. On the otherhand, Richard is very loatheable in this book, so I was happy there too!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The moment LKH ventures into major character development some of her so-called fans call it \\"porn\\". Give me a break. I have given it four stars because it is lacking in the action/mystery department. I think that many who have read the rest of the series were in no way surprised by the sex in this latest installment. All the signs pointed to Anita loosing control. It has been one of her greatest fears. The fact that sex and magick have been linked to Anita's self control makes perfect sense. I am however, waiting for some very interesting side stories considering how much was revealed and sometimes hinted at, by the supporting characters. Every author deserves to have a few books that are not considered top notch by everyone. True fans don't leave when this happens and even bad stories have some redeeming quality. Time is only wasted when these qualities are overlooked."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"now dont get me wrong....there is nothing wrong with a little smut and sex to liven up a book. i started this series loving the plots, action, and yes even a bit of sex. the later books i didnt love but i at least liked them. this book was awful. anita has no time to solve crimes, weld weapons, or have interesting conversations. she now only has time for having sex, thinking about sex, or talking about sex with a variety of partners. anita blake used to be one of the best female characters around, now i hope hamilton will decide to kill her off quickly and painfully. at least as painful as it was to read!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I broke with tradition and read this book FIRST . . . and I couldn't wait to read the others to catch up on all the details and intrigue, then I read it again and enjoyed it all the more!!Extremely well written, complex, and utterly captivating.

And I do not believe it is \\"porn\\" as written in other recommendations by narrow -minded , disapproving stiffs.

Anita's life was so much simpler when she could just shoot something and make things better.***** With every new book, Anita Blake's romantic life gets a little more complicated. Each book in this series gets more fascinating. Though Anita breaks all the rules and sets up her own, it all makes a certain kind of sense. The characters continue to grow in depth and complexity. The only missing thing is Edward. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The story - ho hum.As a confirmed English geek, I just could not help picking up my red pencil and correcting spell-checking errors! At least, I HOPE they were spell-checking errors and not errors in usage. Either way, these issues should have been caught during proofing and editing: scene/seen, born/borne, etc."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"For all those fans out there, like me, who was hooked from the start and buy the books just to see what new mayhem ANITA has created there is little i can say about Cerulean sins other than:Anita is still the baddest person in the Valley of Death and not even the Vampire Council showing up again can truly put her down for long. She has come into her power at last and has a sizeable powerbase to fall back on- Vampires (Her personal servant Damien), various werecreatures: not just the pack but also pards, roderes and whatever the pack of WereHyenas are called. So buy the book to find out how the story unfolds on the standard Anita Blake storyline: Monsters, death and the supernatural."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins was one of the best Anita Blake books. Many people say that Anita has changed for the worse, but if she never changed, then the series would be over by now. There is a moderate amount of sex in the book, but it ties in with the story nicely. This is the best series I have ever read, and it just keeps getting better."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've read every single Anita Blake book since the first one, which came out when I was a sophomore in high school. I must say, as a graduate of a Catholic school, I'm certainly glad she wasn't having this much sex then! :-) Now that I'm older, I don't mind at all.A lot of people read this book and just saw the sex, but I seemed to notice a transition or a bridge. I like the addition of new \\"warrior\\" characters to draw the attention away from just using sex for power, and showing other power avenues. I think it can be a good change for the way the series has been going. I just hope it's really going there, and not into just more sex.Because, honestly, at this rate, Anita might run out of people to *be* with."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As much as I like the way Laurell Hamilton writes I've started to avoid reading her work. I'm not a prude, but I don't think scenes that are steamier than what could be found in the 'dirty books' section of the drug store (that's where you snuck off to when I was 13) add tons to the plot, or to the character development. A little is good, but a lot just becomes tedious. With Cerulean Sins out in paperback I decided it was time to test the water again.For 135 pages I thought I was in luck. Hamilton builds a story line about the unexpected visit of a group of European vampires who are the emissaries of Belle Morte, one of the oldest vampires on the grand council and maker of both Asher and Jean Claude. There's a lot of \\"who gets to torture who\\" as the intricate politics and backstabbing of vampire society are laid bare (bad joke!) for the reader. But Musette and her cohorts are at least interesting as they try to work Belle Morte's revenge on her wayward children.The other subplot is a series of murders that leave people looking like hamburger patties. Anita's issues with Dolph, the head of the preternatural investigatory team, come to a head as his hatred of occult creatures boils over. This is a bit of a shame, since Dolph and Zerbrowski, another detective, add what little human dialogue there is in recent volumes in this series.This brings us to page 135, where we discover that the emotional triangle between Jean-Claude, Asher, and Anita (I'm not counting Anita's other bed partners) is going to become physical, and Anita's frequent state of arousal is the basis for a large part of the plot. One has to wonder what the next volume will have to offer in the way of erotic violence, since Hamilton seems compelled to escalate the titillation.Between the bedroom theatrics, there is actually a good book here. Or rather, good as I measure good - complex plot, rising suspense, strong characters, etc. In a way it recalls some of the earlier Anita Blake books where the necromancer did less romancing and more raising of the dead. Cerulean Sins really is better balanced than some recent efforts so, perhaps, this signals that Hamilton hasn't given up writing horror stories."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I knew this book would probably take a while to come out in paperback, so I went ahead and got it. Boy, was it good! I discovered the series last year and probably read the first ten books in about 5-6 months. Like so many series out there, I was afraid that Hamilton may have lost touch with the series in this current book, but I was blown away (Let's face it. Anyone that can keep a series alive and kicking after 10 books has got some major talent). Just when you think she couldn't make the series any richer she goes and does it again. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in something with mystery, a little humor and supernatural elements all in one. I think Hamilton deserves a standing ovation for the latest book in the Anita Blake series. Buy it. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I only recently found Anita Blake and have eagerly devoured the first 10 books. I loved the character of Anita, very real and true to life...until now. With this book it seems as though Anita has transformed from a person with some type of standards and some type of line she won't cross, to one who has nothing at all to stand on. How does one go from being with one man in her lifetime to 5 or more sex partners with one session being four men at a time? I would think a transitional period would be in here somewhere. I feel as though the author went through some sexual transformation and instead of taking Anita along, just jumped to the end. So we have the good Anita and the naughty Anita. No in between.I doubt that I will finish this series now. I just don't think it will be worth my time anymore."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I love the Anita Blake series. However, and I've seen other people comment on this same thing, it's losing some of it's originality by becoming exactly like her Merry Gentry series. I like both series and don't mind the sex but the Anita Blake series started out as a strong woman who kicks (...)type of story and now it's more of a strong woman who is a (...)story. I wish she would move back away from it, although I don't see that happening with the direction these books seem to be going. It was nice to have the (...)kicking series and the naughty series as it showed different sides of her writing. I still like the book, but just be warned if you are looking for an action book that this has action, but alot of it isn't the type you are looking for."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have recently finished reading Cerulean Sins and I have to say it isn't bad at all. I read several of the reviews from this site before deciding to purchase the book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a good, quick read. Anita Blake has evolved alot since Book one. But then again so has all the other characters. Anita's morals have done a complete 180 and she points this out much to her dismay. She seems more frail now because she is at odds with what she's become but she still manages to remain the strong female character that I love to read about. Also, Richard was not suicidal in this story as a previous reviewer stated. He may not have cared whether he lived or died but he didn't actively try to kill himself. His lack of calling for help, I saw as a deeper sacrifice to save his pack because if he had called them he could have killed them due to Belle Mortes' influence. By the end of the story he cares once more and he and Anita manage to have a somewhat civilized conversation. Talk about progress. Jean-Claude and Asher have both grown as well. I'm glad they have gained in power and in understanding.All in all it was a good read. I'd definitely recommend this to any avid Hamilton reader."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Well I have all the books for this series and all I can think of is how far the series has sunk.From the start the series was excellant with a great storyline but the last 3 books have been for the most part trashy sex novels.While this novel was a bit better then the last two I will NOT be buying the next book in this series until I read it from the library as my money is limited and I cannot and will not waste it on a bad book or a series that has become bad.To the author I say this.Get back to writing the story and bring back the mystery but please stop using the sex as filler.If you are having problems getting to the x number of words you are supposed to have for the novel then take a break and delay it for a year or two. I would rather have a novel of the past quality I know you can do rather then a roll of toilet paper that most of the last 3 books for the series have been."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Like the last reviewer, I was a big fan of the orignial books. One after the other they have disintegrated into utter nonsense. The characters were cool and individual. Now they all clump into one big mass of silliness. And I no longer care about Anita. This was my last book. I thought the last one was my last, but I decided to give it one more chance. And what I've read of the next book bodes ill. So nope. They all went to goodwill and I've a whole row on my library shelf to devote to a new author. Like Susan Sizemore or Tanya Huff. Jeeesh, Christine Freehan is starting to look good."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita has become something of a sexpot in recent books, much to her chargin. She hates the slippery slope her morals are on but is forced to go around them in order to stay alive. This was made apparent, to a sickening degree, in Narcissus in Chains, the previous Anita book. In this one, the moral ambuiguity she is losing herself in becomes more ambiguous. But what this book does is set up the next one. By hinting at a threat that is not addressed directly, Blake is set up for one of her biggest confrontations. One that is likely to either bring her into total depravity or that will free her from the moraly mucky-muck that she's become wrapped up in and let her be herself again.Certainly, not the best Anita book (that was Blue Moon). But not the worst either. You just have to be willing to look a little deeper."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Ok, I love Hamilton's books. Her creativity is boundless, and her characters fly off the pages. But this book was so one-dimentional and I was really dissapointed. I gave it two stars because even though it's kind of a let-down, it still manages to nudge the story along and you should read it if you want to keep up with the series. But it's a total \\"filler\\" book. There is tooooo much pointless sex, (most of which is totally pointless to the story). Enough with the ARDEUR crap! If Hamilton wants to write porn, she should just get on with that. And don't get me wrong, I totally love good sex scenes, but in this book they took over to the detriment of a decent story line. Hamilton's signature preternatural crime hook suffered badly here, becoming almost an afterthought to the Anita's being in constant heat. I mean phleaz! Get the woman a vibrator already...."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been a fan of the Anita Blake series for three years now, and enjoyed all of them up until \\"Narcissus in Chains.\\" Because of this, I decided to give \\"Cerulean Sins\\" a chance. Surely, I thought, it was possible for the series to bounce back.Unfortunately, \\"Cerulean Sins\\" falls farther down the sinkhole established in \\"Narcissus in Chains.\\"Complaint the First: There are an extremely large number of run-on sentences and comma splice errors. I don't know why, unless this was rushed into publication hot off the press, which I suppose is possible. They distracted me from reading the book and made it extremely hard to finish at all.Complaint the Second: The sex scenes are more numerous and have even less point than in \\"Narcissus in Chains.\\" There were several that had true potential, but tapered off into simple repetition. Where is the woman who at the beginning of the series refused even to sleep with a human whom she didn't know well? Dead, I suppose.Complaint the Third: Belle Morte appears, briefly, as truly threatening, only to turn out to be a pawn of an even more powerful vampire. This is a trick Hamilton keeps pulling, and it has long since worn thin. Unless the next book somehow manages to end with Anita's death, one knows that the powerful vampire will be defeated and Anita will live on, though probably with added angst. It robs the book of all suspense.Complaint the Fourth: All the males in the book, with the exception of Richard, now worship Anita. This deprives many of them, including Asher and Jason, of most of their personalities. When other characters cease to exist save as shadows around the hero, then I want to read a different series.I think I stuck with this series for so long because it was one of the few examples of dark fantasy I know of. But there are others. Try \\"Kushiel's Dart\\" by Jacqueline Carey, or (at least the first book of) the Black Jewels Trilogy by Anne Bishop. They go more firmly towards the fantasy side of things, being set in other worlds, but the darkness is blended with the world and intensified, and every motion of the characters has a point."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell really delivers in this the 11th installment of her Anita Blake series. It has been years since I found a series of books as enjoyable as Ms. Blake's romps through the Anitaverse are, Laurell has breathed life into old favorite myths of vampires, were-wolves, zombies, and all sorts of other legendary creatures. This book is action-packed, a great read that literally grabs you by the throat and pulls you along, you'll be up far into the night, the twists concerning lovely Asher, and cute Jason, are well worth the long wait. Her attention to details never falters, and all the red herrings are well placed, as usual. I love stories that surprise me (there are so few), and Laurell does a fantastic job. I have also read \\"Incubus Dreams\\", and would love to review it, if I could just get amazon.com to allow it!! Maybe I will wait until September 28, and then there will be a format for it, but just as a hint, number 12 is absolutely smashing good fun, loaded with action, sex, humor, and some new characters who may be around for a while."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I like a good sex/romance scene as much as anyone but I also like a story to go with it. The so-called plot of this book seemed thrown together around Anita's ever-widing pool of sex partners. I was very disappointed in this latest book. I hope that LKH gets her heroine and her storyline back on track soon."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I found Cerulean Sins the best so far in the Anita Blake books, The plot was well thought-out and also answered many question I had about what had happened to all the characters in previous books. Not only does the writing seem more mature, but Anita herself seems to be more mature. As always, this book has prompted me to get out all the others in the series and re-read them...and I can't wait for the next! Ms. Hamilton has left me wondering what comes next in the weird but wonderful world of Anita Blake and her many monster loves and enemies."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After reading what other's thought of this book, I will accept their opinions, because they did have some valid thoughts. But what I have been getting out of the last few books is that Anita is starting to grow up. As a person grows up and matures, so do their values and morals. Anita can't help what she is, the most powerful necromancer seen...ever. I want to see Anita marry the 4th mark with JC and marry Micah in real life. I did think that the aduer popping up all the time was a little repetative, but its now somthing that she has to deal with and has to controll, and it's somthing to be used against her in a metaphysical way. I like the sex. Anita getting hammered all the time makes the story that much more consuming because she was a prude, and that was somthing I didn't like about her in the first half of the series. If I had a harem of men that practically worshipped the ground I walked on, I think I would be having fun with them too. Just like the last 10 books, this one was spectacular, and I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Well, if you are already up to book number 11 in this series then I can assume you have met and feel as though you know all the essential characters. In CS Anita is far from the no nonsense-vampires-are-bad type of gal we know her to be in GP. Jean Claude and Asher get a suprise visit from Belle Morte's right hand. This little predicament opens doors for new relationships. Damian fans be prepared to be teased mercilessly!! Hamilton only minutely covers the connection between Anita and the thousand year old red-headed hotty!! Jason is his usual witty,charismatic self but even Jason is surprised when Anita's \\"fire\\" engulfs both of them. Anita Blake Fans will love this book. It still has Anita's wit. Her sharp tongue and fast draw. Its still filled with our familiar sexy heroes and it introduces a couple of new villains sure to make your skin crawl. Fans of Hamiltons other works will see a slight resemblance between Anita and Merry Gentry. But fear not Anita may encompass some of Merry's heat but she'll still pull her Browning and put a bullet between your eyes. All in all...read it. You'll thank me."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"If I wanted to read porn I would buy porn. I expected this to be a good mystery like the earlier ones and really regret buying the whole series at once just because the first 2 books were so good. The last book was nothing but sex scenes and this one is worse because now Anita is doing the nasty with everyone in sight and having orgies with Jean Claude and Asher. What is really weird is the beginning. A hitman comes to her office wanting her to raise a dead person for him. You assume this is the main plot but I'm nearly at the end and I haven't read anything more about him since the beginning. Also the review here mentions the two murders...well, that was good for about 4 or 5 pages but that's about it. I'm determined to finish the series since I bought them all ahead of time, but this author has turned into a real disappointment. The author says somewhere on here that she doesn't read the reviews about her books. How arrogant! And how stupid! She might learn what her readers are wanting if she did!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This is the second offering by Hamilton I've read...I will admit the first offering I read was her short story included in Cravings-I was simply awful. Cerulean Sins was my attempt to give the author a second chance to come up to snuff (several people suggested I read some of Hamilton's work). Well, it took nearly 2 hours to read 82 pages...the reading was slow, silly, and boring. I thought the heroine (read whinny Anita) was just a spoiled-I-want-everything-my-way brat. How could powerful master vampires put up with that kind of stuff??I would advise the author to exercise rewriting her stories before she sends them to the publisher...200 hundred of the 500+ pages were not needed."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"With the Obsidian Butterly and Narcissus in Chains, I felt Hamilton was going totally off-road. The character development was skewed (Edward with a family? Puh-lease.) and plotting was submerged in favour of kinky sex scenes.In Cerulean Sins, Hamilton comes back to the police and necromancer work that first got me interested in the character of Anita Blake. Although I feel the serial killer sub-plot and the Belle Morte primary plotline should have been reversed, it was still a step in the right direction in returning to the mystery foundation of the series.That said, I was very disappointed that I didn't get to witness the ancestor raising Anita scheduled in the first few pages. The intriguing client disappears and is never seen again in this book. If it was a tease for a future appearance, it was irritating and unfair to the reader. I knew Hamilton was a good enough writer that she would tie up that loose end, but the even the tie was weak. The book could have started at the cemetary and been the better for it.In this reader's opinion, Anita needs to pare down her life and Hamilton could help by paring down the characters. Asher (while interesting) is an unneeded distraction as is the addition of more sexual entanglements. As for Richard, I know he's there as the love she can never truly have (an example of what happens when compromise is required but seemingly unattainable), but his self-loathing is getting to be a dead bore. He's always either angry and feeling sorry for himself or sad and feeling sorry for himself. Bah, humbug. After all this time, he should either indulge in a little character growth or go away completely.One of the reasons I found Anita's character so interesting in the beginning is the tension between her spiritual beliefs and her reality. While I think it's a good thing that she is seeking balance, I don't feel her struggles to find it are being adequately represented. Her friend and police mentor Dolph's personal struggle comes into the novel as another example of what can happen when one refuses to compromise, but the example comes and goes, dealt with summarily at the end of the novel without any real examination. There are a lot of interesting threads going on here: christian witches, persecution, the definition of evil for each person, but they're all left more or less dangling, perhaps to be taken up again in a future book.While it's true that the characters talk mostly to themselves instead of each other about their problems, I don't find this particularly frustrating, since that's how most people deal with things. If they did talk with each other, they'd have a Dr. Phil moment and the tension would be over. However, it would be nice to see them occasionally trying, which might provide hope that someday they could work things out if only serial killers and other people wouldn't come in to gum up the works.To sum it up, I would like to see the Blake novels become more plot driven rather than angst driven. I would like the emotional stuff to return to being secondary to whatever threat or threats she is having to deal with. I want more crime, more mystery, less Dawson's Creek."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Vampires, werewolves and other preternatural creatures share the same civil rights as human beings, but when one commits a crime, licensed executioner and federal marshal Anita Blake kills them. Her lovers are Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire of St. Louis, and Micah her co-leader of the loyal shape-shifting leopard pard that looks to he or protection.The Regional Preternatural Investigation Team asks Anita to help on the case of a murdered man nailed to the wall in a mockery of the crucifixion with Nordic Runes painted nearby. Anita is positive that this is not a magical murder. When a woman is ripped apart, Anita knows that this is the calling card of a shape-shifter. Meanwhile, the woman, who turned Jean-Claude and his second-in-command Asher into vampires, Belle Morte has the sadistic Musette come to town to learn why her boys are so infatuated with Anita. Anita knows she must do something to stop Belle and Musette from taking vengeance upon her loved ones, but whatever she decides will leave her in peril.Anita Blake is a great character who has dramatically changed from a deadly vampire killer to a person who realizes that some non-humans are more humane than mortals are. In CERULEAN SINS, Anita realizes she is more comfortable amidst the vampires but especially with her pack of shapeshifters than she is among humans. However, the key that makes this novel a standout in a tremendous series is Belle Morte as frightening a villain as one will find since even her own species fears her. Fans of Anita Blake will want to read this tale and see the direction Laurell K. Hamilton is taking her heroine and readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Must love this series.It's a great vampire/werewolf otherworldly series.The series in general is a little racy...not for the feint of heart or squeemish."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I found that what I have read so far, that this is a really great book.

I just finished book 11 last night and I am awaiting the next 3 I ordered. I admit that at some points like books 9 & 10 there seems to be a lot more of the sit around and talk, but at the same time it does help you to understand some things about the America they live in the side where all the supernatural happens I guess you can say and peoples powers and how they work.I like the direction this series is going. Anita is working through her struggles with her own powers because no one knows much about her necromancer. To me out of all the guys Anita has in her life JC is basically the one who \\"gets\\" her. Who shows some kind of understanding in all this. He accepts her as is and knows where her thinking comes from and how it works and to me it looks as though he is willing to wait it out and just be there for her while she continues to help everyone in her life, she is very nurturing and loyal to those she cares for.I am not sure where I read this if it was a reviewer or part of the description of one of the books, but it said something like this. The more Anita embraces the supernatural stuff even her own supernatural side she actually seems to be thinking more human. I totally agree with this. Especially in this book she has found herself in circumstance where she would think I would normally be squeamish about something like this but I am not and I should be. It just shows how much more she is accepting these changes and noticing that it's ok because this is who she is. She is embracing her powers.These books definitely should be read in order and not as stand alone as they are written to be stand alone but you get way more out of them if you start from book 1. :0)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book was good. I enjoyed it throughly. I've already read past this, and this book is definitely not the 'downfall of the series'. This one is good. Incubus Dreams and thereafter are really, really disappointing.I love that Anita finally starts to see that her annoying stubbornness isn't only annoying to constantly read, but that it hurts the characters in the book. She finally swallows some of her anger, and it's really refreshing. Asher and Jean-Claude also finally show some backbone and stand up to her. I wish I could say we're finally seeing a new, stronger side to Anita - but after this book there is no plot to see character development. This could have been the first book in a great turn of the series. Instead, it's the end of a great series, and the start of an erotica series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"With \\"Narcissus in Chains,\\" Laurell K. Hamilton switched her format from blood'n'suspense to sex, blood and endless superpowers for her self-insert, Anita Blake.And sadly \\"Cerulean Sins\\" only continues that tradition, couching a meager plot in endless supernatural sex and increasingly purple prose. But even that might be tolerable if Hamilton's idtastic heroine did not waft through the book, expecting all males to put up with her mood-swings, molestation and manipulation. Think the worst fanfiction Mary Sue ever written by a twelve-year-old Hot Topic shopper.Anita has just finished a zombie raising when Asher arrives with a message: Belle Morte's emissary Musette has arrived unexpectedly. It turns out that she's come there to toy with Jean-Claude and torment Asher -- and even worse, she intends to use the scarred vampire for her sadistic pleasure. If he isn't the sex partner of a more powerful person, she's free to do it.However will Anita fix this? By stabbing Musette and hopping in the sack with Asher, of course!While Anita deals with her deteriorating relationship with the police -- it's their fault rather than hers, of course -- she also must deal with a series of murders, and strange men following her. But the main problem is Belle Morte, who has taken a person interest in Anita -- and whose emissary is still able to cause trouble for Anita's \\"people.\\" And possibly death for Asher.Some lip service is paid to a serial killer and a gang of secret agents who, of course, want to enlist Anita's oh-so-impressive services. But that's not where Laurell K. Hamilton's interests lie -- it's pretty clear she is focusing on the endless parade of \\"who's on top?\\" vampire politics and all its courtly trappings, and in writing maybe/maybe not sex scenes.Problem is, she's not very good at it. The supposedly courtly etiquette of the vampires is staggeringly dull, with much hilarious talk of \\"American sex\\" (your basic sex) versus \\"European sex\\" (just about any kind of physical contact). And the sex scenes require endless before-during-after talking and ridiculous angst. At least two pages are required to get Asher out of his underwear. And her attempts at compelling, intense scenes -- such as the were rescue squad or the long-distance prods of Belle Morte -- end up laughably melodramatic.Worst of all, no sense of humor -- despite Anita's oh-so-witty barbs, the funniest line in the whole book is Asher announcing that he's known saints and priests who did not have the self-control of a nymphomaniacal narcissist. Add Hamilton's endless descriptions of anime-style flowing hair and brightly-colored eyes, and you have a recipe for tedious, slow-moving slogging.It's pretty evident that Anita is self-absorbed and not very bright, as well as a glaring Mary Sue with contrived angst and unreal sex powers. Everyone (including the villain and the government) wants her, because she's so tough and special, and despite the fact that she's utterly abrasive and a raging narcissist. Hamilton tries to cover this with protestations that she \\"loves\\" all the guys around her, but it's never convincing.But over the course of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" she becomes truly loathsome: emotionally manipulating the vulnerable, endlessly sniping at Richard, and refusing to let Asher leave unless he has sex with her. And while she admits that it's massively hypocritical to insist that Jean-Claude be faithful to her alone while she has sex with anything that will hold still, she insists on it anyway.Poor Asher. He gets put through the wringer in this one. After being stabbed by an old flame, he has to deal with Anita lying and manipulating him so he'll have \\"European sex\\" with her, and apparently not caring how distraught it makes him. The poor guy deserves better.\\"Cerulean Sins\\" is a long, tedious slog of painfully boring sex, painfully boring dialogue, and painfully boring vampire politics that exists just to be talked about. A ghastly experience."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Having begun with Guilty Pleasures and read with constant enjoyment up through the first hundred pages of \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", I feel tricked and cheated.

Both \\"Narcissus in Chains\\" and \\"Cerulean Sins\\" are colossal disappointments for anyone who read for mystery, crime drama--or anything, really, other than sex.Almost all of the major relationships in these books have been destroyed or relegated to the back burner, and anyone who disagrees with Anita gets pages full of badmouthing. It's tiresome, tedious, poorly plotted, and not much more than an endless and emotionless sexathon. The edge Anita's tangled love life gave the books is gone. The promise of the TRI--the metaphysical and emotional entanglement between Anita, Richard the Ulfric, and the vampire, Jean-Claude--has been destroyed by Anita's unceasing selfishness and incredible demands.I adored Richard, and Micah, Anita's \\"soulmate\\" as introduced in \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", is a one dimensional, contrived, gutless wonder, and an absolutely pitiful substitute for the vastly fulfilling Richard and Anita dynamic. He is much more of a Stepford Wife than any kind of believable partner, with only one endowment to recommend him. Fans that look to \\"Cerulean Sins\\" for resolution of Richard and Anita's dilemma will be sorely, and bitterly, disappointed. Richard gets little page space, and most of that is spent with Anita's internal wondering of \\"how long it would be before she hated him.\\" Less time than it takes for the devoted to begin to hate you, Anita.There are no good aspects of this book. The mystery is underhand, poorly developed, and is more an afterthought than any active device of the plot. It is resolved in a slipshod manner that is to me indicative of Hamilton's poor opinion of her readers. The plot devices are contrived, the vampire villainess less than believable. It is remarkable that a villainess can consume so much page space and still manage to accomplish so little.Most importantly, as far as being relevatory of Anita's abrupt personality transplant, is the destruction of her relationships with all of the human, or humanish, characters in these books. It is only the characters that embrace Anita no matter what that win Anita's and the author's stamp of approval; Dolph, Ronnie, and Richard in particular have been treated abominably. Dolph was throughout the series a rock, and his breakdown is poorly planned and poorly executed. Anita speaks repeatedly of getting rid of Ronnie, her long-time \\"best girlfriend,\\" apparently for the dastardly crime of daring to question Anita's lifestyle choices. The characters have been reduced, almost in toto, to poor caricatures of what they once were. It makes for bland and occasionally offensive reading.With \\"Narcissus in Chains\\", I was looking for the book I had somehow missed between pages 100-101. With \\"Cerulean Sins\\", I'm looking for the other half of the book that was somehow swallowed up by meaningless automaton sex. The ardeur, which might have had interesting possibilities, is merely a device for Anita to sleep with almost all the main and secondary characters...and the ones Anita managed not to sleep with this time are assured of getting their turn in the next book. I am disgusted with the way the promise of the TRI has been sold out, and disgusted with the author for such sloppy writing. If she can't write two series well, don't try. The readers are getting shortchanged on both ends of the spectrum.The only way I would consider continuing with this increasingly Anita-worshipping cult of a series is if Anita were to get over her fiance in college, Richard was restored to the man we fell in love with back in \\"Circus of the Damned\\", Micah were killed, and the ardeur was relegated to the background it deserved: another need, and not one that we need to hear every detail about fulfilling. I have no problem with sex and violence, but only when they serve the plot. Largely due to the sex, there is, in \\"Cerulean Sins\\", not much plot to speak of."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been reading reviews for Cerulean Sins and have found that the opinions of the readers are split; half find the book just as entertaining as the other novels and the other half does not. I am of the half that find Cerulean Sins extremely entertaining, and believe that Laurell K. Hamilton had done an excellent job. Granted, this installment of the series was not as fast pace as the other novels and sex was a reoccurring theme, just as in Narcissus in Chain. If you don't look at the big picture, then yes this book will most likely be a slight disappointment. Being a writer myself, I understand the big picture. CS is a bridge of sorts. It furthers the plot from Narcissus in Chains, and the character relationships and beliefs that changed in NIC were further developed in CS.In NIC Anita took the last steps that officially elevated her into the ranks of the \\"monsters\\" that she fights on a near daily basis. The lines are blurred for her as to who and what the monsters really are. The other books in the series worked on humanizing the monsters, showing their pasts, vulnerabilities, shortcomings and strongpoint and NIC and CS takes that a step further.Minor SPOILERS read at your own risk!*******SPOILER ALERT*************(...)*******SPOILER ALERT*************Faithful readers of The Anita Blake Vampire hunter series, this newest installment of the series has to be read, it sets up the plot for the next book as well as the rest of the series. Don't turn your backs on LKH just because this book wasn't what you are used to from her. Continue to read her books with the faith that she wrote CS the way she has for a reason, we just don't know what that reason is yet.Personally, I enjoyed CS immensely and I can't wait to read Incubus Dreams in September!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins could have been two great novels, but instead comes off as one average book. That is not to say that Anita's adventures are any less exciting than her previous exploits, but I would have liked to see each of the ideas presented at the fore of the novel expored more.First is the whole, 'Anita is asked to raise a very ancient ancestor' for a mysteious assassin. Then the assassin and his plotline disapears until the last 30-pages of the novel when everything is conveniently wrapped up.Second is the return of the Vampire Council, specifically in the form of Belle Morte, the vampire who created Asher and Jean Claude. Belle doesn't physically come to St. Louis, but makes enough appearances through her underlings that she plays a major role in the story. Basically this side of the plot deals with someone on the Vampire Council wanting to take total control from the Vampire who created the Council in the first place. This takes up most of the novel and could have been a really interesting study on the politics of Hamilton's vampires, but again this plotline is quickly tied up in a few short pages before Anita et al wrap up the first plotline mentioned above.I feel that Hamilton is starting to lose a bit of what made Anita attractive in the first place, her outside job and human friends. After Ronnie was explained away conveniently a few novels back Anita has no one outside of the Vampire/Lycanthrope community to interact with, unless you count the RPIT team whom she only sees while standing over some gruesomely dismembered corpse(s). Like the Simpsons creators, who found that by focussing on Homer instead of Bart would prolong their series, Hamilton needs to stretch Anita beyond the borders of St. Louis again and have her interact with people/lycanthropes/vampires outside of her direct group otherwise she runs the risk of stagnating the character."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I started reading the Anita Blake series sometime ago and instantly loved it. It got to the point where I ordered three books at once because I knew I'd be reading them in a day. Well once I got to Obsidian Butterfly I couldn't get past the third chapter. I also skipped Narcissus in Chains, but thought to give cerulean sins a try.Needless to say I was disappointed. If I wanted an eratic adventure I'd rent a movie from the little back room at the video store. I find myself missing the old Anita. The new one kicks less...and has more sex. Where's the raw action?The other thing that put me off was all the details. It took almost two pages just to tell me what two characters were wearing. I don't care much about the clothes! I want to see guns slingin' and mouths shooting! But Anita doesn't do any of these things anymore. She just has sex, with several men at that!Give me the old books, get ride of this new [stuff]."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anyone that is a fan of LKH will no doubt enjoy this read. We finally get background...or more background...on those vampires we love so much. Not to mention those who needed a little loving finally get it. On the 1st read, I was disappointed becuse i thought the counsels presence and influence on the things going on should have been more pronounce, but on the 2nd read, I realized it was. It is definitely good. I read it in one day. : ) But that is just me."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This was one of my absolute favorites of her series. I loved them all, but this is my favorite. I read it over and over and over. It's probably because not only have I come to adore Anita and the way her character and her powers have evolved, but alot of light has been shead on Asher and Jean-Claude's past, whom I must say I truly love. Asher is my favorite fanged fiend. For while I normally have a tendre for men who are tall, dark and sexy like Jean-Claude, Asher's character pulls my heartstrings. Don't get me wrong, I adore all the others. Jason, Nathaniel, Damon, ....Goodness, there are so many.But anyway, by now Anita finds herself as human consort to both Jean Claude, Vampire Master of the City and Micah, a leopard shapeshifter (who Anita finds herself immediately attracted to). But it doesn't stop there. Oh no. It gets better. Or worse, however you look at it. Anita isn't exactly as human as she once was.To explain it, Jean Claude comes from a bloodline that humans once called them incubus and succubus. He feeds from the sexual energy from others, as well as blood. So there you have it. Then you have the fact that in Narcissus In Chains, Anita was scratched by a wereleopard. SO not only does she crave sex, but blood as well. When the head of Jean-Claude's bloodline, Belle Morte, sends one of her underlings, Valintina, to St.Louis, trouble begins to really brew. Belle Morte comes to town, stirring up trouble in her wake when she come to claim Asher back as one of her lapdogs. Plus, while that's going on, Anita's got problems in the human world and in the lycanthrope world. Richard, the King of the Werewolves (Ulfric of his pack) becomes a bigger jerk, Dolph begins to really have issues with the fanged and furry, Anita has a murder to solve and to top it all off, you manage to get a small glimpse of the Mother of All Vampires. (I really hope Laurell brings her character into play in one of her novels one day)Just to give you another juicy hint, Asher, Jean-Claude and Anita have a very hot menage scene chapters 11 through 13. I had to read it a couple of times. I just couldn't help myself. I read those chapters every once in a while just to give myself a little jolt, and a smile.For those of you who love this series, this is a great book to have. But if you are a first time reader in this series, with all of Anita's members in her harem, the evolving of her powers and how she got them, you'd do best to start with the beginning. Start with Guilty Pleasures. If you don't, you'll be lost.Happy reading. I hope you enojy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton has done it again! This newest book, #11 in her Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, is a unique look at how the entire world of Anita Blake, necromancer, human servant to the vampire master of the city, member of the local werewolf pride and nimera of the local wereleopards, will fit together with ancient vampire relatives of Jean-Claud's coming to visit unannounced and ready to cause big trouble. While Anita fights her ever increasing urges of lust brought on by her association with vampire magic, she must keep herself together enough to play vampire and werecreature politics and avoid being kidnapped, while she solves a serial murder case in St. Louis.

In the last 2-3 books in this serie the focus has gone from some violence and romance with a little sex, to much violence and then sex, sex, sex and a tiiiiny bit romance. What will be next? She _becomes_ the new \\"Mommy dearest\\" hyper-vampire-queen? I still loves her series.. but I wish she would tone down the sex-part. I don't mind there beeing some sex in the books - but I DO mind when it takes up more than half the space of the book. I wish for more Richard, more Ronnie, more stuffed penguins, more fun, more Edward.. and more of her old, good humour :)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In the 11th book in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series Anita has to deal with Musette, a vampire sent by Jean Claude's maker to meddle in their affairs. Musette takes a disturbing interest in Asher and Anita will have to go to great lengths to keep him safe. There are also a series of gruesome murders that are not easy to solve especially since Dolph's pent up rage has started to explode.This is hardly the best book of the series but it put to rest all my fears about this series going bad. The only thing really wrong with the book is the pacing of the plot. Laurell K. Hamilton needs to either write longer books or not try and cram so many sub plots into them. Where this book really shines is character development. Anita finally gets some much needed character development that will keep her character for getting stale. Some fans will undoubtedly not like her change in character though. This will really please Asher fans. He gets a lot of scenes and a few of them are some of the most emotional writing Laurell K. Hamilton has ever done. Jason also gets some character growth as does Richard. This book even gives me hope for Richard. If you've given up on the series you should still give this book a shot because you may be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I believe this was the best Anita Blake novel yet. I don't particularly like the way Richard is going but over all I enjoyed the story line. I know Ms.Hamilton is a n excellent writer and knows what direction she wished her characters to go. I read a few of these reviews and could not disagree more with the one that stated there was too much sex. I my self could have appreciated a few more scenes. I love the was she writes its been a long time since I have enjoyed reading this much about this subject. I especially enjoy the first person narative which I would have never picked up before, if a book was written in the first person it automatically went back on the shelf. Thank you so much for this book and I am looking forward to another fairy book soon."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This book has no plot. It is solely written as a device to get Anita into lots of sexual situations and be naked."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita Blake vampire hunter is gone and not for good. The strong character I fell in love with is gone. She has been replaced by a \\"Holier than thou\\" Anita that has become nothing more than a \\"yes\\" girl to most of the men she comes in contact with. The ARDUER (one of the worst plot twists I have ever seen) is an excuse for Anita to end up in various sexual or sexually charged situations. As the vampires feed off of blood we are given an excuse for her ending up with the various men as part of the ARDUER.The chemistry of the story has been absolutely lost. The whole dynamic of Jean-Claude/Richard and Anita had been killed. Simply explained by Richard coming across as insane simply because he's trying to show everyone that if they want him to be a vicious leader he can. Then Anita holds it against him. It was a further nail in the coffin that is Richard. It is easy to see that LKH has decided to remove him from the picture and replace him with the vast array of Vampires/Wereleopards and a few submissive Werewolves. Totally lost is the erotic edge the story used to have Jean-Claude hasn't gone crazy but become a mild mannered YES man.In an attempt to keep Asher from ending up back with Belle Morte Anita allows him into bed with her and Jean-Claude. Even though Asher protests and even YIPPEE complains that he won't be like the others are with her and that he won't agree to joining them only to be turned away later by Anita on and off again libido/Arduer. Even though Anita assures him that won't be the case, it is. She gets angry with him for using his powers/rolling her mind another excuse for her to complain and as he said back out. That was a stand out moment that didn't last because even though he stood up to her it didn't last. He becomes content with the fact that she's like that. Not happy but content.As for the other cast of characters Micah is Anita's new love! PLEASE I do not get this at all and Anita even mentions that the Tri that exists between her/Richard/Jean-Claude could probably work with Micah/JC/her. It was another nail in that coffin of Richards.I was never pro-Richard he was whiney and annoying, but after this book I realize he was the only thing that seemed believable in this series. No matter what he'd remained the same. Now he's portrayed as insane. When in truth all he is saying is that in order to be one of the monsters you don't have to become one in your soul. He's trying to keep his soul and as punishment he's become the bad guy of the series. It's a sad day that this series has become more about Quanity than Quality. It wouldn't be so bad if it were good sex instead it's a neverending stream of sexual situations with men who are all overly endowed with no real sense to say \\"NO\\" I won't share as Anita demands out of all of them.How many men does one girl need? LKH has done this with her Merry Gentry series and now with Anita. It looks downhill from here."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Sad, sad, disappointment for a Laurell fan.I'd suggest readers stop at Blue Moon. Subsequent books ruin the series and the characters.Too much badly written, pointless sex and sloppy plot."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Reading this novel, I couldn't help but be reminded of a porn movie that tries really hard to have a story along with it. It was like Laurell sat down and thought, \\"OK, what can I do to make Anita have sex with all these guys? hmmmmmm lots of \\"ardeur\\" and Vampire sex poltics...Brilliant!!!!\\"In all seriousness though, the sex stuff was just too much and compact all together that it was exhausting. When she is not haveing dirty sex (or dealing with her inner beast etc.) she's having boring conversations about her life with people.......the good stuff appeared in the book when she's trying to solve the serial killer murders, she starts being stalked by foreign government people, and her conflicts with Dolph...but this came very few times in the book...Obviously, I miss the tough ... Anita Blake who has to go through the struggles of killing the supernatural and dating a single monster ( the single has quickly become plural and very annoying), and worrying about everyone else trying to kill her...Now she's just doing people...it's just too much......so in conclusion, more interesting plot and less fabricated ways of getting Anita naked with guys...Thanks Muchly!!!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been in love with LKH's writing for a decade now, and it grieves me to part with her, but part with her I must. What began as an awesome series staring a wonderfully tough but ethical herione infused with sarcasm has evolved into someone with about as much depth as a porno-movie plot. I've stayed with her two books longer than I should have. I'm jumping ship to Charlaine Harris, anybody want to join me in the life boat???"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a big fan of vampire/lycanthorpe novels. I have quite a collection I have gathered over the years. Of course no collection is complete without the Anita Blake series by Laurell Hamilton. I still remember when I first read \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" I fell in love instantly with Anita Blake's world. How she worked part-time with the police dept., how she raised zombies for her money hungry boss; and even though she was tough as nails, she still had a heart and felt for those around her. Once I read the first novel, I immediately went and bought the entire series. Now as a fan of vampire novels, the first four novels cannot be beat. But once you reach no. 5 on, you start to feel as if you are part of a very bad soap opera. Still, there's always hope so I continue to buy her series.This latest novel is downright \\"disappointing.\\" Anita is pretty much a whore. This novel should not be in the vampire category or even in the romance category, it should be in the xxx rated/erotica category. This novel is not about romance and not about vampires. It's about orgy sex, sex with strangers in showers, sex standing up, sex in bed, and sex with anyone who is in the room when everyone else she usually has sex with is not in the room. That's pretty much the plot for 400+ pages, and I am not exaggerating.And what's worse, throughout the novel you are led to believe while she's sleeping her way through every male in the novel, that this is not her fault. Also, when she's not having sex, there's even one point in the novel where she actually has the nerve to whine about how the one true love in her life \\"Richard the werewolf\\" abandoned her. If you have been reading this series you would know that Richard (who she was engaged to marry) became angry with Anita for sleeping with Jean Claude (a vampire) after she ran from Richard because he killed one of his biggest enemies, Marcus (who Anita had been begging Richard to kill for at least two previous novels). The night he kills Marcus as soon as she leaves the man she is going to marry she sleeps with another man. So they break up. And from then on they have sex and break up again and between their sex and break ups Anita finds more men to have sex with.Finally, Richard walked out on Anita when he wouldn't allow her to feed on him. And Anita whines about this even though she doesn't allow anyone (including Jean Claude) to feed on her. Of course, as usual with Anita her values changes depending on who she is having sex with, and once its acceptable to her, everyone else around her should follow her lead and think its acceptable too.What I loved initially about this series was Anita's strength of character. She had a huge inner battle to face as she fought the monsters while not trying to become a monster. Very understable. My empathy for Anita has dissipated by the number of times she has had sex with strange men. She is not a likeable heroine anymore. I hope Laurell decides to start a brand new vampire series. This one had disappointedly run out of steam.If you are looking for a good \\"fresh\\" vampire series try Charlaine Harris' Dead Series (Dead Until Dark; Living Dead In Dallas and Club Dead). This has a likeable heroine with a believable heart of gold."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I have read and loved all the Anita Blake novels. I have always liked Anita's moral conumdrums and the fact that there were no neat answers. I enjoyed watching her raise a graveyard of zombies. I liked her physically tough and emotionally unsure personality. She was true to her friends both human and monster. But is there a solid story line here?? I could not discern one. She seems to run from raping and using the people who depend on her to behaving like a mean spirited slut. The are no new issues in this book. Everything is recycled and tied together with so much sex I am surprised that Miss Blake can still walk. Can we PLEASE get our old heroine back?"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Sometimes you keep reading a series out of habit, just because you started it and you might as well keep going. The Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series is definitely NOT one of those kinds of series!!! The 11th book, Cerulean Sins is involving and carries on the tradition of lush storytelling that Laurell K. Hamilton has led readers to expect. Each book has introduced new players and storylines, and Cerulean Sins does a great job of pushing the story forward. In this book, Anita has to make a big decision about Asher, gets more drawn into vampire politics than ever, tries to sort out her ever confusing love/sex life, and still manages to balance a major police case involving a werewolf. Suddenly my life doesn't seem so confusing...I read it all in one sitting, and now I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita Blake is trying to put some balance in her life, but things seem to keep getting worse. Werewolf-boyfriend Richard is still sulking about not getting Anita to himself. Anita is happy with vampire-boyfriend Jean-Claude, but Jean-Claude's alter-ego, Asher, wants in on teh Anita Blake action. He was content to wait until their master-vampire, Belle Morte decides to call Asher home. Anita can either add Asher to her lover list, or lose him entirely. Richard won't be happy. Vampire politics are bad enough, but a serial killer appears to be operating in the area--a killer that Anita believes can only be a were. She could really use Richard's help on this one, but the police aren't even sure that they can trust her.The Anita Blake stories have been getting progressively bloodier as the series progresses and CERULEAN SINS is no exception. The graphic descriptions of the serial killer's work are disgusting but appropriate for the subject, deeping the horror that Anita faces and making it clear that she has no choice. The violence associated with Anita's sexual appetites will put some readers off--but it just might be what others are looking for.CERULEAN SINS parallels two subplots--that dealing with the internal politics of the vampires and the threatened rise of the mother of darkness, and that dealing with the serial killer. The two subplots are only loosely connected thematically, and not at all connected from a plot perspective. Thus the novel sometimes appears disjointed. I would have preferred to see a closer link between the two major story elements.Author Laurell K. Hamilton is completely convincing in her description of vampires and were-creatures, in the subculture that they create and in the ambiguous (at best) feelings that they create in others. Her heroine, Anita Blake, is refreshingly cynical about the government without having given up on it. I found that some of the clothing descriptions went on a bit, but fans may enjoy the richly detailed imagery.Fans of this series will find a lot to like. Anita continues to mature, struggling with the realization that the simple rules that once guided her are not longer enough. Richard, the deeply damaged were-leader represents what Anita would have become if she hadn't changed--and the destruction he creates in his pack is a microcosm of what Anita could create in the larger preternatural community. Still, each loss of innocence has its costs and Anita must pay those costs in full--often sexually, and always violently."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Before I purchased this book, I read all of the reviews on this site. After doing so I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy it. Now that I've bought and read this book, I feel like I need to comment here so that others won't be turned away from this book. This book, and Narcisuss in Chains before it, have taken Anita into a much darker and sexually charged world. And I am loving every second of it. This seems like a natural and exciting progression for her, and all of the other characters. If you're a prude, don't read the books. It's as simple as that.

The only advise I have is that if you want to read the series start with the first book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"\\"Cerulean Sins\\" is the eleventh book in Laurell Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake Vampire Hunter\\" series. These are amazing novels, but I want to emphasize that the degree of enjoyment one gets from them depends on a level of familiarity with Anita Blake and cohorts. These are not stand-alone books. Author Hamilton has developed her characters over a period of eleven-plus years, and one should read at least a few of her early works, beginning with \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" before tackling \\"Cerulean Sins.\\" Action-packed and plot driven though the books may be, knowledge of the characters, and their growth, is essential for maximum appreciation.\\"Narcissus In Chains,\\" the novel prior to this one, was a pivotal point in the series, where some tension, built over a long period, was relieved and crucial decisions were made concerning the direction of Ms. Blake's life. Anita achieved the level of master necromancer, enhanced her status as human servant to Jean-Claude, and acquired a vampire servant of her very own, Damian. She has also become Bolverk of the Thronnos Rokke Clan, Nimir-Ra, (with her own Nimira-Raj - Micah), of the Blooddrinkers Pard, and a lycanthrope politician, of sorts. Anita, Jean-Claude, the Vampire Master, and Werewolf Ulfric, Richard Zeeman, finally married their forces and have become a triumvirate, powerfully tied to one another. Anita merged her blood and her being with two extremely vital creatures, for whom blood lust and sex are major motivators. The two preternaturals took on a touch of Anita's humanity in this exchange, and she, in turn, has become more otherworldly - her sexuality included - especially the part inherited from Jean-Claude. He has within him elements of an incubus, and is able to feed off sexual energy. Anita now has this same capacity and need, called the \\"ardeur.\\" She is not able to control this drive yet and needs to have a trusted man around to allow her to feed when the urge overcomes her. Needless to say, the concept of monogamy is kaput, at least for the time being. She also possesses an inner-beast, as does Richard. Her ability to deal with an overabundance of additional superhuman features is just another stage in her development. Laurell Hamilton has made a courageous decision to take her protagonist over the dangerous terrain she now travels. She is definitely pushing the envelope. This is a crossroads for Blake fans, as well as for Ms. Blake. Ultimately Anita had to deal with making a decision about Jean-Claude and Richard, and either accept her growing preternaturalism, the merger and its consequences, or look for another career.\\"Cerulean Sins\\" begins in a relatively low-keyed manner. Leo Harlan, a new client whose job description reads \\"assassin\\" meets with Anita and hires her to raise a dead ancestor for genealogical purposes. Hah! That same evening she has cemetery duty, to reanimate a man thought to have been a suicide. For insurance purposes, Anita needs to interview the corpse with a judge, insurance agent, former wife, and various others as witnesses to determine whether the family is entitled to receive insurance money. Vampire Asher, second-in-command to Jean-Claude, arrives as the zombie-raising ceremony is concluding. A major emergency has arisen - so what else is new?Belle Mort, the 2000 year-old fountainhead, \\"le sourdre de sang,\\" of Jean-Claude's and Asher's bloodline, and member of the all powerful Council of Vampires, had scheduled a visit to St. Louis for three months in the future. The Master of the City, and everyone connected to him, are responsible for wining, dining, (she thrives on blood, sex and fear), and doing everything possible for La Belle Mort and her entourage. Displeasing her could mean death or serious long-term torture. However, no one is allowed to harm this Queen of vamps - no matter what she does. She is their mother and their liege lady. Mussette, one of her lieutenants, has arrived early, on purpose, to wreck havoc. Mussette has some unreasonable demands, (of course), including the return of Asher to Europe and La Belle's lair. The only way he can be saved is for him to become the third member of a menage which includes Anita and Jean-Claude. Hmmm. What will Anita, the former Miss Priss decide?On another front, a series of hideous murders are being committed in St. Louis, and although Anita has been called to work the case, her longtime mentor and former dear friend Lt. Dolph Storr, seems to hate her for her intimate contact with the preternatural set, especially the vampires. Then problems arise with Richard, and the allegiance of his werewolves, whose back-up is especially needed during the visit of Belle Morte and Mussette. The action is totally non-stop, as are the multitude of conflicts and dilemmas Anita must confront in her personal life.Laurell Hamilton is one of the best storytellers around. I have now read eleven Anita books, and I rarely read series novels. The plots are spectacular. The labyrinthine vampire and lycanthrope politics makes US election brouhahas look like child's play. The characters are some of the most fascinating and complex that I have encountered in fantasy fiction. They have all grown and changed tremendously since book #1. The author's humor is often dark, but hilarious. I can't wait to read \\"Incubus Dreams,\\" the 12th and last published Anita Blake novel. On the other hand, I am reluctant to begin it, because the 13th book won't be out until 2006. I highly recommend \\"Cerulean Sins,\\" and every other book in this extraordinary collection.JANA"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins is the first book in the Anita Blake series that could probably done with a bit less sex. The book has a phenomenal vampire council storyline and a engaging shifter mystery, both of which get a little forgotten when carnal issues take center stage.I love the Anita Blake series and I appreciate how Laurell K. Hamilton has woven the story in such a way that the sex becomes integral to the overall plot itself. As the books progress, the sex becomes more important because it plays a large plot in both the way Anita carries herself and how Anita's abilities function. Every sex scene in Cerulean Sins has a point, whether to show a new physical relationships in Anita's life, or to set up for heartache later, or to make something \\"magical\\" happen. There is more sex behind the scenes and I love that Hamilton knew to leave it unwritten. In a storyline like this, sex quickly becomes something akin to eating or drinking. We don't need to know every time a character eats, unless it's important to the story. The same goes for Anita's sex life and Cerulean Sins is right at the edge of that border. Any more sex would have been detrimental to the story.Musette, an emissary sent by Belle Morte, has come to visit St. Louis. She isn't hugely important, but Belle can speak through her, bringing about many tense moments for Anita and the vampires. With Musette are two underage vampires, Valentina and Bartolome, who involve some of Anita;s maternal instincts. They also allow for a focus on child abuse and pedophilia.The mystery in Cerulean Sins is in the background for most of the book. While the outcome is interesting, it doesn't effect the plot of the book much. The real importance of the mystery is that it gives the perfect place for Dolph's career implosion.While I would have enjoyed a bit more about the visitors from the vampire council and a bit less of the multiple sex scenes, Cerulean Sins is a very good novel and does a lot to further certain story lines in the series."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I can't remember what book in the series I was on when I stopped reading it, but I remember I stopped when the plot and characters went down the toilet, and it was all just sex, sex, sex, and more sex. I don't get into romance novels much because that's all they're usually about. No really good plot to keep you turning the pages in them. Unfortunatly, that's how this series ended up, a really trashy erotica novel full of sex with strange men and that's all.A previous poster said something about her \\"ardeur\\". I remember when Anita would get this, but then it turned into just an excuse for Miss Hamilton to write a few more pages about having to have sex with some other strange guy (maybe two at once) because the \\"ardeur\\" flared up again...and again....and again....and again. It's sad really, the direction this series went."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After following this series for so long I gotta tell you, I was somewhat disappointed with this installment. The ending didn't set well with me, I'm sorry to say. Usually, a fan of Ms. Hamilton, I hate to say this but if I were you, I'd check this one out at the library or borrow it from a friend. Hopefully, my faith in Ms. hamilton will be restored with her next book!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"From the title of this review, your first question may be why did I give the book 4 stars. I am an avid reader, and I can only give it four stars when comparing it to Larell's other books. This series is truly a wonder to read. If you like Vampires,a strong female character, and want to spend the time to get to know some troubled but fascinating people; pick up this series. From first to last, it's a wonderful package."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I had never read anything by Hamilton until Cerulean Sins. I was surprised to find in was more centered around sex than mystery, crime, and suspense. Although more than half of the book dealt with Blake's sex life and the mating habits of preternatural creatures, what remained was very well thought out and tied together from beginning to end. Keep in mind though, this is not an action packed book. You aren't going to find any great fight scenes, but you will find blood and conflict."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"The latest installment of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series delivers all that we have come to expect from Laurell K. Hamilton and more. In this story we find Anita now dealing with the men in her life post-Richard. Narcissus in Chains the book prior to this ended with Anita and Richard calling it quits for good. But of course Anita cannot be without shapeshifters in her life, so the character of Micah, Anita's Nimir-Raj was introduced.Never fear loyal readers, because just when you think her love life is starting to straighten itself out it gets infinitely more complicated. I won't give away secrets of this book, but Anita gets lots of action, some from very unexpected places. As always there are plots within plots, the central one being Musette's visit on behalf of Belle Morte the sour de sang (founder)of Jean-Claude and Asher's line. We learn more of what Belle Morte is like, and Anita's powerbase is explored more. If you don't remember, Anita is now a Master Necromancer, and has Damien as her vampire servant and the leopards as her animal to call. There is lots more going on in this book, but this should be enough to whet your appetite.I am a huge fan of this series and each is more intriguing than the last. I can't wait to see what the next installment brings."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I enjoyed this book but not nearly as much as Narcissus in Chains. The plot line was rushed and the initial story was rushed to a finish at the end in a clumsy merge. I am anxiously awaiting the new book."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I can remember a time when Anita Blake was the coolest literary character in town. Feisty, with a fierce personal code, too much pent-up agression, and a chip on her shoulder the size of Everest. She was also interesting. Now, even with Anita having more self-revelation moments than any fictional character should have, she feels false, tired and uninspired. If you've ever seen the term \\"Mary Sue\\", the Anita Blake of the last 2 books is a perfect definition.I've always thought Jean-Claude, the sexy but manipulative vampire, and Richard, the powerful but angst-ridden werewolf, were characters just as interesting and compelling as Anita, sometimes moreso. As the 3 characters make up a magical Triumverate, I liked when the books revolved around the 3 of them and their connection, as well as their tangled relationships with each other. Now the books are awash in more cardboard cut-out studpuppies then you can shake a stick at, with Anita having all sorts of magical connections with each of them in different ways. It wouldn't be such a bad thing if they didn't all fall madly in love with Anita with lightening speed, and exist mostly to reassure her or have sex with her. I keep hoping Edward will show back up in the series and take out some of the excess baggage that plagues this series. And of course, Anita is \\"in love\\" with all of them in different ways, which basically means she has sex with them, or wants to have sex with them. She loves Jean-Claude, no, she loves Richard, no she loves Micah (UGH, the WORST!!!), no she loves Nathanial....please, enough !!After the last book, I really was hoping that this author, who I believe is talented, would bring back the magic of her earlier works and stop confusing this series with her other sex-driven series. Sadly, I don't believe that will ever happen."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"While the later Anita Blake novels are not as straightforward as the early ones (after all, there's more and more men and her relationships just get more complicated - it used to be just Jean Claude v. Richard - now it's Jean Claude v. Richard v. Asher v. Jason v. Micah v. Nathaniel), I like the later books more. In the first novels, Anita is just insanely stubborn and idealistic. She used to have all these rules, to help herself feel different from all the monsters, to mark a boundary. In Cerulean Sins, she's finally growing up, and realizing that some of her prohibitions aren't worth the torture/death of someone she cares for. She learns to compromise with herself, to make the people around her about happier. And by doing so, she finds a measure of peace. She can't help being the way she is, and now that she has the ardeur, she has to have multiple partners. It's just part and parcel of being an Anita human servant who's part of Belle's line. So the sex scenes don't bother me at all. Compared to her usual violent/rude/aggressive attitude, it's nice to see her when she's actually emotionally open and intimate with the other characters. It's got the danger of Burnt Offerings, the paranormal sensuality/complexity of Narcissus in Chains, and kick-a** attitude of Circus of the Damned. I really enjoyed Cerulean Sins, and would recommend it to anyone who likes Laurell K. Hamilton's later novels."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a huge fan of LKH but this book was so disapointing. It is the worst book of the entire series-so far anyway. I thought that things were bad in the last book, but this is just pathetic. If I didn't have a bad habit of becoming adicted to a series I would forget about it. The spelling errors were so often that even I noticed. Not only that but it had no plot at all, everything is centered around the da**** lust. If you enjoy endless amounts of sex in your novels, go on, but if you are looking for a good story skip this one. Especialy if you are a Richard fan. LKH keeps sinking her main characters into the background to make room for half-explained ones (Micha and Nethanial).No issue is resolved in this book. The ending was rushed and seemed half finished. Probably because of all the sex. It only served to give Anita a chance to make more screw ups. I'm tired of Anita blaming everyone else for her mistakes. Worst of all, the Jason I loved is turned into a sex toy and Anita gains another boyfriend, leaving her with even less time for the people that have been there from the begining.If you are new to this series, I advise you start from the beging since it concentrates around things introduced earlier. Also, I advise you to borow it instead of buying it at the strore. That way you won't waste your money. I was angry about buying it in hard cover. This book was a complete waste of paper and I hope the next one is better."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I was so starved for this next book by LKH, I pre-ordered in anticipation. After getting half way through, I wish I had waited for paperback, or better yet, checked it out of the Library.I love the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series, and I especially love the characters she interacts with. In this latest, it's still full of sex, much more than any of the first five or six, but suffers from non-engaging plots and page turning danger and intrigue--not to mention grammatical mistakes. The Lunatic Cafe, Burnt Offerings, even The Killing Dance had more suspence--and more importantly, more Richard.There are pages of mystical dreams that Anita goes through--because of Belle Morte--as the Ardeur can't make up its mind whether it wants sex or to feed, and I ended up skipping pages in boredom. There's also a sketchy dream sequence that seems to start in a car and ends up in Jean-Claude's bedroom. What?Anyway, a fantastic sex scene between Anita and a certain wereleopard, and before that a threesome with two favorite vampires, was mindblowing--LKH knows how to write them! but they don't make up for a preternatural murder plot that is tertiary, (even it's not supposed to be). In earlier novels we could identify with Anita because she was afraid of the monsters even if she associated--and loved them, she was scared of losing her humanity and it made her cautious and a lot more real.She has given up that fight, and is edging toward being more like Edward every day. I hated that there were about six pages combined with Richard, who still hasn't learned to accept himself or be able to channel his anger into postive things. Reality eludes him and his suicidal tendencies and low self-esteem are both sad and disturbing.I adore Jason and was satisfied to find an ample amount of him in the book, as well as Jean-Claude. In fact, the threesome of Jean-Claude, Asher and Anita was very interesting, as well as deep thoughts with Jason, who is a very interesting and perceptive character. By the time I finished, however, I was happy. The murder plot was wrapped up with a bow, and we're still left hanging with the Anita/Richard thing. One good quote that I can think of, and incredibly gruesome murder scenes are still the standard with LKH.Still, I don't know how many more books are in the series, but I hope to focus more on Anita's personal developments and her relationship with Richard, who seems bent on self-destructing without Anita. An okay book, but not one of her best. I can't believe I was bored! Get it at the Library first."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Sex, sex, and more sex. I am so disappointed in what LKH has done with her characters and why she insists on throwningaway the very things that made me love this series. As far as I'm concerned, the last two books were not about Anita Blake and the monsters, they were about Anita Blake having sex. I used to be her biggest fan but no more. I will say she is a fantastic writer and I loved the first nine books. In fact, they are my all time favorite books. That's why I'm so upset with the last two books. I feel like I have lost a close friend."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Anita Blake series. NIC was starting to break from the usual excellence of the line, Cerulean Sins is even further off the mark. The book was still well written which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I miss the elements that made the first 7 in the series excellent. There isn't much in this book about Anita's 'work,' only a few gratuitous mentions of her side-kick Larry, and NOTHING about Ronnie. There is a lot of sex though. While some sex is fine (since ALL the main guy characters are hotties) but time after time gets old. Please, have Anita controlling the ardeur by the next book and fill the pages with a true story, not just sex. If the next book doesn't veer back on track it may be my last."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"It's terribly disappointing to see a series that was so brilliantly conceived and executed descend to these depths.The \\"plot\\" has been explained both in the editorial and reader reviews, so I won't bother with it. It's so artificial and contrived that it's not really worth discussing. It's hardly even a plot.The errors in the text are inexcusable. The sloppy editorial process makes me wonder whether something in the prodcution schedule went so wrong that an editor never really got his or her hands on the author's draft.I heard an interview with the author in which she indicated that established characters in the series experienced growth in this book. I saw no development for any but a couple minor characters.Finally, I have no objection to sex - even graphic sex. I like it when it's well-done and steamy. The sex here is anything but. It's clinical and boring. Pages and pages of negotiations over who will have sex with who, followed by ridiculous descriptions of the results. . .so dull. Thinking back several books on Anita's emotional decision to finally have sex with Jean-Claude and how that scene was handled leaves me shaking my head. It's hard to believe the author of this sterile and pointless book could have written such erotic stuff at one point.Sad."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Is Ms. Hamilton just phoning it in, now? I used to enjoy this series, but turning Anita into a nymphomaniac has made her boring. She used to be a kick-butt heroine. She's given up kicking the butts for...never mind.What ever happened to plot? To character development? I like sex as much as the next person, but page after page after page of two-somes, three-somes and more-somes gets monotonous. This isn't even hot sex, since most of the characters are one-dimensional nonentities.The only person who could enjoy this junk is a randy adolescent. It's a brief step up from the Penthouse forum."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Ms. Hamilton has fallen into the trap of making each new book more sensational than the last, at the expense of the twisting plotlines that made us love Anita in the first place. The preternatural crimes in Cerulean Sins are relegated to a secondary role, while Anita's enthusiastic love life takes center stage.The summary on the back of the book says Cerulean Sins is about a hitman who hires Anita to raise a dead relative. That happens in the first 30 pages then falls off the radar for 400 pages of Anita having sex with various vampires, werewolves and wereleopards...sometimes more than one at a time. I'm all for plenty of sex in a book, but as Richard the wereworlf, Anita's ex-boyfriend, says, \\"What is it with you, Anita? Are there any men in the world you haven't slept with?\\" At least she loves them all.For a good Catholic girl who started out 10 books ago not believing in casual sex, Anita has certainly broadened her horizons. Richard is about the only male not on her list of bed buddies.At long last, Anita crawls out of bed long enough to investigate the murders almost as an afterthought. C'mon, Anita, you've a better hunter than this!!!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"While I usually believe in judging a book more on its own merit than as part of a series, this is impossible to do with Laurell K. Hamilton's books, as each book depends on your knowing the characters and subplots from previous books and anticipating how the plot of the current book will affect future stories.Cerulean Sins is a vast improvement over Narcissus in Chains, which used a few lines of plot here and there to break up the monotony of endless sex scenes and gang bangs. Cerulean Sins still has plenty of sex, but the sex is more caring and has emotional context: it deepens or tests bonds and changes friendships. But Hamilton's plot suffers from a bit of split personality: unlike the early books, where the murders force Anita to make devil's bargains with the monsters, weaving the various elements together, in Cerulean Sins there's the murder mystery and the sexual/supernatural politics, and the two don't interact for the majority of the novel.As for characters, Jean-Claude, Asher, Damien and Jason are all very well-drawn, as are the various villains. Anita has reached a new milestone in her development: in the early books she had a slightly panicked quality that worked well because she knew the monsters were stronger and faster and they outnumbered her. It ratcheted up the tension and made us empathize with her. Later she became more confident, but in the most recent books that confidence -- along with her invulnerability -- made her repellantly casual about receiving and dispensing violence. Now Anita has looked into the abyss and decided she didn't like what she was turning into. Violence is a last resort, and is never casual. Anita has also regained her sense of humor. Richard, unfortunately, hasn't changed from the childish, hypocritical and self-destructive persona he seems to have adopted in the last couple of books. He's not grounded in reality at all, but at least the other characters find this as odd as the reader does.All in all, though, Hamilton is back in my good graces, and I'm quite curious to see where the next chapter of this saga will lead."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins features the further development of Anita's relationship with the vampires Asher and Jean-Claude when the head bloodsucker of their line sends her representative to St. Louis. Anita finally has some measure of control over the ardeur, which again plays a fairly major role in the movement of the plot, and she and her guys (pretty much all of them) interact in various ways (violently, sexually, emotionally, and otherwise), which has always been interesting. A secondary subplot features a gruesome werewolf serial killer, an international terrorist, and an assassin who all want Anita to raise a certain someone for them. I find that the mystery sections and the sex/romance/paranormal relationship segments have become less and less integrated as the series has come along. They can pretty much be read as separate but unequal stories. However, if you like paranormal romance, this is definitely a series to read, as it is much more interesting and imaginative than a lot of others out there. And as always, it's entertaining and a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Standing ovation for Laurell K. Hamilton!!! Once again you've treated us to a tantalizing fantasy of love, blood, danger, and mystery! Fantastic! The descriptions and details leave the reader breathless and panting for more. The scenery and setting provides details for the imagination to run rampant with thoughts of tantalizing vampires, werewolves, and other lacanthropes. Setting the stage with hints of the Mother of Darkness and more sinister visits of the Council makes it hard to wait for the next book. LOVE the Anita Blake series!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"As you get in to the last few books in the Anita Blake series they become more sexual in content (with Cerulean Sins being the most graphic, by far), but do not let this dissuade you or sidetrack you. Some readers find the sex to be too much. However, it is not 'porn' as others have unfairly charged, but something that fits with Anita's growing magical abilities and the 'fuel' that feeds them. Remember that as you read and it isn't as offensive when read and consumed with that understanding.For those calling Ms. Hamilton's writing 'porn', it is obvious you have never read TRUE porn. Instead of seeing it through the eyes of an observer of an orgy, see it as it is meant -- the 'fuel' needed by Anita and what she learns about what she needs and how she can use what she gets from the sex act.I have loved Anita Blake and her characters since the first book and I still do. This is a series that forces the reader to re-examine their own boundaries and grow with the main character. I highly recommend this series, but strongly recommend it be read in order to fully appreciate the eventual growth and changes that occur during the course of time."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"After reading some of the reviews for this title on Amazon, I felt compelled to share my own. One particular review had more adjectives than my dictionary! The reviewer spent more time trying to impress me with her vocabulary than actually talking about the book.I feel that LKH is taking Anita on a very complicated journey. I think she has hit some major road blocks on the way. Ones that she might not have wanted to share with her readers. I still have to say that I enjoyed the book. I would love to see LKH concentrate more on the characters she has now, instead of adding any more to the mix. I would love to see Anita and Richard fill the gap between them. We shall see.

Of course, there are some books in the series that I like better than other's, but I am never disappointed. How often can someone say that and mean it?That being said, \\"Cerulean Sins\\" is one of my favorite books in the series. Anita is really growing as a person and into her powers. Her relationships just keep getting more intimate, erotic, and enjoyable to read. What I liked most about Cerulean Sins is that Anita seems to be (at last) coming to terms with whom and what she is -- and appreciating the people in her life for who and what they are as well.While this is a stand alone book, this is a series that is worth reading in its entirety and in order. I would recommend going out and buying all of the books in the series and devouring them like a box of chocolates, if you have not any of the other Anita Blake novels."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been follow Ms. Hamilton's Writing for some time now. She started off very strong, with strong characters, impelling plots and morbid humor. When she started up her Fae series I saw another side of her writing. It's not that I do approve of her Fae series just that I wish she would have kept her two main subject matters seperate. I worked for a bookstore for over a year and the main sections I took care of were the Relationships and Fiction. Bookstores have policies of placing the sexual fiction books in the relationship sections where they can keep an eye on them. Those under 18 are not allowed to review or buy the overt sex books at all. Unfortunatally, Ms. Hamilton's fiction series is reaching the point that if I still worked for the bookstore I would place them in that section. Please bring back the action and humor that you had In your earlier writing Ms. Hamilton. I felt when I was reading the book that it was a few lines of talk between sex scenes.

At the same time, a rogue shapeshifter is slaughtering women in the area. Jean Claude and Anita have to deal with Musette and her entourage, while the third member of the triumvirate, the werewolf Ulfric, Richard is on a self destructive downslide. The only question is, will he destroy himself or them all. To make matters worse, the oldest vampire of them all is waking from a thousand year sleep, and noone knows what that will bring.This is a very intense novel, even more so than the last. The characters become more and more interesting as time goes on. Anita's character is vastly different from the first book, but she has grown in a natural(supernatural) manner with the development of her necromancer powers and just her life experiences in general. There is so much action here that it is difficult to put the novel down and I will definitely read it again very soon.

And what more can I say but Asher...oh my..."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Sheer disappointment. I keep seeing that word, \\"disappointment,\\" all throughout these reviews, and I don't think that's simply coincidence. These are my personal, major complaints in no particular order:1) *Shift of plot type*I got hooked on these books because they were a cool, supernatural combination of the whodunit, detective, and action genres. Don't get me wrong, Anita's love/sex-life has always been part of the stories, but it wasn't ever really the primary plotline. Now it is, and since I don't dig soft-core erotica nor romance novels, I don't care for it.2) *Apparent metamorphosis of major characters*When I was reading passages involving Dolph or Richard, I couldn't imagine why they're now such different characters. People go through difficult, sometimes traumatizing times in life, but for pete's sake, these guys are so different from the way they were in the previous books that their names ought to be changed!3) *The ardeur*I'm sick of it, sick of it, sick of it. That's about as concisely as I can put it.4) *Long hair on men*Okay, Hamilton, so you like long hair on guys. So do I -- on the right guy, of course. But get over it! I'm weary of reading endless descriptions of some man's long, flowing, beautiful, cascading, lustrous, rippling, flaxen, luxurious, blah blah blah hair. Oh, and lets not forget how traumatizing it is for his friends when a man cuts off his long hair!!5) * \\"So much meat\\" *Might there possibly be any other phrase to describe a human being who's been ripped to shreds? &lt;reaching for thesaurus...> Seriously, I should've kept track of how many times that particular phrase was abused... er, used.6) *Lack of editing*Way too many typos, grammatical errors, blatant overuse of some phrases and words (e.g. #5 on my list). Need I say more? Although, like another reviewer said, this is less the fault of Hamilton than of her editor/agent/publishing house/whatever.There's more, but I think I'll leave it at that.Back when my friend first got me hooked on this series, I practically salivated with anticipation during the weeks before each new book was released. Since _ Narcissus in Chains_ was a letdown to me, I was eager to see if the next book would be an improvement. How sad that it wasn't. I would say I won't bother to read the next book in the series, but I know my lack of willpower won't let that happen. I'm sure I'll read it anyway, if only out of pure, morbid curiosity."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I know, we don't confuse fiction with reality. Yet, when you read enough about a character, you start relating to \\"it\\" (him or her) as if that character were a personal friend. Sadly, I have broken friendship with Anita in this new installment. \\"Anita\\" books used to have two major strengths, I think: a good mystery plot which got solved at the end (and if Anita kept pulling increasingly unbelievable tricks out of her sleeve, more power to her), and Anita's coherence as a character. The reader may have gotten a bit bored with her constant moral qualms (\\"An affair with Jean-Claude, does that make me a monster? Maybe yes...maybe no...yes...no...\\") and may not have agreed with some of her choices, but at least they used to make sense within Anita's system of beliefs, the way the author described it. In this book, we encounter a new Anita who, while trying to learn self acceptance, also stops making sense. I don't mean it as moral judgment, but Anita's quite brusque transition from \\"prudish\\" to \\"orgiastic\\" seemed more motivated by real market pressures than the internal logic of a fictional character. Anita is as coherent as a software with a virus: push the button marked l'ardeur, and lo and behold, there's no stopping her. (I have to say that at this point I sympathize a lot more with Merry Gentry from the other series, who at least does what she enjoys best.) To top it off, one of Anita's strong points, her ability to take control of an explosive situation, here turns into the obsession of control: she whines, she complains, she complicates fairly straightforward circumstances. Unfortunately, that doesn't come across as complexity, but rather as a badly constructed character.My second problem was with the plot of the book. Surely enough, the first 100 pages or so build the right momentum and offer the promise of great suspense. Then it all goes away, leaving the reader increasingly frustrated. The story is only partially resolved - we don't find, for example, the key to Anita's visions (or at least it wasn't clear to me), probably in anticipation of a sequel. Because of that, you cannot help but feel throughout the remaining pages that the author actually had two books in mind, couldn't quite figure out which one to concentrate on, and decided to wait awhile and hope for the best. I don't think the best happens, not in this book. I am not sure whether to give it 4 stars out of nostalgia for the early series, or 2 stars out of disappointment. An average it is."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"What on earth has happened to Anita Blake? What was once an engaging, funny, and human character whose vulnerability in a world of superpowered creatures made her so intriguing is now a hypocritical, self-centered, spoiled, childish, delusional, hateful, mean-spirited, nigh-omnipotent, humorless and unappealing sex fiend. Now, usually I rather like sex fiends, but Anita Blake is perhaps the most irritating, unlikable, and revolting character I have come across in a long time, and no amount of orgasmic sex is going to fix that.Anita's supporting cast almost holds CS together and makes it palatable, but unfortunately Anita's overbearing presence kills the other characters' appeal. The fact that all of the characters in this book have been reduced to spineless bootlicking sycophants, hateful villains, or pale, zero-personality ghosts with no will of their own doesn't help matters. What LKH has done to Richard and Dolph is atrocious, and Zerbrowski is getting dangerously close to being yet another Anita groupie. The newest male to be added to Anita's ever-growing harem, Micah, is completely useless as a character. Sadly, I actually *like* Richard's sudden raging hatred of Anita, because at least this means he's not another mindless Anita-worshipper. Jason is adorable, as always, and Nathaniel is finally becoming interesting--almost. Jason alone is the bright spot in the hideous morass that is this book.The ever-escalating superpowers Anita keeps getting are also very tedious: at the rate she's going, Anita will soon be able to control every vampire, ghost, were-animal, and other supernatural creature in the world, and probably not even God will be able to defeat her in combat. Ridiculous.Add a total absence of plot to the mix, and what you get is a self-indulgent mess with little to no redeeming qualities whatsoever. There is nothing to recommend about this book, not even good writing or pacing. The pacing is dreadful, and the writing is... well, I've seen better writing in badly translated assembly instructions.The only way to fix the atrocious mess that this series has become would be to have someone, maybe Edward, come to town and blow Anita Blake to kingdom come. Then, Asher and Jean-Claude can get together without having to ask Anita's permission, Richard can finally find a woman who supports him, the wereleopards can get lives, and Jason can join RPIT, the preternatural police squad, and engage in entertaining high-jinks with Zerbrowski, with Dolph to keep the two in line. And Micah dies, of course.Now THAT'S an Anita blake, Vampire Hunter story I'd pay money to read. Anything else? Won't spend a penny on such disappointing drivel."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I would've given this book 5 stars, if I thought its intent was to inspire fits of hilarity. But seeing as how the author wants to be taken seriously for this laugh riot, I have to go with 1 star. None wasn't available.Now, don't get me wrong, its quite an achievement to put the word \\"ardeur\\" in the books as many times as Ms Hamilton does. And its not just anyone that can make sex scenes so mechanical and uninteresting. And one particular sex act gets described in painstaking detail not once, not twice, but THREE seperate times. Is this a book or a sex manual? (and a bad one at that).And its frankly miraculous that so many incredibly stupid characters can find their way onto these pages. I think they might have had a brain once, though not since Blue Moon. But now? Whether its the totally self-absorbed Anita, a character that has become so unappealing its amazing that the rest of the characters haven't ganged up and staked her already. Or Jean-Claude, the once clever and manipulative vampire who seems to lead his life according to what Anita wants on any given day. Or Richard, the once sympathetic and very human werewolf who now gives new meaning to the terms \\"bipolar and moody\\". Or how about Micah? A character that wouldn't know a personality if it bit him on his enormous...uh...nose. And then there's the increasingly whiney Asher who puts his foot down with Anita. At least for a whole 50 pages he does. Then he caves like the rest of the girly-men that inhabit this book. Someday I might understand why Ms Hamilton thinks men with long hair, feminine feature, the ability to wear Anita's clothes and no visible signs of a backbone are interesting. But I seriously doubt it.What was once a very interesting, fun and exciting serious seems more and more to me like a soap opera/authobiographical/erotica mishmash. Someone send in Edward with an uzi to clean house, and make sure not to miss Miss Blake."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This was a wonderful series, until the last 2 books. I'm still trying to figure out why its all gone so horribly wrong so quickly.The 11th book in this series starts out promisingly, with Anita in a graveyard raising a zombie. She even seems to have regained some of her trademark quips. And some of the other plots that are introduced along the way seem very promising. The werewolf serial killer, the assasins following Anita and especially the emissary of the vampire Belle Morte. As we found out earlier in the books, Jean-Claude and Asher used to \\"belong\\" to Belle, and we've been led to believe that she's very powerful.But all these potentially great stories seem to get crushed under the weight of Anita and her sex life. Or should I say the ardeur. One of the most offensive and blatant plot devices to come along in any series. Lets just call it what it is boys and girls, an excuse for the author to get Anita naked and in bed with a cast of characters. A male author using this type of device would be blasted to the moon. In this book, Anita adds another 2 men to her stable. With each intimate addition to her life, her relationships take on a more shallow and unconvincing tone. I miss the intimacy of her individual relationships with Jean-Claude and Richard. They were real and touching and convincing. Anita with Asher or Jason is not as convincing. And definitely NOT with Micah.When all is said and done, Anita emerges victorious again under extremely dubious circumstances that make her appear very callous. The book insults us by suggesting otherwise. And Belle Morte is sent packing by Anita and her male studpuppies. And once again, Anita's \\"dating\\" status is changed. I didn't realize that Anita dated anymore, I thought she just had sex with different men. How I long for the older books and the romantic scenes between Anita and Richard, or even Jean-Claude.I like the substance of the early books over the gloss of the later books. Now, they seem to be about how much LKH can throw in, violence, sex, unexplained monster powers. But everything is just slick and passionless. The series feels tired."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I started out a huge fan of this series. Many fans of LKH left or became disgusted with the turn this series took after Narcissus in Chains, but this one was the straw that broke this camel's back. Where there was once a dynamic plotline rife with action, drama, diverse and interesting characters......it became an ill-conceived series of pointless sex, zero plot, and disappearing personalities. I, as of yet, have not picked up the latest book and don't plan to based on what I've heard of it. I'm personally relying on a friend of mine that has stuck with the series to let me know when it's safe to pick up another one of these books because I refuse to do so on my own. As of yet, she has told me not to bother. How anyone who claims to be a fan of this series can say that the latest 3 books are even nearly on par with the rest is beyond me."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Although I love to read, I don't have much time for it, so I go through a lot of audiobooks instead. Therefore, I was thrilled when I saw that this book was available in audio format (and unabridged, no less!). To my knowledge, this is the first Anita Blake novel that has been available as an audiocassette.I must preface my review by disclosing that I have not yet completed the book (I'm just beginning Tape 7).As many others here mentioned, I initially thought that there was a plot revolving around a client that would be fleshed out but I have not yet seen that happen. A few tapes into the book, I thought that perhaps the problem was that Anita did not translate well to audio; however, given that many other reviewers have picked up on the same problems with the book that I have, I no longer thing this is the case.First, I realize that a series that is so strongly built around a single character requires that the character evolve over time. Anita began as a strong heroine with a wry sense of humor and a highly developed sense of right and wrong. An essential part of the series, over time, has been to challenge that sense of right and wrong and force her to make hard choices. Now, it seems, there are no choices. Everything she does is driven by psychic links to others, the arduer, etc. Far from being the strong executioner of the previous novels, this Anita cannot even drive a car by herself, she is so weakened or overtaken by these outside forces.As to the rest of the characters, some are getting fleshed out, but the ones that truly matter, such as Richard and Jean Claude, have become shadows of their former selves, with Jean Claude (and many of the other characters) coming across as overly obsequious to \\"ma petite\\" and Richard (again) coming across as nothing but a whiner, rather than the strong but conflicted lycanthrope we've seen in past novels. In addition, as the series has progressed, it seems that more and more of the other characters' world revolves around Anita. In the beginning, characters had their own lives and interests in addition to their interaction with Anita; now it seems as if every character's overriding interest in life (or death, depending on the character) is to bed, feed on, kill or psychoanalyze Anita.In addition, although I don't have a problem with gratuitous sex, I do have a problem with the entire book being nothing but a series of sexual encounters. If I wanted that, I would buy a Nancy Friday book. And again, as alluded to above and as mentioned by another reviewer, why does it seem that EVERY available male is in love/lust with Anita to the point that each of them would do anything to have her?In addition to the moral dilemmas Anita has faced, the characteristics that make an Anita Blake novel enjoyable to me are as follows:- The superimposing of the supernatural world upon the real world. This has been lost in the more recent novels, as Anita has slipped deeper and deeper into the supernatural world.- Consistency within the supernatural world. While I understand that there are exceptions to rules, it seems that something that has never happened in the history of the world is always happening to Anita, or she is able to do something that she should not be able to because of her \\"marks\\", etc.- Some mystery/suspense. So far, the most suspenseful thing in this novel was whether the threesome with Jean Claude and Asher was going to happen. I haven't noticed a plot in this novel. It's more like \\"a day in the life of Anita Blake when she's having sex every five minutes.\\"- This kind of goes along with the previous point, but I loved seeing Anita work, especially with the police. There is some of that in this novel, but it has yet to be fully developed.- A strong, sassy Anita. She seems to have become nothing but a weak sex toy.- Multi-dimensional characters. The series has gone far afield from the original substantive characters that there are just a host of one-dimensional characters. In addition, there are now so many characters that it is difficult to keep up with them and there are way too many that are overly dependent on her. Finally, it seems to me that the many of the characters are interchangeable. Edward might have been kind of one-dimensional (I say \\"kind of\\" because there was always a bit of mystery behind his character), but at least he was different than the other characters.Ms. Hamilton, I'm glad that your strong past sales have convinced your publisher to provide your novels with the same level of visibility as more \\"mainstream\\" novels, but I am sorry that it has to be when the series is in such decline.Please go back to basics. Somehow get rid of the arduer and pare down the cast of characters so that there is time to more fully develop the ones that are left. Bring us a true mystery and let us see Anita at work more than having sex with various supernatural beings. I know - the last couple of novels were nothing but a long nightmare that Anita wakes from in the next one! ;)"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In the earlier Anita Blake novels, I was drawn in by a bad ass heroine who seemed able to take care of herself in a world overwrought with mystical and supernatural events and creatures. The very lure of Anita Blake herself was the rigid code that she held herself to, especially involving her tumultious inner turmoil on romance and morality. Her struggle against herself always seemed to make the Fantasy World in which she inhabited more believable.Nevertheless, as the novels have continued there can be no more sympathizing with the plights that she faces as a result of a cast (more like a body pile-up) of needy characters who drag her into more intrinsic situations that seem to get father away from anything resembling a plot.The degeneration of the entire series into a soft core porn sequence is a pathetic attempt to indulge what must obviously be a bored house wife's pent up fantasies.The only way to get Anita Blake back on track would not only be for her to somehow \\"lose\\" all the powers that she has accrued so conveniently, get back to work, and make a resolute decision about her lust life so we can stop reading about the harem of orgies that parade through the revolving doors of her life. Otherwise, this course is headed for a crash."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"With \\"Narcissus in Chains,\\" Laurell K. Hamilton switched her format from blood'n'suspense to sex, blood and endless superpowers for her self-insert, Anita Blake.And sadly \\"Cerulean Sins\\" only continues that tradition, couching a meager plot in endless supernatural sex and increasingly purple prose. But even that might be tolerable if Hamilton's idtastic heroine did not waft through the book, expecting all males to put up with her mood-swings, molestation and manipulation. Think the worst fanfiction Mary Sue ever written by a twelve-year-old Hot Topic shopper.Anita has just finished a zombie raising when Asher arrives with a message: Belle Morte's emissary Musette has arrived unexpectedly. It turns out that she's come there to toy with Jean-Claude and torment Asher -- and even worse, she intends to use the scarred vampire for her sadistic pleasure. If he isn't the sex partner of a more powerful person, she's free to do it.However will Anita fix this? By stabbing Musette and hopping in the sack with Asher, of course!While Anita deals with her deteriorating relationship with the police -- it's their fault rather than hers, of course -- she also must deal with a series of murders, and strange men following her. But the main problem is Belle Morte, who has taken a person interest in Anita -- and whose emissary is still able to cause trouble for Anita's \\"people.\\" And possibly death for Asher.Some lip service is paid to a serial killer and a gang of secret agents who, of course, want to enlist Anita's oh-so-impressive services. But that's not where Laurell K. Hamilton's interests lie -- it's pretty clear she is focusing on the endless parade of \\"who's on top?\\" vampire politics and all its courtly trappings, and in writing maybe/maybe not sex scenes.Problem is, she's not very good at it. The supposedly courtly etiquette of the vampires is staggeringly dull, with much hilarious talk of \\"American sex\\" (your basic sex) versus \\"European sex\\" (just about any kind of physical contact). And the sex scenes require endless before-during-after talking and ridiculous angst. At least two pages are required to get Asher out of his underwear. And her attempts at compelling, intense scenes -- such as the were rescue squad or the long-distance prods of Belle Morte -- end up laughably melodramatic.Worst of all, no sense of humor -- despite Anita's oh-so-witty barbs, the funniest line in the whole book is Asher announcing that he's known saints and priests who did not have the self-control of a nymphomaniacal narcissist. Add Hamilton's endless descriptions of anime-style flowing hair and brightly-colored eyes, and you have a recipe for tedious, slow-moving slogging.It's pretty evident that Anita is self-absorbed and not very bright, as well as a glaring Mary Sue with contrived angst and unreal sex powers. Everyone (including the villain and the government) wants her, because she's so tough and special, and despite the fact that she's utterly abrasive and a raging narcissist. Hamilton tries to cover this with protestations that she \\"loves\\" all the guys around her, but it's never convincing.But over the course of \\"Cerulean Sins\\" she becomes truly loathsome: emotionally manipulating the vulnerable, endlessly sniping at Richard, and refusing to let Asher leave unless he has sex with her. And while she admits that it's massively hypocritical to insist that Jean-Claude be faithful to her alone while she has sex with anything that will hold still, she insists on it anyway.Poor Asher. He gets put through the wringer in this one. After being stabbed by an old flame, he has to deal with Anita lying and manipulating him so he'll have \\"European sex\\" with her, and apparently not caring how distraught it makes him. The poor guy deserves better.\\"Cerulean Sins\\" is a long, tedious slog of painfully boring sex, painfully boring dialogue, and painfully boring vampire politics that exists just to be talked about. A ghastly experience."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I used to be a huge fan of the Anita Blake series -- I single-handedly evangelized them to all my friends as living up to the title of the first book -- Guilty Pleasures.Alas, this series, which used to be so much fun, has sunk to new lows with this book.The bad points:-- The pretentiousness. The title seems to have no relevance to the book, other than having the color blue appear throughout. But we're never given any meaning behind the color. It's just there, some vague literary conceit.-- The sex. Don't get me wrong. The entire series has been about sex and sexual tension. But in the other books, they were mixed together with the plot and character development. Here, they stand alone, there for no reason other than to allow Laurell to write another porn scene. If I wanted that, I could pay a lot less, and get better porn, frankly.-- The editing. About two typos a page. Does anyone even edit LKH any more? It's unprofessional and lazy (although, to be fair, it's the editor's fault, not Laurell's).-- The plot. The main plot is, once again, a gratuitous mix of sex and violence, without any believable motives. New characters appear out of the blue to menace Anita without any acceptable backstory.-- The characters. Richard continues to act nothing like the man we first meet in book three. Jean-Claude has now morphed into a vampiric Jiminy Cricket, telling Anita what would be \\"wrong.\\" Micah and the other assorted were-creatures are given about as much personality as chess pieces. Other than Jason and some of the were-rats, the characters are practically interchangeable.The good points:-- We finally get a plot (albeit a B-plot) with Dolph and the police force. It's far more interesting than the A-plot, and could have made the book worthwhile if it had been the focus.-- Jason has some good moments, and is probably the best character in the book.Not much in the way of good stuff to counter the bad, I'm afraid. I think I'll be dropping this series now; I certainly don't plan to buy any more hardcovers by LKH."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This is the first bad book for me in the series.

But I was desperately seeking the whereabouts my lil' necromancer and her sexy comrades, so I decided to skip book 10 and go straight for Cerulean Sins since the reviews were more concordant.Even though I had such low expectations the novel still reeled me in and spit me out wet and confused. Albeit, I did enjoy parts of the storyline, but it was indubitably amorous and erotic in a way that was tasteless leaving the plot screaming for help. As the characters heedlessly become one big revelry affair, they are lost in having any depth that previous books expressed potential in doing. With the spot light on the sexual relationships, the mysteries were forgotten and the reader is left trying to name all those that have to support Anita's libido.Unfortunately, this will be the last of the series I am willing to devote any more time to.

Then around book 9, our heroine met with some...changes. From about book 10 onwards it has been nothing but hate from critics and readers alike. Amazon is populated with hundreds of 1 and 2 star ratings for books 11, 12, 13 and 14. Pretty much everyone turned on author Laurell K Hamilton and gutted her with a very long, very sharp sword. Was this a great book? No, not great. But it was good, it was engaging and it kept me reading. Hamilton is gifted with a wonderful imagination and Anita is so very practical and real and solid. She's incredibly likeable, despite the fact that she kills monsters for a living and *gasp* sleeps with more than one man at a time. However, the finer points of plotting and story development are not really Hamilton's gifts. In the beginning books she was clearly heavily edited and the books were better for it. But like some other authors I can think of, as she became more popular and sold more books, her books got bigger and bigger and not necessarily better. Typos and grammatical errors (truly appalling ones, like the use of \\"isle\\" instead of \\"aisle\\" in a wedding setting) crept in and gave people who hated what Hamilton did to Anita Blake even more ammo to throw her way. And really, the publishers should be ashamed of themselves.Anyway, the book itself was good. The plot was a bit thin, with a gaping hole in the middle resolved with a last minute tie up that was a bit too convenient. It was nice to see some development with Richard actually growing a pair and Asher finally getting back into Jean-Claude's (and Anita's) bed (at the same time! Shock! Horror!). Anita's character only moved forward marginally, but some of the scenes with her and Belle Morte/Musette were vintage Anita and really well done. Part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because it has been well over a year since I read Anita Blake number 10. I have discovered that a little Anita goes a long way. I have number 12 sitting on my bookshelf as we speak, but I'll be giving it at least a few months breathing room, maybe more."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"In the beginning, Anita Blake was widely feared by vampires and wereanimals. Known by the monster community as the Executioner, the petite necromancer was either raising the dead or helping the police solve preternatural crimes. Nowadays, she spends most of her time babysitting the wereleopards, consorting with the Master of the City and playing preternatural politics. Oh, how the mighty has fallen!In CERULEAN SINS, Jean-Claude and his clan is once again targeted by another Vampire Council member. This time, Belle Morte, the sourdre de sang of his bloodline, has sent one of her lieutenants to claim back Asher. The vampire version of Barbie, Musette is the embodiment of viciousness. But this sinister Barbie isn't the only thing that Anita must deal with. There are some gruesome murders that must be investigated, her police-friend Dolph is on the edge of a nervous breakdown, and then there's the ever-demanding ardeur that must be sated.The eleventh book in the series continues with Anita's seemingly biggest problem, which is how to deal with the ardeur and the growing number of men in her life. While Hamilton has thrown in the problem of Belle Morte and the gruesome murders, the real focus is on Anita's libido and fall from grace. While I personally enjoyed the love triangle between her, Richard and Jean-Claude, I feel that it has lost its novelty since the introduction of the ardeur. At least in the first few books, the plot has always remained strong and Anita's complex relationship was interesting. Now, it is becoming tiresome.I shall limit my rambling except to say that there were some parts that I enjoyed, mainly the entertaining banter between the main characters and those few scenes where Anita decides to put some clothes on and kick some butt.

It began with Anita seeing a client at her work regarding raising a zombie and then an actual zombie raising. Unfortunately the swamp of lovers, boyfriends and discussion of who will have physical intimacy with Anita for what reason came up pretty quickly. Long complicated scenes of relationship issues involving sulking vampires and pouting shapeshifters ensued.Belle Morte, the ancient vampire who started the line of vampires that now include Jean-Claude and Asher, has sent her evil, sadistic and perverse emissary to challenge Jean-Claude. Vampire politics ensue with torture and mayhem. Which would have been interesting but it was all built around the metaphysical sexual sadism that is the hallmark of this particular vampire. That gets pretty old very quickly. Anita must protect Asher who Belle Morte is threatening to take back to her court. The only way to do this is for Anita to have physical intimacy with him.There was a compelling murder mystery plot that took the back ground to Anita becoming a m&eacute;nage a trois with Asher and Jean Claude. And there were some hit-men stalking Anita which provided some interesting notes. But basically this is a rehash of all the different characters that Anita will have physical intimacy with--and the resulting melodrama. Even Anita says she is sick of all the men and their drama. A loss for us readers!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I've been reading the Anita Blake series since the very first book and have always looked forward to the next in the series. This book, however, has really disappointed me. It was basically 500 pages of vampire politics and the main character's internal conflict of should she or should she not have sexual relations with multiple guys. The usual action-packed, crime-solving, tough heroine I always loved was no where to be found. The inner workings of her vampire world may be fascinating to the author, but 500 pages of it is way too much for me.This is NOT typical of the series and I hope Ms. Hamilton gets her character back on track, for I would hate to see the loss of an overall very good vampire series.I'll give her next book a try when it comes out on paperback. But if this new trend continues, I won't continue to buy her books."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Maybe the past few books weren't as enjoyable as the first ones, but I still liked \\"Cerulean Sins.\\" No, Anita isn't at all the perfect heroine. No, it's not just about good vs. evil anymore; there are shades of gray in the world one cannot ignore. That has been the lesson Anita has had to learn to live with, and also the reality that Richard has been unable to accept, both about himself and about the world he lives in. I will definitely keep reading as long as Laurell keeps writing."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"But it certainly was better than the waiting period until the next book came out. Although I must say, it could have been polished a little. And the ending was something of a flop to be brutally honest. But overall, this book was still enjoyable. The beginning started out just like any other of her great books, yet something was missing. It was hard to pin down, but the missing link (so to speak) to this being a great read was simply that the entire affair seemed a bit rushed; like Hamilton had a deadline to meet, and didn't have time to nurture the plot into something spectacular."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Cerulean Sins almost seems to be the first half of a really good Anita Blake story. Future plot twists and character developments are liberally strewn about.But the mystery component never quite develops beyond the crime-scene walkthrough. The killer is identified in an almost off-hand manner, and the other 'bad guys' never pose a serious threat - we only know that there are 'men in black' looking to exploit Anita's talents.Other key elements seem rushed or underdeveloped. Dolph's problems have taken a sharp right turn and shaded over into psychosis; Richard's personal problems follow in the same vein - it's been several months since the events of 'Narcissus in Chains', and we're to believe that Anita didn't notice (or didn't care) about Richard's depressive state? What would happen if one third of the triumvirate offed himself? Wouldn't it be the job of Jamil, Shang-Da, or Sylvie to break their leader's wishes and get him the necessary help - even if that's from someone Richard doesn't particularly want to see?As for the extended adult content this time out, I'm not sure what to make of it. While it underscores the difference between humans and lukoi/pard/vampire ... Anita's world seems to have become a binary bedroom-or-boardroom sort of place.All in all, it's good to see old friends again, even if we're left with the feeling that the visit was cut short."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"My word, what a tedious book. I've read the other Hamilton books and, while they've had their problems (grammar, LKH, please learn grammar), they've been enjoyable for their humor and subject. But this one is by far the weakest she's cranked out. Whining is not character development, and neither is sex.Also, whatever you do, avoid the audio version of this book. I have a long commute and listen to a lot of audiobooks, but I've never heard such a horrible reader as the one who reads this book. No real attempt at character voices (or, most likely, no ability to do them) and the worst french accent I've ever heard. Avoid her like the plague!"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"It is very unusual for a popular series to take a free-fall like this one has (think: Charlaine Harris's \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" series). I, like many other formerly devoted readers of \\"Anita Blake,\\" don't understand why the author would take such a sucessful franchise in such an odd (soft-porn) direction. I can only imagine that LH became bored after completing book #9 in the series, yet perhaps had a contract to \\"chug out\\" 15 books or so, and thus, decided to toss plot and characters to the winds in favor of \\"Playboy for supes\\"....very sad, as her reputation is suffering. Not worth the effort to read, nor the trees that died in order to publish this drivel."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"This series started out so well. It had mystery, horror, and suspense to keep readers wanting to read more. Sadly, it has now gone downhill and in the gutter. The suspense and mystery has been replaced with soft porn and erotica. I'm really tired of reading about how long and lustrous someone's hair is or how Anita can't keep from wanting to tear someone's clothes off. I kept hoping the series would get back to its roots but each book has been worse than the one before lately. Sadly I will not be reading anymore as I've had enough. If I wanted to read erotica I would be looking for that. I however like suspense, mystery, and horror and this is none of those to me anymore"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I started reading the Anita Blake novels just to try something different. I enjoyed the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher and was looking for other contemporary fantasy authors. The earlier installments in the AB series were very fast-paced and imaginative novels. I was instantly addicted and couldn't put down the books.As I was going through Hamilton's earlier works, I also read the declining reviews from Cerulean Sins to the other novels that followed. I decided to move forward despite the mixed reviews. Unfortunately, this is a poor quality novel because it lacked much of the exciting elements from her previous works such as police work, solving crimes, etc. Instead, she replaced action and plot with nonsense fillers like hair, clothes, etc. Oh, let's not forget about the overabundance of sexual exploits. Sex is part of any good story but...geez. OK, so LKH likes very short men with long hair but let's move on. If I wanted to read about silly romance and sex, I could've just picked up a cheesy romance novel from the drug store.Where is the bad ass vampire executioner who shoots all the bad guys? Come back Anita Blake. Did LKH kill you? Not sure if I'm up to reading the rest of the books. So disappointing."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton, Cerulean Sins (Berkley, 2003)Wait, what? We're ten books into this series and Hamilton stops with the bar-name theme in her book titles? Yes, it's true, for the first time, she's named her book after something other than a bar, perhaps because the only one that features in the book is Circus of the Damned (which was, of course, already used). It could also be because, while she does get back into Anita's actual day job in this one (which begins with an appointment for a raising, and then a different actual raising), this is an even more soap-opera entry in the series than was Narcissus in Chains.Anita is still working, of course, and as I mentioned the book starts out with her having an appointment with an unsavory character (she thinks he may be a hitman) who wants to raise one of his ancestors to get some information about the family line. She then immediately heads out for another raising, to determine whether the deceased committed suicide for an insurance company. All of this is a mask, however, because it doesn't really get brought up again until the final few chapters. The bulk of the book concerns Musette's visit from France (and from Belle Morte); while it was set up in the previous book, Musette has broken with convention and arrived in town three months early. What's a girl and her vampire pals to do with someone who's obviously trying to unsettle them?I can only say pretty much what I said about the previous book in the series; it's still Laurell K. Hamilton, decently enough written to keep you turning the pages and, since you're already invested in the characters by this point, that should be enough to get you to read it. But for those who are interested more in the mystery angle of the series rather than the romance angle, this one will likely be a disappointment. And one other thing; why is it that detractors of the direction the series went during this period call it softcore? I've read less explicit porn. ***"},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I mindlessly read the entire book before I realized that it's just covering more of the same territory as the previous books. I think Obsidian Butterfly was the last one that I really enjoyed.There's no longer any suspense. All of her books involve a bad guy/guys who Anita triumphs over in the end. During the course of all of the books people/creatures are going to die and/or be tortured, some of them may even be Anita's \\"friends/soldiers/sex partners\\". The difference with the later books is that it's become difficult to feel any empathy for the characters, especially since they are all seen from Anita's increasingly twisted point-of-view."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"I am not a prude by any means and I love a good book. The first books in this series were good books (although Anita Blake was not always very easy to like). The last couple of books are nothing more than a most unlikable character having sex with anything that moves, and somethings that don't move! In one day she had sex every two hours and with complete strangers. And the descriptions are so graphic, they just are not nice to read. They just go on and on and on. Enough already!I enjoy the other characters, however it is difficult to read when she is just plain mean to the people who love her."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"All right, so in this book we have several subplots, as has become the norm for this series. The main plot has to do with vampires, as the book before focused on weres -- Narcissus and Chimera and the werehyenas, and Anita becoming Bolverk for Richard and so on -- and I bet the next book will focus on humans, in some way. The vampire plot here started with Belle Morte, the sourdre de sang (Source of blood, and though I love these characters and it fits them well, I still hate the French language) of Jean-Claude and Asher's bloodline. She has been negotiating an official state visit to St. Louis, and now she breaks the rules and sends her emissaries early, just to mess with our heroes. Stupid vampires. I loved that this book got deeper into the psyche of those stupid vampires; Belle Morte is the way she is because she considers herself the most alluring woman in the world, and she is confused and offended that there are two men who left her -- and since those two men are Asher and Jean-Claude, here she comes to St. Louis. She also believes that everything that she thinks belongs to her descendants also belongs to her; makes sense for someone so egomaniacal. So she wants Anita, specifically, and maybe Richard and the wolves and the leopards and anyone else who she feels like taking over or just messing with.So she sends Musette, a lovely little thing, who was a great character because she wasn't actually terrifying herself; in fact, she was kind of stupid. There's a great scene when she tries to insult Anita, and it doesn't work because Anita doesn't have the same values -- but then Anita insults Musette and cuts her to the quick without even trying, because Anita is not an idiot. The horrifying vampires in this book were Belle Morte, who possesses Musette in order to make an appearances in St. Louis despite being in France -- and I assume Hamilton did that so that Anita wouldn't have a chance to kill Belle Morte quite yet, as she seems to whack any vampire who appears in these books other than those in Jean-Claude's circle (And she kills some of them, too.) -- and the Mother of All Darkness, who has begun to awake, and who finds Anita interesting. She's particularly creepy, an effect carried off by the use of a nice little plot device: the creepiest vampire in this bunch, the child Valentina, thinks the MOAD is creepy. Creepy at one remove; I liked it. Anyway, Belle messes with our heroes again and again and again, with some limited success; I liked that Musette was the undoing of Belle's plans, and that the two child vamps, Valentina and Bartolome, show some honor and drift away from Belle and Musette.The subplots involve Anita bringing Asher into a menage a trois with her and Jean-Claude, which kind of worked but not completely; I liked that he and Anita had trouble dealing with their impasse, because I thought it kept true to the characters, but I dislike that there's an impasse. I got really ticked at Anita for being mad at Asher, but I also understood why she didn't want him rolling her mind; I was extremely happy when she worked it out in her head, and I hope the issue is resolved, now. Then there was the murders, which brought Anita into a final conflict with Dolph and his anti-monster prejudice; Dolph has finally gone off the deep end and now Zerbrowski's in charge of the unit. Probably a good thing, really, but I was sad to see Dolph go; I liked him in the beginning. The murders were nicely done, since they tied in to the main story. It made it easier to handle the limited space that was dedicated to the mystery itself, as so much of the book has to do with the vampires and the ardeur. Oh, one thing about that -- there's a rather difficult scene when Belle is messing with Anita's head, giving her ardeur lust and then bloodlust, and she can't keep herself from attacking either Jason or Caleb or Nathaniel, none of whom she wants to screw or eat at the moment, while they are speeding down the highway in a Jeep. And I just wondered: why didn't someone just knock her out? I know she's all hardcore and stuff, but come on: somebody could have clocked her in the head, and it would have been so much easier to deal with the situation then. Well, maybe they couldn't. Anyway, I liked the murder mystery and how they finally got to the solution, and I really liked how Anita ended it."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Anita has a falling out with the head of the local paranormal crimes unit, and traps him into admitting his prejudices against them, and being recorded. This is a distinct change in character from the first books, where she would be agreeing with him, most likely. More evidence of her completely distancing herself from normal humanity.Even more so when she has to deal with the ruler of Jean-Claude's vampire line and another even more powerful female vampire ruler.How do you fight this problem. Yep, you guessed it. Vampire threesome! Anita sandwich, or whatever you want to call it.Still, a semblance of a plot here, as well."},{"Title":"Cerulean Sins (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter, Book 11)","review":"Hamilton is at the top of her form in terms of what she does best -- staged sex on command. Poor, poor Anita Blake is forced by the demands of her magic to sate her appetite frequently and in all sorts of combinations. I'm not against that particularly, but it really gets to be repetitive and predictable."},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"My wife has a lot of medieval fantasy books. I don't much like the genre. But Days Dark as Night is different; indeed, it can hardly be called fantasy. It's much more historical fiction.That's because, as in, say, The Winds of War, the fictional characters exist in a meticulously-researched real world. The history, mores, technology, and language of the 13th century are painted vividly into this book.On top of that, you get a strong female lead character, but not one whose ideas are 700 years ahead of her time. So often, women in period fantasy seem like they were pasted in from Redbook. The heroine in Days Dark as Night is a) not an Amazon and b) motivated by her own experiences. She is conscious of inequities of the system but not on an anachronistic political rampage.So you really get two books here. One is a medieval fantasy piece with believable characters, both good and evil. The other is a fascinating work of history. They just happen to come in one cover for your convenience. That's quite a find!"},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"First, full disclosure: one of the authors was a grade school classmate of mine with whom I had not spoken for 40 years. When we recently reconnected she told me about her book. I bought it out of curiosity and because I remembered how smart and creative she was in school. My expectation that she would write a smart and creative book was not disappointed.The story is set in the 13th century in a fictitious Northern European island kingdom. While the historical details are grounded in research, documented at the end of the book in an \\"Authors' Note,\\" they don't get in the way of a gripping story of a conquered people persecuted by their conquerors to the breaking point. When they mount a violent rebellion, led by a charismatic peasant girl and a young lord who breaks with his family to side with the rebels, you won't be able to put the book down. In addition, there are fascinating excursions into medieval life describing feuding clans, relationships between lords and peasants, Christian heresies, wandering Jewish merchants, a weak king and clever, manipulative advisors. For those who like their stories spiced with some fantasy, there are some white-knuckle battles of the will between two magicians. Overall, this is a great read!"},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"This is an historically very well researched and still very exciting story of war and magic, religion and the lust for power, loyalty and betrayal, oppression and revolt, ideas, passion, love and revenge - all brought to life with good horses, broad swords, a beautiful powerful heroine, a strong handsome hero, a cool dwarf and yes, even an evil Cardinal and a couple of nice wandering Jews. The authors have done a good job fleshing out these and a variety of other characters, high and low, and furnishing their daily lives amidst the dramatic plots and historic events that drive the story. Watching the heroine's power and wisdom (and not coincidentally, her beauty) grow with experience is particularly satisfying. Also nicely done is how the importance of magic is handled - we don't know whether the magic is \\"real\\" or whether its power derives from the characters' belief in it, but either way it has real consequences in people's lives that could be sometimes as long and slow as the seasons and sometimes - often - noble, brutal, and short."},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"I have enjoyed the plot, characters and historical references. Can't wait for the last book of this trilogy. You will not put it down."},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"It is rare to find a book that is both an exciting adventure story and an informative work of history, but Days Dark as Night manages to accomplish this. There is a Michneresque attention to historical detail combined with &quot;edge of your seat&quot; story-telling. The book works on many levels: as a history, as a romance, and as fantasy. Even if you are not a fan of fantasy, you should consider this one."},{"Title":"Days Dark as Night","review":"As a first and rather obscure novel, I expected to dismiss Days as Dark as Night after a couple of chapters. Boy, was I wrong! Almost from page one, the characters, fast-paced story development, rich historical descriptions, and wonderful plot twists, combined to make this into a book that I literally couldn't put down. It has a few flaws, including a couple of slightly preachy asides about how merciless the Catholic Church was to heretics, and a few mildly cheesy moments between the heroine and her love interest.

He was put in induced coma as he was writhing & having bad time breathing. This happened because he was pulled of an anxiety medication abruptly which should never have happened if his doctors had read his medication list.The reason he was on this medication was because of a prior heart attack 2001 which did no real damage to heart. He had stents put in then in 2001 but not at CMMC. At CMMC, he was stabilized by Dr. Phillips, cardiologist, & then transported to MMC in Portland, ME. CMMC did not have the ability to do stents then, thank goodness!! Dr. Phillips did do a good job which is a lot more than I can say about the surgeons & anethesiologist in their fancy Cardiovascular (for profit) Unit! Back to 2004 ordeal-- Right after surgery , I was told he was in good shape & so was his heart, but 2 hours later he was writhing which is not good after bypass or any surgery for that matter..After 2 weeks & still writhing even though in coma & no indication that he ever was going to come out of this state & probably going to die, I managed to get a doctor from St. Mary's in Lewiston called in after begging the surgeon(Dr. Frumiento) repeatedly to call this M.D. & finally calling this M.D myself because this M.D. had prescribed this med. & knew that the medication should not have been stopped abruptly as it was . This M.D. managed to fix the medication problem and the writhing & coma ended. Then husband was put in CMMC Rehab for about 3 days & released in AM after having no physical therapy . That evening following his release he had a \\"panic attack\\" or so it seemed , as I had been told that he had these \\"panic attacks\\" in the Rehab Unit by the doctor & nurses there . I called the M.D. who was on the case but got M.D. on call & told to give him an extra lasix and Alprazolam/Xanax. . Things got worse that evening & wasn't getting anywhere with the M.D. from CMMC & so I called the M.D. from ST Mary's who told me to get him over to ER there. The ER doctor at St. Mary's said that he had Pulmonary Edema & was suffocating so of course he was panicked! He wanted to admit him there but because CMMC WOULD NOT RELEASE HIS RECORDS THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO TRANSPORT HIM BACK TO THAT HOSPITAL & SO WE WENT VIA AMBULANCE BACK TO THAT PLACE. HE STAYED THERE A FEW DAYS & RELEASED I was given no help upon release from there on how to follow now prescribed LOW SODIUM DIET--in fact was told by dietitian there anything organic was good. I knew better than that! Anyway, I took him to Brigham in Boston and was told by expert cardiologist to enjoy next 5 years--he was not given transplant option. When I got home got on PC found Megaheart.com and Don's book, & Healthy Heart Market. I had to send away for Low Sodium foods--very expensive & hard to find then. To make a long story short--my husband was told he couldn't climb stairs, well he can. I managed to get him down to Akumal, MX and he could snorkel 2005 & 2009!

However, current reprints of this dictionary (including this Hendrickson one, which I own) suffer from the blurriness of letters that inevitably comes from copies photographed from earlier copies or from editions printed with very worn old plates.While I know of no recent published dictionary that covers the Targumim, there is a very recent dictionary that covers Talmudic and Geonic literature, and incidentally contains much of the vocabulary of the Targumim. It is Michael Sokoloff'sA Dictionary of Jewish Babylonian Aramaic of the Talmudic and Geonic Periods. See my review of it for more details. However, its price puts it out of the range of all but the most serious students. So for those not yet prepared to shell out well over $100, Jastrow's dictionary remains the alternative--and not a bad one.I was surprised to see that one reviewer said that Jastrow lists words by root, because he does not, at least not as most people count this. Nouns such as _mas.s.uth_ are listed alphabetically, not under the root _ns.'_. The reviewer must be referring to the fact that the various verb stems are all listed under the Peal/G stem.

During that Exile, Israel found itself.It not only rediscovered the Torah and made it the rule of life, but under its influence new religious institutions, such as the synagogue, i.e., congregational worship without priest or ritual, came into existence - one of the most far-reaching spiritual achievements in the whole history of Religion.At the re-establishment of the Jewish Commonwealth, Ezra the Sofer, or Scribe, in the year 444 B.C.E. formally proclaimed the Torah the civil and religious law of the new Commonwealth.He brought with him all the oral traditions that were taught in the Exile, and he dealt with the new issues that confronted the struggling community in that same spirit which had created the synagogue.His successors, called after him Soferim (Scribes'), otherwiseknown as the \`Men of the Great Assembly', continued his work. Their teachings and ordinances received the sanction of popular practice, and came to be looked upon as halachah, literally, \`the trodden path', the clear religious guidance to the Israelite in the way he should go. When the Men of the Great Assembly were no more, the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem took their place. The delight of all those generations was in the Law of the Lord, and in His Law did they meditate day and night. When their exposition followed the verses of Scripture, it was called Midrash; and when such exposition followed the various precepts, it was known as Mishnah.Academies arose for systematic cultivation of this New Learning, as well as for the assiduous gathering of the oral traditions current from times immemorial concerning the proper observance of the commandments of the Torah. This movement for the intensive study of Scripture did not pass unchallenged. The aristocratic and official element of the population - later known as the Sadducees - unhesitatingly declared every law that was not specifically written in the Torah to be a dangerous and reprehensible innovation.The opposition of the Sadducees only gave an additional impetus to the spread of the Oral Law by the Scribes, later known as the Pharisees. What they sought was the full and inexhaustible revelation which God had made.The knowledge of the contents of that revelation, they held, was to be found in the first Instance in the Written Text of the Pentateuch; but the revelation, the real Torah, was the meaning of that Written Text, the Divine thought therein disclosed, as unfolded in ever greater richness of detail by successive generations of devoted teachers.\`Apart from the direct intercourse of prayer,' says Herford, \`the study of Torah was the way of closest approach to God; it might be called the Pharisaic form of the Beatific Vision. To study Torah was to think God's thoughts after Him, as Kepler said."},{"Title":"Luxury Airline Design (Luxury Books)","review":"Fantastic, luxurious book.

What do the victims have in common - if anything? This book isn't such much about the whodunnit, the answer is fairly obvious about halfway through, but more a study of the response of the administration and society to such a phenomenon in a huge, modern, metropolis. I must say, I found the treatment masterly - the usual high-quality writing of the authors, their feel for human responses (not something they are often associated with!), and the sure pace of the plotting in what must be considered to be a very successful thriller. The main downside for me is the exaggerated deference to Freudian psychoanalysis, but that was very characteristic of the time of publication (1949) to well into the '60s or even '70s. Having said that, at least the authors did their research and presented clinical thinking as it was - much more credible, for example, than the simplistic cod-psychology of Poirot.On balance, this is an exciting book that is well worth reading - not the best of Queen in my view - but a fascinating examination of a social problem that occurs too often in reality yet is rarely addressed in fiction - unless, of course, it involves Jack the Ripper!"},{"Title":"CAT OF MANY TAILS","review":"Maybe I was influenced by the mildly repugnant paperback cover of the 1965 edition I first read, but I still have a memory that this mystery has an unpleasant air about it.

There are some old favourites, such as Rupert, Ranaldinni and Taggie and Flora Seymour, but the author introduces a whole new array of characters and quite frankly, there are far, far too many to be getting to know properly.Once the sinister air of foul play starts creeping into the plot, this is when things start getting ridiculous. I see the author's point - to keep the readers guessing as to who the murderer is - but the climax, when we finally do find out, is so ridiculous and completely unbelievable that you are left wondering what the hell that was all about....??The &quot;love Story&quot; part of this book is also completely unbelievable, there is absolutely no warmth or chemistry between the two characters involved, this book is nothing like the magic that she has written before but, nevertheless, if you're on holidays and there's nothing else around, then it does while away a couple of hours.Come on Jilly, you can do much better than that."},{"Title":"Score!","review":"Well I've read just about every Jilly Cooper book going (sad, I know).

It's one of many useful tidbits of information to be gleaned from Jilly Cooper's new epic cultural romper-stomper of a blockbuster novel. Score! is the sixth tome from Cooper that is mainly set in Rutshire, her fictitious and unlikely English county. It is populated by handsome over-achieving men, gorgeous over-achieving women, two or three designer labels per page and lots of sex and intrigue. The score in Score! is this: big-shot conductor Sir Roberto Rannaldini's life ambition is to make a film of Verdi's opera, Don Carlos, with his godson director Tristan de Montigny. Both men attract beautiful women like flies to honey. A cast of dozens, most of whom loathe each other, coalesce as the film gets under way. Cooper can't write for toffee, but she has a fertile imagination and piles up the mystery. The first fifty pages or so are heavy going as the plot and characters are explained. There are lots of sentences filled with many commas as we learn who married who's neurotic ex-wife, and why, and what happened then, and what Sir Robert thought of it all. Still, Cooper has a bawdy sense of humour, and one wonders if much of her writing is done tongue-in-cheek: \`Baby's attempts only to kiss Hermione between her jutting lower lip and her chin came to nothing: she sucked in his tongue like a Hoover. \\"That woman could suck Tasmania back to the mainland,'\\" Baby said.

If you are seeking certification, then this is the book to get. I have corresponded with the author via email and he more than knows his material.

Some of them had three or four good chapters, but they also had a lot of \\"fluff\\" material and just did not cover the material in a logical manner. This is by far is best wireless security book published to date. Even more important than being a study guide, the book will become your permanent reference book when deploying solutions in the real world.The book covers a wide range of wireless networking security solutions including 801.x, 802.11i, DES, 3DES, AES, WEP, WPA, TKIP, PPTP & IPSec VPNs, wireless VLANs, EAP, EAP-TLS, LEAP and EAP-TTLS. It covers numerous Layer 2, Layer 3 and even Layer 7 solutions.The guide also has a great section on wireless security auditing tools. In addition there are several chapters that discuss the implementation of security policies and why corporations need wireless security policies in their company handbook.Although this book is the best wireless security reference book available, I would still highly recommend that you take the CWSP class which is about 80% lab with about 35 hours hands-on with the equipment. The guy who writes the tests for Planet3Wireless is the Marquis de Sade of test creators. He is sadistic, but bottom line is that I was forced to learn and understand the material and concepts.

I have to say that I found this book quite by accident and chose it because my brother once attended Pastor Church's Church in New York City and because it carried a very positive blurb by Harvey Cox. I am now on my second read and am enjoying it every bit as much the second time around. The book is a collection of ten interrelated essays all dealing with the profound issues involved in the search for meaning in one's life. I was staying with friends on vacation when I found this book and read an essay each day. I found myself reading whole passages aloud to them. I recommend this book strongly for those who find traditional Christianity lacking in depth and credibility. Church has given me a new way of looking at my life--as projects--and a much better way of looking at that which I refer to as &quot;God.&quot; It will add much to your life if you have questions unanswered in these areas of your life. And don't we all?"},{"Title":"Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday","review":"I would have read this in one day if I had the time. I had to tear myself away to do other things. Each chapter eases into it's theme, with humor, insight and awe. At first, seeing life as a series of projects seemed simplistic to me, but Forrest delves into these life projects and provides humorous and touching examples from his own life. Eventually, examining a life in this way acquires a deeper significance. As another reviewer noted, there are many great &quot;read aloud&quot; sections and a wonderful collection of breathtaking quotes from others. Forrest makes you feel his awe for the deep meaning that may be found in everyday life, when one lives mindfully. He demonstrates that a spiritual life is not the exclusive province of those who believe in the God of doctrinal religion. Even, if you are not caught up in Forrest's infectious enthusiasm by the third chapter, I guarantee that the last page of the book will blow you away."},{"Title":"Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday","review":"I READ THIS BOOK DURING A VERY DIFFICULT PERIOD IN MY LIFE, A TIME WHEN DISPAIR RULED AND THE FUTURE SEEMED DARK AND THREATENING.

Thank you, Dr. Church. Brin E. O'Reilly"},{"Title":"Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday","review":"I read \\"A Chosen Faith\\", which Forrest Church co-authored, several years ago, and enjoyed it. \\"Lifecraft\\" covers some similar themes that I find worthwhile, such as looking at the \\"self\\" as interactive mosaic, and avoiding idolatry, that is, excessive commitment to any principle or set of principles. Forrest Church has undoubtedly helped to improve my respect for Unitarian Universalism. Unfortunately, this book leaves me feeling that Forrest Church may not be the best exponent of that religious association.Regretfully, I found Lifecraft too stuffed with quotes, anecdotes, and metaphors to communicate clearly. The book diverges too much into examples that have the odor of bits and pieces that he's been impatiently waiting to put into print, such as running into Martha Stewart at an Egyptian ruin. Church's attempt to redeem Princess Di as a sister saint to Mother Theresa seemed to be a stretch; if I'd only had a better sense to where Church was stretching with this canonization, I might have been more tolerant.\\"Lifecraft\\" also struck me as self-serving, in spite of its attempts at self-deprecation. Church strikes me as rather self-righteous in his theism. He insists on defining \\"God\\" as whatever seems awe-inspiring to a person at any given time, discarding the obvious association of \\"God\\" to the Judeo-Christian tradition (which includes Islam). Once he defines God thus, he accuses non-theists of being short-sighted in their disbelief. I find this rather disingenuous, insofar as Church appears to be just as much an atheist as Nietzsche, even while strutting about before the world in the pious garb of a liberal theist."},{"Title":"Lifecraft: The Art of Meaning in the Everyday","review":"How can one not like a book with such a lofty purpose--to teach the craft of living, expecially when it evokes an image of Martha Stewart in the Egyptian tombs? Perhaps, it's not a dislike I'm trying to avoid but, rather, a suspicion of vacuousness. What is alarming, given the book's brevity, is that if the quotes and the metaphors were eliminated, the length would be decimated. To quote Emerson from his Journal of May, 1849, &quot;I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot; Metaphors are like grains of salt--a few are good; too many are ruinous. The author has crossed the ambit into brackishness. The metaphor of the facets of life as projects is especially labored. I'm sure my wife would bristle at being designated as one of my projects--many of which lie in bits and pieces in the basement. The use of a length of string to represent history and then identifying temporal events as a distance from one end is a cliche.

The maps have improved over previous years, but they could stand an extra one or two. Fortunately, the rest of the information is up to date, as it is the most-recently updated book (so far as I've seen).The other books, I'm sorry, .... Lonely Planet books are updated every eon, and they've got the prose style of a VCR instruction manual. Rough Guides, while quite literate, lack the phone numbers, dates, and times that are the bread and butter of budget travel guides. The Frommer's and Fodor's guides to Austria are a joke: they have few listings outside of 4 star hotels, and could have been written by the tourist offices! The point of Aus/Switz is its natural beauty, and appreciating that is facilitated by good info, not by spending cash.One note: the focus here is for the budget traveler. Those with money will benefit from this, as many of the most friendly places in Austria are cheap (like Privatzimmer and family-run Pensionen). However, the other, mostly older travelers who want to stay in posh hotels and would rather take a cable car than go hiking might want to get a book like Frommer's, or just do whatever the local tourist office tells you to do."},{"Title":"Let's Go 2001: Austria & Switzerland: Including Prague, Budapest, and Munich","review":"I bought this book for a trip I'm planning to Budapest, and unfortunately, while advertised as being a part of the book, my copy does not have the information on Budapest.

Then I discovered his commentary on Galatians. I have the tenth printing from 1890 London. The fonts are readable and clear. The book contains over 350 pages of scholarship on the six chapters of Galatians. It's a thorough commentary. Coupled with Luther on Galatians, we have a good glimpse into the history of commentaries on Galatians. References to Papias, Tertullian, Victorinus and many other Early Church Fathers are scattered throughout this commentary. He not only grasped the history and the Greek text, but he knows how to bring the Early Church Fathers perspective to bear when pertinent.The main text is presented is the actual Greek text (provided for him by Wescott & Hort before they actually published their text originally). After the Greek text he gives a word or phrase in Greek and then comments on it. A year of B-Greek is best for a full grasp of what he means by his comments. If you are exegeting through the Greek text you may want to keep this commentary open on your desk!Many great commentators on Galatians interact with the concepts that Lightfoot lays down. For example, on Galatians 6:2, Lightfoot discusses the probable interplay between the law Paul is discussing in Galatians (the law of Moses) and the stunning mention of the 'law of Christ'. I think that every commentator I have read, who is thorough, deals with the concepts Lightfoot mentions...with an effort given to defend any difference they have with his view. For example, Fung contends, after reviewing Lightfoot's position, that Paul is really more focused on the law of Christ as love, than as a replacement or interplay with the law of Moses. So the most current scholars all seem to either agree with Lightfoot or feel a need to explain why they would adjust what he says. He is not always mentioned in their articles, but if you read him first, you can see his influence clearly shining through.If you are interested in newer approaches of Historical Theology, then this book is essential for studying the historical views of Galatians in the late 19th and early to mid 20th century, because it played a huge part in the exegesis of Galatians during that time. Since it continues to be a force today, I would not be surprised to see a reprint of this by some publisher in the future.I am so happy I found a copy. I urge you to pick up a copy if you can find one. This is the commentary that almost all others still quote!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Red Moon","review":"Let me start off by saying that this book isn't like Walter Dean Myer's other books. Rather than being a story about urban life, this is a fantasy story that definitely takes place on another planet.My first encounter with the book left me feeling moved from the cover illustration (my edition of the book has a boy curled up in the wilderness against a red moon) and the title was moving too. I know they tell you not to judge a book by it's cover, but I was pretty convinced that this was a good book by that point. And you know what? I was right.In response to one of the reviewers here who claims that the book had boring parts, I say that I haven't found any boring parts. Even from the beginning of the book (which DID come with a bang!) I was feeling for the characters. The parts without action are when the main character is thinking about his past and therefore revealing more to the reader, or when the characters are bonding, and I always found that to be enjoyable to read.I'm not sure what age group this book can be placed in. The delivery (vocabulary, grammar, etc.) is simple enough for a twelve year old to read, and that's how old I was the first time I read the book. However, upon re-reading the book at fifteen, I found that I could understand the book much better, and therefore become emotionally attached to it. I wouldn't say that the subject matter is for young kids. To me, any book dealing with the apocalypse, the plague, abandoned children, suffering and even a little bit of drugs isn't for kids.Shadow of the Red Moon might be a little bit short, and I'm fully aware that Walter Dean Myers has written books that the critics have received better. But Shadow of the Red Moon certainly does not deserve to be out of print. It is an excellent book. To any Walter Dean Myers fan and even any fantasy fan, this book deserves a read from you. It might have been better if you had bought it while it was in print, because then we might have received an update on what the main characters are up to these days, but buy it anyways. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Red Moon","review":"I have listen to Emelia Earhart one,Searching for Davids Heart,nd right now this one. They are excellent!"},{"Title":"Shadow of the Red Moon","review":"The book Shadow of the Red Moon by Walter Dean Myers was a book I don't recommend. That is because Walter Dean Myers I think is a better writer when he writes about the inner city urban community. This book had its ups and it had its downs. At some parts there would be a lot of action and at other you would get bored really easy. Myers made it unique making Jon be half Fen and half Okalian. He was half of the enemy and half of the endangered race of humans. The beginning came with a bang and made you want to read more which I liked a lot but after a little bit it would start going from action to boring and back to action then boring. I thought the book was really weird to do that. I also thought they should of changed Kyra's name to something else that matched his attitude. Like he said in page eighteen \\"\\"Go away!\\" The boy spit his words out angrily.\\" I didn't agree with most of what the book said. It doesn't relate to one thing of real life because it is a fantasy book about prehistoric people. I definitely don't recommend this book to anyone because it doesn't have an exciting plot. I read this book because the cover persuaded me it looked like the name and the illustration had a powerful meaning.

Why bother with this tosh when you can read the doctors of the Church, the saints, the Holy See, and other goodies?"},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"I read Fulton Sheen's book a couple of years ago. While rereading it, many things come back to me which have pointed my life away from depending on the material, the immoral and the un-helpful ways of finding peace in friends and psychiatrists who have just about tried to separate me from the true faith Catholicism and to separate me from Jesus Christ. I find it quite interesting that the chapter of his where he compares psychology vs faith in the Healing Physician (ie Jesus Christ Himself) is very much the core of why people keep going to their shrinks when they might do better going to Holy Mass and meditating on where their souls are at the present time. My biggest recommendation to all is that our souls are the highest possession we have from God above, and that in communing with His Son and the Saints (esp Fulton Sheen, because I know he is in heaven and should be a saint) is our passport to heaven. I feel much gratitude to Fulton J Sheen, and will always be indebted to him and his teachings for where I am and who I am now. Peaceable and contemplative."},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"Bishop Sheen has done an outstanding job of bringing Christian revelation to bear on modern problems and modern understandings of the psyche and the soul. Sheen shows that Christian revelation about the soul is the only true answer to man's neurosis. The book is wholly, and entirely, Orthodox and represents the best of modern Catholic thinking. THe Catholic tradition of thinking has always been involved in an engagement of Christian revelation with contemporary intellectual thinking. Not only was a harmonization of the best of secular thinking and Divine Revelation achieved by St. Thomas Aquinas in the 1200's, but it was also the achievement of the Fathers of the Church as well. Sheen stands in this tradition, addressing pastoral and moral concerns of contemporary man. Sheen will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the finest pastoral theologians of this century."},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"ARCHBISHOP SHEEN DOES A REMARKABLE JOB OF SHOWING THE READER HOW THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO ACHIVE ABSOLUTE FREEDOM AND ARRIVE AT BEING A TOTAL PERSON IS THROUGH THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GRACE OF GOD ALMIGHTY. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL WHO ARE HURTING BOTH SPIRITUALLY AND MENTALLY AND WANT TO FIND TRUE &quot;PEACE OF SOUL&quot;."},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"In modern society, it is common for personal problems to be attributed to psychological makeup, and in particular to the paternal relationships of the individual. Anxiety, guilt, depression and other negative human experiences in general are not seen as the consequences of bad personal decisions but instead are linked to repressions of feelings that go back to early childhood. Freedom from these repressions--often translated into a license to do what one formerly resisted to do--is what constitutes the end of psychology as a means of improving mental well-being.Bishop Fulton Sheen acknowledges the usefulness of psychology and many of the methods used in the field to help individuals sort out their psychological problems. However, he also is critical of particular mindsets that accompany some of these methods. He disagrees with the view, common among many psychologists, that there is no sin. He also frowns on psychologists who separate feelings of guilt from wrongdoing committed. Bishop Sheen professes that besides psychological illness there is spiritual illness, which only can be healed by confession of sin as sin and the receiving of forgiveness, exemplified by the sacrament of confession.The first 2/3 of the book is heavily noted with references to Freud and terms associated with him and his followers (e.g. psychoanalysis, Oedipus Complex, unconsciousness, ID, Ego, Superego). These references are in some cases lengthy, the notes nearly as long as a chapter in itself. The information contained in these notes is quite informative, but the debate with Freudian thought results in several protracted arguments that cause the theme of how to attain peace of soul to fade temporarily.The last 4-5 chapters are the true gems of the work. It is here that conversion and the acquiring peace of soul through inner change receive central treatment.Overall, a Fulton Sheen work that offers astute commentary and worthwhile quotes."},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"I am a fond reader of science non-fiction and spiritual transcendental books and have always yearned for a book which can fuse this dichotomy. Mind you, souls and physics/origins of the universe great logic the 2 do not make! However one cannot argue that there are issues which science cannot answer and theologies which religions hold true. (that being the soul or our humanity)This book is able to convey the importance of the belief in souls/spirituality w/o referencing biblical fiction which would cross realms of scientific culpability (ie turning to salt or creating the world in 6 days). It simply reminds us of our humanity and that our human essence is not grounded in physical origin but rather in a place far greater than our physical existence. He also recounts the human error of solving many psychological problems with drugs rather than possibly sourcing it to something beyond the brain. That our being far exceeds the sum of our physical parts, and that in attending to this, we may truly find peace in this world as well as any others that follow.Of the many great excerpts from this book, one seems to resonate frequently - that our souls will not find peace in finite things of this world. That to truly find peace, we must find it in the infinite.There are many references to God that I believe a Christian reader can benefit from moreso than readers from a different theology. However a modicum of understanding of souls and spiritualism will benefit many other readers as well.All in all, I believe this book is truly uplifting - and I'm not talking endorphin and serotonin rushes here - Fulton is able to truly center on that &quot;something else&quot; which makes you human and brings you to a place so great that makes you KNOW that you can LIVE and DIE in peace.GODSPEED.."},{"Title":"Peace of soul","review":"Beeeeeeeeautiful! One feels blessed while reading the delightfully estute and directional offerings of Fulton. It even makes one not fear any challenges it may present. It's insight makes me laugh out loud.The Native Americans, Twelve Step guru's, Hindu's, Jews, Taoists, all know that we need guides and mentors else we become lost and half of our selves. We become flat, half-dead and we can definitely feel it. We even grow to not mind the half dead feeling thinking it is just natural human moods.We all must encounter Rites of Passage and that is why the Catholics have the sacraments.It has been scientifically PROVEN that the state of Peace is the most beneficial to the human body. Not just the mind - the body. The Twelve Steppers say, \\"Bring the body, the mind will follow.\\" Fulton knows that our minds are always trying to return to Peace so the act of constantly understanding what we each do personally that distracts us from the blessed state of peace, must be understood. We must understand how to Transition back to Peace. I believe the Catholic church is now going to call The Eucharist (Thanksgiving) the Sacrament of Transition. If Jesus of Nazareth is really the Prince of Peace, and I mean inner peace, than this is a welcomed new title for Communion. They are not erasing the names Eucharist or Communion, just adding that the receiving of it - will transition the receiver back to Peace. Faith, Hope, Love, Charity, etc. are all under the umbrella of Peace.I think it is very smart and wise that the Catholic faith intends to keep our minds engaged on spiritual matters and contains pools of spiritual discussion, practice and thought. It attempts to engage us so we have less time to focus elsewhere. (So, sister Joseph Anne...was right after all)It's a wild thing to believe the whole, Father, Son and Holy Spirit trifecta and all that it entails. But if your body feels it...you can't deny that something is there. May I suggest you spend one hour a week in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament. Find a church that hosts the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. Remember when we were kids and it felt like punishment to sit there in church before it. Woah....do it now. Tell me it doesn't blow your mind. Don't be suprised if you find yourself wanting to skip along the street instead of walking....just like when you were a child.God Bless this modern day prophet who thankfully will be canonized a saint any day now. Modern day saints must exist to distract us from the antithesis. They become the magnet for our eyes, hearts and minds...as Jesus would say...\\"The better part!\\" Aside from all the grossly unfortunate corruptions that have been exposed in the Catholic ORGANIZATION over the past few years, I have found the Catholic FAITH the real deal spiritually. At base it is all about moderation, joy and yes, the most blessed state. Peace. The Prince of Peace...and anyone who chooses to receive that blessings knows the source.

I particularly liked their recipes for \\"double dough\\" (p.82)--far more explicit, including drawings, than the Wei-Chuan books and also far more variations: red bean paste, pork and white radish filling, etc.If there are any drawbacks to this dim sum cookbook, there are two: one is the pictures, which are very mid-80s and somewhat amateurish.

This one belongs to none of them. If you are looking for a book which boosts your creativity but yet still teaches a few tricks &amp; technique, this will be the one.Chap 1: Makeup as Self-discovery - This part is an autobiography of her life as a makeup artist. A fun part to read to know her makeup philosophy. I often find that it is good to understand an artist's philosophy before start reading her book. (e.g, Some people dislike Bobbi's book because they think that the looks are boring. But by reading the introduction, you would know her appreciation for natural beauty and that book is actually for everyday makeup.)Chap 2: Basics - This part is no basics! There are a few of step-by-step photos but not many. Most important of all it shows the techniques of wearing makeup. E.g, different ways to apply eye shadow, different placement of blush to correct face shapes and some lip color mixing tricks. It doesn't teach you one method as in Bobbi Brown's book. It rather gives you a few ways and let you decide on your own.Chap 3: Glamourizing Technques: It features some perioud makeup info and some glamourizing techniques. There's a step-by-step guide to smoking eyes, a comprehensive info on contour, putting on false lashes, etc. This part is nice if you want something beyond everyday look. It's quite easy to follow.Chap 4: Freestyle makeup- Linda Mason is an advocate of freestyle makeup- a style which has no rules at all, you just apply color with your intuition. You may not like every photo in this section, but I think one should always appreciate the creativity in her. This part is truly an art. You must see with your heart but not only your eyes. This chapter is the gallery of her 'art'. At the end of this chapter, she would also tell you what do use in freestyle makeup.Chap 5 + Chap 6: Professional Makeup &amp; Becoming a Makeup Artist-These 2 parts are particularly for aspiring makeup artists. It tells you some work information, e.g, working on location, how to start out and the makeup kit. Not really everything you need to know, but it is good if you want to see a general picture of the industry.Generally speaking, I like this book very much. As I have mentioned above, you may not agree with every picture in it. Some pictures are too old fashion in today's eyes, or you just don't like some of the freestyle makeup. However, you can definately see the creativity in Linda Mason towards makeup. She does not conform to any rules, any color spectrum. Her passion for colors matches my makeup philosophy very much, that's also a reason why I like her book so much. Moreover, being an aspiring makeup artist without much basic knowledge, this book gives me some good advices but not premade beauties as in Kevyn Aucoin's or NARS's book. It really encourages creativity. I would recommend people who want to learn about makeup techniques but not looking for premade looks (if you want something to follow, try Kevyn's Making Faces and NARS) and those who really believe in makeup as an art form. However, if you are a professional looking for technical tips, e.g, lighting, or ingredients in makeup, this is not what you are looking for."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"What a great make up book by a professional make up artist!!!!Linda Mason takes us behind the scenes at fashion shows and photo shoots and makes the reader feel like her friend &amp; apprentice.The stories, the tips, lessons , photographs and hand done illustrations are all superb&amp; informative.

I amthinking that it was the author's intent to share the oldphotos to give an account of the history she's had with theindustry?Anyhow, it was the first time I heard of the concept ofhaving a \\"basic four color palette\\" to create fournew colors - (p.67 a brown shade in cream texture,a gloss in yellow, a pale shade such as coral-pink,a bright color such as vibran red) - and also the firsttime I realized how much money I had wasted on all mymakeup products I have been amassing!And this concept totally gave me the insight that it'snot about those blues, greens I need for my eyeshadows -it's all about the skin tone colors working together!!!(Although it was Bobbi Brown products and salespeoplethat yellow-base was good for the skin... this isn't thesame thing!)Some of the very fashion-editorial type photos didn'treally help me on a practical level... but it was quitefun and liberating to view makeup as an extension ofexpressing oneself, almost like a fine-art painting usingyour face as canvas. For most everyday people looking forsensible application of makeup probably won't get much outof the Freestyle makeup chapter though... They look likeclowns or Picasso's women from bathers of Avignon, ie. Africanmask-like...But I decided to buy the book because I was so eager to learnabout the different ways of dressing the eyes; I felt this bookhad more to offer than Kevin AuCoin's book on treating the eyes.I especially love the distinctions made for... The Sultry Eye (p.85),The Doe Eye, The Cat Eye, The Smoky Eye. The book includes manyversions of the smoky eye (soft&simple;, a little more, deep smoky,strong&sexy;, and neutral smoky layers). This was also the first timeI ever saw of a makeup book include a very very clear illustrationof how to do the Marilyn Monroe's eyeliner -- the drawing on p.87is quite helpful for beginners like me to see how the line is achieved.Unfortunately, this is not the definitive book on contouring...Contouring is explained on pages 94-95, but it's mostly text,and only 3 photographic sources are given using one model. So if you'rea beginner who wants to learn more about contouring, I suggest youcheck out Rober Jones's website and books and DVD.The latter section of the book deals with practical advice for professionalmakeup artists - things like working on location, working onlocation in the city, in hot climates, in any weeather,fashion shows, advertising and other commercial work are covered,including makeup for brides (unfortunately, the photos are not thatup-to-date nor inspiring) and fees and compensation.

General-interest libraries with beauty sections will welcome a basic primer packed with color photos, step-by-step application tricks and tips, and a knowledge of bone structure, color, and makeup for different ethnic groups. Very highly recommended.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"This book is fun. The author shares her story--from being a young girl enchanted by her mother's makeup rituals to a budding makeup artist making mistakes along the way to the now successful artiste. She shares some basic and glamour techniques and devotes a portion of the book to freestyle makeup. There are chapters dedicated to assisting the reader in developing a career as a makeup artist.This book is enjoyable. The freestyle section is not at all practical but demonstrates the author's free and creative spirit. If you are looking for a make-up practicum, this is definitely not it. While her instructions are minimal, her diagrams are helpful. However, if you want to change your look and are not afraid to play, this is a great guide."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"I didn't think I would love this book as much as I did Kevyn Aucoin's works, but I was sooooo impressed by it I'm recommending it to everyone I know who's interested in makeup. Linda Mason is truly an artist, who uses face as her canvas. The book is very educational, as well as inspirational. Some might find her techniques to be dated, but she has written her techniques to show what kind of different things you can do with makeup, and don't necessarily have to follow rules. Her technique for creating the smoky eye look is brilliant and very clear. I also found her section on being a pro makeup artist very helpful....her list of what should be in a makeup kit is very accurate. All in all, I give this book five stars because of the wealth of info you can get from it."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"I saw the author on a morning talk show, and was very eager to read her makeup tips. But the book contains very little guidance on how to put on makeup. What little is said is so poorly written that it is almost incomprehensible, and the author does not offer any advice on specific makeup products or brands. Moreover, most of the book is devoted to advice on how to make a career out of doing others' makeup, and to details about the author's career--which are given in an almost ridiculously egotistical way, right down to referring to herself in the third person. I feel I wasted the money I spent on this book."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"The book was in perfect condition and was received promptly.

I don't think this is in the same league as Kevyn Aucoin, but there is some interesting stuff in here. Some of the looks do seem a bit dated, and there seem to be more photos from the late 1970s and through the 1980s, so you have the colors and intense diagonal blush, etc. There are some interesting tips, such as applying blush in a vertical smudge to create length, etc., and while I'm not going to be applying fake gems to my eyebrows or painting a stripe of bronze down the side of my face any time soon, it's interesting to look into and read the book and see someone painting outside conventional lines. It's fun and worthwhile for that alone. A little bit of the avante garde never hurts."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"...Not for little kids or conservative types wanting to do the same old hackneyed thing. If you're a secret little superfreak in the making, get her makeup book for teens. Linda Mason is an artist and painter and at times there are few boundaries between the face, body, and canvas. Her covers are actually quite modulated compared to what you'll find inside. I almost didn't buy her books at first because of the covers, but I'm so glad I took a chance. She makes your mind take leaps beyond. That's what good art books ought to do. Her range is amazing--she can do uber glam and fun and girly and smouldery and crazy. I've referred to her books multiple times for day time ideas on myself, as well as for theatrical or film ideas."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"I found this book a delight to follow for a variety of reasons. The artist is definitely skilled and quite creative with her designs and use of color. This makes for a gorgeous array of artistic photographs throughout the book and shall be enjoyed no matter what your reason was for picking this book up.The level of skills described are more suited for a beginner I think. Still, if you're a pro or thinking of becoming one, she shares lots of tips on getting started, building professional relations with photographers and models, professional makeup, etc. Everyone can benefit from it.I myself am what one would call a girly-girl. I enjoy makeup and find it very amusing as a pastime, however, I'm most definitely not a pro. I was looking for a book that would give me some pointers and I definitely found what I was looking for here. The instructions on how to create the perfect smoky eye (I could never do it before) alone was worth the price of the book for me. Linda Mason's results on her models are very easy to recreate since her sketches are very simple and so, quite easy to follow. It's refreshing to find an artist that holds no tips or instructions back from her readers and instead chooses to &quot;educate&quot; them wholly. I salute Linda and I truly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Makeup: The Art of Beauty","review":"The author is extremely generous with information and with her spirit.

Fast-paced, this action packed novel takes your emotions on a roller coaster with just one more twist at the end."},{"Title":"Deadbeat (P. I. Mysteries Ser.)","review":"This novel was a lot of fun for the reader despite trying too hard at times to attain erudition. No one talks like that all the time. Still a lot of the humor works and the characters are just larger than life enough to push the story along. This isn't hard-boiled realism by any means but it's a fun ride anyway. There's even a lightly applied but touching comment on fathers and sons. I was surprised to find, as I thumbed through the book, that it was written by Clay Harvey of &quot;A Flash of Red&quot; _fame. The action is furious and kind of cinematic and the plot, revolving around the search for a &quot;deadbeat&quot; Dad moves right along despite getting a little boggy.The author knows how to use action to unstick a gooey storyline.

Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Cody \\"Blister\\" McGraw tries to engage the services of private investigator Connor Gibbs. The nine-year old child desperately wants Connor to locate his missing father, Noah Sizemore. In exchange for accepting his case, Blister offers Connor his entire savings that he accumulated over the past three years. Unable to resist the offer of $67.12, perhaps because his ex-wife rarely allows him to speak with his own child, Connor accepts the case.Connor soon learns the family background. While Noah was bowling and drinking with friends, his pregnant wife drives herself to the hospital to give birth. On the way, a drunken driver crashes into her car. She gives birth by herself just before dying. The driver Able Johnson just about gets away with vehicular homicide. Two years later Noah kills another driver by running him off the road. Noah jumped bail and everyone is looking for him. Connor soon finds himself threatened by various thugs in his quest to locate Noah. Though preferring nonviolence, nothing will deter Connor from satisfying his client.Connor Gibbs is definitely no DEADBEAT as he may be the best character found in a mystery in several years. The story line is amusing, witty, and interesting especially the relationship between Connor and Blister. Leo Atkins has a winner that deserves wide reader attention. That should encourage the author to bring readers more tales starring the former Duke University giant, Connor.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Deadbeat (P. I. Mysteries Ser.)","review":"Note: My rating is for all three of the Leo Atkins novels taken as a whole, not just this one. Had I stopped after one, my rating would have been higher.I've now read all the Leo Atkins (aka Clay Harvey?) novels, and he can't seem to choose between schmaltz on the one hand, and gratuitous &amp; graphic violence on the other. (He also has an irritating penchant for throwing in words he seems to consider &quot;erudite&quot; but which make it seem as though he's writing with a dictionary at his elbow.)I think Mr. Atkins needs to decide who his target audience really is, and stop trying to have it both ways. Does he want to show positive relationships between men and children (with a bit less sentimentality, please), or does he want to stick to numerous gore-fests in each novel? To use both is really an abuse of reader patience."},{"Title":"Deadbeat (P. I. Mysteries Ser.)","review":"If Leo Atkins wanted to write a story about Ninja warriors, he should have. The original story is a good idea. A little boy goes to a private detective in the hopes of finding his father. The good ideas end right there. Between the graphic descriptions of the fighting (all the characters except the little boy himself are portrayed as expert Ninja type fighters), and the horrible choice of words, there just is NO hope for this book. Here's a good example: &quot;...his objet d'amour rolling away to perform an excretory function...&quot; or how about this one: &quot;Faces turned, lips curled into contumelious sneers.&quot; What the heck is contumelious? I didn't even bother to look it up. If you have to look up a descriptive word, the author should not have used it. And the best one: &quot;&quot;Groan,&quot; he said, onomatopoeitically.&quot; I am not kidding. This book was an absolute literary disaster. Author Leo Atkins should not give up his day job.

Out of this period came a large number of works on Anglicanism, such as commentaries on the 39 Articles and books about the Book of Common Prayer, whose immense scholarship continues to amaze me and to be very profitable.One of these works is Evan Daniel's \\"The Prayer Book: Its History, Language, and Contents.\\" Like Blunt's work, \\"The Annotated Book of Common Prayer,\\" Daniel's work is an encyclopedia of information on the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. (In spite of the amount of detail in Daniel's work, Blunt's work contains even more!) Some editions of Daniel's \\"The Prayer Book\\" run to almost 700 pages of small font type.\\"The Prayer Book\\" does just what you expect it to: it discusses every part of the Book of Common Prayer in order, in some detail. If you're looking for a better understanding of where parts of the Prayer Book came from, how they've changed, and what they mean then you'll find your answers here. Daniel's \\"The Prayer Book\\" is a handy, one volume introduction to the Book of Common Prayer. It manages to be both comprehensive and in-depth at the same time - all in one volume.While you can get an idea of what Daniel covers by looking at the Table of Contents of a Prayer Books, here are some highlights of Daniel's work. First, he provides a rationale for the use of a Prayer Book, and then he provides a lengthy history of the development of the Prayer Book that will satisfy all but specialists. Daniel doesn't only discuss the use of the Psalter but also provides a useful list of obsolete words and difficult passages in the Psalter.After presenting a discussion of the Prayer Book in order (which takes up the majority fo the book), Daniel adds an interesting section on Questions for Candidates into Church Training Colleges from 1896 to 1899. He concludes with a more than 100 page discussion of the 39 Articles.I highly recommend it to students of Anglicanism."},{"Title":"101 Supershots: Every Golfer's Guide to Lower Scores","review":"Contrary to the title of the book, this is not \\"every golfer's guide to lower scores.\\" In fact, only a small subset of golfers will be able to put these lessons to effective and efficient use.

Luckily, the story stands strong against the title. This is a more sprawling work than Holman's The Dress Lodger. While its geographic base is pretty focused, rarely leaving the small town it is set in, the story spins through a large number of characters and several major plotlines, including a pending farm foreclosure, a Presidential election, the aftermath of a divorce, the birth of 11 babies to one mother, a spiritual crisis, several mid-life crises, unrequited love, a growing relationship between a teacher and his pupil though whether it tends toward good or bad remains up in the air for a while, and of course, the creation and transport of the mammoth cheese itself. That's a lot to tackle and Holman admirably handles the load. As one might expect with so many characters, some are not as fully fleshed out as one would like. The history teacher and the ex-husband in particular I thought were a bit weak in their portrayal, as is the mother of 11 until somewhat later in the book. While their lack of full depth is noticeable, it does not detract over much from the work as a whole. And their somewhat shallow development is more than made up for by the rest of the characterization, which is deeply satisfying. One begins to care for and root for these characters early on. We take on their hopes and desires along with their despair and fear. The woman desperately trying to hold onto her farm and family, the Jefferson impersonator trying to figure out who he is behind his persona, the minister struggling with his recent decisions and his possible motivations, eventually the mother of 11, and perhaps most of all, the young daughter struggling to find herself among and sometimes in spite of all these adults surrounding her. The tension steadily rises throughout the novel as questions come nearer their answers, answers which Holman skillfully manages to not foreshadow too obviously. And because we care about the characters, we care greatly about the answers. There are moments that are truly terrifying, especially as one moves toward the close. It seems lately that my biggest complaint about recent books, even ones I loved such as Lovely Bones or Bel Canto, is that so many of them have had poor or even terribly endings. I'm happy to say this book broke the trend. The ending here is not only earned by what has gone before, but is the best part of the book. Another complaint I've had a lot lately is that so many characters in a lot of recent books have acted not as real people would but in ways to service the plot. Once again, The Mammoth Cheese shines as the opposite. all of the characters, even the small ones, even the ones not so well drawn, at least act human. They do dumb things, they doubt, they make mistakes, they get lucky. and because we can recognize ourselves in their thoughts and actions we care even more about what happens to them. I wouldn't call this a great book or say as some reviewers have that I couldn't put it down though I never considered doing so. It did bog down in two or three places, though only briefly, and as mentioned, some characters were too sketchy for my liking, but even in the slow parts I wanted to read on because I wanted to know what happened to these people. More than wanting to know, I wanted the right things to happen to them. I won't say if they did, but it's worth finding out."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"As I was reading Sheri Holman's new novel, THE MAMMOTH CHEESE, on the subway, I received countless comments from strangers on the book's title. \\"THE MAMMOTH CHEESE,\\" more than one person said to me, \\"What's THAT about?\\" Although many of the novel's situations --- and certainly its title --- are rather absurd, the novel touches on themes that are anything but silly.Sheri Holman, whose previous novels, A STOLEN TONGUE and THE DRESS LODGER, were set in Palestine and England, respectively, here writes a novel that is not only American in its setting and scope but also quintessentially American in its themes of self-reliance, family obligation and, most importantly, independence. In many ways THE MAMMOTH CHEESE is an extended meditation on the concept of independence, explored through the examples of several carefully drawn small-town folks from rural Three Chimneys, Virginia.There's Manda Frank, part of Three Chimneys's most notorious white-trash family, who finds herself the mother of eleven babies after a fertility drug proves a little too effective. Counseled by her pastor to keep all the babies, Manda is completely bewildered by her new responsibilities. When some of the babies start to die, Manda is torn between anguish at her loss and relief at the prospect of regaining the freedom she has always valued and the ability to hunt and roam the woods with her beloved dogs, a freedom that motherhood seems to have stolen entirely.Also struggling with his own independence is August Vaughn. By day, August is a farmhand on Margaret Prickett's small dairy farm. By night, he dresses up as Thomas Jefferson to interpret Jefferson's life and writings to audiences of locals and tourists alike. Even though August reveres the man famous for writing the Declaration of Independence, he is unable to declare his own independence. He's in thrall both to his parents, with whom he has lived as an adult for more than twenty years, and to his long hidden and unrequited love for Margaret.Margaret, too, must define what independence means to her. Recently divorced from her husband, she's struggling to keep her small dairy farm afloat while raising her 13-year-old daughter Polly, protecting her from the corrupting influences of modern life. Margaret has pinned all her financial hopes on newly elected President Adams Brooke, who has run on a platform of granting debt amnesty to America's small farmers. As a dramatic expression of her gratitude, Margaret is determined to present President Brooke with a 1,200-pound cheese, a gesture reminiscent of a gift given to Jefferson during his presidency. Soon, though, the mammoth cheese gets out of Margaret's control, and she must decide how far to take the media circus that ensues.Finally, there's Polly, Margaret's teenage daughter, who loves her mother fiercely but feels lost in the wake of her parents' divorce and the drama of her mother's struggles to save her farm. She is drawn to her history teacher, Mr. March, whose favorite Jeffersonian motto is \\"Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God.\\" Mr. March paints himself as a radical and encourages Polly to rebel, but it soon becomes clear that his interest in Polly is more sinister than a desire to help her gain her independence.Amazingly enough, all of these threads do come together during the Mammoth Cheese's pilgrimage to Washington, D.C. Without being preachy or predictable, THE MAMMOTH CHEESE manages to incorporate some big ideas about the nature of independence and the character of America.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I cannot recall the last time I read as entertaining and smart a book as the Mammoth Cheese. It's a really smart book about family, destiny, love, and, alas, the government and the ways in which power is obtained and maintained. All of this manifest's in young Polly March's life and a far as narrators go, I haven't come across as interesting a young woman since I read Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye. Sheri Holman nails the sense of a girl beginning to think and live her own life so vividly that I could not put the book down. I was just riveted.This is a big, important, lovable, endearing book. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"Is it my imagination, or is it getting harder and harder to find mainstream literary fiction that doesn&#65533;t stink? Fortunately, just as my cynicism is just about to peak, along comes Sheri Holman and The Mammoth Cheese. Holman&#65533;s manages to be witty, complex and absorbing all at once. Her novel brilliantly weds personal and political themes in a way that seems utterly natural. In fact, it is natural to wed personal and political themes, and the real genius of this book is to show how political corruption and neglect trickle down to the personal level, and how personal corruption and neglect affect the larger political scene. But never once does the novel come across as ponderous or affected. You&#65533;ll keep turning the pages not because of Holman&#65533;s sophisticated ideas but because the book is just so fun to read."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I've read this and The Dress Lodger. Consider this a comment on them both.Sheri Holman's characters are, each and every one of them, beautifully flawed. They are drawn out to the very detail, and she never ever takes the easy way out and makes them just good or bad. The plots she comes up with are far-fetched and bizarre, but she does this with incredibly real characters, which, if you ask me, makes for incredibly well-written novels."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"There have been several reviews which deal very well with the plot, so I will not replicate it here, except to say that the two major events, the arrival of the 11 live born multiple-birth babies and the manufacture of the title's mammoth cheese are the central events of this well crafted novel. But the real richness of the book is in the fabulous characters that Sheri Holman gives us to sympathise with, get annoyed with, and ultimately feel some satisfaction with.And they are great characters too. There is poor Manda who finds herself in IVF hell. There is Margaret, the somewhat eccentric cheese maker who clings to the old life and her somewhat prickly teenaged daughter Polly. There is August the Jefferson devotee and his father the Pastor who somehow seems to be in the middle of all that drives the town and the people who live in it. By the end of the book you feel as if you know these people quite well, and I find that it is this talent that makes me really enjoy a novel.There have been some criticism of elements of this book, and it certainly isn't perfect, but it is a really lovely story, well written, and I am happy to recommend it."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"This is by far the best novel I've read this year. I don't know where Sheri Holman's talent comes from but I suspect it's otherworldly. Her gifts for characterization, her flawless writing and her beautiful yet horrifying story kept me up all night. I literally could not put this book down. Nothing but raves and praise here - I'm going to find her other book, The Dress Lodger, just as soon as the bookstore opens. Read this book. Read this book. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"Here is America with all its warts and all its faults, in the microcosm of Three Chimneys, Virginia, a tiny rural town with a population less than 800 souls.Something enormous has put Three Chimneys on the voracious radar screen of the nation and the press: ordinary blue-collar hunting-dog trainer Manda Frank has given birth to 11 babies, known as the \\"Frank Eleven.\\" No matter whether or not the babies are healthy, whether the poor couple wanted all these babies, or what will happen to them--they are now celebrities, along with the entire starstruck town.What happens to push the Franks off the radar and replace it? None other than the desperate move of one woman, Margaret, who is struggling to keep her family-owned farm against all odds. Margaret makes the finest cheese...and to call attention to her plight and the plight of so many other family farmers faced with extinction and foreclosure, she decides to replicate a stunt from Thomas Jefferson's day and create a 1200-pound \\"mammoth cheese\\" to be ferried to Washington as a gift for the President.How this noble cause becomes perverted by local personal interest, the press, the pastor, and just about everything and everybody else is the center of this hilarious but disturbing book. We see the facetious and sometimes horrifying modern-day obsession with fame and fortune through the eyes of Margaret's only daughter, 13-year-old Polly, who is under the influence of her cynical and smarmy history teacher, Mr. March.All in all, a simply brilliant, albeit very upsetting, look at the underside of all that is good about America and society in general. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"In Sheri Holman's previous work, A Stolen Tongue and The Dress Lodger, it's been noted how informed the novels are by Holman's diligent research and attention to detail. With a contemporary setting, I wondered before reading The Mammoth Cheese how she would put her research to work.And yes, there's the issue of multiple births and plenty of historical reference; these should have satisfied the author's penchant for holing herself up in the library. But it's Holman's attention to the details of the heart, the authenticity with which she creates her principal and supporting characters, and the clear-eyed but affectionate way that she describes life in a small town that makes this novel come to life.A wonderful story, told with remarkable skill. Holman has done a marvelous job, infusing the story with trenchant observations of politics and contemporary values, without ever taking away from the sincerity of her characters' hopes and desires."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I'm a big fan of Holman's earlier book, The Dress Lodger. And I'm happy to report this book is, at least plot-wise, nothing like it. But that's not a bad thing at all. Instead, Holman harnesses her considerable humor and wordsmithing to create a well-spun, character-driven paen to the joys and troubles of modern small-town life.Veering between descriptions of the main character's cheese farm (does not sound interesting, but is!), a presidential campaign, a family blessed (and cursed) by multiples births and a Lolita-like relationship, Mammoth Cheese is a big mouthful of a book. But Holman's ability to use well-honed facts, quirky characters and interesting plotting makes it all come together. I can't wait to see what she does next!"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I like the ridiculously quirky humour of the characters and personalities of this small town; the meteoric rise to fame of an otherwise unremarkable couple who become parents to 11 children; the cashing-in on said fame by the local politician running for re-election; and the ordinary dairy-farmer's assistant by day, Thomas Jefferson-impersonator by night, to name a few. Yet, there are those poignantly serious parts to the storyline - the breakdown in communication between mother and teen-aged daughter, the dark thoughts that accompany post-natal depression in a young mother, and the sardonic teacher who captures a school girl's fancy. Filled me with nostalgia for my home country."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"Holman is not only a very good writer, she is a highly original and eclectic one. Her novels absorb, amaze and, in this instance, amuse. Each takes place in a dramatically different setting and tackle different ideas, but all are linked by Holman's uncanny voice and attention to telling detail. Go ahead, grab this book or any other Holman novel, and you'll embark on an unexpected and enlightening ride that left this reader marveling about Holman's imagination and breath of knowledge."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"This is a good read, but I wouldn't go as far as &quot;couldn't put it down.&quot; The themes of separation, survival, growing up, growing old, and love in all its strange forms are all interwined into an interesting yet at times almost silly story. A Jefferson impersonator, the multiple-birth of 11 babies, a cynical high school teacher, a female dairy farmer, and an Episcopal priest all make for interesting characters; however, the circumstances they find themselves in are a stretch for the reader to believe. And the making of a mammoth cheese to present to the president of the U.S. just didn't do much for me -- in fact, the whole presidential election bit was a bit weak in my opinion. In short, it's entertaining and thought-provoking in places, but overall rather unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I got this book purely by accident when I forgot to mail in my book club notice warning them not to send me this month's selection! So I came on Amazon, read the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did because this book is a wonderful little treasure. The characters are wonderfully drawn, and not in that annoying &quot;small-town cliche&quot; sort of way. Each is unique and complex and I truly cared about them all! Holman's writing is witty and smooth and the characters are unforgettable, especially the young Polly Marvel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"The author chose to write the book with a third person, removed narrator, who tended to give an overview of the very interesting, and usually funny, goings on in the town. This prevented the author from revealing the inner thoughts of the characters at times. This was particularly true of the mother of the eleven babies. The narrator gave us the information, for the most part, that the mother would allow to be known, if a real person. While this added to her character development in someways, I wanted more insight into her thoughts (and her husband, too.)One interesting aspect was the pastor's realization that his messages from God were tainted by the filter of his own self-interest. I came to like this character very much.A good read."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"The virtues of this book include an intelligent and perceptive narrative voice, and characters with depth and complexity who grow in the course of the events. All except one, villainous Harvey March, the only Jew and only villain in the book, and not just the Jew but the small dark Jew, arrogant and sneering, a charismatic junior high school teacher who manipulates and seduces his thirteen year old students. It's no accident that the Jew is the villain. Harvey March is obsessed with the idea of transgression, an idea which he urges on and practices on his students. The connection is that as a Jew he is an outsider (his students even think he looks like a spy), bitter and resentful. Asked if he's Christmas shopping, \\"'My tribe doesn't celebrate Christmas,' Harvey explained, just as he'd had to explain to everyone over the years, that he belonged to neither the Episcopal nor the Baptist church. And no, he wasn't Methodist either... Christmas was the hardest of all seasons on an exile like Harvey March\\" (298, hardcover). Given a ride by another teacher, March becomes impatient at the traffic \\"and before he could stop himself, he reached over and pressed Coach Emery's horn.\\" \\"We don't do things like that here,\\" he is told (299) even though he lived there for fourteen years. At the end, after his predatory ways have been exposed, his most recent victim imagines him driving out of town \\"into the interior of the country, where he would disappear like a lost tribe of one\\" (437). This mean-spirited racism curdles the content of an ambitious and in other ways sympathetic book."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"Engaging story, well-plotted, interesting read...but how in the world did \\"Carmen Ghia\\" get by an editor? Over and over and over again, I couldn't get past thinking about such a glaring error. Hey, Sheri - it's KHARMANN GHIA."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"After page 100 I cound not put it down. Polly, August, Leland, Margaret, Manda...they all draw you in with their longing, hopes, needyness and determination of everyday life. A good story &quot;cured&quot; well."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"There are so many interwoven stories in this book its hard to know where to begin. At its heart, this book is about life in small town America, and the people who live there. Margaret Pricketts is a struggling farmer/cheesemaker who has hung her hopes for saving her farm on the election promises of Adams Brooke. When he wins the presidency, she finds herself at the center of a plan to present him with a mammoth cheese, in a re-enactment of a gift given to Thomas Jefferson. Margaret's daughter, Polly, is struggling to come to terms with her parents' divorce, and finds herself falling into the snares of an older man, while Leland Vaughn struggles to come to terms with the consequences of his advice to Manda Frank, who has just given birth to eleven children through the dubious miracle of fertility treatments. Ultimately, each of these characters must make choices about their future and decide what is most important in their lives. This character-driven narrative delves deeply into each of these diverse characters, and weaves a complex tapestry show the interconnections present in their lives. In the end, things turn out differently than any of them expect, but they have each learned and grown through the experiences along the way.The author's attention to local detail is impressive, and you get an authentic feel for the rural portion of Central Virginia that is the setting for most of the story. Once I got started, it was hard to put this book down, as these characters intrigued me and I was curious about where they would end up. This is wonderful story telling."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"If you have ever wondered what the real difference between fiction and non-fiction is, the answer is that good fiction actually has to make sense and be plausible. Real-life, non-fiction often doesn't make sense but a good story had better make sense.Sheri Holman's Mammoth Cheese is guilty of failing to meet the standard. That's not to say I didn't enjoy reading it and would even recommend it to some of my friends but there are too many absurd plot lines to be ignored.The setting of the story is a small town known as Three Chimneys in Virgina. In my opinion the main character is a farmer named Margaret Prickett who is a divorced, boutique cheese maker forced to make ends meet and raise a junior-high age daughter. To say she is quirky is an understatement; she forbids her daughter many of the modern pleasures of current life including brand name clothing, fast food, and movies. She often rails against corporate American and especially corporate farming being the death of the family farm.That's not surpirising because her dairy farm is in foreclosure, so she gets behind a presidential candidate named Adams Brooke who promises to enact an amnesty regarding farm debt to save family farmers.It's a pretty basic story but somewhere along the way we get to learn more about Three Chimneys. One such person is a woman named Manda Frank who breaks the record for births after taking fertility drugs and being counseled by a local clergyman who happens to be the father of Ms. Prickett's hired hand. The hired hand is also a history buff who likes to dress up as Thomas Jefferson and re-enact many of his speeches. Somewhere along the line he mentions the idea of delivering a giant cheese to the new president based on something that actually happened to Thomas Jefferson. The idea is pushed by his father who starts to feel some guilt regarding the advice he gave to Manda Frank. Farmer-cheesmaker Prickett ends up making the big cheese for the President, but I will not reveal more of the plot.The problem is that there is too much absurdity for all of this to work. Multiple firms, Jefferson impersonators, big cheeses, etc. One story device might have worked, but after all you wonder if the purpose is to come with a farce. The good news is that Holman can write well so she takes you along and you have fun reading.The problem is that it eventually fell apart when Holman moved away from the plot and dealt with human emotions. The middle school-aged daughter's relationship and feelings regarding her history teacher was somewhat offensive. Ms. Prickett's relationship with her daughter and farmhand and ex-husband turned her from being a sympathetic character to one that I began to hate.As a whole, it's an ambitious book but it lost me in the end. After reading it, I didn't gain added sympathy or understanding for farming life which I think was one of her points. Given the positive points of the book, I will probably read other works by her but this one is a tough one to like."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"My only disappointment was that the book had to end. I felt as though I knew the characters intimately. A wonderful story with excellent character development. Perhaps a sequel?"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I found this book to be lackluster and quite boring. The plot was tedious and overwritten. The book never drew me in, I never felt like I was in the story. In the end, I just wanted to be done with the book and forget I ever read it."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"A girl learns about life and left-leaning politics while her mother struggles to keep the dairy going, eventually deciding to take issues to the president.The title is taken from a bit of history of Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson history and some philosophy are sprinkled throughout with little of the traditional liberty emphasis, but rather with a mix of opinion.I found the descriptions of the process of making cheese interesting; they were a reprieve from the dreary days and dreadful decisions in the novel.This seems to be a bit of learned wisdom for liberals, a confession or suggestion of varied and pervasive self-centered natures, a revelation almost intramural and private, certainly humble."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"If you took out all the boring, tedious repetitions this would be a small book. After hearing each character's flaws, preferences, and ideas for the hundredth time, I began to be a little insulted. Yes, I can remember for all of three pages that August admires Jefferson. No need to tell me yet again. There were no surprises, no revelations, no analysis, and I really didn't care what happened to the characters."},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"Miss Holman seems to have some good researchers working for her. And she can put together a nice sentence.The book turns out not to be funny or interesting though. Boring, boring, boring with characters that I couldn't find any concern for.I can't imagine why this book ended up with four stars????????????"},{"Title":"The Mammoth Cheese","review":"I found this story line to be a bit ridiculous. No one in the story was very likeable either. Unfortunately I was stuck on an island on vacation with it so I finished it.

The cooking and food topics I found on Amazon are a economically great idea for this device."},{"Title":"Every Step in Canning ~ The Cold-Pack Method","review":"This book is a delight to read, if only because of the author's fervent sense of mission in a world-gone-by, one actually not so different in mentality as today (of course I am a social worker). She has discovered something of use to the \\"common woman\\" to help in ways that expand from beyond the kitchen: economically in a time of very tight finances, and nutritiously, in a time where much of the country is under-nourished (as today, except for the fact that our under-nourished are often our most overfed). But the methods still work!! And though I doubt I will have much use for canned apples in our world of jet-fresh foods, canning home-grown (or locally/healthily-grown) food is still one of the most delightful and economic ways I know to extend the joy of producing and providing the 'fruits' of our loving efforts to our famililies and friends."},{"Title":"Every Step in Canning ~ The Cold-Pack Method","review":"This is good to have for new and old canners.

The best part of the book was the photgraphs of the remains of the wall. The actual writing does not go into too much detail about the historical building of the wall; it provides a decent introduction to the various periods of building and the styles of various sections of the wall's design. Overall, this is a good introduction book to the Great Wall of China, with excellent photography."},{"Title":"The Great Wall","review":"This is a wonderful book by the leading expert on the Great Wall of China. Insightful, well researched and expertly illustrated with stunning photography, many maps and classical documentation relating to the Chinese wall.In around 100 pages Mr Lindesay clarifies both the historical dimension as well as the contemporary significance and threats to the Great Wall.His project documenting recent changes and damage to the wall is enlightening; the great Wall is not only disappearing fast but damaged through restoration for commercial exploitation and modern development. His historic and contemporary documentation is a treasure - as is this fine book.Published by Oxford University Press it is carefully written, beautifully illustrated and an absolute highlight in the prestigious Images of China series."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"If you have used any of the open-source technologies offered at apache.org, you've probably got a few of these libraries already. This is a great introduction to the &#60;insert word that doesn't sound as obnoxious as &#34;plethora&#34; or &#34;myriad&#34; here&#62; of tools and utilites that will make your routine java development easier.While it is not a comprehensive book, each chapter takes a look at various areas of Java development and which of the Commons libraries provide classes and methods to handle common routines. Covered are things like Text Manipulation, JavaBeans utils, Collections (stuff that isn't in the offical JDK... yet) and Math functions. Personally, I didn't realize just how cool some of the Math functions are - so that was an interesting read. I like the fact that there was a lot of source examples in the book, too.I think O'Brien does a nice job at balancing the Commons stuff with the topics that are better handled by a more focused book. For example, he just touches on XML and Log4J - so if you're looking for a book that has details on getting logging up, running and configured (for example), this isn't it.If you want to know if you should incorporate any of the Jakarta Commons stuff in your development, this book will give you plenty of reasons why."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"One of the beauties about Java, compared to earlier languages like C or Pascal, is the huge set of library classes that comes with the default distribution. An immense amount of code, all for free. Any experienced Java programmer knows this. But what if you could also get another set of free classes that extends the functionality even more? And has been well tested? O'Brien educates us about this - the Jakarta Commons. A nifty amount of heavy code. It can be highly worth your while to peruse this for useful classes.Here is a brief excerpt of what is offered. Consider the default maths classes that come with Java. Important. But still very primitive compared to the decades of effort put into various mathematical libraries in other languages like Fortran. Of course, many of those tend to be proprietary. Now, in Commons, we have Maths classes. These can solve a linear system of equations. In other words, matrix arithmetic is implemented. Opens up entire regions of electrical circuit modelling and control systems theory, for example.For statistics, simple regressions between two variables is now computed. And complex numbers can be explicitly handled with the ComplexMath class.It can be appreciated that the new Commons maths classes fill longstanding gaps in the default maths ability of Java, which has been weak in numerical methods and high performance computing. It greatly strengthens the credibility of developing applications in those fields with Java."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"How many times do you find a solution written for your last project to be equally applicable to your current problem but too closely coupled to reuse without adapting code in copy-and-paste style? Even worse, when bug is found you have to patch the same solution differently amongst relevant projects. While open source and Java mean free, community support, and options, Jakarta Commons bring the next level of productivity and ease of maintenance. Being one of the contributors, the author introduces the audience components refactored from more elaborated projects in an easily referenced form of tips and cautions.How many times do you end up disappointed when a primitive function is expected from the language with its Javadoc being searched through? Even though you find it from the latest release, sometimes upgrading the runtime environment is not an option. Language supplements are described like Jakarta Commons being the lead of the direction the language should be steered towards. Text manipulation is so universal where handy utilities are illustrated. JavaBeans, a simple yet versatile convention, deserve a helper library that eases your life. Feature rich collections, command line interface, properties configuration, logging, and networking I/O are clearly mentioned. By practical to conceptual ideas, the math library is employed to estimate the amount of time left in long running processes. Arbitrary complexity of comparison and sorting is managed by means of functors.The author intends to be neither comprehensive nor surveying options to a problem. Nonetheless, it is inconvenient to have no source available for download. With the book in its first edition, there exists missing cross reference and code inaccuracy sometimes is obvious. By including instructions for the use with Maven, those new to the framework may be confused. Coverage of advanced topics like XML, web development with templating, WebDAV, and indexing are not sufficient. After the book is glanced through, it is really desirable to see how the author can deploy the same way of presentation to areas where no thorough documentation of good quality ever exists."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"The Jakarta Commons Cookbook provides an excellent resource into the many useful features and functions in the Apache Jakarta Commons libraries. In addition to the nice cookbook style, there are large numbers of examples in one single volume.

Tim does a good job of introducing you to them (+2). Unlike most books, this is very readable, using (for the most part) clear examples (watch out for the phantom 'Person' class) (+1).The only draw-back I can really point to is that Commons is really designed to be straight forward and easy to understand, so an O'Reilly cookbook might be too indepth for this (-1). I like that I can read other posts by the author, related to Commons, in the ASF (+2)."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"This book does provide a good overview of some of the most popular libraries in the Commons project. Although I have read and enjoyed several other Cookbook style books on more general topics, I did not find this one as useful. This is because the Jakarata Commons recipies are very speicific, and cover a wide array of unrelated topics. If you have a specific need that is covered, you will likely find the book helpful. Otherwise, it may be like some of the real cookbooks in my kitchen that are interesting, but rarely used."},{"Title":"Jakarta Commons Cookbook","review":"Although a bit out of date, this book is a great introduction to the Jakarta Commons libraries.The Jakarta Commons libraries are an invaluable resource for the Java programmer. So many holes in the Java class libraries are covered by Commons, that it can become an inseparable part of any Java code. As a Java programmer, I recognized such utilities and code fragments, found in the commons libraries, that I used to implement over and over again on my past various projects.No more! Commons is to the rescue, and much tested, working code can now be reused.The book itself follows some of the major libraries: Strings, IO, Templates, Networking, Collections and more.Some of the covered libraries are not any longer part of the Jakarta Commons (Velocity), and others are missing (commons-jdbc). It would be great to have a new edition for this book.But even so, the book provides a structural, well defined review of the most interesting features in these libraries. Written in an easy to follow language, having simple yet clear examples and making a point on where and why Jakarta Commons is a good choice.Many of the features are not well presented in the Commons User's Guide on the Jakarta web page.

He is non other than Kilkenny, the fastest gun around and the greatest fighter too. Before it is over, he'll have to prove it. Check this book out. L'Amour is especially good at describing the fight scene and he does it expertly in this saga of old west fiction."},{"Title":"The Mountain Valley War","review":"I am reading L'amour for the first time and all in a mix depending on which books I get hold of first. I was a bit disappointed with this one. I like the funny wry novels better than the serious/gunfighter ones - and this falls into the serious gunfighter genre, it seems.IN this second book Kilkenny has drifted to Idaho into the mountains and properly filed for some land himself. Unfortunately he and his fellow 'nesters' have aroused the ire of the local land baron, 'King' Hale. Hale hadn't been interested in the land until the nesters came along, now he is ruthlessly driving them out aided by his violent son 'cub' and the tacit help of some of the locals including a shop owner who refuses to sell them any goods.Kilkenny now calls himself Trent and doesn't want to be drawn into anything he doesn't have to, but unfortunately it is brought to his door, his neighbour is ruthlessly murdered and his children hunted. They escape to Trent's cabin and then Trent himself is threatened. He refuses to budge but joins up with the other nesters and fights for what is his.What I liked about this book and other L'amours is that people are generally not simply black and white. Some of Hale's men are actually good men and they recognise in Trent a similar spirit which makes the action more complicated and richer for it. Also within the nesters there is Cain Brockman, whose brother Abel was killed by Kilkenny/Trent and has sworn revenge. Cain is a good man who fell in with a bad lot now trent has to use his persuasive powers to convince Cain of this.Like I said this is a rich and complex novel, a good easy read to take up an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Mountain Valley War","review":"The second of the three novels about Lance Kilkenny, a man with an unwanted reputation as a gunfighter, now he's got himself a small piece of land, a few head of cattle and has hung up his guns.

For one, the material is four or five years old and collectible rods have skyrocketed in price in that time frame. So the dollar amounts placed on rods are not very realistic. Secondly, I have found that there are sizes and models of fly rods that are not included in the listings of the various rod makers or manufacturers.

I have owned both of them for over 20 years. These are primarily reference books of a technical and seasonal nature. They are like a companion that you don't see for a while but reacquaint yourself with periodically. Every three years, when the Catholic Church is in Cycle C of the Lectionary, the readings are primarily from Luke's gospel. These are great for following the Church through the weeks of this cycle. I am not a Biblical Scholar. What's more, I have only a rudimentary working knowledge of Greek and am therefore somewhat limited to the amount of research I can do. As well, I am limited by time. I have a number of other sources to use. Nevertheless, when I need strict Biblical interpretation for weekly writing or teaching, I prefer to use these volumes, before going anywhere else.I do not regard every volume of the Anchor Bible series to be of equal weight; however, I always find myself returning to Fitzmeyer for exegesis and hermeneutics on the Gospel of Luke. His work in these volumes has stood the test of time. Nothing like them has come along during this time which can compete with them in this regard.As I look at these volumes within my library, maybe the greatest compliment I can give Fitzmeyer is that the books look used and the dust jackets worn over the years.

They cover a broad historical time frame, from the mediaeval to the modern, and examine representations of female sexuality and women's bodies from the perspectives of historical interpretation, cultural analysis, literary investigation and critical theory. The analytical framework of the essays draws greatly on the work of recent French feminist and cultural theorists, such as Foucault, whose writings on the history of sexuality have influenced work in this area for over a decade. The book also examines the ways in which women and men view sexuality and representations of the body differently and the authors draw here on British and American writings on 'the female gaze'. As such, this book provides an interdisciplinary text which utilises prominent Western critical theories to highlight the specifics of Russian cultural thinking in the area of female sexuality.The introduction to the book provides an extensive outline of a number of issues which influence our thinking on female sexuality: biology versus culture, the language of sex, the diverse range of sexualities, reproduction and sexual pleasure, bodily representations - '\\"women\\" dressed as \\"men\\"' (p. 22) and the changing and challenging perspectives on Russian sexuality which have emerged since the advent of glasnost'. Russian literary, political and cultural texts from the 19th and 20th centuries, now familiar to many Western readers, are used to illustrate the variety of debates on these issues. They clearly illustrate that Russia has never been a 'sexless' society or 'uninterested in the erotic' (p. 37). 'The papers in this volume demonstrate that the \\"erotic questions\\" have always been present in the history of Russian culture, even when they have been most vehemently denied' (pp. 37-38).The introduction also poses the question 'how does \\"Russian\\" sexuality differ from that of the \\"West\\"?' (pp. 4-8) and signals the importance of the overall theme of the individual chapters for contemporary rewritings and redrawings of Russian sexuality. Eve Levin argues in the first chapter that 'an understanding of how mediaeval Russian high culture viewed sexuality becomes a necessary first step for the analysis of sexuality in modern Russia' (p. 52). Most of the chapters which follow adopt an overtly feminist perspective in their analysis of such topics as puppet theatre, vanguard art, the ideological battlegrounds of reproduction and maternity and lesbian sexuality.The authors do well to note some of the problems to which their own analysis gives rise. The very framework of their debates may be meaningless to many potential Russian readers. Diana Burgin, for example, points out that 'whatever contributions Lesbians have made to Russian feminism have either not been noted by historians or, more likely, are impossible to determine because Russian cultural norms and community standards strongly discouraged and continue to discourage any politics of the personal' (p. 178). In a more general analysis of personal politics, Helena Goscilo explores Tolstaya's rejection of the feminist label despite the fact that she offers 'a classic feminist critique of repressive patriarchal practices' and Goscilo proceeds to note that 'the stumbling block is less feminist theory or praxis per se than the label \\"feminist\\". Discredited by class associations in earlier phases of Soviet history and still rendered suspect by disillusionment with any comprehensive political agenda, the term \\"feminism\\" as entertained by Russians is culturally overmarked and consequently stigmatized' (p. 219).The chapters are all very well documented and offer ample scope for further reading and research. Most of the contributors to this volume have also published extensively elsewhere and their chapters here, therefore, provide a useful introduction to some of the more extensive and related readings on the selected topics. This is probably not a book to be read directly from cover to cover and readers would be best advised to be selective in their choice of essays. It would also be an advantage to be prepared in advance in the theoretical and analytical writings which inform the ongoing debates in many of the chapters as these are not given a full explication in the text."},{"Title":"A call for character","review":"The depth and wisdom in this book led us to do a 12 week series on the subject at our church(elementsaspen.com).

We are reinventing the feminine. And most of us have barely begin to appreciate the value of the enormity of this task.\\"--Hope Edelman, Motherless DaughtersMoms: Wouldn't it be nice to anticipate and have as much joy in your daughter turning into a woman as you did with her first smiles, steps and words? Wouldn't it be great to have the confidence in guiding your daughter as she crossed the threshold into womanhood? Moon Mother, Moon Daughter: Myths and Rituals that Celebrate a Girl's Coming-of-Age can help you discover and embrace such a journey with your daughter.Moon Mother, Moon Daughter: Myths and Rituals that Celebrate a Girl's Coming-of-Age is chewy and concise, informing moms about how they can honor the sacredness of being female. Authors Lucy and Allison weave moon and goddess mythology and provide a myriad of activities for moms and daughter to do independently and together--to encourage reflection, introspection, understanding, and celebration of becoming and being a woman.Among topics addressed in the book are the value of spending time alone, how to guide your daughter in awakening and connecting to her inner wisdom and intuition, how to guide her in finding and having confidence in expressing her voice, and the power of honoring your body.As the cover of Moon Mother, Moon Daughter promises, the advice has new-age overtones, using the moon as a guide and metaphor (the most sacred feminine) throughout the book. However, any mom (including this one) can easily draw upon the ideas and tweak them to fit into and guide her relationship with her daughter. This is a terrific book with wonderful goddess mythology to share and empowering ideas from which to borrow. This mom is looking forward to using some of them with her daughters.Note: Moon Mother, Moon Daughter: Myths and Rituals that Celebrate a Girl's Coming-of-Age is geared for moms of daughters ages ten-thirteen.by Judy Millerfor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Be The Ball-An Audio Recording For Better Golf","review":"Be The Ball is a superbly produced, forty minute, audiobook presentation on how to play a better game of golf.

Odem holds a Doctorate in History and is an Associate Professor at Emory University in the Department of History and Women's studies. Odem is well qualified to teach this subject. Odem explains the books objective is to make three main arguments this is explained in the books introduction. Odem's first argument is to clarify the moral campaign to reform teenage female sexuality. Her second argument isthe state of California paid a hefty price for said campaign, as they could not absolutely control sexuality. The final argument, self-rule in working class families was the underlying cause for cases of teenage daughters brought to court. The book focuses on moral campaigns and enforcement of sexual policies and Progressive campaigns to control and reform female sexuality.Odem did thorough research and read various publications from Universities, the National Archives, the Los Angles and Huntington Beach Libraries, and read publications from the Women's Christian Temperance Union and Young Women's Christian Association. The bibliography cites manuscripts, newspapers and journals, annual reports and government documents, books, articles and unpublished studies were sources for this book. Odem also refers to court records and specific cases to back her evidence and notates that many books were cited as source material in the books notes. The evidence presented is abundant and some of it irrefutable. For example, she argues there is a double standard to prove the point she proved that most men found guilty of having sex with a minor received an insignificant punishment like probation. The female was humiliated by the mandatory pelvic exam and cross-examination in court and in some cases was sent to a reformatory or sent to work, as a domestic proving there was a double standard. Odem uses sentencing statics, court records and various publications to back her point. None of the evidence appears to be conflicting or irrelevant.Odem makes a logical argument the book is written from theexpository perspective but occasionally turns to the persuasive perspective and at times could become redundant. The book became more interesting and persuasive when Odem presented real court cases as evidence like Mae Tanner, Pauline Taylor, Minnie Kent and many other girls. Odem to breaks up the main issues such as the \\"delinquent Girl\\" , working class families, the mothers roles in the courts proceedings, and other issues into six chapters and keeps each point clearly organized and separate from the others to help lesson any confusion on the part of the reader. Odem also makes a clear distinction of the evolution of the Progressives belief from the 1880's that young women were seduced and corrupted by older and more sophisticated men to the belief later in the 1900's that home and society were responsible for a girls \\"moral downfall\\". Odem also clearly lays out how the Progressives relied on the state and legal system to control female offenders. The subject matter seems complete and not lacking except when it comes to African Americans. While Odem does shed, some light on how this issue did affect African American's and does mention key African American Players in female sexual reform like Janie Porter Barrett. I feel Africa Americans and Whites should have had equal focus in this book. California has a large population of African Americans especially in Oakland and Los Angeles.The age of consent law campaign's significance is clearlyexplained as is the moral reform movement and enforcement that came along with the campaign to raise the age of consent law. The book clearly also paints the sociological view of a young women's place in society and how even something as a young woman wearing makeup can be seen as rebellious. Odem also explored how class and race played a role in the reform of teenage sexuality and how it came to be that the majority of cases that ended up in court were those of a working class family. Odem clearly explains the struggle between parent and child and the state and the parent. This book is very relevant to a future history course as it explains and shapes how society viewed young women for thirty-five years and gives the reader a clear impression of what it was like to be a female living in this time. This book was informative and sheds a light on a subject of History in the state of California we seldom hear of today."},{"Title":"Delinquent Daughters: Protecting and Policing Adolescent Female Sexuality in the United States, 1885-1920 (Gender and American Culture)","review":"This book was required reading in one of my history classes in college and it is one of the books that I still refer to in conversation.

(white, working class, Hispanic, African-American) Odem argues that many girls who became labeled &quot;wayward&quot; were acting out against oppressive and repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls' sexuality. Odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that reformers took in &quot;retraining&quot; wayward girls."},{"Title":"Delinquent Daughters: Protecting and Policing Adolescent Female Sexuality in the United States, 1885-1920 (Gender and American Culture)","review":"This is a great history lesson on the treatment of young women.

Unfortunately, this case book only added to it. There are cases after cases that are supposed to help you understand civil procedure, but there is little discussion of the law itself or about why the court decided the first case the way it did but did the polar opposite in a second, similar case. The questions that are provided after the cases are designed to help you analyze the law, but they are of little help when you have no foundation. Most people will probably need to consult at least one other source to understand civil procedure. If your law library provides a hornbook, make it your best friend. It is too late for me."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"This book is a good read. It uses a lot of anecdotes to explain otherwise intangible concepts.

My item was shipped quickly. I recommend purchasing from this vendor and plan on doing again myself."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"Note to Civ Pro professors: please don't use this book.First, Yeazell's book forces the student to guess the court's interpretation of the FRCP and and law. It does this by providing unfocused edited opinions. The opinions are so poorly edited that they become confusing. Often I found it would have been better to just leave in the entire text because the author's constant and obsessive desire to pare down the opinions using ellipses is ineffective. It just doesn't work. Yeazell might want the student to see the case from his perspective, but it's not coming through. I suggest that Yeazell just write his perspective after exposing the student to the actual, unadulterated text of the case. Yeazell is not getting his point across with the edits.Second, the structure of the casebook doesn't align with the typical 1L casebook. Specifically, the Notes and Problems sections (these are a constant thread throughout the book) rarely add clarity to the procedural topic. The Notes and Problems sections often pose hypothetical questions, which is a good idea in theory, but the questions are rarely answerable or answered. Maybe that's the point, but a 1L student doesn't need curve balls like this. If you're going to pose a question, you must give the student the tools and information to find the answer. Yeazell doesn't always do that. Further, the Notes and Problems that follow most of the cases refer to other cases that might not have been part of the assigned reading. Sometimes the Notes and Problems in one chapter allude to briefly mentioned Notes and Problems hypotheticals in another. The content is so jumbled that a 1L student will find it frustrating to understand the point.Finally, the casebook is not updated, contains too many errors (spelling, grammar, mechanical), and isn't easy to navigate. The latest edition still refers to pre-2010 Rules. The student must find an old version of the FRCP and then translate those rules to the current rules just to understand what Yeazell is talking about. The table of cases is lodged in the back of the book. Most troubling, the grammatical errors make the student question the veracity of the message. How do you know what you are reading is accurate when there are obvious grammatical errors?Overall, this was my least favored 1L casebook and I think the other reviews here and elsewhere echo that sentiment."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"If you remotely understood the humor in my header than this book is fine for you.

Gibbs! Yeazell has all the cases you need in here. I do think Semtek in the Erie section is odd because preclusion has not been introduced. And I think it is the odd placement, if you read the book linearly rather than jumped around, that makes some of the reviewers here hate this book. But this is one of the better books. Couple this sucker with Glannon and presto you will be screaming \\"There ain't no subject matter jurisdiction under 1331--it is all a lie!\\" In no time.

No need to blame it on the casebook.If you are a scared pre-1L reading these reviews thinking, \\"oh crap, why did my professor have to assign the confusing Yeazell casebook,\\" don't bother. It really comes down to how good your professor is at explaining things, not the casebook. Having said this, I actually think the notes, cases, and examples are all well edited and presented clearly.Just a note, in class Professor Yeazell started on \\"The Process of Adjudication Examined\\" section, went to the end of the book, and then came back to personal/ subject matter jurisdiction section (the first section of the book) at the end of the semester. Maybe that's why everyone was confused."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"This order was timely shipped and in incredible condition. I wish ordering was always this satisfying"},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"Yeazell's casebook gets off to a good start with a very well written intro, but after that it is obvious that the first chapter was the only chapter in the book that Yeazell put any effort into. As other reviewers have stated the cases have been edited quite poorly, the Erie doctrine section confuses, more than it helps and the overall flow of the textbook is poor. Also the note sections, which usually serve to help students make sense of the case that was just read, are more often than not filed with unhelpful questions with no guidance on how to answer them or what the answer would be.I ended up buying the Hornbook by West and that easily became the text that I used (along with the Fed Rules book) to understand Civ Pro.I fell sorry for you if you have to use this book.*Note review is for the 6th edition."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it is pretty good for teaching the basics of civil procedure. If that's what you're planning on doing, buy with confidence. On the other hand, if you are hoping to use this as body armor or some sort of fortification you will be disappointed. I can say without reservation that this book will completely fail to stop even 9mm rounds. They went clear through. Predictably, it did even worse against 7.62 NATO rounds. To summarize this book can teach you civ pro but will be of little use in a post-apocalyptic survival scenario."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"When you first pick up the book, you feel exhilirated that you, too will be learning all about Civil Procedure. The case in the introduction is fun, but it is all down hill from there. The cases are important cases, but the editing took out parts of the opinions that should be there so you can understand the rest of the opinion (I could mention Erie, but nobody understands that on a good day either...). It is a necessary evil that we mut struggle through in our attempts at world domination...I mean our attempts to become lawyers..."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"My review will mirror many of the reviews for this edition of Yeazell's Civil Procedure: Good intros, but difficult explanations to wade through for the rest. Which is where a good Professor/TA comes in.Here are the best methods in successfully deciphering this book (and in general for law school):Before class:-Read Yeazell's intros (they set up the cases well)-Read each case then read over his notes (if any exist) and any FRCP rules/sections from the Rules supplement-Do the problems in the notes (take your best shot)-**Optional** - For the really motivated students, you can look up the cases in law reviews or de minimis for further explanations/context. I never did this, but I've heard it helps when there's confusion.-Prepare a case-brief while re-reading the case, incorporating the knowledge obtained from the notes-Review 1/2 hour before classDuring class/TA sessions:-Take detailed notes! Fill in anything you might have missed/misunderstood, and anything else you deem important (especially anything the Prof. puts on the board, or writes on projectors, or asks hypos of, or gives out handouts for)-Refer to your case-brief, and be courageous in your answer when called upon (the Socratic method is for your benefit, though it may feel like torture)-Pay attention to how Prof/TA goes over the problems and answers-Ask questions about anything you might have missedAfter class/TA sessions (directly after-wait too long, and this stuff might fly out of your brain):-Add condensed and important points into outline (which you will use as your study tool for finals)-Add answers to problems into outline-Mark up rules/sections in the FRCP Yeazell supplement pertaining to important class discussions-**Important** - Attend office hours for Professor (or TA - but not as important b/c TA not testing you) and discuss ANYTHING you might be hazy on - Students rarely go to office hours. Those that do, get the top grades. Go figure.-**Optional, but important** - Form study groups to go over class material/outlines/complain about CivPro-Review material weeklyAfter this is complete, rinse and repeat.Before finals:-Finish up outline (should be almost finished before end of classes), and read over repeatedly until you're confident with materials-Take practice exams (especially essays)-If you have time, go over practice exams with Prof/TA/study groupLaw school casebooks like Yeazell's are almost never straightforward so they require all these steps so you actively learn. If most of these steps are not taken, it will probably lead to confusion, panic, just overall bitterness from a nebulous source of education.---advice from an overachieving 1L"},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"I actually liked my Civil Procedure class, but I hated doing the reading for it because it meant I'd have to use this book. The layout is thus: You read a case, and then you are presented with a series of questions that apparently you're expected to be able to answer on your own - in effect, you have to teach yourself Civil Procedure as you read. Interspersed with the meaningless (at least to the confused 1L reader) questions are little facts and tidbits related to Civil Procedure which aren't that important, but since they're the only information in the discussion section not presented in question form, you glom onto them in the hope that knowing said facts and tidbits will help to clarify Civil Procedure for you. All in all, easily one of the worst textbooks I've ever had."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"This book is basically worthless, except as a makeshift booster seat or placeholder on a bookshelf. I read this book, then I read the Glannon E and E. There is no comparison. Glannon illuminates, and Yeazell simply asks tedious questions with no answers given. My advice would be to use Glannon as your text and only use Yeazell for the cases.Also, I should mention, don't drop out just because you find this book incomprehensible. I did fine in civ pro using mainly supplements for learning the material."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"The author who wrote this book must have had only one intention- to confuse the reader. There is nothing remotely good about this book. It is edited very poorly to the point where it makes absolutely no sense. The author hides the true meaning to the cases. If you don't have a VERY good civ pro teacher, you will have no idea what you are reading. I don't understand why someone would take the time to write over 800 pages and deliver no purpose to the text. It is so bad that if I was an incoming law student, I would probably turn down a school if I found that they used this book for their civ pro course."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"First is the review and then how I managed my study time using supplements and the FRCP. This is by far the worst text book we used during my 1L year, because after each case it has a few explanations, but typically just asks TONS of short questions W/OUT ANY answers! The purpose is to get you thinking about the topics and spend weeks figuring them out yourself. I listened to my 1st semester prof and used solely this book and the rule book (used minimally first semester). This was by far the worst advice I have ever been given, because the book will waste your precious time or make you stop reading altogether. However, there is a way to make the class interesting and gain the necessary info with minimal wasted time. Also, each semester is almost like a completely different class (one is theory and one is rules).I used various supplements for this class. Before buying all of them (like I did) I would go to your law library and look them over, use them for your class and see if they are presented in a way that works for you. If not, then buy whatever you can that is most useful and use the library's books as needed. My biggest mistake was thinking by using supplements to supplement my casebook I would learn less or get screwed up. Professors tell you whether they like supplements or not, but if you use them to prepare for class, still at least go through the cases and take NOTES from what they say, you will do far better.I will explain the books I used second semester, which is less theory and rules based. Before each class topic I readAcing Civil Procedure (Acing Law School)and then outlined the rule in my own words using the Commentary sections inA Student's Guide to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Student Guides)to fill in and flesh out the rules. I then read throughEmanuel Law Outline: Civil Procedure Yeazell (Emanual Law Outlines)skimming and highlighting the key points in this casebook and adding the extra info to my rule outlines. This made class easy because I simply noted the key comments and wording my Prof used and modified my outline accordingly. After class I quickly organized the rule outline and moved on. This may seem like a lot of time, but it was about 3 hours a week. Beware of spending too much time on the supplements and rule outline BEFORE class. Much of the material in the supplements and casebook is not covered in class and therefore a waste of time.When many spent extra time making their outlines, mine was complete and I spent an hour or two each week working through hypos and questions fromCivil Procedure: Examples & Explanations 5th editionandGlannon Guide to Civil Procedure: Student Manual. I added any issues and fact patterns I came across, to my rules outline. Before the exam I condensed my outlined rules, worked on hypos, and used the hypos we went over in class to see how Prof would work them into the exam. Overall I did not spend much time understanding the cases in their entirety . After the first week of class you should have typed down every question asked in class, because this is what the prof will ask the rest of the year. This makes it easier to skim cases and determine what is necessary and what is a complete waste of memory and time.For first semester, this was my worst class. My 1st semester Prof was not very good and I did not practice hypos and writing out answers as in 2nd semester. What I learned was to USE SUPPLEMENTS. I used them in half my classes (best grades) and not in the other half (good but worse). I managed to use Emanuel to catch up and made a great outline, but I spent far too much time with my wording in the essays. This is whereUnderstanding Civil Procedure, E&E; and Glannon Guide (multiple choice) came in. Even without multiple choice exams, these short practice questions really help hammer out the trickier parts. The hypos help you learn to quickly write out your answer. The Understanding series is GREAT for your first semester, because it more in depth and helps you understand the overall concepts better. Also, many prefer E&E; to other books for explanation, but I found it better suited for hypos.These books collectively were not necessary , but they sure helped. If you are short on cash, the best books from most helpful to least are your required casebook, FRCP Student's guide, Emanuel (if not using Yeazall, the keyed edition to your casebook if possible, if not then case briefs should work), Acing Civ Pro (AMAZING short book with great checklists to work through the rules), Glannon Guide, and then E&E; (if used for hypos, although there is a newer ed). For first semester, the Understanding book was excellent to read before anything else (do not read too heavy), because it is highly explanatory. I have found canned briefs useful from online and the various case brief books keyed to your casebook. Acing Civ Pro was the best book, but not the most needed if short on cash. See my other reviews regarding the above books mentioned. However only the first couple paragraphs will be different.Good Luck, I will try and answer any comments!"},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"This was my favorite casebook of my 1L classes. I have no complaints about it. Things I like: Plain English writing style, use of modern cases (Internet, etc.), extensive use of hypos as questions after cases, thought-provoking and difficult questions - many of them with answers or hints. If you can do these, you'll be prepared for whatever issues appear on exams."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure","review":"I think my title sums it up. If you are a professor deciding on a book to use for your class, PLEASE do not use this one. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I loved the book and it came in great condition once again Mildred D Taylor shines as she brings the Logans to life"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"Having now read five Logan books by Mildred Taylor, I have two favorites: Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry and Road to Memphis. The first is about childhood; the second is about adolescence. While both contain a mixture of happy and tragic moments, Road to Memphis is about change and so is sadder in tone. Yet in many ways, the two books have parallels.Like Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, Road to Memphis is about family. In one of its earliest chapters, Mr. Logan returns home to see the Logan siblings gathered around Stacey's new car. He walks around the car slowly and then without a smile says that he's heard that Stacey has been showing it off. When he strolls around the car yet again, the Logan siblings all anxiously wait to hear his verdict. To their relief, he winks and then proudly puts his arm around Stacey's shoulder. Everyone jumps in the car and goes for a ride. Later, Cassie and her mom share a sweet moment. Cassie is trying on dresses for church when her mom walks into her bedroom. They talk about her appearance and about love. Cassie thinks she isn't ready, but her mom knows better because why else would Cassie take so much care in picking out the right clothes to wear around Moe? This isn't to say every moment with the Logan parents is light. One day Cassie is hanging out at her friend Sissy's home. On her walk back to church, Cassie crosses paths with three white boys. Immediately they start harassing her. If not for her father showing up, because he worried about her being out on the roads alone, serious trouble might have resulted.Like Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, Road to Memphis is about family. is about friendship. In an hilarious scene, Cassie and Sissy share their feelings about love. Sissy chides Cassie's lack of interest in boys, telling Cassie that with her being seventeen it's time she start thinking about love. Cassie teases, \\"Maybe, then, I'll think on Clarence.\\" Sissy retorts that she'll whip anyone who messes with her Clarence. Cassie reassures, \\"Girl, don't nobody want Clarence but you.\\" The girls laugh. Then there's the bittersweet moment between Stacey and Jeremy, when Jeremy asks if he could get a ride in Stacey's new car. This is 1940's Mississippi. White folks didn't normally ride with black folks unless the black folks were in their employment as a chauffeur. However, they agree to a ride across the pasture, behind the barn, where no one would see them. As they ride, the two boys laugh, share memories, and wish for the old days. Unfortunately, the joyous moments soon end. One day while the Logan siblings and their friends are hunting in the woods for \\"coons\\", Cassie and Harris get separated and run into a gang of white teenage boys that includes Jeremy. Three of the boys taunt Cassie and Harris about hunting with them. Except they don't really intend for them to look for a \\"coon\\" together. Instead they order Harris to be the \\"coon\\". Jeremy speaks up, but his three white friends don't take kindly to his suggestion to \\"Leave them be.\\" Jeremy responds in a startling way. A few days later, the same three boys pick on the Logans and their friends once again, this time while in the nearby town of Strawberry. In a moment of righteous anger, Moe takes a crowbar to them. Everyone's loyalty is put to the test, for anyone who is caught with Moe could face charges of aiding and abetting a criminal.Like Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry, Road to Memphis is about family. is about bullies and about racism. While Cassie and her brothers wait for the eldest Logan sibling Stacey to show at the bus stop, they run into Harris who needs some shells at the Wallace store. You'd expect a little errand like buying shells to just take a few minutes. It probably would have too, except that back then certain white folks got a kick out of teasing black people and for the most part there wasn't anything that black people could do: If they talked back, they could get into trouble; If they hit, they could get killed. Harris decides to act as polite as he can, despite being called dumb and being ordered to act like a monkey. Later, during a car ride, Stacey has to stop at a gas station due to mechanical trouble. Cassie needs to use the bathroom and is told to use the bushes, but instead she tries to sneak into a public toilet. Again, you wouldn't expect any incidents to arise from that little errand. Yet Cassie rebelliously uses the bathroom labeled WHITE LADIES ONLY. The attendant who catches her orders her and her siblings off his place. When she falls in her haste to leave, he squashes her purse under his one foot and kicks her with his other foot.As I indicated at the start, Road to Memphis differs from Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry in being about change. Some changes are almost insignificant such as when Little Man starts to insist on being called Clayton Chester. Others are typical of coming of age stories, such as Moe's developing interest in Cassie as a girlfriend. Some are indicative of a certain time such as the number of community boys who sign up for the war effort. And others have the potential to become monumental such as Cassie's belief that if black people knew the law, maybe black people could help change a biased justice system. Finally, there are some which are unique to Taylor's tales of the Logans. For example, Jeremy makes a choice that will forever change his life.After five books, the Logans have come to feel like a real family to me. By the time I reached the second half of Road to Memphis, I couldn't put it down. Incidentally, one of the most poignant scenes involving Cassie and her dreams about the future is found in the latter chapters. Once I did finished Road to Memphis, I felt almost as upset as I do when I read a trilogy that ends with a cliffhanger. I didn't want to say goodbye. And while fortunately there are three more books about them, Road to Memphis is the last narrated by Cassie. It has been an unforgettable journey."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I bought this book for my son to read for school. He is 13 years old. He loved the book.

It is realistic because everyone knows how Blacks were tortured, and mistreated in those days. I admire the ways the characters use their brains to solve their problems and go on with their lives.

I think we kids should more history and sstuff instead of just reading about fantasy.anjie UK"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This was a book I was assigned to read for school. When I first saw it, I was demolished because I thought the book would be boring, because normally I like fantasy novels with wars between dragons and wizards and such. But when I finished this book, I was amazed at how intruiging it was. The plot is all carefully and well melded together, starting from the incident to... well maybe you should read the book. The only I put 4 is because this book seems to discriminate white people, or make them look mean, like how the white people did to the black people in the book. But this is just my opinion. You should read the book, and see for yourself."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The book The Road to Memphis by Mildred D. Taylor, is about a girl named Cassie Logan. Cassie Logan is black. She embarks on a journey with boys. When her best friend Moe, gets into trouble, her and her brother have to find a way to get him out of trouble. Jeremy Simms,a white boy who is nice to black people, lets Moe hide in the back of his truck. Then the journey begins.I really liked this book. I didn't think that it was the best of the Cassie Logan series. but it was good. Some other books by Mildred D. Taylor are as follows: The Well, Let the Circle Be Unbroken, and The Friendship."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"\\"The Road to Memphis\\" is an extremely well-written book. It takes the reader to the south in the early 1930s. From there, the reader learns about the Logan family and their friends and their struggle against discrimination in Mississippi. For example, Cassie Logan and her two younger brothers were waiting at the store to pick up Stacey, their older brother. When Cassie discovered that the bus was running late, only trouble followed for Cassie and her friends from then until the end of the novel. During each incident throughout the novel, the blacks were always provoked by the white people. The blacks would always mind their own business and greet the whites with the respect they wanted. But since the white people thought that they were more sophisticated than the blacks, they would always degrade them and start problems that would usually result in the black people taking all the blame. The whites could do as they pleased with the blacks, and the blacks could not do anything to stop them unless they were willing to lose their lives because of it. Not all the white people in Strawberry were like that, though. Only two white people in the whole book treated the black people of Strawberry fairly. They were Mr. Jamison and Jeremy. They both on more than one occasion proved theirselves to be true to their word to the black people of Strawberry. Through the harsh truths of reality, the black citizens of Strawberry, Mississippi were able to overcome the obstacles and to move on with their lives.I think that there is no specific audience recommended for this novel, but I think that anyone above the age of 12 can read this book and understand the full effects of it. I think that anyone younger than the age of 12, however, will not understand how bad things were in the early 1930s and 40s. It is very important to know the history of this time period in order to understand this novel.I think that the book's appeal is that all the events seemed so vivid to the imagination. During every incident mentioned in the novel, the author gives very descriptive details that make the reader feel like they are there witnessing the events unfold. Another appeal of the book is the rising action and the climax. I think that the climax was much unexpected. The climax of the book is when Moe beat the three white boys (Statler Aames and his cousins) with a crowbar. It fits in well with the rising action because the incidents leading to the climax all pertain to Statler Aames and his posy always provoking the black people.This book is one of the best books that I have ever read. I think that this novel can definitely become a classic in the near future. I have read four of Mildred Taylor's books and each time I read one of her books, I realize how good of a writer she is. In her writings, she is able to take the reader into the life and time of the Logan family. The events in her novels are historic to the time period, and there is never a dull moment in many of her books. There is always some type of action going on. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading and loves a book full of action."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"Road to Memphis-was I think was far by the best book out of Roll Of Thunder and Let The Circle Be Unbroken.

To think of what Casey and her friends went through scares me because I have to think, would I be that loyal to my friends and would they be that loyal to me? To know that things like that happened make me wonder why people could ever be racist and make me not want to be racist even more than I already am."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This book is my most favorite book out of all the books I've ever read in the Logan Family series!

At the beginning, life is going pretty well. Life changes when Cassie's big brother, Stacey buys a new car that is very nice for an African American. It all starts in Strawberry when some white boys are making fun of Moe. They say things that really make him mad. He explodes and hits them with a crow bar. He then jumps into a truck that belongs to Jeremy Simms, a long time friend of the Logans. Jeremy is related to the people Moe just beat up. Being the good friend, Jeremy jumps in the truck and drives off. The Logans take off and pick up Moe in another town so they can take him to Memphis so he can catch a train to Chicago. On their way to Memphis they run into a lot of trouble with white people and they have a lot of car trouble. When the get near Memphis, Clarence gets really sick and has to go to an old lady's house to get better. The Logans finally get to Memphis and they get their car fixed so they can make it home. They finally get Moe on a train ticket. When he is getting ready to leave he expresses his love for Cassie. She is very disappointed because she knows she might not ever see him again. The ending of the book amazed me so to find out you need to read it.I really enjoyed this book because it showed what black people had to put up with everyday. Also because it taught a very good lesson which was that even if things go bad they can turn out well.Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is the first book of this series.Let the Circle Be Unbroken is the second book in this series."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I am in eighth grade at San Francisco Day School. I read both The Road to Memphis by Mildred Taylor and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee for my English class. I found the two books closely related. They are both about a community in a racist time period and how it survives, or attempts to survive the hardships it suffers in a short period. The Road to Memphis is about a black community in the 1940's. The main character, Cassie, is a young black lady whose core group of family and friends is torn apart by several incidents over a three day period. Cassie's dream was to go to law school and become a lawyer. She thought that the court was a fair place where everyone, including blacks, were treated equally. This is the same belief Atticus and his family had in To Kill a Mockingbird before the Tom Robinson trial, when they lost faith in the whole judicial system. Unfortunately, a \\"fair\\" court does not make up for the unfair community and population running the court. Cassie's community was split up by racial slurs, death, and the start of World War Two. I thought that The Road to Memphis did a superb job of illustrating what life was like for a black lady in a time when neither ladies nor blacks were highly respected. The novel also showed how much your life can change in a very short time period. In the three days of turmoil Cassie found out how harsh this world was. She was harassed by several white men and lost four of her closest companions to death, or to the misuse of the power of the white community. It was disturbing how in three tragedy filled days, a young lady's life can be ruined, and the cards containing the future of a community can be shuffled so thoroughly. To Kill a Mockingbird also did an outstanding job of portraying the harshness of being black at that time. Although the spotlight was on a white family, Harper Lee was using that position to go inside a white community and write about their feelings toward blacks. The Tom Robinson trial was a good example of how a black person's life can be ruined by the corrupt, white dominated court."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"A great book by a great author.

Unfortunately, a \\"fair\\" court does not make up for the unfair community and population running the court. Cassie's community was split up by racial slurs, death, and the start of World War Two. I thought that The Road to Memphis did a superb job of illustrating what life was like for a black lady in a time when neither ladies nor blacks were highly respected. The novel also showed how much your life can change in a very short time period. In the three days of turmoil Cassie found out how harsh this world was. She was harassed by several white men and lost four of her closest companions to death, or to the misuse of the power of the white community. It was disturbing how in three tragedy filled days, a young lady's life can be ruined, and the cards containing the future of a community can be shuffled so thoroughly. To Kill a Mockingbird also did an outstanding job of portraying the harshness of being black at that time. Although the spotlight was on a white family, Harper Lee was using that position to go inside a white community and write about their feelings toward blacks. The Tom Robinson trial was a good example of how a black person's life can be ruined by the corrupt, white dominated court."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The setting has a very big impact on the story because it was during the time when African-Americans were mistreated because of their skin color, and they were in the south where it was easier to get away with because the North had been against slavery. Out of all of them, if I had to choose one that was more important then all, it would have to be Strawberry. Strawberry is an average town, no big landmarks or things to make it stand out on the map. On the story map it plays a major roll because it is where part of the climax takes place. (The rest is all on the way to Memphis, hence the title.) Stacey stops to make the final payment on his car. Clawrence goes into the store to get something for his headache. The rest of them (Little, Willie Moe, and Cassie) go to the mechanic to fix the flat. There 3 white men are teasing Moe. He lashes out by hitting them with the crow bar he was using to take the tire off. The rest of the settings include Great Faith and Jackson."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I thought The Road To Memphis was a very dramatic,compelling book. This is the third novel in the series written about the Logan family. This book takes place in 1941, right before the outbreak of World WarII. Cassie is 17 years old and a senior in high school dreaming of going onto law school. Stacey is working in Jackson and is driving his first car. A sequence of tragic events, incuding pregnancy and death, threatens to seperate the family, possibly forever. In Jackson Moe lashes out at his white tormentors, an act unheard of in Mississippi back then, almost killing them. Cassie, Stacey and their friends must try to get Moe to Memphis and safety. At the end of the book it doesn't tell you what happens to Jeremy, Stacey, Moe or Cassie. I found myself asking what happened to them? Mildred D. Taylor is and excellent writer. In reading this book I found she depicted the magnitude of racism in the 1940's very well. It really gave me an idea of what life was like in that era. It also made me realize how times have changed and how ucky I am to live in this day and age. I would suggest this book to readers who are old enough to comprehend the realism of it. This is a great book that I think all people should read at sometime in their life."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I read this book in one day!! I read &quot;Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry&quot; in 8th grade as a class requirment and I loved it and I started looking for the sequals and prequals a couple of weeks ago. So far I like this one the best. Cassie Logan is 17 and still has a temper when it comes to segragation and one of the young white boys Jeremy Simms cousin Statler is setting eyes on young and beautiful Cassie Logan. an incident happens causing the Moe to flee to Memphis with the help of Cassie, Stacie, Clarence, Little Willie, and Jeremy Simms. On the way Cassie meets a very handsome man in a cafe........... Great book I highly reccomend you read it or get it for your child. Taylor is very good in expressing the hardships of the African American people during that time period."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I love The Road To Memphis. I started reading Mildred D. Taylor's book at the beginning last year at school as a class reading but right away I loved it by the time my teacher stared I was at the end of chapter 1 in Roll of Thunder,Hear My Cry. After that I couldn't stop reading, and I got in trouble for reading it so quickly, but then I read Let the Circle be Unbroken, then found myself reading The Road To Memphis. The main charcters of this book is Cassie,Stacey,Moe,Claudia,Little man,Christopher-John. When Moe gets tired of the whites treating him like dirt,he beats up 3 white boys,almost killing them. Then has to make a run for a train in Memphis to get to Stacey's uncle Hammer, But on the way somebody dies (i'm not saying who).In the end even a white's life messes up.Before I read this book I knew slaves had a hard time, but after slavery I didn't know how they were treated, and I think all whites (including me) are well respected of blacks even without reading theese books.! And I recomend you reading her other books to!"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This book is absolutely great! Mildred D. Taylor explains the hardships of blacks in her books. This is a very sad book because Cassie has 3 friends that leave and her brother leaves. Cassie says she'll never fall in love, but she falls in love with a guy named Solomo Bradley. I won't give the book away to you, so get a book yourself a read it to see what happens! I wish Taylor would make a sequal to this book because I want to know what happens. I HIGHLY RECCOEND THIS BOOK! Get it now!"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I would recommend this book because it speaks the truth and it doesn't hold anything back. I think that people who came from this background would like the story because it's our nature. It's easier for people who came from a similar background; it would be easier to understand. Some are used to hearing real southern slang 24/7. They can get into depth as I did, and relate to the story. They can read,\\" in between the lines\\", the message is more clearly sent. This book was so real and you felt like you were there. I personally think that it wasn't hard to concentrate on the story because it was such a page-turner. Something was always exciting or causing anxiety. I learned a lot of things by reading this book. The message that was mainly focused was that racism wasn't a joke. For some people, the details got too emotional. The Road to Memphis was a terrific book."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I read the book over the summer it is extremely sad and I would not recommend it for an audience under 12. It was even better than the first book \\"roll of thunder, hear my cry\\" (I fell in love with both books). The whole problem in the book was that Moe, a black guy striked these white people with a crow bar when he got angry at them. This was an action unheard of for black people to do in those times so Moe had to run. Cassie Logan narrates you through this sad sad book. By the end of the book I was so attached to the characters that I cried because several unfortunate things happened in the end. I would STRONGLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The Road to Memphis is one of the best books i have ever read. This book is a heart tugger, and shows you through writing, how hard it was back then, and how a young women, and her family struggle to get to memphis unharmed, and undetected. If you want an adventure that teaches you how it was back then..this book is the real deal.My name is Ella, i am 13 almost 14, my mother bought this for me to read."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This book has got to be one of the best I've ever read so far. The realism of it made you feel as if you were there, right next to the Logan family. I'm just hoping a third novel will come out, so I can see what happened to Cassie, Moe, and the rest of the characters. Well I'll be waiting!"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The Logan family is a black family who live in Mississippi during the time right before World War II. Cassie Logan, the main character is going to school when a friend gets into trouble and they have to take him to Memphis so he won't get arrested. Many things happen showing that the prejudice between black and white is far from being solved. Cassie ecspecially feels the sting of this prejudice as she realizes her dream of becoming a lawyer is not possible.I loved this book. It is exciting and full of adventure and it makes you realize how long it took for the African- American people to get their freedom and it makes you ask your self if they really are free today."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This book was a soso book. There were many times where I had to go back and reread pages. something I don't like to do. And to me his book was like a modle airplane. You need plenty if all most to much glue to hold the plane together. This book just had enough glue to hold it together. It still needed more. I would recomend this book to some one who is looking for a racism story. But in general I would not recomend it."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"My rating of The Road to Memphis on a scale of one to ten would be a seven. This is because it is slightly boring and the author overreacts to small situations and does not put enough detail into the bigger, more important events. On the other hand the book is very well written the author paints a vivid picture of the scene in your mind. I did not like this book as much as Mildred D. Taylor's first book of the series, Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, although that novel was also boring. Compared to other books of its genre, it would be one of the best. Mildred D. Taylor is a wonderful author and describes situations very vividly and imaginatively. The only problem with this is that Ms. Taylor gets to describing things too often and too much. This makes for an extremely long book. The Road to Memphis is only the least bit not enjoyable because it is not only too long, but also slow moving and boring. A long book is no crime, but if the book is so boring that the reader has to struggle to keep his eyes open, that is when it gets bad. The Road to Memphis is a good exciting book at a few points in the book. The end and a small amount of scenes in the middle are gripping and you will not want to stop reading the book. When nothing is happening, though it is extremely boring. The Road to Memphis blends romance, action, and tragedy. I would suggest it to anyone with a lot of patience and time."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"In the book called \\"The Road to Memphis\\", there is a girl named Cassie Logan.

The characters are not described clearly. My favorite part was when Cassie,Moe,and Stacey entered Memphis and they went to stay with a person Cassie knew who studied the law until they could find a train for Moe. Mildred Taylor is one of my favorite authors because she writes to show how black people have loving,caring families and are no different from our families. She wants us to think about the good things about black people,not the bad things."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The book The Road to Memphis by Mildred D. Taylor, is about a girl named Cassie Logan. Cassie Logan is black. She embarks on a journy with boys. When her best friend Moe, gets into trouble, her and her brother have to find a way to get him out of trouble. Jeremy Simms,a white boy who is nice to black people, lets Moe hide in the back of his truck. Then the journey begins.I really liked this book. I didn't think that it was the best of the Cassie Logan series. but it was good. Some other books by Mildred D. Taylor are as follows: The Well, Let the Circle Be Unbroken, and The Freindship."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This book was so expressive in everything about it! The people seemed real, the events seemed real. It was so amazing! The troubles blacks faced was enough to drive any person today wild and we have to know how strong both black and white are because without either one of us today, nothing would be the same. When Jeremy did what he did and the consequences he faced, I realized that everything in this book counted. Mildred D. Taylor brings this story alive with a modern touch that has people want to read it. I have never read a book that made me feel the way I feel about this book. And I know you will enjoy it. It is not just some racist book. It is a good book that everyone will enjoy and I have nothing negative to say about it! You will enjoy it and I hope you found my review helpful!"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The Road to Memphis by Mildred D. Taylor uses the literary device of atmosphere very well. The mood of the story, which is dark and gloomy, is perfect for the book because it helps depict what life was like for African Americans at that time. Because African Americans were treated differently than white people, made fun of, and segregated from whites, the mood of the book is perfect. The clothes of the characters, which are part of atmosphere, also help strengthen the novel. Cassie, for example, wears dresses most of the time and almost never wears jeans. Her clothes match the clothes that the women wore in the 1930s and 1940s because it was considered improper for women of that time to wear boyish clothes. The thick trees and forests also serve as a great atmosphere because the Deep South is covered with trees. Humidity and stickiness, which is what the southeastern United States contains, is also used in the book to describe the climate that the characters live in. I think the part where Jeremy Simms helped out Moe by giving him a ride in his truck weakened the book because it's unrealistic. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, no white man would give a black man that just injured three other white men a ride to safety. This is so because if other white folks heard that a white man helped a black man, the white man could be punished more severely than the black man. Next, the three Aames brothers contributed greatly to the literary device of atmosphere because they served as the \\"bad guys\\" of the book. In every novel, there has to be at least one bad guy to make it exciting. However, I believed that the character of Little Willie could have been omitted when the book was written. When you first meet him, he seems like he will be a major character. But instead he just works with Stacey and Moe and rides along with them in the car everywhere. Next, the car that Stacey buys contributes greatly to the novel because it distinguishes the Logans from other African American families. It makes the Logans seem richer and more important than other blacks. If the Logans didn't have something to distinguish them from others, they would just appear to be a normal family and wouldn't seem as important. Also, the segregation of whites and blacks makes the book more interesting. It makes you realize how the blacks felt about it and actually how badly treated they were. In the book, Cassie tries to go to the bathroom in a white ladies restroom. For doing it, the gas station manager kicks her when she's on the ground and causes here to lose her purse, which had money and other important items in it. The dirt roads also added to the literary device of atmosphere and strengthened the novel because they seemed to be the same way I would picture them to be. When the cars went over the dirt roads, dust would fly from the back of them. However, the thing I noticed most was the accents of all of the characters. Every character spoke improper English and some spoke a little gibberish. This added to atmosphere because it made me feel that I was actually in the Deep South with all of the characters. Everything in the book appeared to be very realistic and accurate. Last, the general layouts of the towns were very impressive because everything was spread out from each other and that's how many small towns are these days. Everything in the book appeared to be very realistic and accurate."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I started , THE ROAD TO MEMPHIS,for the summer reading and fell in love.

After reading ALL of the preceeding Logan stories by Taylor, I couldn't wait to dive into this book. It's a wonderful \\"coming of age\\" story. Cassie Logan and her brother Stacy, along with their childhood friends find themselves on what turns out to be a more than an eventful journey to Memphis. Cassie and the others experience the South in the early 1900's outside of the protective reach of their father David, Uncle Hammer, Mr. Morrison, and family friend Wade Jamison. Readers begin to see Cassie as a young woman instead of a little girl in this story. We still see some of the characters from the previous books and are introduced to a list of exciting new ones. I really think that this is the best of Taylor's novels. I hope there will be a follow-up."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"The Road to Memphis By Mildred D. Taylor is about a seventeen-year-old girl named Cassie Logan and her friend Moe, Clarence, Jeremy, Harris, Sissy and, Little Willie and, her brother Stacey. The setting is during 1941 on the brink of World War II. Sissy is pregnant with Clarence's child. Cassie's life is dramatically changed when her friend Moe lashes out at his white tormentors. This is the conflict in this novel, which drives the plot. Because Jeremy is white and will not be suspected, he takes Moe to Jackson. Stacey, Little Willie, Clarence and, Cassie meet Moe in Jackson and accompany Moe on his way to Memphis. Clarence can't continue the trip due to his severe headaches so he must stay with Maylene, someone who they met along their way to Memphis.

I just finished it. My only complaint about it is that there is no sequel. In the end, I was left wondering, Does Cassie become a lawyer? How many of the boys in that book died in a white man's war? Was Moe ever caught and prosecuted? Did Troy Aames die?But this book was real; it allowed you to experience what happened firsthand; and while it dealt with serious, weighty issues, it was a joy to read. Anyone who hasn't read it has missed something. It is MUST reading!Mildred D. Taylor is a gifted author with few that are her equal. She has the ability to write in such a way that the reader lives the story instead of just reads it. Because that is true, her books do, on some level, change the lives of those who read them."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"This is a powerful, beautifully-written book. If you haven't read the earlier books recently before starting this one, you may have trouble telling all the young men apart. They are wonderful characters, though - completely believable and true to life - and the story is utterly gripping. I see that Taylor is &quot;filling in&quot; the series with short novels that feature various of the characters, and I certainly hope that she takes us further into the century - at least to 1963."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"My 10 year od daughter loved it.

Unlike other books, the problems in this story are real, they're not just make-beleive."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"I loved this book along with the rest in the series. I only wish the author would make more books on the series. Like what happens to Moe and Stacey? Do they have to fight in WWII. The book ends the series with you still hanging on.This book jumps quite a bit of time. In the first 2 books Cassie Logan is only about 10yrs old. Now she is 17. Since in the first 2 books Little Man and Christopher-John were young, when ever I read their name I thought of a little kid. Instead of a kid my own age. So that was kinda confusing.

When I first saw it, I was demolished because I thought the book would be boring, because normally I like fantasy novels with wars between dragons and wizards and such. But when I finished this book, I was amazed at how intruiging it was. The plot is all carefully and well melded together, starting from the incident to... well maybe you should read the book. The only I put 4 is because this book seems to discriminate white people, or make them look mean, like how the white people did to the black people in the book. But this is just my opinion. You should read the book, and see for yourself."},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"If you like a book that has a lot of action then read this book it is a excellent book. A black youth severely injures one of the boys with a tire iron and enlists Cassie's help in trying to flee the state. The lexile was 724-874. Other books by Mildred D. Taylor, Gold Cadillac, Land, and Roll of Thunder. Hear My Cry. I bet all of those books are good too.I thought that the book itself wasn't as great as I thought it would be. It was kind of hard to understand and it just wasn't as great as I expected. Some of the parts were boring and they really didn't catch my attention it was one of those books where you could fall asleep at some parts.Cassie is basically the main character in the story. There were some young boys that never got along. The kids loved to fight. So anyway there was this girl named Cassie who always broke up every single fight. In one exiting moment their car gets stuck in a ditch. Cassie is also in that. Cassie is basically the main character in the story. Then everyone starts to yell at Little Man because he keeps complaining about the mules. Then Cassie actually makes the white boy and black boy get along for once you know they stopped fighting. Find out what happens in this great story!!!!Cassie made the story joyful by what she did in the book. For example when Cassie broke the white guy and black guy up from fighting. Cassie finished high school in the city of Jackson and was dreaming of college and law school. Cassie had to be in the middle of the fight to break it up. I thought Cassie had a lot of heart to brake up all those fights. Everyone should've listened to Cassie about getting along. Cassie made a difference in the story I thought if she wasn't in the story it wouldn't have been as good she mad a huge difference.The action in the book made it more exiting. For example when they had the first fights. When they had the rifle fights, when the car got stuck in the mud and they had to pull it out, when the guy was screaming that he didn't want the mules, when know one knew what was going on and everyone was screaming from all the cars in the story and how fast they were going. I enjoyed all the action in the story it made the story more exiting with all the action and I am glad that they put it into the story.In 1941 America was filled with rumbling wars in Europe and the Pacific. Cassie Logan has trouble back in Mississippi. There was a quarrel between two young lovers a black friends rage and a white youth's remark over violence. Cassie is in the middle of all those fights and they are unforgettable days.If you like to read about people trying to help one another stop fighting while a war is going on. Read this story it is great for helping. A great story about helping each other out by braking fights up, helping people pull cars out of ditches, and just driving each other from place to place. If you read this I guarantee you will learn something and also I guarantee you will love the book!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Road to Memphis","review":"Hi,...

I think this book has helped me to feel more deeply about what prejudice must have been like for Cassie, who's life choices were limited by the color of her skin.

Kessler does a very nice job outlining the multiple Directorates within the CIA while offering interesting anecdotes and tidbits about various past players within each Directorate. I especially enjoyed the different profiles of past CIA directors. The author consulted both with retired employees and people who are still employed with the United States government today. A good example is Robert Gates, recent Secretary of Defense and past director of the CIA. Kessler's writing covers both criticism and accolades, giving this book a well-rounded feel. Having never read much concerning the CIA, I cannot offer a perspective on whether this book agrees with other works on the agency. As a stand alone read I found it to be informative and thought provoking. For someone who has no idea how the CIA works this is a nice place to start."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Those touting access to the CIA are usually not the ones to explain the bureaucratic infighting, dramatic capers and beautiful agents betrayed. But this is a good book for learning the foundational stuff including how the agency is organized and its mission.The book is useful for gaining background information that can later be important for understanding events in context. I'm not dismissing the book for those looking for some entertainment value, just warning that it's not a page-turner."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Inside the CIA is a tantalizing title conjuring images of cloak and dagger operations scattered across back allies and poorly lit parks around the globe, but of course this isn't a Robert Ludlum novel and the books focus is in reality very different. The book was recommended to me by a professor of mine when I was in college and as such I was prepared for its true aim, to provide a broad level and detailed history of the Agency itself. While in some ways this is disappointing, mostly because after the mental build up and preparation for an exciting tale of spy craft it turns out to be a text book on the evolution of a government agency and bureaucracy. Still it plays a crucial function for anyone hoping to learn about the CIA and its actual operation both at home and around the world by detailing its development over the past fifty years and the role that each Directorate and position plays in the Agency.On a side note Kessler did conduct several interviews with former Directors prior to writing Inside the CIA which perhaps lead to his broad spectrum and policy driven approach as their influence appears in various forms throughout the book.Ultimately I would say that if you're looking to learn more about the CIA and how it functions as an Agency then this is the book for you but if you're looking for a personal account of working in the Agency your better of checking out something like See No Evil or Class 11 (or maybe just googling Ian Fleming depending on what your expectations are)."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Kessler managed to write a series of books throughout his literary career. It isn't his writing prowess that sells his books though- it is his ability to gather comprehensive information that is otherwise unavailable to the public regarding a very secret agency, and present that material to those with the curiosity about the CIA. Kessler writes much like a classroom notetaker, where organization is sometimes compromised by detail upon detail. But this is not a negative thing at all. There is just so much to tell and he leaves nothing out.I have read many books on this field and Kessler is always good to go back to and be reminded about the basic construct that is the world's strongest spy agency. Granted, much has changed since the early fifties but Inside the CIA will give the reader the inside scoop of what began 50 years ago. Even more, how exactly the agency is run, who reports to whom, how information flows, how operations are carried out, etc... Enjoy this read. I know I did."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"It is obvious from reading this book that Kessler did his homework along with the work assigned to other classes. The book is filled with anecdotes and details that help complete the extensive history and organization of the CIA. At times, he gets a little too specific such as when unnecessarily stating the room and floor of the building for a particular meeting. At other times, these minute details gives credibility and invokes a tour-guide-feel to the author. In addition, the author exhibits an overall positive view of the modern CIA though he does not hesistant to mention the CIA's failures.As for my personal experience, due to the large number of persons discussed, I found myself flipping back and forth to find out trying to recall a name I passed over before. By the last chapter, the final pieces of the puzzle are put together and what I'm left with is a clear picture of the organization of the CIA along with a slightly blurry image of its history. (I just can't remember all those names.)"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the C.I.A. It presents an excellent picture of exactly how the C.I.A. works and how the various departments work. However due to its length (it is somehwat short for such a broad agency) it is not able to go into great depth concerning the great and not so great history of the C.I.A. If you are interested in a book which traces the C.I.A. from its very beginnings i would recommend &quot;The Secret History of the C.I.A. which gives much more detail about the history of the C.I.A."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"The Central Intelligence Agency recommended that I read this book! What else need I say? Kessler's novel is extremely comprehensive, and encompasses the most important points of CIA history and function. A must-read for all Americans, especially those who think CIA only stands for the Culinary Institute of America!"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"I think Kessler told all that he could tell about his ultra-secret organization. I am one who appreciates that he did not go as far with the CIA (C.I.A.) as he did in his FBI (F.B.I.) book. I appreciate that some will not find this as exiting to read as a tell-all book but I found it to be interesting reading anyway."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Overall, being the first book I've read on the CIA, I would say I learned a little bit from this book. It goes a long way to humanize the CIA, but at the same time criticizes them severely. Very little meat to this book, though. I'm sure that any other book about the CIA could give you just as much or even more information about the CIA's structure.Kessler clearly has a bias in favor of the FBI. The only parts of this book that seem to go into extensive detail are those about the former FBI director, Webster's administration. Kessler goes into extensive details about Webster and his assistants, but unfortunately, he jumps around so much I'm often not sure if he is talking about Webster at the FBI, Webster at the CIA, or both. Overall, I'm led to the impression that Webster was so favorably treated by this book (and not denigrated like the other directors) simply because he was a former FBI Director. Also, I'm really glad to read that Webster was given a stuffed FBI bear upon leaving the FBI in a book supposedly about the CIA.All the same, the book does definitely have some good parts, but it gets very repetitive at times especially when bringing up the mistakes of the CIA. It seems that Kessler had so very little factual information on the CIA that in order to write a full book about it, he had to include 80+ pages about the FBI and 50-60 pages of pure repetition.Still, it's not so terrible that I will throw it away or anything, but I'm really trying hard not to buy another book of Kessler's; I don't want to contribute any more money at all to his retirement."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"It was like reading a very long newspaper article. 50% of the book was insightfll, the rest of it was just filler."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"&quot;Inside the CIA&quot; by Ronald Kessler is a comprehensive and at times laboriously detailed accounting of the CIA'S origin, organization, missions, accomplishments and abysmal failures beginning with its establishment on September 18, 1947 under the National Security Act. The CIA with its 22,000 full-time employees is clearly explained in terms of its assemblage, sub-structures and turf battles amongst its four divisions: Operations, Science and Technology, Intelligience, and Administration, with a listing of specific areas of responsibilities, achievements, and methodologies. Differentiation is made between CIA Officers and Agents, differences amid the CIA and FBI missions and philosophies, and noting certain improprieties which led to the Church Committee hearings (1975) and certain oversight committees including those of General Counsel (legal), and Inspector General. The complex shpere of CIA responsibilities is illuminated by describing a typical &quot;day in the life of&quot; the Director.The author's experience in investigative reporting permitted him unusual opportunities to obtain convincing first-hand accountings of the CIA physical plant, personal interviews with five of the CIA past or then present CIA Directors, and numerous informants from the FBI and Congress.To not read &quot;Inside The CIA&quot; is to not know the CIA."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"The book was very informative. It sidewise criticizes libs as well as conservatives within the CIA. The text has quite a bit of value for the general reader."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Apparently, the CIA has NEVER done anything wrong that we haven't already heard about in the popular press. At least, that's the impression to be gotten from this tedious, badly-edited work of apologist literary bureacracy. According to Kessler, the modern CIA is a thoroughly law-abiding, and highly misunderstood agency (with the possible exception of the directorate of security). And the few illegal activities the Agency has been involved in happened under past directors, particularly the much-vilified (and conveniently dead) William Casey. William Webster, in the author's eyes, is apparently ripe for canonization. Who knew the CIA was such a benevolent group of folks?"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"I found this book to be filled with worthwhile information. My husband has been with the CIA most of our marriage and there was much that was useful and relevant in Kessler's text, but I did feel that he might have cut a bit of the excess wordage out and offered more background material."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"The CIA is a secretive organization. So it comes as no surprise that a book that states that it reveals the top secrets of the CIA is merely a hodgepodge of technical mumbo jumbo relating to how the agency works. It is not very informative, but what can you really expect? No one is really going to get to the bottom of what the CIA knows presently and what they are telling the president. It is better that way. Policymakers are able to surprise our enemies. At the same time, because the agency is secretive, we are able to benefit from novels and movies that probably exaggerate the day to day life of a CIA spy. If you're really interested in knowing secrets, I'd suggest reading a crime novel or joining the CIA itself. But this book does not help."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Ever since it's formation in the 1950's the CIA. has been one of the most intriguing and at times most controversial organizations of all time. Ronlad Kessler's investigative novel: Inside The CIA offers to shed some much-needed light on the agency's purpose. Using information gathered from interviews with retired CIA and KGB officers, Kessler reveals more about the CIA's structure, policies, and personnel than any James Bond movie ever could.Kessler explains that the CIA is divided into four chief directorates: operations, intelligence, administration, and science and technology. He goes on to say that these four departments work in unison to keep the CIA runnning smoothly. The CIA could not withstand the loss of any one of these divisons; if the directorate of administration was taken away no one would get employed, paid, or terminated. Likewise if the directorate of intelligence was eliminated the CIA's main role (gaining information about other countries and using that information to protect national security) would not be fulfilled. At the head of all these directorates and sub-directorates is the office of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency.Movies like James Bond and Misson: Impossible may give people the wron idead about the CIA. Kessler states that &quot;When the public or the media cannot know something they immediately assume that the agency has make a mistake.&quot; Many people think that classified information is something the CIA doesn't want to acknowlege; in reality the CIA classifies information to protect the US and its citizens.I picked up this book looking foward to pages full of clever gadgets and shadowly double agents. What i found was long drawn out procedures and policies that often confused me. However the book was occasionally spiced up with an intresting fact or two. For instance did you know that former president George Bush was once director of the CIA? Or that in the past the CIA hired US citizens vacationing over seas to spy on foreign emmbassies? These seldom facts combined with the agency's interesting history kept me reading. This book might appeal to someone who wants to clear up some of the speculation of the CIA.A reader from Colorado Springs , September 21, 1998 Excellent reference work! I bought this book and have referred to it many times since. Bumford, Stieger, Sweetman, and Burrows are the authorities. The information in this book rivals if not tops Brad Stieger's new book, Alien Rapture. I worked Top Secret black programs for 25 years as a DOD contractor and employee. I know every detail in this book and the Puzzle Palace and will verify that it is highly accurate. Brad Steiger has published 140 books and everything he has written supports the facts in The Puzzle Palace. Think of The Puzzle Palace as a text book on secret government technology and methodology. Think of Deep Black as a text book on top secret information on satellites, use and abuse. Think of Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture as a novel incorporating all this information. Brad has even delivered the only picture of the most classified aerospace vehicle in the world. Once you've read these books, you'll never stop looking over your shoulder, buy it soon!"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Kessler created a title that would sell thousands of books even if there was nothing between the covers and then did a less than average job telling the story. In the entire book I found less than 50 pages that were worth my time reading. The remainder was just above &quot;filler&quot; quality. It was repetitive, lacking in focus, poorly written and not very informative. Enormous time was spent on personalities and conversations about unimportant topics. Of course the book is also showing its age which only exaserbates the weakness of the &quot;read&quot;. As for being some exciting expose, &quot;fagetaboutit&quot;, unless learning the details of the organizational structure of the CIA was high on you list or you cared about what all the spooks thought of each other, or you didn't know that the CIA like every other large government organization spends half its time and money on internal politics, protecting its turf from other agencies, and fighting against the American people and their elected representatives. If you didn't already know how blatantly the CIA had abused their power or how they felt they were above the law of their own country, then skim the book for these riveting revelations. Otherwise, find another form of entertainment."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"This book is the dumbest book, I ever read. I can't believe the dumbass lies in this book, and the attack on someone like James Angleton. This is a clear sign of our, once great nation in decline, when this jerk can bad mouth someone like Angleton."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"The simple fact is that this book is outdated. Published in 1992, it is obvious that the absolute last world event dealt with in the author's research was the Gulf War of 1991. Even though it says it's been updated in 1994, there is definitely no mention of the Clinton years or the 1993 WTC bombing. In fact, in an ominous line, the authors writes to the effect that there has never been a major intel failure since the 80s (regardless of what side you believe, 9/11 would certainly get a full chapter under this category). It's time to update this book, or it will be totally obsolete very soon.The entire structure of the CIA is outdated. The book was written in the days when there was a DCI, and the major directorates were Ops, Science & Technology, Intelligence and Admin. Now, there is a DNI/DDNI team as head of national intel, under whom is the DCIA (not DCI anymore). The directorates are different as well: Ops is now called the National Clandestine Service; S&T; is the same, Intelligence is called Analysis, and Admin is called Support. Not to mention that the whole thing about visitors to Langley is laughably archaic in post-9/11 America.Though some reviewers mention that Kessler doesn't \\"reveal any secrets,\\" I found the book quite full of inside info. There are tons of examples of insider issues, operations that went well or badly, and myth debunks. What did you expect, that even if there is a captured UFO, the book would tell you? I didn't see TOPSECRET//NOFORN//SCI anywhere on the cover.As a history, the book is wonderful. Unfortunately, it's the closest thing to a current tell-all of the Agency, which is sad. Even the Agency itself lists it at the top of their recommended reading for applicants. Untimately, how much can one read about the Soviets and their terrible, horrible threat and still take it seriously in the age of terrorism? In a history of the CIA, fine. But in a book that is supposed to (by the Agency's own admission!) let the average civilian in on the unclassified story of the CIA, Kessler has got to update this book."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Kessler's Inside the CIA has more to say about the organization of the Agency than actual spycraft. As such it is hardly an interesting read - in fact, I would venture so far to say that it is downright dull. Kessler laboriously explains the table of organization of the CIA - what the 5 directorates are and what they do (in the abstract) with very little by way of specifics. The few interviews Kessler conducted in his preparation for this book were with former Directors - very little from the &quot;men in the field.&quot; Most of the information Kessler presents can easily be found elsewhere, in a much abbreviated form, and at less cost than the book. If you are interested in a book about what the function of the CIA is and how it is organized to carry out its mission, this is the book for you. If you are interested in something about spycraft or are searching for stories about individual CIA operations, look elsewhere. In spite of its catchy title, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"This is a fantastic book that carefully steers away from the over-zealous and tired conspiracy theory that one might expect to read in any book about the CIA. For those interested in American political process, this book simply tells you how the CIA is structured and how it works to carry out its legal mission. In an unbiased way, it also highlights some of the successes and failures of the CIA since its inception."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"This 1992 book by Kessler is quite similar to his more recent book on the FBI, but without the quantity or quality of interesting inside stories. Not surprisingly, despite having excellent access to the CIA, there are fewer details. Again, however, he comes across as remarkably fair-minded--quite critical of failings of the agency, and not afraid to point out flaws and foibles of its leadership--but also sympathetic, refuting some inaccurate charges that have been made. The book has a very amusing and horrible typo in the title of Chapter 24: it is given as \\"X-Rated Chowder\\" in the table of contents, at the beginning of the chapter, and at the top of every page in the chapter. In fact, it was supposed to be (as you learn when you read the chapter) \\"X-Rayed Chowder.\\" A good introduction to the CIA, but it's now over a decade out-of-date."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"If you have ever had personal contact with anyone from the Agency, you know that this is the book the CIA tends to recommend for those seeking to understand the real world of espionage. This is not intended to be a spy thriller by any means or a pastiche of anecdotal accounts from folks in the field. However, colorful, humorous, sometimes disappointing, and often intriguing stories are interspersed throughout the narrative which keep the reading interesting. &quot;Inside the CIA&quot; touches on the Agency's history and development but focuses on Cold War and modern challenges, the personalities behind the decisions, past obstacles, successes and failures. Under DCI William Webster, Kessler was granted significant cooperation and access, both from the upper echelons and from the staff at large. His account does not seek to make friends within the Agency nor does it reek of an anti-Agency agenda. This is a fairly level headed account and solid reference for anyone seeking to build a basic understanding of the intelligence community."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"What an atrocious book. Thoroughly disappointing after a bright start. I learnt nothing from this poorly written, poorly edited and annoyingly repetitive book. I am glad I only bought the paperback. The whole thing was extremely tiresome and it was quite obvious the author had very little actual material to work with. I would estimate there is about 10% of this book containing vaguely interesting information, the rest is pure filler. And, in 2001, it's thoroughly outdated. Don't waste your time..."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"This book got off to a great start and was very intriguing, but the momentum fizzled towards the end. The last section about the director of the CIA is a boring summary of William Webster's accomplishments. One chapter lists a typical week of his schedule that literally reads like, &quot;at 7am he did this and met with this person, at 8am he did that, at 9am he had to do this...blah blah blah.&quot; I think this book is average. I would recommend reading all the sections except the last about the DCI. It completely fails to &quot;reveal the secrets of the world's most powerful spy agency.&quot; The other sections do have some small interesting parts, but this book is not as revealing as it claims to be."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"If you're going to read just one book about the C.I.A., this is it. The book provideds ample, succinct, and interesting history, analysis, and a treasure trove of direct quotes from the people who work at the agency. This is the first truly independent author to get cooperation from the company (at least at first), and this is the one book I've foundwhich I can honestly say seems unbiased. He's unshirking in looking at the ugly side, but just as thorough in his coverage of the heroism and success stories. This is also A QUICK AND ENTERTAINING READ; you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Ronald Kessler's INSIDE THE CIA is among one of the worst books I've ever read, and the worst detailing the Central Intelligence Agency.The material presented by Kessler is hardly informative, and never thought-provoking. Rather, the book is a cluttered, rambunctious compilation of CIA facts merged with Kessler's own commentary which, at times, entirely invalidates his initial claims.Kessler spends one chapter depicting a CIA director as having been detrimental to the agency at critical times, and justly explains why. However, at the end of the same chapter, he spontaneously introduces his own commentary which contradicts his previous portrayl of the director. For three pages, he actually has the audacity to violate his role as an author and instead become a self-propelled menace to his own writing. Commentary in such books should elaborate on the research presented, and address the author's authentic view; not a repetitive rambling on information.Furthermore, INSIDE THE CIA is poorly written. Kessler provides facts in short burts of words, sometimes in the most illiterate fashion. At times, Kessler repeats the same facts and commentary, sometimes within the same paragraph on the same page. Therfor, the book becomes irritating to read.While the book pretends to illustrate the internal workings of each directorate in the CIA, Kessler spends the shortest of chapters on the Directorate of Science Technology, and provides absolutely noththing. The extent to which he describes this directorate is common sense; such as the utilization of satellites; spy devices, etc. He never describes either of those in detail.Kessler's book succeeds with one function: presenting facts or views on the CIA that are already well known, or just common sense... There are plenty of books on the CIA, and I suggest you buy one that's more informative by an author that knows how to write."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Ronald Kessler does an outstanding job informing and entertaining the reader. Moreover, &quot;Inside the CIA&quot; is both objective and comprehensive. Kessler uses his remarkable access to key actors in the CIA to lift the Agency's curtain of secrecy. He also dares to expose agency blemishes and is critical of organizational failures. I found his review of the Cold War outstanding and appreciated his detailed breakdown of how each Directorate functions within the Agency. However, the best part of this book is the many first hand accounts from former operatives."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"I should have read the published date, some of the material is a little out of date.

But if you're looking for action, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"All in all, the FBI book seems better. Both in accuracy (based on information confirmed in other books) and depth (this one doesn't get very deep). This book is a decent overview but really leaves the doors open for a lot of other reading on the subject. Information contained in books on the MI6 and the KGB (Sword and Shield) paint a somewhat different picture of some of the CIA's accomplishments. Suggest reading the Black Tulip for a semi-non-fiction read. Looking back I'm not all that happy with this book."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"Anybody even remotely interested in the inner workings and history of the Central Intelligence Agency will thoroughly enjoy this book.

Kessler is very informed about the workings of the CIA and the backgrounds of its employees and directors, but only up to when this book was published. It has a lot of interesting folklore about the beginning of the CIA and its different divisions. It's a good read if you want to get an overview of its structure and an idea of its mindset of the CIA up to and just after the fall of the Soviets. That being the post WWII era and the cold war.

However, a CIA officer told me that Kessler tends to take topics he is ignorant of and speculate about them yet writting as if it were objective fact. This was the case with his book Moscow Station. If you ever speak with anyone who spent time in the American Embassy (which I have), you'll likely hear the same thing. However, this book is interesting but it leaves you to wonder if what is written is really true. As I said I used to work in embassies so I know for a fact SOME of it is very true, but I can't speak for what I have not seen.

Of course, an updated edition that addressed the CIA's role post-9/11 would be interesting as well.MyBargainShopping.com"},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"I didn't realize the book was published approx. 17 years ago.

For this??, I paid full price."},{"Title":"Inside the CIA","review":"The author received the cooperation of the CIA in the writing of this book. As you can imagine, I think that both helped and hindered him.How it helped: We get a nice look at a day in the life of the Director. We get a clear explanation of how the CIA functions as an organization. We get an idea of how the different branches within the CIA feel about each other and the rivalries they nurse. We get an interesting look into the mindset of the officers, today and yesterday. We get an interesting look at how the personality of an individual Director affects the way the organization does business.How it hurt: The CIA is presented the way the CIA wants to be seen. It comes across as little more than a big 'ol benevolent think tank with daring aspirations of bureaucratic inertia. It is strongly implied that the most nefarious activities they engage in during this modern era are fishing the fecal matter of foreign dignitaries out of hotel room toilets and recruiting OTHER people to spy. While I don't doubt things like this make up the bulk of the daily grind for Operations Officers, I also had the strong feeling the job descriptions of the Operations Directorate were... neutered.If you're expecting an officially sanctioned expose, this is NOT it.

This allows for easy short term reading periods appropriate for training classes or casual reading.ejb"},{"Title":"What Went Wrong?, Fourth Edition: Case Studies of Process Plant Disasters","review":"\\"What Went Wrong?\\" is a well thought-out book on practical safety in the chemical processing industry. The book recounts numerous actual process plant accidents and incidents, includes causes and effects, and avoidance and mitigation practices.Some of the accidents in this book are familiar to most people (Bhopal, etc.), but most are not; this exposure to \\"new\\" material is a real strength. Another strength is the focus on \\"minor,\\" seemingly inconsequential, actions that have major effects. For instance, on page 62, a company was concerned that because heating had to be shut down over a weekend that water lines would freeze, so water was replaced with alcohol. When a fire occurred the sprinklers then fed the fire. This seems obvious in retrospect, but Kletz is trying to develop foresight rather than hindsight. Kletz also includes examples of human error accidents from other fields. (An excellent example concerning radiological medicine is on pages 92-93.) Kletz always avoids simplistic \\"human error\\" diagnoses and diligently pursues root causes; he asserts correctly that in human error accidents it is \\"unfair to put all the blame on the person who adds the last straw.\\"Chapter seven concerns leaks. Thomas Fuller was right in 1732 when he said \\"A small leak will sink a great ship.\\" Leaks are easy to discount as minor and routine annoyances. This chapter does an excellent job of discussing most leak-related issues. The section on \\"Drain Valves and Vents\\" is particularly well-developed, as is the section titled \\"Small Cocks,\\" which makes the point that they should never be used as the sole source of isolation (especially for flammable materials above their atmospheric boiling points.) Likewise his remarks at the end of the chapter (page 162) about measurements are insightful: \\"Whenever possible we should measure directly what we need to know and not some other property from which it can be deduced.\\" This was, of course, one of the major problems that triggered the Three Mile Island accident.Chapter eight is titled \\"Liquefied Flammable Gases,\\" and is an extension of chapter seven in many ways (leaks play a role in many LFG incidents.) Kletz also has an excellent discussion of the hazards of Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosions (BLEVEs) including dramatic examples from Feyzin, France and Duque de Caxias, Brazil. A great example (a crack propagation problem in a low temperature, nine percent nickel steel tank in Qatar) of how to mitigate and trap problems in a large-scale LFG system is on page 172, and discusses the pros and cons of different types of dike wall construction.Chapter nine is on pipe and vessel failures. There is a good discussion of vapor cloud explosions, and while I am amazed at the scope of the author's data, even I was surprised (and amused) to find that Table 9-1 included in \\"transport container\\" column for vapor cloud explosions the note \\"Includes 1 zeppelin.\\" Now that's thorough!The book also discusses ancillary fittings (like flanges and gaskets) and equipment (like centrifuges and pumps), their common failure modes and hazard prevention methods. There is an especially good discussion of heat exchangers, furnaces, and cooling towers in chapter ten. Especially enlightening is the discussion of damage by water hammer, and the example given (see Figure 10-11, \\"Condensate in the steam...knocked off the impingement plate and damaged calandria tubes\\") illustrates the folly of ignoring precursor incidents in an accident prevention strategy. In section 10.7 Kletz discusses furnaces, and makes the statement \\"Never say, 'It must be safe because we have been doing it this way for years and have never had an accident'\\" which is an axiom that any safety professional should embrace.Chapter eleven concerns entry into vessels, and notes that in the US each year about 63 people are killed after being overcome in inadequately prepared vessels. Of these, 40 are would-be rescuers. Any business with this type of exposure must insure that they have excellent equipment and training (including recurrent training) for people undertaking these tasks. No matter what training occurs, though, you can't protect from bad judgment. On page 232 an incident is discussed where a worker was trying to shrink-fit a bearing onto a shaft in a pit with an acetylene torch while the shaft was cooled by another worker hosing liquefied petroleum gas onto the shaft with the expected fatal results.Chapter twelve discusses the hazards of common materials. Many situations in this book concern the misuse of water resulting in boilover, slopover, foamover, frothover, puking, or many other steam or vaporization related accidents. Compressed air is another underappreciated hazard, and is also discussed at length. Especially emphasized are reactions of air and oil mixtures and the importance of using Type 3A molecular sieves, which can avoid issues encountered in operations that dry or purify compressed air. Nitrogen is also discussed. While it is inert, Kletz makes it clear that it is not harmless using several insightful examples, including an unusual liquid nitrogen induced explosion in a pork rind processing operation on page 254.Throughout the book Kletz emphasizes the importance of process change control, and that even slight modifications are thoroughly evaluated; this is true in all safety communities, not just the chemical processing industry. Excellent examples of training issues are throughout the book, but are specifically delineated in section 22.5 \\"Poor Training or Procedures.\\"Appendix one contains a useful discussion of relative rates of different types of incidents, while Appendix two is perhaps the best in the book, as it discusses accident reporting (page 395) and gives five excellent reasons to publish accident reports, advice that is valid in all industries.\\"What Went Wrong?\\" is a well written book with many insights for safety professionals. It is written for the chemical industries, but is readable and useful to safety professionals in all industries. I deal largely with aviation safety (though I have a background in industrial chemical processing), and the parallels are manifold.I highly recommend this book, and look forward to reading other books by Trevor Kletz."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong?, Fourth Edition: Case Studies of Process Plant Disasters","review":"Learning from other people and other companies mistakes is better than to gain experience through our own mistakes, especially if those are relate to safety.An excellent reference for the industrial practitioner interested or involved with Process Safety System, Emergency Shutdown Systems, Safety Instrumented Systems, etc. working in the process industries, who want to learn about real world examples of what can go wrong.The incidents described could occur in any type of industrial plants, even in yours. This book doesn't provide an exhaustive analysis of process safety issues or risk control. For this type of in-depth information you could try \\"Loss Prevention in the Process Industries\\", by F. P. Lees.Use this book as a safety manual full of stories from which you should try to get what lessons can be learned from the incidents described.I am an Industrial Practitioner of Process Safety and Control.

It is easy to find a type of accident. For example, when I turned to page 291, I found an exact, simple description of the dangers resulting from the flow of a non-conducting liquid, i.e., one with a low dielectric constant --- like toluene (2.4 compared to water with a constant of 80). \\"The danger is that a spark could discharge between a body of liquid and grounded metal.\\" In other words, a high voltage shock will knock you off your feet.If this review was helpful, please add your vote.This is an easy-to-read text and should be required reading for all chemical engineers entering the workforce. After you read it, you can move on to more detailed engineering text on the subject of safety such as Kletz's own book, or Mark Tweeddale, or Crowl and Louvar's text. These text are for calculations, \\"What Went Wrong,\\" is for a clear understanding of the dangers you will be facing.If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."},{"Title":"What Went Wrong?, Fourth Edition: Case Studies of Process Plant Disasters","review":"Terrific compendium of case studies and industry wisdom on how to prevent loss of life and property.

I haven't seen the paperback, but I thought it would be useful to cross-reference to the hardback, since Amazon didn't:Discovering Dinosaurs: in the American Museum of Natural HistoryThe review there is close to my own reaction: this is a first-rate book. And it's available for all of $4 used. The book is a bit out-of-date -- it was published in 1995. Unless you're a specialist, you'll be fine with this book. The bones don't change, and the American Museum of Natural History still has the planet's best dinosaur collection. Handsomely produced, well-illustrated and well-written. Go for it!Happy reading--Peter D. TillmanConsulting Geologist, Arizona and New Mexico (USA)"},{"Title":"Discovering Dinosaurs: Evolution, Extinction, and the Lessons of Prehistory, Expanded and Updated","review":"After visiting the National Musuem of Natural History, I wondered about many of the claims that the museum made. So I decided to read a book about the &quot;terrible lizards&quot; and found out what I had guessed -- the study of dinosaurs and their fossils is not an exact science and many of the fundamental questions we have about them cannot be answered, including:How old are they? How fast were they? How big were they? What did they look like? What color were they? What is their relation to birds? How are fossils aged? Do we have any dinosaur DNA?The authors of this book do a good job at trying to answer many of these questions about dinosaurs, but in the end their explanations merely lay out the science of guesswork. The first part of this book is fifty questions about dinosaurs, and I would recommend this section to anyone interested in the subject. The next two sections are about dinosaurs digs and specific dinosaur species, and is a little bit extensive for the &quot;casual dino reader.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silver Bears.","review":"The Silver Bears is a hilarious story and entertaining story of intrigue about an attempt to corner the silver market, with a few too many players.

It's just simple to read and informative without that convoluted wording"},{"Title":"Understanding and Managing Cybercrime","review":"This is a unique book. I would have liked the book anyway, as I work at the same university as Dr. McQuade, and we talk on occaision about information security. So I want you to know my bias. But I am not talking about liking it, I am talking about being astonished.Dr. McQuade wrote the book because he needed a really good book for his Computer Crime class. He was squirreled away for a couple of years, and now I know why.The book motivates the average reader and student through being real and relevant.The book calls to the aspiring and excellent student to do deeper, as deep as they want. The references, indexing, and especially \\"Critical Thinking\\" questions at the end of each chapter are amazing.Dr. McQuade also leads by example. He cites frequently from his groundbreaking research. He leads in 2 areas, first he shows what rigorous social science research is about. He also inspires by giving an example of doing research, when there is not much to build on.For information security professionals that know the law, but might not know it as deep as someone outside law enforcement, the chapter on relevant law is worth the price of the book.Also, as an information security professional, I often forget to ask the question \\"Why?\\" The \\"Theoretical and Social Perspectives on Cybercrime\\" took me deeper than I have been before. It is a bit chilling to understand that a generation has been left alone with computers with little or no guidance on the ethics of responsible computing.And if that weren't enough, the \\"CyberTales\\" and the cartoons actually make the book fun."},{"Title":"Understanding and Managing Cybercrime","review":"This is an intelligent, informative and entertaining (love the cartoons!) text dealing with cybercrime from a sociological perspective."},{"Title":"Understanding and Managing Cybercrime","review":"Note: I waited until I had completed Dr. McQuade's courses before posting my comment, so as to avoid as much bias as possible.I purchased Understanding and Managing Cybercrime as the required textbook for my class. Having said that, it's the only book I purchased this quarter that I actually read. This book is a resource for anyone involved in network security, systems administration or computer consulting. And while it packs in alot of topics into its 490 pages, it's not written over the head of the casual computer user. In fact, the chapters on malware and computer attacks as well as victimization are pertinent to anyone who uses computers in either a personal or business manner.For the scholar, this text is broken down into 3 main portions: What there is to attack; Who attacks and why; How they attack and what is/can be done to prevent it. From firewalls to FISA, from Critical Information Infrastructure to the history of Cybercrime laws... it's in there. Dr. McQuade is not an IT person at all, and will profess this to all who ask. He conducted research with experts in the field and combined it with his own criminal justice background to create a book that hits on all of the important topics while giving some personal insight.The book is a bit difficult to read sometimes. Chapter 8 is very long, with a lot of historical information! And while the text is a little on the small side, it is delightfully broken up by \\"Cybertales\\" and cartoons.The part I enjoyed most about this text, and which has shaped my view the most about managing cybercrime, was the section on Theories of IT-Enabled Abuse and Crime. Although no one can predict when a crime will occur, the \\"tools\\" in this chapter when combined with the lessons in the rest of the book will help the IT professional plan thier prevention of cybercrime.As Dr. McQuade was oft to say: \\"Eventually, you're all going to get sued\\" Perhaps with the knowledge from this book, I will win."},{"Title":"American Cowboy","review":"I bought this book to finish my collection.

In many reviews one will read that the book is a &quot;page turner&quot; and that the reader &quot;couldn't put it down&quot;. With &quot;Sirens&quot; the author has seemingly injected rocket fuel into the pages. The story grabs you from the beginning and accelerates through the whole book to a stunning conclusion. This is a superbly crafted political thriller, full of twists, turns and surprises, and with extremely interesting characters to propel the action. To say that the book is timely or &quot;torn from today's headlines&quot; is an understatement, although this would be a great story in any case. The topical nature of the plot just makes it that much more appealing. Mr. Williamson has his finger on the pulse of the current world events and has used these masterfully to give the reader a real treat. I would expect to see more books from this author, and if they approach the quality of this, his first book, Mr. Williamson is likely to become a household name."},{"Title":"The Sirens of Ming Hai","review":"&quot;The Sirens of Ming Hai&quot; is not the genre of novels that I usually read (i.e. political spy thriller). Therefore I was beyond pleasantly suprprised when a friend got me to read the book. It was &quot;a real page turner&quot; in the mold of Sydney Sheldon's &quot;The Other Side of Midnight&quot;.As in that Sheldon book, Mr. Williamson has managed to end each chapter in a cliff hanger. In the first chapter, we learn about a young coed, Jennifer (her American name) from mainland China. The chapter ends as she is given an awful choice: either return to China to marry someone she doesn't love or move to Washington, D.C. where she must try to see how far she can move into the circle of White House figures.Of course, the reader anticipates learning more about this beautiful woman only to start the next chapter and learn about Nick, naval aviator and son of the Vice President of the United States. The chapter hangs on the cliff of Nick preparing to fly his ill-fated plane.The book contains subplots including action, love stories, politics and much more. It will appeal to men who love action-adventure stories, women who love to love, and anyone who just plain loves a good, fast read.I loved the book! In fact, I have purchased a total of eight books that I have given as presents to family and friends. They all felt the same way."},{"Title":"The Sirens of Ming Hai","review":"This fast paced and complicated spy thriller kept me imprisonsed within its pages. The plot begins when a young Chinese student, Jiang Ou or Jennifer, is completing her studies in the US.

Despite strong family ties to the Communist regime in Bejing, her loyalties are to her secret love, currently imprisoned in a Harbin &quot;lao gai&quot;, as a disident. In order to obtain his freedom, she becomes a double agent for Taiwan. As Jennifer moves to her assignment in Washington D.C., she soon charms her way to the highest levels of the U.S. government, always one step ahead of the Secret Service. As the story unfolds, Jennifer becomes involved in the complicated mix of international politics, military/industrial corruption and personal moral conflicts. Her decisions will alter the world events and to many, will be considered a heroin as the Sirens of Ming Hai will testify."},{"Title":"Promised Brides: The Wedding of the Century/ Jesse's Wife/ The Handfast","review":"The first book in by Mary Jo Putney.

Although Fourier Analysis is first in the title, I think Finite Groups should come first. The author takes the discrete perspective of traditionally continous functions of classical physics and other applications - which not suprisingly brings finite groups into the picture. This includes the applications of quadratic residues and primitive roots to areas not usally touched by number theory - such as the ceilings of concert halls. This is a fun book, and it doesn't pretend to be comprehensive or complete with regards to its choosen subjects. I'd call the book &quot;A Grand Tour of Finite Groups and Fourier Analysis with Applications&quot; if I were the publisher. The price is suprisingly affordable given the subject where new books usually cost O($100)."},{"Title":"Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups and Applications (London Mathematical Society Student Texts)","review":"For students and users who need the facts! Perhaps they havecome accross a group problem in programming, in physics, in some course or other, or in a research assignment. Over the years, when teaching, I am often asked by students for directions to the facts of groups(usually finite) and their harmonic analysis.And too often, I have had to send the poor studentto a multi-volume book set on the general theory. Sure much of it can be specialized to what the case demands. But the user[in e.g., programming, algorithms, fast transforms, error-correction codes, crystals, symmetry, quantum theory, engineering...]typically isn't ready for the big picture yet, and more often than not, she will need to first look for a gentle introduction--just the facts!-- and written in a delightful style! The one that this author has perfected in her other books. Thanks! Now I do feel good about sending my students to this lovely little book. Great book! -- And gentle on my student's budget too."},{"Title":"Fourier Analysis on Finite Groups and Applications (London Mathematical Society Student Texts)","review":"The book presents a wealth of facts regarding finite structures related with the Fourier transform and its many applications - not only the usual stuff on fast and discrete Fourier transforms (FFT/DFT), but also on Cayley graphs, error-correcting codes, group representation, and the Selberg trace formula, among other things, e.g., an introduction to the idea of random walks on groups. However, while I liked the choice of subjects and the book 'hits the point' many times, sometimes you get lost in the somewhat sketchy presentation, as if it had been assembled directly from slide presentations and lecture notes. The book also has some typos like non-matching parentheses, spacing errors, and dislocated super- and subscripts, most of them harmless.Dr. Terras is a good math writer, though, and succeeds in making an otherwise potentially dull subject entertaining, either by demonstrating erudition - she cross-references ideas from different fields with apparent ease - or by interspersing her book with wit. For example, in chapter 15 (p. 243) we read that \\"A chapter of a mathematics book often begins with a long parade of definitions. Sorry, but it appears that we are at the beginning of a chapter.\\" Fine.I recommend the excellent and highly entertaining \\"Number Theory in Science and Communication,\\" by Manfred R. Schroeder, as companion reading. In Schroeder's book you will find a more structured (perhaps more elementary) presentation of a large subset of the subjects presented by Terras.My rate: 5 stars for the innovative choice of topics and quality of the math and -1 star for the sketchy presentation. This book deserves a better editorial and typographical treatment (e.g., the type chosen to represent the Cyrillic letter shah is a shame, some figures seem to have been extracted from shabby PowerPoint slides, etc.) as well as a hardcover in a future, ideally updated, edition."},{"Title":"Russia in Space: The failed frontier? (Springer Praxis Books / Astronomy and Planetary Sciences)","review":"For Americans, brought up on NASA's many successful exploits, this book gives a useful different perspective. Much of the narrative details the Soviet space achievements during the Cold War. And indeed, there were many notable firsts. From Sputnik to Vostok, Gagarin to Tereshkova, the Soviets made impressive strides. But Harvey shows that they also had their share of failures. From unmanned probes that got lost, to cosmonauts who perished.Comparing the Russian and American space programs, you can see how the former played to their strengths. By emphasising massive launch capability (like the Proton and Energiya rockets) and a can-do attitude necessitated by small budgets, especially after the end of the Cold War. Arguably, the Americans had the most advanced vehicle, in the form of the Space Shuttles. But scarcely perfect, given 2 that were destroyed, and the lengthy regular maintenance costs even when matters were routine. The book also shows the deep experience of prolonged spaceflight that the Russians amassed, via their space station.

Some unpleasant surprises are in store for him, place is entirely unrecognizable due to new religion - sunchildism. Higgs, the Sunchild, finds it hard to beleive how his sayings got so corrupted and is unable to do anything about it. Declaration that he is the Sunchild only brings his life in danger, since professors of Music Banks are not going to let go new lucrative businees just like that. Fascinating book, dealing with rise of new religion out of one &quot;miracle&quot; (i.e. unexplainable event such as Higgs escape in a baloon) account of which grew out of proportion every year."},{"Title":"Colour Atlas of Dermatology","review":"The Color Atlas of Dermatology by G.M. Levene and C. D. Calnan is by far the most accurate represenation of typical dermatological cases seen in clinics today. Many other atlas's tend to display the most profound and severe cases of skin pathologies. Unfortunalty, these cases are not typically seen in most clinical settings. This then makes learning how to diagnose these problems more difficult. Thus, having the most commonly seen stages of the pathology, is this book's greatest atribute. Many people would argue that this book lacks written explainations of the pathologies as well as treatment and prevention. This is true, however, this is not a textbook, it is an atlas. Although this book is out of print and was last published in the late seventies, the photographs are very clear and graphic. The only negative draw back of this book is the use of some old termanologies. However, the realistic represenation of the photographs outweigh this insignificant factor. Over all, the Color Atlas of Dermatology gets five stars. It is definatly worth using Amazon.com's out-of-print service to obtain this book. Once you see it for yourself, you'll be sure to agree."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This is the third book in Mark's Verona series. It was the first one I read, and I wish I had read it after I had read &quot;Ancient Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Someone is Watching&quot;. Several things happened in this book that ruined the suprise when I read the first two novels. But the books are all excellent. It's hard for some of us to believe that an incredibly good-looking and well-built athlete could fall for a nobody. But that's because those guys are always on a pedestal, the gods of high school, and we can't believe they would ever fall for someone like us. Mark makes it believable, and spins a heart-warming tale of their developing love. A great read, a great series, read them."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"From the cover, I've expected this book would be cheesy. Boy, am i wrong! This book was beyond anything i could think of. The writing was immature, and very un-professional. The plot was unbelievable. Where in the world were these characters coming from? Okay, let me recapture the lives of every characters in this book: Casper, a very poor boy, who was raped by his brother and being abused by his school-mates; Brandan, a rich boy who was extremely good-looking and popular, fell in love with the poorest boy in school (Casper). But wait, there were more. The rich boy was sent to a mental hospital because his parents couldn't accept his homosexuality ??? And then, there were Nathan, who was raped by his mom ??? Wait, we still had more melodramatic characters: Mark and Taylor, who killed themselves because their school-mates discriminated them. What on earth was happening here? TOO many tragic lives. And way too many social conflicts in this book. But...guess what? They all found happiness in the end.Although this book was edited by the author of \\"Common Sons\\" (which I like a lot), it still reflected a very bad writing style. I know I'm not an expert in literature, but I've read quite a lot. And this book will ever be in my list of worst books I've read. If you don't believe me, borrow it from a library (don't buy), and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"When I first received this book in the mail the cover kinda shocked me and i thought &quot;Oh I think I got a bomb&quot; here but I was very pleased with the whole thing it is very well written, a little schmaltzy at the end but I was so engrossed in the story that I finished the whole book in two days. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I'm usually not too picky about the material I read. As long as there's a great story line and depth to the characters, I can manage. However, it's very hard to look beyond the short, choppy writing style used here.

Neither of us could put it down. It's a wonderful romance novel between 2 boys who fall in love and struggle to find their place in the world. If you loved the The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton when you were young, you'll love this book as an adult."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book is basically a romance novel for gay teens. That said I think it is great that this stuff exists for the gay youth of today. I found it a little too young for me but hey-I ain't a kid any more. Had I found a book like this when I was a teen I would have thought I had died and gone to heaven. Love and acceptance are universal desires and in this book the author gives a voice to those who usually feel only rejection. Despite the fantasy romance aspect of the book I have to say it wasn't a bad read. I congratulate the author for his effort and recommend this book to any gay teen."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world.The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental. I know that the chamber of horrors at the \\"mental hospital\\" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear. And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I don't particularly understand how an editor let this book get published.I think the story had potential, hence the two stars instead of one, which makes this book all the more tragic. The characters were decent (even if occasionally a little extreme). Casper, especially I found myself drawn to. There was a bit too much crying for my taste, but if I recall my teenaged years correctly, that's what happens when you're a gay high schooler and you think no one understands you. I fault these characters, however, with being too dramatic--especially in the dialogue, but that ties into prose, which I'm getting to now.The real fault with this book was the writing style, which was unbearably juvenile. I can understand a simpler form of prose--it's 1st person from a few teenagers' points of view after all--but this goes beyond that. The only way I could possibly get through this book was with a red pen in hand. At first I was baffled to see how many five-star reviews this book got, but if writing style is not something that concerns a reader, that's fine, I suppose. However, it made me and my small LGBT book club want to throw the book across the room in frustration.If Roeder really worked hard to improve his style, I think we might have a passable gay YA author on our hands--goodness knows we need more of those. But as it stands at the moment, this book is not passable at all. I have read far better fan fiction."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I understand this book is probably witten for young teens, rather than adults readers, but I found the writing style to fall into the 'painting by numbers' style. The device of writing from the point of view of differing protagonists, setting out what was going through their minds, was shallow and superficial and did not stretch the mind orr the imagination. The story line was plodding, and predictable. I was driven mad by the tendency for all the male teen characters to break ut with floods of tears at the drop of a hankie. Even the tough \\"manly\\" football jock star was shedding copious tears. This is just so unbelievable. Talk about a bunch of sooks!!!. OK, I accept some of the situations they found themselves in were dire in the extreme, but hey, they needed to man up, not act like total pussies. And that gets me to the plot. Coincidence - ridden and implausible for much of the time, yet, just like the fairy tales of old, they all lived happily ever after. Mark Roeder, with this trite and urealistic \\"fairy\\" story, has set back the cause of gay youth fiction a thousand years."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This is one of three of Mark's books that I have read so far and is, in my opinion, the best yet read.Casper's character, especially early in the book, stimulates every sympathetic and protective nerve in your body. Sometimes so much so that it hurts. Brendan, almost a little too perfect to believe at first, develops very nicely as the story progresses and the balance between our two heroes shifts into gear before any seeming gulf between their needs and abilities becomes uncomfortable.Like all Mark's couples with whom I am familiar, Casper and Brendan really and truly *belong* together. It seems to take a little longer for them to show it in APB than is the case with characters in some of the other books. But that makes it all the more wonderful. There was a quite a bit of heartbreak, suspense and even a \\"dark secret\\" or two before Casper and Brendan truly \\"meld\\" in my mind's eyes. But when they do, the result is one of the most beautiful and believable stories of mutual love and support that I have had the pleasure of reading.Although other fans will disagree (we have *strong* opinions in this regard), I would readily recommend \\"A Better Place\\" to anyone who is curious about Mark A. Roeder's work (or about \\"gay teen romances\\" in general) as a \\"first read.\\" That recommendation stands whether the prospective reader is straight or gay or somewhere in between. Even more, I would recommend this book to parents or adult friends (teachers, employers, coaches, etc.) of gay young people who are a little unsure of what \\"being gay\\" can really mean. Mark captures the hopes and fears, as well as the trials and victories of young gay men and gives them a vitality and realism that is exquisite. If you have read other of Mark's books, you of course need no recommendation. But if you haven't, I urge you to try this one. It will definitely take you to a \\"far better place\\" than you might first imagine."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This is the story of Brendan, who has it all; looks, popularity, and money and Clint nicknamed Casper in grade school because he was thin and pale like Casper The Friendly Ghost. Casper is the poorest boy in school and is not in the popular clique, his brother beats him, his father ignores him and his mother passed away a few years before. The first half of this book takes us on the journey of how they come together and begin a relationship. Casper is excited at the attention paid to him by Brendan but the road they travel is not always easy. There are misunderstanding and mixed feeling to deal with along with friendships and betrayals, hardships and heartbreaks. The second half of the book explores just what they have to do for love and to be together. Is it worth it? Can they find their way to a better place? This story was critisized by other reviews for being to juvenile in its writing style and for the characters crying and descriptions of muscles but in my opinion the author hits the nail on the head with these situations. Perhaps others have forgotten what it was like to be a gay teen just coming out. It is not all easy. Crying is par for the course and seeing the muscles in good looking guys along the way is normal. The author switches from the points of view of the main characters so you do get a little overlap of some situations as they are described by each of them but it allows the reader a greater chance to get to know each character more by seeing how they react to the same situations. The boys end up in the town of Verona and meet up with characters from the authors three preious books. This book can be read without having read the others but I recomend the reading of the first three books to get some of the back ground history of the characters. Some authors seem to think that to write a coming out novel it has to be an &quot;event&quot; that the messages have to be grand and larger than life. No so here. Mark Roeder has found the voice of the young gay teen and captures it with depth and compasion without coming off as predictable or shallow. The joy of reading this book is you care for the characters and what happens to them. I can't wait for a sequel or to find out what happens next in Verona."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"It's wonderful to read a novel that pulls at your heartstrings and makes you care deeply about the main characters. But this novel will make you sad not only for what happens but that what happens also happens to too many other boys. But feel assured they do end up in A Better Place!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"\\"A Better Place\\", by Mark A. Roeder, is an engrossing tale of two boys from different worlds who fall in love. Readers may already be familiar with Roeder's other books in the \\"Gay Youth Chronicles\\" series. These include, \\"Ancient Prejudice\\", \\"The Soccer Field is Empty\\" and \\"Someone is Watching\\", to name a few.It is sad that young boys are taunted and shamed into keeping their true identities securely hidden. What could Brendan, a beautiful, incredibly popular, seventeen year old boy, captain of the football team, and an A student, have to fear when he seems to have the world on a plate? The truth is that he is gay and if anyone finds out, his life as he knows it, will be over. Could such fear of discovery be worth taking your own life, or even thinking about it?And what does Casper have to fear? He is fifteen, motherless, poor, lonely, and tormented by his brother, neglected by his alcoholic father, and bullied at school. He never gets sufficient food to eat, has a sparse wardrobe, and often sleeps outdoors to escape his abusive brother. He hasn't even admitted to himself that he likes boys. What would happen to him if people suspected he was gay too?Brendan and Casper make an unlikely couple, the rich boy who has everything, and the poor boy that has nothing, but they hook up. Their relationship is a bit stormy at first but Casper learns to trust Brendan, comes to terms with his homosexuality, and is able to return Brendan's love.Roeder gives us an amazing portrayal of the fear, self-loathing, and other problems these boys experience because of their sexual orientation. He captures the boys' emotions so deeply that the reader's own heart breaks for them and for all boys like them. It is disgraceful that they are made to feel perverted, abnormal, and inferior because much of society has deemed homosexuality immoral.It makes any accepting human being want to fix society, to change the puritanical idea that same sex love is wrong, to pass legislation that makes same sex marriage legal, and accept that it is diversity that makes our country great. We should all be free to love who we want without fear of discrimination, hatred, and prejudice.Anyone who has ever been teased or tormented appreciates the emotional toll it takes on self confidence and self esteem. It is depressing to hear Casper describe himself as \\"poor, unpopular, weak, puny, and pathetic,\\" while the reader sees a sweet, loveable, bright, and undernourished boy. Brendan's love for Casper makes him even more desirable.Roeder shows, parents who can not accept their children's sexual orientation and love them unconditionally, parents who do not protect their children, and a society that allows places like Cloverdale, a mental institution that uses physical, chemical (drugs), and psychological means to \\"cure\\" people of their homosexuality. There can be no equality and freedom until people accept that nothing can (or should) be done to make gay people straight.This story offers hope that a better place, away from fear, hatred, intolerance, and discrimination, does exist and at the same time, tells a heartwarming, exciting, and enjoyable story. I love Mark Roeder's books and hope he continues to share his talent with us for years to come."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"The beginning chapter read very much as \\"I like green. Green is my favorite. Houses are pretty.\\" It was tough, the sentences were oddly simple and didn't have much substance to them. You were into the plot and moving before you were really interested in following the characters along."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author but I have to admit, I want to go back and read his previous three books now. The story progresses beautifully and in such a way that you really believe the characters. I got really sucked in to this book and am still thinking about the characters several days later--they really get to you. Roeder really knows how to create a heart wrenching story line with characters you feel deeply for. I felt a wide range of strong emotions as the plot unfolded and the characters revealed their inner thoughts and feelings.Anyone who loves gay fiction will love this book, I promise. The one critique I can offer now is that I found it extremely annoying that there were so many typos, misuse of words and misspelled words in the book. It had the effect of pulling me out of the story.All in all, a great book. I hope to see these characters in following works by Roeder."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This was the romance story I have been searching all year for! How easy is it to find? Not easy at all! You've tasted purity of love and the devestating pain of loss in Mercedes Lackey's \\"The Last Herald-Mage\\" series. You've found the long lost classic \\"Maurice; a novel\\" E.M. Forster and \\"The god in Flight\\" Laura Argiri. You've read the more contempory novels like RD Zimmerman's \\"Hostage\\" and Alex Sanchez's \\"The Rainbow Boys\\" Well this is it! Casper and Brendan are the perfect match, so sweet and loving. Casper needed someone soo bad and thank god it was smart and understanding Brendan. In fact this story shows something that is refreshingly new and rarely seen; that all our education isn't wasted on the young. Kids in the here and now aren't so dumb or naive (mostly)as their parents may have been. There is still predjuice and ignorance but MAYBE it's not so strong in this next generation. Maybe with continuing education and generations it will disappear.. Well the first 'Part' is more then half the book and is the meat of Casper & Brendan's story. In Part 2 new characters are added and they meet others in Roeder's universe, a little slower paced here but no less wonderful (also a great taste of his other stories.) BUY IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Set in the early 1980s in Kentucky and Indiana, \\"A Better Place\\" is the story of two boys who fall in love and search for a place to call home. Casper is poor and the victim of incest. Brendan is the captain of the high school football team, and keeps his being gay a big secret, until he falls for Casper. They struggle through a rough beginning, but eventually they become boyfriends. When their secret gets out, their schoolmates are supportive, but Brendan's parents force him into a mental hospital for treatment. He escapes in time to save Casper from his sadistic brother, but at a terrible price. They flee and scrape by, until they end up in Verona, where they feel finally at peace, until Casper's family reaches him yet again. This is Roeder's fourth book in his gay youth series, and it intertwines with those tales, forming a tightly-fit jigsaw. Unfortunately, the story suffers because of it. As the novel progresses, events become more and more contrived and almost unbelievable. There are several passages of great writing, but the endless clich&eacute;s and stock characters drown these passages. Plus, the characters of Casper and Brendan are nearly indistinguishable in terms of story voice and actions, only the details of their backgrounds keep them separated in the reader's mind (poor/rich, abused/strong). I wanted to rate the book higher, but the final dozen or so pages reinforced the novel's deliberate lack of reaching beyond the plot's ubiquity in so many stories targeted to gay youth."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"As an educator I highly recommend this book to young and old alike. The main characters Casper and Brendan face incredible odds in their relationship and how they deal with those odds will not cease to amaze the reader. Mr. Roeder has given us a love story that at times is difficult to handle,(I had to put the book down several times and catch my breath), and yet so believable. Gay and straight youth and adults alike would benefit from this story that touches upon some very important issues.This is my first read from this author, I now want to read the other books in this series entitled \\"Gay Youth Chronicles\\" and I will. A definite five star read! Thank you Mr. Roeder for your wonderful story, your insight, and your ability to create such heart-warming characters. I look forward to reading all of your past and future work."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book is very uplifting in many ways even though it deals with some very somber issues. I had bought the book by mistake thinking it was cowritten with Donaghe, whom I adore (the book was misrepresented online--Donaghe only wrote the forward).It's a highly enjoyable read. However, oftentimes the poorly edited text gets in the way of my being able to enjoy the book to its fullest(simple grammatical mistakes like \\"it's\\" for \\"its\\" and vice versa are very annoying and seem to be quite rampant with the iUniverse books in general). Also, there are lots of redundancy in the text -- facts and situations are repeated many times, often just a couple of pages after they've been mentioned. This is arguably part of the conversational style of the book but it is highly distracting nonetheless (also, the argument about the conversational style doesn't really hold water since the three or four voices in the book all sound the same -- there is no differentiation in vocabulary or tone of each of the characters who are given a voice. Nathan is supposed to be more farmer-like and less educated-sounding than Brendan, yet Brendan makes the same grammatical mistakes as Nathan when it comes to possessives even though Brendan is supposed to have gotten all A's in high school (?).Brendan's experience at Cloverdale is a bit over the top and a bit orchestrated but it does serve as a painful reminder that such inhumane institutions do exist and our gay and lesbian youths are still being forced to change what they cannot change.Note: no explicit sex like some of the other books by iUniverse (perhaps because it's meant for young adults too, yet there are enough suggestions throughout that sex does goes on and quite a bit of it too (and not just kissing either)).Bad editing aside (by the way, the book was edited by the highly talented Dohaghe, whose many wonderful books are unfortunately plagued by the same grammatical mistakes as Roeder's), this book is still highly recommended to anyone who loves coming out movies or books such as Beautiful Thing, Common Sons, etc... All the young protagonists exude a positive and uplifting outlook on life, even in the face of tragic though highly plausible circumstances. It's a real pity that more attention wasn't paid to basic proofreading before it went to press. I would get more of Mark Roeder's books for sure as I greatly enjoy the subject matter he treats. --Compulsive reader from the Pacific NW."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This story is really pretty good, despite all the grammatical errors and typos. I personally thought the level of english was very simple and I was really, really disppointed with that. I have to say that I really expected more, considering all the good and positive reviews here. This is probably a book for young teens.The storyline is very basic and really unrealistic where it's all cheery and wonderful besides the character's pasts and some 'unfortunate' events that happen. I'd say this is pretty much a feel-good story because nothing bad actually happens to the characters and they never really seem to feel any negative emotions or insecurity throughout the story - which you would really expect from the characters because they had such horrible and trumatic pasts. That, doesn't seem realistic to me.Also, how all the characters are good when they're 'supposed' to be good, and if they're bad they're bad all the way, bothers me. There aren't any explanations for why they were bad, or how they became bad, or why they think the way they do - they just are. So although I do like the characters, I think they're not really planned out and designed very well. Like I said, this book is for children. It's too simple! People aren't like that in real life.The fact that this book was written in the first-person narrative means that we should at least get an insight into the character's feelings - regardless of whether they are good or bad. What Roeder has going on is a case of over-fluffing the characters he probably liked personally. Nothing too bad could happen to them and nothing too bad could ever cross their minds. Seems like the 'good' chracters had no flaws whatsoever.Don't get me wrong, I thought the characters were alright, but there wasn't really much character development on the others besides Casper - and that was really only at the beginning of the book. Casper's father somewhat changed too, but it's very odd that a father who never cared for his son and who was only mentioned several times in the book could come in all of a sudden and make things better for everyone on his expense. It's just too idealistic!I bought this book because I liked the odd-pairing thing the author decided to do. I thought it would take quite alot for him as a writer to have that work out. In a way, he did a good job in creating this idealistic, dream world where everything is so special and wonderful. Love is wonderful and people don't disagree; when a person is bad, he is downright bad; when someone is stuck in a rut he gets out of it really quickly without much of a problem at all - and other scenarios like that. Things don't usually happen that way. It's not that simple.The way the story it flows is alright, and I like how it's not so much like the common 'story' structure where it's exposition->complication->climax->resolution. I daresay that it's about a main 'story' followed by a mini 'story' and then another 'story' at the near-end. That is to say that the novel is really like a few stories written seperately and then pieced together. At least the transitions were somewhat smooth.If you want a simple book with a little bit of suspense and overall sugar-coated romance, get it. It's a pretty good book really. It was just some minor problems with the characters and also the writing style that could have been fixed to make it better. Honestly, I'd recommend it for a read if you have nothing better to do and feel like you'd want to curl up and read something uncomplicated and sweet. This book is really addictive. The only reason why I'm keeping it in my collection of ...-themed books despite it's simplicity, is that it did make me feel good and tingly because of the romance in it as well as the idealism.Well, that's just my opinion. I probably had too high an expectation for it. Nevertheless, it's a good, simple read for a boring day. Enough said, get it!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Amazing book I kind of wish that this had just the story of first 5 characters Casper and Brendan are amazing I love their story I just want to know about them but guess I'll have to read it all to understand!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Our answer is the world's hope.

I used my Kindle to see how many times the word showed up, and it was 118. Fantastic book otherwise."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Actual rating is about 3.5 only for three reasons: 1) as mentioned by other reviewers, some of Roeder's cliche phrases and pat situations are repeated a little too much, 2) the story set-up isn't very original (opposites, blond with brunette, etc.) from all his other works, and 3) the ending got somewhat slow with semi-repeat scenarios from diff. perspectives...BUT! It held my interest. There were a few surprises, very good issues to look at, and the characters- while at times overly sensitive in some situations- were likeable and root-worthy. Fans of the Gay Chronicles series, this is one you'll appreciate, and if you're not, well, it still has something for you. Just a bit of wishful thinking for next time: hopefully, he'll compress the ending cuts-per-character a bit more; many of them weren't very necessary."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This was the first book that I read by Mark Roeder.

But I will say that deciding to read this book is one of the happiest decisions I've ever made.Read &quot;The Soccer Field is Empty&quot; and &quot;Someone is Watching&quot; before you read this.

It is part of a series called The Gay Youth Chronicles. I have since read all of them including the latest one This Time Around, which was just published at the end of march.A Better Place is griping and awesome. Be warned though, you are going to need tissues next to your reading area. It beautifully tells the love story of two unlikely lovers. Brendan, the popular high school football star hunk from a well to do family. Then there is Casper a poor puny, under nurished runt who is terrorized by school mates and brutlized by his older brother. Not to mention a drunken uncaring dad. I loved this book because the drama never slows down and at the end of the book, I felt like, I had taken the journey with them to a better place."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Before I bought the book, I read some of the reviews here. The opinions are stretched out to the two extremes. After reading the book, I think both sides are correct. In terms of diction, sentence composition and writing style in general, this is indeed not a difficult book as one side pointed out. If you are looking for the richness of language, maybe this is not your number one choice. Meanwhile, I found beauty in the simplicity of the book. More precisely, I found myself lost in the romance that the author sensitively expresses with his uncomplicated words and carefully weaves in between the lines and passages throughout this novel. Though unrealistic it may seem from time to time, the ideal of love that we were raised to believe in and pursue after is reconstructed between the two protagonists, Brendan and Casper in this novel. And to me, given that love at its &iexcl;ideal&iexcl; itself implies that it may be unrealistic, this is still a good book that is worthwhile of your money and time."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I know that it may seem corny to say that A Better Place is touching and moving but it is! Brendan, the jock of all jocks, a man among boys, the dream boy of all the girls, smart, intelligent, obviously he is in heaven, right? Casper - wears old clothes, motherless, abused by older brother and ignored by drunk father; a loser? What do these two people have in common? Each other, they are both gay high school students. It is set in a contemporary setting but some opinions have not changed. This is a true love story on how two people met, had quite a few problems at first but when people finally listened... I do not want to give away the plot but there are incidents and situations where we can all identify with whether straight or gay! I would love to teach this book in my classroom. If you know people who are struggling with their gay identity, I strongly recommend this novel. Thank you Mark Roeder for a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"&amp;#65279;Love is never easy. But, when you are young, have no legal rights, and are despised by many other people, &quot;never easy&quot; becomes &quot;almost impossible.&quot; Casper and Brendan are opposites in every way. Each of them, on their own, is limited by their situations. That changes when they are able to admit the feelings they have for each other. Together they are able to overcome disapproving families, abusive relatives, bigoted classmates, and a world that wants to keep them apart.The give-and-take convention of having each boy tell his own story in alternating chapters presents a clear picture of the relationship between them and heightens the suspense of the story. Strangely enough, although the convention does intensify the action in the book, it also draws one into the more tender moments. I was chilled by the therapeutic techniques used to change Brendan and by the abuse in Casper's homelife. But, I was entranced to watch the relationship between Casper and Brendan develop. It made it hard to deny that this love is real."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I didn't hate this book, but the bad writing distracted from the story. I liked the story. It may be full of clich&eacute;s, but it was entertaining. Most of the dialogue didn't flow naturally, and the author kept repeating himself when describing the characters or situations. It just came off as cheesy. Some of the situations the characters found themselves in seemed rushed and unrealistic. This isn't the first book I've read from this author. So I know he is a better writer. I'm assuming this is one of his first novels."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"We all read novels for different reasons and with different expectations. When I read A Better Place, I was expecting a sort of \\"Cinderella Story\\"-poor, downtrodden boy is swept away by the godlike High School super-stud and lives happily ever after. I definitely got my money's worth on that front, but had absolutely no idea I would read anything so incredibly powerful and emotional. I was not at all expecting that I would develop such a love and, yes, deep emotional bond with the characters. I've never experienced anything quite like it.Casper, the poor boy, is almost the poster child for \\"whatever possibly can go wrong, has\\". He's almost a caricature at times-but I SO DEEPLY cared for him and what he felt and experienced and thought. Roeder's writing style-while judged by some in online reviews as \\"immature\\"-was done with the purpose of making the reader FEEL what it's like to be 15-year old Casper. I think it was remarkable...Brendan, the football jock, is similarly almost too perfect to be true-but the things that he goes through, the decisions he makes and the thoughts he has are likewise so powerful. Brendan is like the IDEAL of who we all wish we could be or have as a soul mate. In fact, I'm not too proud to say that I think of the character of Brendan as supremely heroic for who he is. This IS only a romantic fantasy, but I'd be willing to put Brendan up as a young gay role model anywhere, at any time. In fact, through the character of Brendan, Mark Roeder has written what I would consider the MOST POWERFUL, beautiful, thought-provoking and inspiring dialog I've ever read in any gay fiction (the opening paragraph on page 313).By the time I reached the final page, I'd read something that spoke to me very deeply. I've been accused many times of being a \\"hopeless romantic\\"-and will freely admit that I am-but this story meant so much more to me than that. I couldn't recommend it highly enough.I timidly have to admit, though, that there was many a grammatical, editing or spelling error to be found-a common feature of P.O.D. books-but I'm more than willing to overlook those, given the situation.While A Better Place is actually the third novel in Roeder's six-volume Gay Youth Chronicles series, it ended up being the one I read first. I actually read it completely, cover-to-cover, TWICE online before buying it and reading it AGAIN in hardcopy. I've never felt so drawn to any work of fiction before and it's because of the power of the story, the love I found I have for the characters and the way the entire novel made me feel.The complete Gay Youth Chronicles canon (The Soccer Field is Empty, Someone is Watching, A Better Place, Someone is Killing the Gay Boys of Verona, Keeper of Secrets, and Do You Know That I Love You?) has provided the most enjoyable fictional world for me of anything I've ever read-the eternal saga of Verona, Indiana. Each novel has a distinct flavor and deals with some very important topics. I would wholeheartedly suggest you purchase and read ALL of them, and in the above order. While A Better Place can indeed stand alone, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND reading AT LEAST The Soccer Field is Empty first. A Better Place contains \\"spoilers\\" for the earlier story, which-in all honesty-made Soccer Field extremely difficult for me to read (see my review of that incredible book).PLEASE read and understand this book for what it is-and don't be deterred by petty online reviews by anonymous readers. A Better Place and Mark Roeder deserve so much more than that."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"The story was good, the writing was good, the characters were good, but this novel would have been a much smoother read if Roeder had employed a copyeditor wirth his salt. As a fellow writer, I realize the importance of making a story move smoothly, and this was hampered by the many spelling and grmatical errors found in the text. Still, though, I really enjoyed the action in this book and it is evident that Roeder is getting better and better at what he does."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Brendan is the dream guy! All fears of both characters were legit. The first part of the book was totally awesome from the way the character profiles were set-upped upto the whole relationship thing. The second part of the book was more of a cross over. Not the continuity one is expecting after the great first part but nontheless it is a great book. Looking forward for a sequel of the 2 characters if there is any."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book is good, but it is too unrealistic, and main character, the football jock Brandan cried too much.It started off very good and interesting, because you gotta see clint & brandan different point of view and how people think differently without knowing what others think. Then afterward the plot is getting too unrealistic and like chances for that happen is zero, after like clint & brandan meet nathan & ethan, they are almost like identical twins and very similar (or same) backgroud and like everyone around them is all accepting and so. It is not a bad book, but actually i expect more from it."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Series: God I hope not, but I believe there is another book.Sex Level: Undetailed, but mentioned.Finished Book: Yes, reluctantlySpoilers In The Review: Yes, but insignificance.Pros:*The only pro I can think for this book is that is was finished before published.Cons:*Very simple sentence structure that makes using your brain unnecessary.*The author also doesn't include you in on the time setting of the book until about 63% of the way through, so you're left wondering where on earth does this take place.*The characters fall in love after two conversations.*The author fails to include development from one idea to another. EX) Casper is not he's real name (but nickname gave to him in elementary from bullies that stuck), however, Branden is told that is his name and you never hear him all Casper anything else, making the reader assume that Branden thinks this is Casper's real name. Later (about 95%) you see Casper's Grandmother calling calling Casper by his real name and Branden does not react at all, as though he has known the entire time without the readers being included on that.*Characters just happen to fall into place, as in, when one character is in trouble a \\"new\\" character in suddenly in the position to help. An obvious attempt to get past one plot point into another the easiest way possible.*Branden attempts to tell Casper he loves him but ends up touching him inappropriately instead?*The \\"whole\\" school excepts both Branden and Casper as gay! That is unrealistic in that time period.*The two main characters eventually meet another gay couple who are exactly like them, but with different names.Casper- raped by brotherNathan- raped by mom(They also look the same)Branden- excepted by his football teamEthan- excepted by his wrestling team(They also look the same)Overall: DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I thought this book was a bit on the \\"tame\\" side. I was looking to read about real life experiences when teens are coming to grips with their sexuality - and this includes their sexual experiences as well. The book never really touched on the boys sexual experiences! I'm not looking to read erotic novels, but do enjoy real life stories with real life sex as well. This book might be more appreciated by a younger audience who can relate more to the characters in the book. I just felt the story was not quite real enough!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Has a horrible \\"show don't tell problem\\", pacing problems, clich&eacute;s are handled poorly and characters are rather two dimensional."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I guess the author never heard of a developmental editor because some of the passages in this book are so weak and simple, I was suprised a grown man wrote them (I mean, pages and pages of simple dialogue and sentence structure). But then, this is one of those instant books, self-published, and so there is often very little quality assurance. The cover (blurry) should have warned me. I'm not sure why this book earned all the positive reviews, unless maybe the author enlisted friends and family. To me, it's no better than monkey-scratch."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Let me say first off that I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun to read and the story moved forward quickly. But it was &quot;fantasy&quot;. To call it &quot;a romance&quot; is to be far too generous in one's praise. Oh alright - we'll call it &quot;a fantasy romance&quot;.The writing style is simple, almost childlike. This reads more like the work of a high school student than a multi-published author. All of the men in the story are crying half the time. I know gay men are supposed to be sensitive, but this was ridiculous. There were enough tears to float a navy of pink rowboats. This is not to mention &quot;bulging muscles&quot; which popped out at every encounter, whether with the good guys or the bad guys. And what about those rape scenes, which were the sole property of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and which were obviously supposed to be the source of major trauma for the &quot;good guys&quot;. Me thinks the author got off just a little too much on those fantasys. If they were supposed to be the root of so much pain and turmoil for our heros, why did the author write in such delicious detail of these warped episodes?So, I conclude with my point that this is really just a fantasy -a gay Harlequin Romance. I enjoyed reading it and rate it four stars. Within its class, it deserves such a rating despite its contrived plot, stereotypical characterizations and numerous grammatical and spelling errors."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I have read a lot of books. This is the first time I've read a book with a gay theme. And i love it. I finished the book, read it once, twice, thrice and still couldn't get enough of this novel.I don't know why I am so drawn to this book. Maybe because of the characters and the story. Casper and Brendan are two most unlikely couple ( like the author already said). One is rich, one is poor. One is popular, the other gets beaten around.I guess I'd like to think that fairy tales do come true, that love will conquer all, and that one day we will meet the person of our dreams, sweep us away to a better place."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"What can I say? This is one of the most fasinating stories I have read in a long time. I read this book unexpectantly one weekend, and let me tell you I was not disappointed. The main characters, Casper and Brenden, seem to be an unlikely pair.Brenden, (captian of the football team,most popular kid in school, and all around hunk)notices and befriends Casper (poor little hungry dude who everyone seems to beat up on). At first things go well, then not so well, then things are better again. I don't want to give the story away but I'll just say they find love( and it is tested often).I believe that Mark A. Roeder has done a great job of making a book that is not only engaging but satisfying. The way Roeder goes between perspectives is great, you get a better idea of the personality of each character. It is phenominal how he can incorporate characters from his previous novels to make a rolling storyline. Although part of a series this book can stand alone. I have never read one of his books before but this has left me itching for more."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"When I opened this book I had no idea that it would be one I couldn't easily put down. It was heart-warming, moving, and full of emotion. The author's approach to having each character tell his side of the story took a little getting used to, but it added depth and I found it very enjoyable. The punctuation and choice of words were sometimes distracting, but when you place yourself in the roll of each character, it fit very well. I enjoyed the storyline, the emotional ups and downs, and the heart-warming feeling of how true love knows no boundaries. Bravo!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Let me say first off that I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun to read and the story moved forward quickly. But it was &quot;fantasy&quot;.

My partner died when he was 40 years old, dating in gay society is almost nonexistent, so I thought I would never love again or be loved and to this day find it hard to live each day knowing I will be alone in a world where you almost have to have a very friend, partner just to make life easier.We made it through the ruff parts, just ready to settle down and Brian died of a diabetic heart attack when I woke up the next morning with my arm wrapped around him. This was brought on by a doctor who prescribed incorrect medication, but since his family didn't even want him being gay, they seem not to even care about his wrongful death.We had so many plans, so many things to do; he had no desire to die so I am left with suicidal thoughts and anger, major depression, now living at my mother's at 45.Wish someone could write a book about what I and us both went through in our lives, you would find a true, sad life to live."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"I went back to read this novel by Mark Roeder since, having read Masked Destiny, I learned some info about one of the character, Brendan Brewer, that let me think it was a nice and sweet love story; in a way it's and there is also a bit of \\"fairytale\\" feeling that makes it light, and on the contrary of Masked Destiny, there isn't any paranormal event, making it an ordinary, and in this case ordinary is nice, coming of age story.Brendan is the most popular kid at high school, quarterback of the football team, handsome and friendly, for a very wealthy family that allow him to have a nice car and all the last fashion available, Brendan is even more fascinating since he seems unaware of his good looks and fortune. Brendan has also a secret, but not really something that is causing him trouble: he is gay, and in his openness and yes, lucky youth, he has already realized it and decided it's fine. Sure, Brendan is aware he cannot come out at school that it's not easy, but more or less, he is fine.Not the same for Casper; he is the poorest kid at school, and even worst, he is abused at home; his older brother has more than once abused him and he is still doing that. Most night Casper sleeps under the open sky to avoid being alone in the same room with his brother. In his young mind, Casper associates being gay with being abused, and so, when Brendan makes a move with him, Casper is scared to death.But as I said, Brendan is such a nice boy that Casper in the end is able to trust him; their newfound happiness is destroyed by Brendan's family and but the dramatic decision they take on their son's fate. Again Brendan will prove to be strong and with a self-consciousness that is rare in such a young man; he will maintain the promise he did to Casper to protect him, whatever it will take.I preferred the first part of the story, until Brendan and Casper are trying to find their path in life alone; I found the last part, when Brendan and Casper go to live with Ethan and Nathan (from Someone Is Watching) a little too similar to what I guess is Ethan and Nathan's own story, almost a repetition. All in all, I think that, even if Casper is cuter and the one who needs more protection, even from the reader point of view, I think the best character was Brendan, I most of all loved how he is so open with his feelings and ready to love despite all the trouble it implies."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book is very good! I did notice a few things here and there that maybe were typos but I still understood everything. This book had me so into it that I found it hard to put down. It went beyond my expectations. I do agree with some reviews about the over use and explantion of muscles, but over all it was extremely well written. I was actually sad I was done reading ti because I was so into it. This book had me smiling, laughing, angry, and sad to. The writer really gets down to detail and makes you feel what they are feeling in the book. I recommend this book for everyone to read!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Mark A. Roeder's books are engaging, entertaining and well written. I enjoy reading his works."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This is another gripping story from Mark Roeder. Fans of his earlier books should read this book for sure. We meet two new guys and follow them through some unbelievably scary times. We also see familiar faces towrd the end. I don't want to give anything away, because this is a book not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"First, I must say I found the story more \\"far-fetched\\" than most. Some of the situations the characters found themselves in seemed unreal but that may be just me. Nonetheless, I felt the writing showed great talent. The author found heartening ways to bring the characters together. It is about teenagers, so I felt some of the book was \\"younger\\" in maturity, but I think this fits with the story quite well.One thing I found unique to this book (compared to most I have read) is the fact that their is no sex. Sometimes it is implied, but the details are left to imagination. At first, I thought this was strange but soon realized that it actually enhanced the story and placed more of a focus on the characters themselves instead of the characters physical relationship. As a gay man myself, I find the gay culture overly emphasizes physical attractions with respect to emotional bonds. This story focuses on true commitment and the struggle to find a better place (yes, corny I know! :)I actually bought this one with two others...I had high hopes for the other two but this one turned out to be the best. I pretty much couldn't set it down for more than an hour or two! If you enjoy gay romances, especially between younger people, this book is highly recommended. However, take note that this book will not give you hot steamy sex as I previously mentioned. Great read, well worth the time!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"An emotional roller coaster ride for sure. Having been there myself I can not give enough praise for such a wonderful piece of work!"},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"What an absolutely involving book. I read this book first before reading all the others in this series. The others were not needed but it gave greater clarity to the story.

It was lovely to be there in the story."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"Overall the book was quite good...it had a few problems, it tended to get a little repetitive and it did have quite a few grammatical errors (makes it look less professional)...Good story line though, suggestive, but not too much.

It tells the story of two boys from very different lives and how they come to find a common love for one another. I was a high school athlete who was \\"out\\" and dating a fellow football player my senior year too, so this book was amazingly real and personal to me. It's focus is on feeling and emotion not just two 17 year olds going at it. It brings to the surface the idea that we too as a community strive for love and acceptance the same as everyone else. Its a love story I personally would love to think is not only possible but going on all over our country right now."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book was great, for me, until about 3/4 of the way through.It starts off very interesting, and I love the way this Author writes (Switching from One Character's point of view, to the other's). This was the first book by Roeder I had read, but towards the end I realized that there were some tie in stories I had missed.One thing bothered me and that was all the mistakes in the books.. typos abound.. everywhere.. Twice in the book, on far and separate occasions, they reffered to a character named &quot;Brad&quot; as &quot;Brendan&quot; when they had just mentioned &quot;Brendan&quot; who was talking about &quot;Brad.&quot; I had to re-read that a few times to understand what they really mean. Also, you'd find words missing letters every now and then and you'd have to interpret that. I expect more from a professional print.As for the story...I must say, tha the last part of the book pretty much ruined it for me. It was as if Roeder decided he was going to jump into a fairy land and give everyone a happy pill coctail of prozac, zanax, lithium (and various other mood elevators). He woke up from this dream but only to late to realize he had f***ed up what was previously a good story.The story is far from realistic (Which I can deal with to an extent). Granted, it is fiction and there are obviously some things that will be different, but this really should be put in the &quot;Fantasy&quot; section or maybe a &quot;Romance for Lovesick Fruitcakes&quot; section. But this kind of thing never happens.As I say, the story is great and interesting and you really care until about 3/4 of the way through when everyone turns into a unicorn and jumps around and plays in the fields. I expected Glenda the Good witch of the north (at one part) to come in and bless everyone with her fairy wand.**** MINOR SPOILER DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****So, once Casper and Brendan get to Verona, Indiana... close the book and put it up or do whatever you do with books you've just finished because you can just assume &quot;and they lived happily ever after&quot; because everything past that point was boring crap and a waste of my time. It was like a 70 page epilogue. that really didn't do anything it was so anti-climactic. I laughed almost the entire time, and not because it was funny. I just kept imagining Bambi running accross their front yard and everyone playing with bunnies. If you make it this far in the book, you'll know exactly what I mean."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"This book is definitely a teen book. The writing is simple at best. The story seems choppy, mostly because of the grammatical and spelling errors. The characters are likeable, but somewhat unbelievable. Casper is on one extreme end. He is utterly and desperately poor, beaten, molested, and has only one shirt and pair of jeans? He only has moldy mayonnaise to eat? It is hard to believe that he spends all evening wondering around after school, you would think he would get a job. I know that opposites attract, and the fact the Brendan falls for Casper is believable, I just think that the author has tried too hard to make them opposite. This bothered me for the entire story.The author seems to have the need to constantly repeat himself in simple terms to prove a point. I would have liked this book better if the writing had been more complex. It is a great story, but I think that anyone over fifteen would find the writing a little uninteresting."},{"Title":"A Better Place","review":"(...)All i want to say is how much i loved this book,it broke my heart then put it back together again,which if you have read this book i'm sure youll understand.I bought this book on my home site Amazon uk for (...)

I started off very good, was suspenseful, but after the first half, it just seemed to drag on. I saw about 4 places where he could have ended the book, and near the end, it was extremely anticlimactic, many questions went unanswered, and the ending which should have been a very emotional and climactic moment fell far short of par. I also feel he put some scenes in just to make the book longer. It was a good book though, but it left a lot to be desired. 3 Stars."},{"Title":"Confederate Quartermaster in the Trans-Mississippi","review":"From the reviews . . .\\"[A]n important contribution to the historian's knowledge of a significant aspect of the military operations of the Civil War.\\"George L.

They fail to even hint at what would be possible to attain with any degree of experience. There are better choices available for anyone who plans to continue with much painting.

When I was a child this book opened my eyes to the sciences that were out there to study. It also showed that two people could change what is known about evolution."},{"Title":"Silas and the Mad-Sad People","review":"This book shows a child Silas making sense out of hearing his parents are going to divorce. He takes it out sideways on his best friend and dog, getting angry rather than addressing the subject directly. His parents help him address the topic and his feelings. He recalls hearing his mother and father fight and begins to understand this separation means less fighting.The book uses an image of a spider plant having difficulty thriving in its stuffed pot, but does better when repotted separating it into two plants. Silas sees he is included in both Mother and Dad's worlds with his own space and own things to do with each of them. He sees divorce doesn't mean losing either parent, just having a family in a different way where all can thrive."},{"Title":"Photo Art & Craft","review":"The book has lots of great ideas, unfortunately, most of them require the photo to be photocopied.

It shows the fascinating and touching interactions of preschoolers and teachers, the dilemmas and joys parents face as they watch their children grow, and the nitty-gritty details of what a child-care center needs to do to survive financially and provide high quality care. The characterization is strong, and I found that I really came to care about the particular children and teachers in the book. As a parent, I was entertained by some of the children's very familiar antics. When I was finished with the book, I passed it along to the director of my son's preschool, and she found it so interesting and informative that she's been having her staff read it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"\\"Come to Me\\"","review":"This book absolutely stunned me. I started reading just a few pages in it and couldn't stop until it was over. If you know someone who is going through problems or seriously considers giving up on life, this is the book they should read. If you are a counselor or pastor and must speak to hurting people, this is the book you should read. If you've ever found yourself at the end of your rope just wanting a few minutes of peace from the hectic, stressful everyday routine of life, this is for you. Pastor Mark is truthful and realistic in the stories he tells and the examples he uses both from his own life and the lives of others. This is truly a hard feat to accomplish properly, as there is a fine line between encouraging someone with your story, and turning it into a pity-party. Pastor Mark definitely succeeds in the former. Even though the struggles he mentions are hard, he's always pointing to the God who makes it possible to live through them. This book is harsh reality with hope. I still find myself thinking about points made often. I can't recommend it highly enough. You need this one."},{"Title":"The Marching Wind (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"This is truly a well-written, great adventure. Although I think that Clark embellishes the dangers of his trip, you definitely get a good feeling of the difficulties and potential threats.(Immediate post WW-II period, during Chinese Civil War). Basically, it details Clark's expedition to explore Amne Machin, which he suspected to be higher than Mt. Everest. The probable real mission was however to map the region and prepare for a retreat of the defeated Chinese Moslem/Nationalist Army through Tibet. In any case, it makes for exciting reading, and Clark is a fine writer, with a good sense of humour and insightful comments. He's not a scholar, but a true adventurer; nevertheless, he seems to exhibit detailed knowledge over many subjects and appears to be an astute observor.I first read this book (hardback edition from the 1950s) some 30 years ago, and was quite pleased when I discovered that LongRiders has re-issued in paperback form. The paper and binding seems pretty decent, and the only real negative is the poor quality of the photographs, which are not reproduced on glossy paper. The other minor quibble is the fact that since this is a reprint, an introduction/retrospective would have been useful. This could have included some info on the fate of the author (he died under somewhat mysterious circumstances in the late fifties in South America) or Amne Machin (it's not higher than Everest) or even some info on the Qinghai region today. But again, these are minor points that shouldn't detract from a great story..."},{"Title":"The Marching Wind (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"Although The Marching Wind was written in the late 40's, this non-fiction story is still very intriguing in today's world. It relates the story of traveler/explorer Leonard Clark and his yak caravan journey through Tibet. Clark convinced the Chinese Nationalist leaders that he could find them an escape route through Tibet as the communists approached. At the same time, Clark plans to measure a mountain in Tibet that is reputably higher than Everest.The book is written as a detailed travel log of the expedition through the wilds of forbidding Tibet during incredibly cold weather for which none of the modern equipment used for extreme weather is available. The caravan is constantly on watch for the fierce Ngolog tribe members reputed to be highly aggressive and murderous. It is a well written and exciting story."},{"Title":"The Marching Wind (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"The formal reasons for Clark's 1949 journey in Qinghai (surveying uncharted mountains; archeological excavations; and aiding escape of Nationalist Chinese) may be mere rationales for his archaic 19th century-style expeditions. But the former OSS major certainly found adventure, with arduous conditions, bandit raids and political machinations recounted in melodramatic but serviceable prose. \\"Marching Wind\\" has useful ethnographic and scientific data from eastern Greater Tibet, though some critics doubt its accuracy. Clark briefly enjoyed fame because his flawed calculations suggested that the Anye Machin range had peaks higher than Everest, but the bulk of the book holds up better. Its main value may lie in detailing the tensions between the end of \\"old\\" China (already vastly transformed, as the presence of foreign devils like Clark confirms) and Chinese efforts to avoid or adapt to the impending Communist new order. The story often alternates between the anxieties of officials and communities loyal to the Guomindang, and the routine--not timeless--activities of people for whom epochal changes in China proper seemingly had little relevance. Despite use of a station wagon (no kidding) in the early stages, this Equestrian Classic will find readers among the growing number of trekkers to these remote regions. Owen Lattimore's slightly earlier travels and writings offer a substantive contrast to Clark's rather self-absorbed, but still worthwhile, account. G. Rowell, \\"Mountains of the Middle Kingdom\\" assesses Clark and other explorers of China's Far West, with many stunning photos."},{"Title":"The Marching Wind (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"I noticed this book on my parent's book shelf when I was growing up. My 5th grade class had studied Tibet and I always meant to read it. Well, many years later, I finally got around to it and it turned out to be a rather interesting book. What makes it interesting is this glimpse at the many different people who make up the vast area of Tibet.The author, Leonard Clark, is a rather archaic type of fellow to read in the 21st century. It's somewhat akin to reading about a 19th Century explorer 50 years ago. The man, fresh out of World War II intrigue in this general area of China, decides that he wants to explore the area of a sacred mountain. The name of the mountain is Amne Machin and it is located deep in the thinly explored areas of Tibet. Mr. Clark briefly explains the background to his quest and, before we know it, he is on his way to Tibet with a mere $1200 to finance his travels. He is an odd sort of fellow who reminds you of a middle-aged bachelor British nobleman who explores for a living. His rare reflections on life indicate a rather detached point of view.We sense his quest to find and measure the height of Amne Machin although I didn't feel particularly excited about this aspect of his travels. I was most interested in the many different tribes of peoples and their remoteness from the rest of the world. Many of these different tribesmen are Mongols who date back to the original Horde. Mr. Clark has convinced the local military leader of the need to find an escape route from the unstoppable advance of the Red Chinese. Thus he is able to explore this lawless area accompanied by a small army. Mr. Clark is an astute observer of the many different tribes, flora, fauna, customs, topography and travails of the area. I found myself shivering with him in the many blizzards he seemed to encounter. I also found myself wondering if I, too, could survive on the various forms of food and drink that he subsisted on.This book didn't exactly grab me once I started reading it. In fact I kept it at the office and would read a bit of it several times a week during my lunch break. It left me wondering about whatever happened to these many tribes of people rather than wondering whatever happened to the author."},{"Title":"The Marching Wind (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"As an avid fan of early nonfiction exploration/adventure tales, I had to read THE MARCHING WIND after first reading Clark's most amazing book THE RIVERS RAN EAST. (I gave THE MARCHING WIND only four stars - maybe unfairly, as THE RIVERS RAN EAST was even better.) This is another mind-boggling Clark adventure and was really insightful regarding the China/Tibet tribal clans in the 1940s. I used a NatGeo map of China to follow his described route throughout the book which was helpful. He was a pretty remarkable man and a heck of an adventurer. His book A WANDERER TILL I DIE is another good adventure read."},{"Title":"Jacob's Ladder:: Wisdom for the Heart's Ascent (Jacob the Baker Series)","review":"This surprising book by an author I had never heard of knocked my socks off.

Nobody navigates the rocky road to love better than this author. She proved that with her first book, Hoodwinked, and firmly cements her position with Rebel Road.Melissa Simmons - Lissa to her friends - is a young Canadian with many talents.She's a university student majoring in criminology and a Field Engineer with the Canadian Armed Forces. Being a crack sniper and demolitions expert are among her military skills. At age 22, love has been furthest from her mind as she pursued her twin careers. When her childhood friend Fernando asks for Lissa's help, she goes to him despite her family's protests.Alexander Demitrius is the reigning prince of a once influential Mediterranean island paradise. Warring rebels, headed by Fernando, have torn the Prince's world apart. Alex is strong-willed, a powerful and charismatic leader with no intentions of allowing rebels to usurp his rule. He dreams of a unified island and being taken seriously by the world. When he meets what appears to be a guileless female tourist - the intrepid Melissa - his thoughts of warring are interrupted by dreams of her seduction. Alex is no stranger to the game of seduction, but meets his match in this evasive Canadian female.Ah yes! Passion flares from their first meeting, despite Melissa knowing they are destined to be enemies. One part of her participates daily in down and dirty guerilla fighting - at which she excels - while the female heart of her imagines the virile Alexander as lover. When she is captured by the enemy, the prince uses everything at his disposal to break her will. Classic sensory deprivation fails to work so he reverts to applying his considerable charm. Melissa is a virgin, ripe for the plucking, and more than willing to be plucked when sexual attraction turns to love. And when a serious illness almost takes her life, Prince Alexander learns a bitter lesson: Some things are more important than war or always being right.This author sets such scenes so well - leading lovers through their paces towards that inevitable first coupling - and she does not disappoint in Rebel Road. Melissa, her delightfully sexy prince, and breathless readers of romantic fiction are all in for a treat, thanks to the inventive mind of Jennifer Lynn."},{"Title":"SHIPS AND THE SEA A CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW","review":"Contains lots of large, accurate and beautifully done line drawings of ships from across the ages.

My experience was not unique; many current and former engineers were motivated to enter the profession by their reading of Tom Swift adventures.In this adventure, the United States is under attack by a criminal organization that uses powerful sound waves to send a city into a panic attack. Battling back, Tom and his father are working on a device that will send out sound waves whose phases are the opposite of those of the attack. When the waves interact they will cancel out, leaving only silence. This is one of the episodes of the series that is more scientifically reasonable; the principle of cancellation of waves is well known.The adventure takes Tom and company all the way to the Australian Outback This adds a little interest because you are introduced to some of the expressions used by Australians. After a series of battles, setbacks and partial successes, Tom is able to defeat the gang and prevent the United States government from having to pay extortion money.The Tom Swift series is more about generating an interest in science, technology and engineering than it is about staying within the confines of physical reality. Read with that in mind, this and all other books in the series are successes. In this case, the book is a bit more successful because there are no major violations of the laws of physics."},{"Title":"Looking at Photographs: 100 Pictures from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art","review":"This book fills the reader with emotion and knowledge about photography and photographs.

Anyone who loves the subject or art in general will find excitement on every page. NOW I can begin to know which photographers to study first and how to approach an enormous subject."},{"Title":"Looking at Photographs: 100 Pictures from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art","review":"Although this book has much less female nudity than many photographic books, there are two such pages in the book. If this type of representation is offensive to you, either skip this book or avoid those pages.This book has modest purposes. &quot;This is a picture book, and its first purpose is to provide the material for simple delectation.&quot; Beyond that, it is &quot;a visual interim report [as of 1973] on the results of collecting photographs at The Museum of Modern Art.&quot; These purposes are magnificently fulfilled, and your eyes and mind will be filled with many useful new perspectives and thoughts as a result of your delectations here. Your life will be expanded by seeing much more, both in photographs and in life, as a result.Mr. Szarkowski, head of the photography collection at MOMA, points at that photography &quot;has received little serious study.&quot; As a result, a language and analytical framework for considering photography are not yet developed. To overcome that limitation. Mr. Szarkowski has provided a number of perspectives in the one-page essays that accompany each page of photography. These perspectives include the utilitarian purpose of the image, the style of the photographer, the technology of the methods used, and the significance of the subjects or subject. He also draws your attention to detail or information that expand your knowledge. It is like having the best docent's photography tour of your life, as you go through the images.These essays are modestly described as simply &quot;an attempt to describe photography from a somewhat more liberal and exploratory perspective.&quot; Well, they are much more than that. They are like turning the light on to see the photographs for the first time, unless you are a talented photographer already.In creating this book, a great decision was made to limit each photographer to one page of work. In this way, you get to see more types of images and styles. I think this added greatly to the knowledge and enjoyment that can be gained from this wonderful book. A great benefit of this approach was to allow selecting photographs that would reproduce well in this page size format. I heartily approve of that approach!In the book you will find portraits, sketches for painters, ways of recording far away places, Civil War reporting, aerial reconnaisance, methods of encouraging connections, insights into the physics of life, and efforts to be a successor to painting. As the author says, &quot;Photography has remained . . . radical, instructive, disruptive, influential, problematic, and [an] astonishing phenomenon of the modern epoch.&quot;Here are my favorite images:D.O.

From the beginning, the museum has been committed to photography and was the first museum to establish its own independent department of photography. Invariably, there are copious hangings from the collection available for viewing whenever you visit MOMA. The museum should be proud of creating and now reproducing an improved version of this wonderful set of selections from its extensive collection. Perhaps it is time to create a larger version of this book that is more representative of the whole collection.After you finish expanding your vision through these marvelous essays and photographs, I urge you to do some photography of your own to express yourself. You will appreciate what you see even more when you create your own images. A good way to begin is to find a subject that is covered in this book and create your own version of that subject. In that way, you can get &quot;inside of the camera&quot; with the photographer. After your photographs can be seen, compare them with the book. Go back and try again. Repeat the process . . . until you have captured the image you were seeking. Like truth, images can be fleeting and transparent.See more and be more through your improved vision!"},{"Title":"Looking at Photographs: 100 Pictures from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art","review":"John Szarkowski has selected 100 worthwhile images and has crafted exceptionally well written commentary about each image.

He was the \\"Stieglitz\\" of the 1960s and 70s, changing the way audiences look at photographic images and he shaped the way future audiences will come to appreciate the pioneering work of Arbus, Eggleston, Friedlander and Winogrand. When he took over the reins of curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from Edward Steichen, photography's early twentieth century grand master, Szarkowski promoted a \\"new\\" photography that incorporated the everyday moment as it was unfolding on the streets around cities and towns across America.His great gift to all of us who love photography besides his championing of new talent, was his incredible skill at writing texts, essays, criticism, books on photography. With his talent as a writer, and his background as a photographer, he was able to open a window onto this two-dimensional world of form and tone, shape, texture and composition, explaining the ins and outs, the subtleties, and the intuitions of image makers, their techniques and their medium in all its finesse.Having simply tried to take a good photograph all his life, he simply knew a good photograph when he saw one. It is what made him such a great curator. His own best known books of photographs, \\"The Idea of Louis Sullivan\\" published in 1956, contains photographs of the architecture of Chicago, and his other, \\"The Face of Minnesota\\" published in 1958, contains haunting landscape images of his home state. He wrote the way he carefully crafted his own images. He framed each paragraph paying close attention to his ear, to diction and all the elements of style. It is why I love to read him and why I think he was the greatest writer to take on this visual art form.Two books of his about photography that in my opinion are indispensable are \\"The Photographer's Eye\\" first published in 1966, and \\"Looking at Photographs\\" first published in 1973. With these two collections, the reader will gain an historic appreciation of photography from its earliest innovators beginning in the 1830s to the period of high modernism in the 1970s. With Szarkowski as your guide, readers will appreciate how the medium advanced, yet they will also understand how it has remained fundamentally the same picture-making process when it comes to handling two-dimensional space.In The Photographer's Eye, Szarkowski covers what a viewer needs to take in from a photograph, how it was framed, cropped, what the subject is, what the detail is, the focus and the vantage point. In each of these wide areas, he supplies important photographs from the Museum of Modern Art's vast collection that illustrate these points. He begins with \\"The Thing Itself\\" the \\"what\\" of photography, the landscape or still life, or portrait that the photographer has aimed his camera at. From there he moves on to how photographers fix on detail, the synechdocal \\"parts\\" that make up the \\"whole\\" and that produce visual metaphor: the close up of the hands, the side of a face, a rifle, a window, a headlight of a car, a door latch.He then illustrates how photographers carefully frame their images, how they crop, how they envision the image from its interior picture plane to what is left out, alluded to, outside the frame. And finally, he shows how photographers measure time; freeze moments, single out the present for the past of some distant future. Added to this element of time is vantage, that trick of where to place the picture plane in terms of its perspective, foreground to background, its recession to a vanishing point or points, whether it is head-on and flat, or deep and endless, looming up or slanting down, the world from above, or the world from below.In Looking at Photographs which is subtitled--\\"100 Pictures from the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art,\\" Szarkowski leads the reader across time, from the earliest best works of the 19th century masters: Timothy O'Sullivan, Fredrick Evans, Lewis Hine, and Jacob Riis, all the way to Robert Frank, Roy DeCarava, Paul Caponigro, and Joel Meyerowitz.The book is printed so that there is a one-page essay facing each of the 100 photographs it describes. Within that compact structure, Szarkowski is able to move from one idea to another across the history of photography as the reader turns the pages, and he is able to pinpoint for the reader, the attributes that each photographer brings to his medium. In this way the reader learns to read images for their wealth of craft, form and subject matter. It is like having the curator take you on a personal guided tour of the museum's photography galleries.I learned from reading this book that Timothy O'Sullivan's \\"white skies\\" were a result of the wet plate's over-sensitivity to blue light and that \\"sky areas were thus automatically overexposed, and rendered as blank white.\\" I also learned that O'Sullivan \\"...accepted the white sky and used it as a shape, enclosed in tension between the picture's visual horizon and the edges of the plate.\\" Knowing this, I can never look at O'Sullivan's work again without understanding how much this 19th century photographic pioneer wanted the figure-ground relationship of sky to land to feature in his compositions. And this is only one example from the book. There are 99 more.Owning this book is like having your own private collection of the world's most famous photographs. The way you look at photographs will be enriched. On your next visit to a gallery or a museum, you will be able to see so much more thanks to the intelligent and thoughtful writing of John Szarkowski. His precise, clear and uncluttered prose style will make your reading experience a pleasure in itself."},{"Title":"Looking at Photographs: 100 Pictures from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art","review":"A Collection, New Yorker styleIt is difficult to make a collection of photographs by different people and not make it haphazard, unless there is an underlying theme. The book consists of 100 pictures by 100 photographers in bw, taken in the 100 years or so up to 1960's, accompanied by a page of text each. The writing is insightful and while is not meant to be a systematic introduction to the history of photography, nonetheless is quite educational if you are interested in the subject. While the photographs range from the concrete to the abstract, the book is coherent helped largely by text. I enjoyed reading the text and looking at the photographs.The book's strength and its weakness is that it strives to be stylish and original; the writing is 'sophisticated' and snobbish, a la New Yorker. Some of the 'deep' comments I did not much care for. Perhaps more importantly, a majority of the photos chosen for the photographer are not the ones that are usually considered the photographers' most representative works.You should not read the book to study the history of photography nor to find the standard representative works of the famous photographers. I think people who are familiar with the rough history of photography and the more famous photographers will enjoy looking through the book - perhaps checked out from a library."},{"Title":"Looking at Photographs: 100 Pictures from the Collection of The Museum of Modern Art","review":"It is tough to write about photography, but each of these short one-page essays is a gem.

Run, don't walk, as fast as you can, buy this book! You'll laugh and cry and pump your fist into the air, as they triumph over all adversity and find that pot of gold, at the end of the rainbow!"},{"Title":"Three Times a Lady (Arabesque)","review":"An intelligent busy no-nonsense career woman and a klutzy work-at-home dad does not seem to make a compatible couple. But the old adage opposites attract seem to apply in this case.Jordan is a successful writer of mysteries who is an accident always ready to happen who has adopted five children. Mia moves next door to Jordan and his brood back in her old urban New Jersey neighborhood much to her social climbing mother's chagrin.She immediately becomes involved with the precocious children who seize on the idea that Mia would make a great mom and they set out to make it happen.Mia thinks Jordan is a clumsy nerd and he thinks she is a high maintenance career woman but their opinions change of each other and the attraction is dynamite. But they are not moving fast enough for the kids so with the help of their grandfather they devise a plan that has Mia and Jordan locked up in the downstairs playroom overnight. Sparks fly but their courtship is not without hitches. Mia's busy work schedule, her mother's matchmaking meddling, a journalist who has the hots for Jordan and the issues of trust are just a few of the roadblocks to making this a smooth ride.This was a lively romance with plenty of sensuous love scene, well-developed characterizations including the children, and realistic scenes. I loved the feel of the commitment both Mia and Jordan had for their city and the realness of their characters. This is a top romance for 2001."},{"Title":"Three Times a Lady (Arabesque)","review":"Nobia's second effort definitely kicks the heat up a notch. Jordan Banks successful writer and father as well as perpetual klutz has let career and love of his children dominate his life. Mia Gordon successful financial anaylist let her love of work become her play leaving no room in her climb to the top for the love of a good man.Jordan's children are determined to have a mother for themselves as well as a wife for their dad, so when pretty, smart, and caring Mia moves in next door, she fits their bill. Mia is not immediately impressed with her scruffy, clumsy neighbor and Jordan sees Mia as an uptight workacoholic that could never settle for his kind of life. However, there are five forces at work to give them both a different view. Jordan and Mia soon discard initial assumptions as they become more than just neighbors. Jordan ignites a passion in Mia that work could never duplicate, she finds herself needing to balance more than career as her man and his brood become more important in her neatly organized life. Jordan's desire for Mia goes beyond his thoughts on his next mystery novel, she satisfies more than just his physical need but also the deep need of his heart. With outside distractions that have other intentions for the two lovers they must let trust and true love become the ties that bind their lives eternally.I really liked the secondary characters, Clinton and Minnie and most especially the kids Rajahn, Tia, Kimani, twins Amina and Aliya. I was even glad for Amanda and Terrence.

The book jacket said the story would start off gradually and sizzle to the end (or something to that effect) and they were ever so right.Mia, Jordan and family provided a welcome look into how well step-families can becomes regular old families. Plus the fact that Jordan was such a skilled lover probably didn't hurt any! Niobia Bryant is very good at writing love scenes that are believable and sensual at the same time. It may seem like an easy thing to do, but after reading many many romance novels, I realize it must not be. It's hard to read a love scene where you're thinking &quot;they'd break their necks if they did that!&quot; HaHaHa....none of that in this novel.If you're looking for a quick, engaging read with a few twists and turns thrown in for good measure, pick this up!

As she was moving in she noticed that her neighbors kids just made them self at home inside hers. She was wondering who would have 5 kids in this day and age. Most of her friends were too busy to have one kid let alone have 5. She found that their father the best selling author Jordan Banks was a clumsy man that kind of reminded you of Steve Urkel.Jordan Banks was so clumsy, I started thinking I hope he doesn't kill himself before he gets the girl (smile). Well Jordan fooled Mia and me too! He really knew how to get a girls attention. Mia couldn't help but be attracted to him. Jordan had compassion and when Mia found out that he adopted all 5 children she was even more attracted to him.These kids decided that they wanted Mia to become their mother, so they devised a plan to make that happen. Even when a couple of other people threatened to make their dream a reality, they went into action. They had to get these people out of the picture, so that they could become a real family.I think Ms. Bryant did a wonderful job at bringing a light-hearted comedy to us. I loved the secondary characters and their budding relationships. The children had wonderful personalities. I even enjoyed the smart mouthed Tia, the oldest girl. Even though this is only her second book, she writes well and has brought wonderful stories to us.

I also wondered will the man off himself before they even fall in love. Mia thought he was kind of Steve Urkle like when they first met. Then she started to get to know him better. Well, Jordan Banks provedto me that he may be clumsy, but he was the ultimate lover for Mia. He would even ask her can anyone else make you feel like this. All I could think was LORD HAVE MERCY!!!!Mr. Banks 5 children played a lead role in getting him and Mia together. These children knew they wanted Mia as their mother. They were determined to do just that! From, Raj the oldest to the twins each child had a strong bond with their father. Even when another man and woman threatened their plan, they found a way to get them out of the picture. Tia the oldest girl with her smart mouth just brought the children's character full circle.This book had me laughing and smiling throughout.

The tale tells of the life of Isabella of Castille, and although the book is fiction, it draws much inspiration from reality about this unlikely and legendary queen of Spain. A story of a woman's faith and desire to unite her kingdom, \\"Queen's Cross\\" is solid and intriguing reading, a must for any fan of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Queen's Cross","review":"Of all the books I have read in my life, there isn't a single book that I have come across that would earn a rating worthy of 5 stars, until I read \\"Queen's Cross\\". It is rare to read of war in such an elegant, poetic prose. It's meaty but not raw. It has war and it has (era and stature appropriate) romance and love, politics, grandeur and simplicity. It is a perfect medley of real history and creative fiction. You'll find yourself, be you man or lady, falling for Isabella, the Queen of Castile, nay, Queen of Spain.The title is apropos in the sense that the Queen wears a cross allegedly fashioned from one of THE three nails (yes, those three nails) but also for the cross that is her burden to bear of uniting Spain.Read this, and you'll not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Queen's Cross","review":"I really enjoyed the book - it was an easy read and I didn't want to put it down.

I found myself getting very teary eyed when he talked about his children,and could only imagine the pain he must have gone through.I enjoyed the book alot,as it let me know David alot more than I knew him before."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"If this book was anything, I'd say that it was brutally honest. David Smith, author and wife of child killer Susan Smith, seemed to go out of his way to air his dirty laundry. I understand what the intent was: if he's not going to lie about his own mistakes and iniquities then he certainly wouldn't lie about his feelings for his boys and his lack of involvement in their disappearance. The honesty was good because it didn't make him out to be a saintly husband and father who'd married a demon. In fact, I finished the book having the very opposite opinion of him. He definitely was screwing up, even from the inception of their marriage.Part of his honesty was mentioning his sex life, even the loss of his virginity. That, as well as some other details, I didn't think were necessary and/or relevant. There are some things you have every right to keep private and it had no bearing upon the true subject: Michael and Alex and their murder. David said at the beginning that he wrote this book so that people wouldn't forget the real victims: Michael and Alex, but he often slipped into spending significant time discussing Susan, himself, and both of their philandering. If anything, I thought he could shed some light on why she would have killed her kids or what led up to that fateful day? He did present certain ugly truths and details, but in the end you were left to surmise just as he was.This book will take you into the private lives of the Smiths and it will uncover some serious dirt, but you will only have one more piece of the puzzle. This book will also shed some light on the not so ethical and clean lifestyles of Union, South Carolina. To be perfectly honest, being that I live thousands of miles from the South, this book only confirmed a lot of stereotypes about the South and those who could be deemed &#34;Southern Hicks&#34;. From the Winn Dixie being the epicenter of town, to the Boss Hogg like sheriff, to the hypocritical preachers, to the shotgun wedding, to the tin roof house; I found myself being grateful I didn't live in Union, South Carolina.Still, the book was decent and worth reading. In the end, you got a glimpse of what it's like to be a tortured father. This story was a big deal at the time and it's one I never forgot. &#34;Beyond All Reason&#34; will help to make a little sense of the senseless."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"When I read this book; I couldn't help but get teary eyed.

After a few chapters, I couldn't stand it any longer so I took my pen and made corrections to add flow to the story.

She then reported that she had been carjacked, and her children stolen. For nine days there was a media frenzy as the nation looked for those boys. I remember that.And then, finally, she confessed, and the car, and the boys, were found at the bottom of a lake. I thought his story would be compelling. It certainly is.If this story isn't an argument for abortion, I don't know what is. Of course, Susan Smith didn't choose abortion. She was a \\"Christian\\" and \\"didn't believe in abortion.\\" She sure as hell didn't want to be a mother.She also had a narcissistic personality, as well as a narcissistic mother. Self-centered to the absolute maximum. No one existed outside of their own little world, no one else mattered.Susan Smith also had a stepfather who molested her. She may also have been an alcoholic, with very deep roots. This is a woman who desperately needed attention, and she was getting it the only way she knew how. Too bad no one else noticed...until it was too late.Amy Fisher: Anatomy of a Scandal : The Myth, the Media and the Truth Behind the Long Island Lolita Story"},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"If you are interested in becoming a writer &quot;Beyond All Reason&quot;- &quot;My Life With Susan Smith&quot; is a a good example of how skilled writers - in this case the husband-and-wife writing team called &quot;Carol Calef&quot; does a masterful job of editing an amazing collection of often trivial items to make it an intensely readable book for many people. The deft selection of small details brought into the story at exactly the right time do much to determine the reader's end feelings about this much publicized. For writers this is an exercise in the proper use of words to achieve a desired over-all impression."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This was such a sad bad. Like David Smith said, \\"Remember who are the true victims in all this, Miicheal and Alex, NOT Susan Smith! It was a good and fast reading and I a book is so much better when it's write by a person who the story concern them and not from a famous writer, is even better when the writer is not a writer, so from people who said this book is good but the editing is bad, I don't see what is bad, I thought the book was very good and it comming from the heart and soul to who that real story had happen, you can feel his pain! Everybody was saying how Susan was too good for David, my God it was the other way around, David was too good for Susan. Susan was picture as like a hot, sexy girl, sorry to me she look like a ordinary house wife and kinda chubby, she come from the South right? Yeah she do look like redneck, the way she dress and wear her hair are out of fashion even in 90th, well I am out of context here but can't help saying that to me see doesn't look hot stuff and one of the book with her glasses and her hair pine up she look like a geek! Like David Smith said, the two persons who love her the most, (their kids), she had killed them, how can a mother do this to her own children and said she love them? Why David Smith want so much the death penalty for Susan, if she got a soul she suffer much more in prison, well if she got one. She seem only to think for herself and feel pity for herself. Killing her children because she was in love with a guy that didn't want a family allready made, so she killed her kids and to have the pity of the man she love she make a a big lie that a man took over her car and push her out put kept the kids. Did she really think she could live with the rest of her life with that story and have back the man she love? She was stupid, he was also having other affair and like I said Susan is no hot thing, why he would go with her? Still a part of me pity her, if she really was having depression it can make you do stupid things, yeah maybe she was really insane!"},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This book made me rather emotional. You learn about two teenagers who meet and fall in love. The young couple is David and Susan, and they both have a far from easy life behind them so far. Susan's parents had a violent relationship, and sometimes Susan's dad would threaten to kill Susan's mum. Three weeks after their divorce Susan's dad commits suicide, and a couple of weeks later Susan's mum remarries. Susan's new step-father sexually abuses her, and when her mum finds out, she decides to stay with her new man. Several members of Susan's family have committed or attempted to commit suicide, and some (like her father) have been too fond of alcohol.Even though David's family background may not be as bad as Susan's, his life hasn't been too easy either. His father tried to commit suicide, while his mother was very religious. In the end David decides to follow his brother and move in with his grandmother. Another blow happens in his life while he is dating Susan: His brother Daniel dies. Because Susan is pregnant, Susan's mother presses on and the young couple marries two weeks later.After reading the book and some additional information, I am sitting with the impression that these two should never have started a family. They were far too immature and their troubled background made things even worse. They fight a lot and both have extra-marital affairs. David seems to have big problems in sticking to one woman at the time. Susan's second pregnancy is a tough one, and David seems too immature to face it. He finds new love with Tiffany, and instead of staying with his pregnant wife and baby Michael, he spends his time with her. For a short while David splits up with Tiffany, and she becomes crazy and starts to keep David and his family awake at night. My opinion is that David does little to protect his family during this time.Shortly after Alexander's birth Susan and David parts again, and just over a year later; in a period of six weeks Susan has four lovers: Her boyfriend, her boyfriend's father, Susan's stepfather and David.In the middle of all this there are two small innocent babies: Michael and Alexander. They are bystanders, while their parents try to figure out their lives. Their lives gets a very cruel and tragic end when their disturbed mother kills them.It wasn't difficult to get through the book, even though the narrative is of average quality. Still, the picture of these two innocent children and their father's story about their short lives, make this into a book it is very difficult to forget."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This is the Susan Smith of Union, South Carolina who pushed her car into the lake with her two little boys still strapped in their car seats. This version of the story is written by her husband and the father of the two boys. He tries to be fair and objective in the first person narrative, but he gets in his opinion on everybody involved including his in-laws and the media. He also reveals himself as a loving father, but a guy working two women at the same time. His wife Susan comes across as a kind of sexy but sick psychopath. According to David's story, she killed the boys so that the well-to-do son of a local business owner might be enticed to marry her. He had told her he didn't want a \\"ready made\\" family. Kind of like the lions killing the cubs to bring the lionesses into heat, only here the lioness does it herself. If she hadn't confessed, she probably would have gotten away with it, because nobody, including her husband, could believe she'd kill her two cute little boys. There was a lot of sexist sympathy on both sides of this case, but there's no getting around the fact that Susan Smith is a monster. The sad thing is the son of a business man guy probably would never have married her anyway. This is a quick and easy read, but somehow unsatisfying I think because the real depth of the story needs a larger point of view."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This is an incredible book. Instead of writing a book and claiming he was the perfect guy and he was the victim, David told it how it was (unlike Susan Smith's mother, who also wrote a book that basically blamed everyone but Susan and the Russell family). He admitted that he was at times a bad husband. Both he and Susan were immature in their marraige. He made mistakes. But, he and Susan were perfect parents. Which makes this case all the more puzzling.Why would Susan murder her two boys like this?! I get so angry. At 14, no one my age understands how I feel. All the way through this book, I kept having to stop and ask myself WHY. WHY didn't she give MIchael and Alex to David. WHY didn't she tell anyone that she didn't want those babies anymore. WHY did she drown them? WHY did she let their bodies rot for nine days?!I sympathize for David. It's happy to report that he has a new wife and two more kids (Savannah and Nicholas), but imagine that, everytime one of your kids do something, everytime something new in a tabloid or the mail shows up about the case, the facts come hurling back to you.David, you are one strong man!!!"},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"I did agree with the man who said this book is poorly edited, but David Smith did not set out to be a writer. He was just a regular guy until this tragedy happened to him. So I can't criticize him for those mistakes. I honestly believe him when he said he did not write this book to make the money, but instead he felt like it was a step towards the healing process. I feel so sorry for what happened to this man.The book was a very fast read and very hard to put down from the first page. I really think it was interesting to find out what was actually happening during that 9 day period. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in that story. And, I do agree with David Smith....everyone needs to remember who the REAL victims were."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This book is not only very easy to read and very difficult to put down, but will also make you appreciate what you have and not take it for granted. David Smith went through hell and back, but what I appreciated most about the book, was that he never slandered his ex-wife the way the rest of the world did. He is indeed an honorable man. Also, the fact that he included some of his most private letters and poems that were sent to him about the boys was very touching...."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"This is an excellent book.

Susan lived the lie of the kidnapping for 9-days knowing in her own mind that the children were in a lake dead!. Riveting story!"},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"Susan Smith is the cruellest person I have ever read about. She drove her car into a lake with her two infant sons strapped trustingly in the backseat, then stood on the shore and watched it sink to the murky bottom. She fabricated a story about an alleged carjacker to disguise her sole culpability in this crime. She shed crocodile tears for her estranged husband, her family, friends, the police, the media, and the world, while her murderous secret remained locked inside her noxious heart. She sentenced her boys to death and David to a life of grief. She sits today in prison. She will never on this earth suffer the consequences of what she did.I started crying two pages into this book, and the tears flowed throughout every aching page. David's pain and suffering is so tragically transmitted to readers that we can almost touch it. But only almost. It is so agonising, so raw, so heartrending, and so horrific, that if Susan Smith were in a room with me I would scream &quot;Why?&quot; repeatedly while pounding her body with my fists!As I write this, there is a lump in my throat, my jaw is clenched, and the tears are welling up. It is instinctive; I simply can't help myself. I will never forget this story, this book, David, or beautiful and innocent little Michael and Alex. Nor should anyone else. Forgetting them would be like forgetting what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Beyond All Reason: My Life With Susan Smith","review":"I titled this &quot;pure torture&quot; because the children killed by their mother were pure and were tortured to death -- she watched the car sink into the water. The whole situation also was pure torture for David Smith and his family. I'm sure he still reels from the shock that he could have married someone who would do this to her own child. The writing of this book must've been very painful for David, as is evident in the perfectly-chosen photograph of David on the back jacket of the hardback book. There simply is no excuse for what Susan Smith did.

This one caught my eye, as I am a teacher-in-training and also a lover of all things Native American.Ove took this job with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 1948 because he needed a job. Not quite a college graduate from southern Illinois, but anxious to get started, he got talked into taking this one-room school house job in south-central New Mexico.The Apache children, who seemed estranged by his lack of the Apache language and culture, took to him faster than the elders on the reservation. They respected him, but kept their distance from him. Poor Ove fumbled after one misstep after the other, with no real experience as an elementary teacher. He and his new bride were lost in the world of the Apache.But he never gave up. Even before his two-year stint was over he learned to appreciate the Apache for everything they offered, ideas that the European culture didn't (and still doesn't) offer. The racist policies of the BIA and of white people of the post-WWII era (\\"The Greatest Generation\\" that was also one of the most abusive to Native Americans and Blacks), the bureaucratic red tape of government regulations, and the manipulation of young college kids all come out in the open in this book.This is a great little book for new teachers who want to go out into the teaching world and do the right thing, a book for young hearts who also want to do their best in a strange new world.The writing style is symplistic but the inspiration, faith and even sorrow prevail in this book.The author wrote his memoirs 50 years after leaving Whitetail Reservation, yet the story reads like something that just happened yesterday. I have to wonder how much more detail he could have provided had he not waited so long to write this pleasant memoir.The second half of this book is mostly interviews with some of his former students 30 years later. Most, sadly, remained on or near the reservation and many had succumbed to alcoholism. A few had already passed on."},{"Title":"Lovely Is The Lee","review":"Robert Gibbings was an artist whose etchings are still on display in major English universities. In the 1930s and 1940s, as he traveled the British Isles in search of scenery, he began taking notes and wrote a number of lyrical, gentle travelogues. He brought to the printed page an artist's delicate sensibility and sentimentality. &quot;Lovely is the Lee&quot; is the book he wrote after visiting his ancestral homeland, the area around Cork, Ireland. It is illustrated with dozens of his fine sharp etchings. It seems that in this case, the sentimental family attachments and his natural empathy for the people resulted in an especially fine book. It was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1945; more than two decades later I found a copy in a book case belonging to my grandmother. I read the book and realized it was something special. I asked my grandmother for it, and it is still on my bed stand today. If you are high strung, worrisome or neurotic, this book is almost therapy in itself. The descriptions of the landscapes are beautiful, and the people described are open, honest and unaffected. You almost feel Gibbings got a last glimpse of a world that has passed away amidst the technological ruckus of the 20th century. Once you read about how he was fitted for a suit by Taedy the Tailor, or listen by the fireside to Patsy Whelan's ghost stories, you'll want to cash in your CDs, burn your computer and take off for the back roads of the Emerald Isle as fast as you can. It is only the realization that Ireland, too, has changed that will stop you. &quot;Lovely is the Lee&quot; is a lyrical, gentle, and haunting book about a man who visited a land almost like Brigadoon. Except that it was real and unlike Brigadoon, it is never coming back."},{"Title":"Lovely Is The Lee","review":"This is another delightful book by Irish author/illustrator Robert Gibbings, in which he takes us on a tour of the west of Ireland, visiting the outer rim, including many of the offshore islands, of counties, Galway, Mayo and Cork. It was on these islands, many of which are very sparsely or no longer inhabited, that numerous early Christian missions were established. In the days before helicopters, Gibbings often goes to great pains to reach some of these islands, which include Inishkea South and Inishkea North, Inishbofin, Inishshark, High Island, Clare Island, and the Aran islands of Inishmor and Inishmaan. Naurally, the odd and most inhospitable rock known as Skellig Michael also gets a mention.There follows a visit to Cork and a look back along the Lee (which has been dammed since Gibbings' day), which he says could then be walked with scarcely a village or building in sight, all the way to its source. As always, Gibbings recounts some of the numerous stories and folktales he picks up along the way, all of which go to make Ireland such a fascinating place and Gibbings' books so much of a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Lovely Is The Lee","review":"Ah now, well ... this one, my third, was a wee bit disappointing. Robert had lulled me into believing I was about to settle down with one of his quiet and charming river books. Instead we get a wild, roaring run around County Cork which it seems is crowded with rumbustious drunks, ghosts and the fairies, the little people.He certainly proves that he, along with everybody else he meets on his return home, was \\"inoculated with gramophone needles\\" - sure, and a bit like m'self - or had snogged with the Blarney Stone. The reader is treated to histories and tales, supported with Gibbings' usual glorious woodcuts as he wanders, tramps, and hurries around his home region. The Lee itself (in Cork) makes no appearance for thirty chapters and he barely gets his feet wet before he is again among the ghosts and changelings.It is still a charmer of a book of course, certainly proving that whilst you cannot get the \\"Oirish\\" out of this author if you prefer his river books, you do need to get the author out of Ireland and back on the Thames or the Seine."},{"Title":"In Defense of Dracula","review":"I was captivated by this new writer's book: a fictional work based on the life of the real Dracula.

If she would of had a better editor also I think it would have made the novel easier to read and more clearly understood. But as for her historical knowledge or where ever she retained her information about Dracula, everything was jumbled around and in some cases completley false.

He starts his account as a young ambitious medical student who by a stroke of luck gets to work with a research scientist, the mad type. A break through discovery is made to alleviate a devastating disease.

Although some characters in Quia Imperfection have been changed for the sake of drama, the result is a fascinating presentation based heavily on a true story about power, international dealing, and one man's personal quest to create a better future for those who suffer from a debilitating disease.

An extremely well written, true story about medical research, L-DOPA, Parkinson's disease, the ideology and thrust of renowned scientist, Dr. George Cozias, and his associates, and serendipity of some of the findings. The book is written by and through the eyes, experiences and observations of a then young Columbia University medical student, Bernard M. Patten, now Dr. Patten, MD, an esteemed neurologist. Dr. Cotzias was Dr. Patten's mentor. In addition to the depicting research and its researchers, part of the book's facinating interest lies in the US politically using Dr. Cotzias L-DOPA, Parkinson's disease work to treat China's ailing Chairman Mao. With all of this, the book portrays, with no punches pulled, the interrelationships, intimacy, multiple dimensions, and conduct of the people directly and indirectly involved in the story. Cover to cover, it is a great story with true-life surprises and a book you will have gained by reading."},{"Title":"Quia Imperfectum","review":"Quia Imperfectum is the story of George Cotzias, the first man to triumph over Parkinson's disease, as told from the perspective of the book's author, then a young medical student working in Cotzias's group during the time period of the epochal discovery. The book serves trebly as a history of a major medical advance, a character portrait of Cotzias, and as the author's memoir of a key formative period of his own life. I thought the book succeeded on all three levels, but I wish there had been more scientific detail and history of Parkinson's disease and the LDOPA treatment.George Cotzias developed LDOPA as the first widely successful therapy for Parkinson's disease, a thitherto inexorable wasting condition of the motor system, typically striking around 60 years of age. Bernard Patten conveys a portrait of Cotzias with a poet's flair, animating him with all of his voting human blemishes as a mercurial, stormy tyrant, quite possibly psychopathic, but with the brilliant wrecklessness it took to wrestle this timeless scourge of humanity into a temporary submission. Cotzias could be brutal to his underlings, having apparently driven two students to suicide. An excerpt from his interview with a black applicant encapsulates his behavior neatly:\\"Let me tell you something. You stink. Your stink disturbs me. Just because you are a Negro doesn't mean you can stink. Just because you Negroes are winning the integration game doesn't mean you can stink. Go to my office in the administration building and take a shower....Negroes! They think they are special. They want us to give them something for nothing. The great thing about this country is that you make it on the basis of what you do and not what you are. They haven't figured this out the way the Italians and Irish have. Even a stupid Greek like me can make it\\"Too unPC for prime time! But at the same time, Cotzias was a brilliant physician who finished second in his class at Harvard Medical School, spoke at least four languages, and could recite Shakespeare from memory. Such are the contradictions of great men, hence the title Quia Imperfectum=\\"imperfect things\\".The story doubles as the author Bernard Patten's own memoir about his formative period as a medical researcher, also giving an insider's glimpse of Brookhaven National Laboratories, as well as a general zeitgeist of that heroic age when giants walked the earth, some of whom Patten would brush shoulders with. Patten cuts a figure equally inpirational to Cotzias, conveying a sense of youthful idealism and ambition. Patten possessed a brilliant mind, steeped in science, literature, not to mention the human qualities that make a great doctor. As a former medical student myself, I found this an excellent rendition of the experience of medical training, similar to books like Year of the Intern, et al.On the down side, perhaps the author delved into too much personal detail at the expense of scientific background about the history of Parkinson's disease, my real motive for reading the book in the first place. There is also an annoying scatological content with excessive cursing and some unneccessary sexual details. But all in all, Quia Imperfectum is a quick, charming read that will stay with one longer than many a more technical science biography."},{"Title":"Quia Imperfectum","review":"Chairman Mao said that all political power comes out of a gun. George C. Cotzias proved that wrong. Cotzias discovered L-DOPA for parkinson's disease and used it to treat Chairman Mao. Chinese-American relations improved immediately. But more than that, this is the real quill: the real story of real scientists working on the frontier of science with all the back biting, petty jealousies, and the red thread of life. I read it through in three hours because I just couldn't put it down and unlike this author's previous books, I didn't have to look up a single word in the dictionary."},{"Title":"Quia Imperfectum","review":"George C.Cotzias (1918-1977) was a Greek American scientist who together with his coworkers including the author, then a medical student, developed L-Dopa treatments, currently-used treatment for Parkinson's disease.In the 1950 Carlsson demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain and not just a precursor for nor-epinephrine, as previously believed. He developed a method for measuring the amount of dopamine in brain tissue and found that dopamine levels in the basal ganglia, a brain area important for movement, were particularly high. He then showed that giving animals the drug reserpine caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control.These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Arvid Carlsson subsequently won the Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine in 2000 along with co-recipients Eric Kandel and Paul Greengard.Subsequently, other physicians treated human Parkinson's patients with L-Dopa(the metabolic precursor for dopamine) and found it to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's. Unlike dopamine, L-Dopa passes the blood brain barrier. This produced transient benefit after injection of L-Dopa. However , because of the severe toxicity associated with the injection, L-Dopa was not of practical value treatment.At this point George C. Cotzias made the critical observation that converted the transient response into a successful, large scale treatment. By starting with very low doses of DOPA, given orally every two hours under continued observation, and gradually increasing the dose he was able to stabilize patients on large enough doses to cause a dramatic remission of their symptoms. The first study reporting improvements in patients with Parkinson's disease resulting from treatment with L-dopa was published in 1968. The result was soon confirm with other investigators and has now become the standard treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms.Dr. Cotzias is the winner of the 1969 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. After reading the book, I was surprised that he did not received The Nobel Peace Prize for treating the most famous patient, Chairman Mao which subsequently open the the USA relationships to China.Quia Imperfectum gives you the human nature of Dr. Cotzias and more.Quia Imperfectum bridges the gap between the world of science,its laboratory and the humanities, its wider world, its voice and vision can tells us about science's aesthetic and philosophical dimension, causes reflection as in a poem or painting."},{"Title":"Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present","review":"If you are interested in history, I highly suggest this book. Marginalized for eons, gay people are now an integral part of history. Relegated to the backburner, or whispered about in history sources, gay people have come forward with a great history. Within this collection, there are heartaches and triumphs, but always searching for the ideal of equality one day. Another good thing about this book is that it includes non-Western gay and lesbian history as well, yet another subject ignored by the &quot;mainstream&quot; history. An incredibly transfixing and fascinating book, I couldn't put it down, and read into the late hours of the evening."},{"Title":"Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present","review":"Neil Miller's done a great job of pulling together aspects of (western) gay history. I've read some of the sources for his lesbian chapters and he uses them intelligently to summarise main points. I assume he's does the same with the male stuff and material from other countries which was previously unfamiliar to me. His style is readable, succinct and balanced about how we look at the past from our current viewpoints.One feature of the book which is particularly pleasing is his use of extracts from writings he's referred to in his central text. This adds a good variety to the voice of the work AND the extracts are long enough (two or more pages in length) to inspire further study.I also like A) the pictures of famous historical figures, there's something particularly moving about them, (I never knew Willa Cather was so gorgeous!)and B) the balance of genders and countries covered is better than average.My advice - read it!"},{"Title":"Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present","review":"Past gay histories have suffered from similar deficiencies. Although Miller has made a commendable effort, as a college history professor, I see these problems abundantly present in Miller's narrative. The following is a brief list: Until the last twenty years or so few gay histories were written by historians and as such they were poorly documented, biased, rarely analytical, and in the case of Miller's very poorly edited. In particular, the typos in Miller's narrative are far too numerous. This could result from a dearth of interest in the field in major publishing houses.The second is that the pre-World War II era was practiced and written about in private with a considerable interest in survivors of those who we fashion as gay in destroying documentation that might provide the primary resources to support the societal and legal pressures that prevent us from truly knowing the pain suffered within. The best gay histories certainly lie ahead but unless the absence of sound evidence to support autobiographical homosexuality can be overcome to replace speculation with fact, gay history will remain as locked as the mystery of the Lost Colony.Thirdly, there is rare coverage of the marriage of practicing one's gayness with urbanization. Therefore, we get histories which neglect the blight of gayness in and to the rural/small town gay population and we reinvigorate the notion that urban equals gay freedom without showing the sociological implications that subvert the need to adopt a night culture, bar culture, entertainment culture, and an urban culture as gays are forced to submerge their inclinations to previous formative small town behavior patterns. In short, there are two adjustments to gay freedom: to the urban environment and to the open practice of being gay within that newly learned environment. This duality layers adaption for gays which is far more complex than it would be for heterosexuals who can always return to the small town world and practice their sexuality unchallenged. Gay historians have a very difficult time grappling with the birth of one culture and the death of another that every newly urbanized gay faces.Miller also subscribes to the fallacy that the United States is still the major bastion of gay liberation. There is no comparable area in the United States that could match London, Berlin, or Amsterdam for gay freedom nor has the nation moved as a whole with the rapidity of other western countries to mainstream homosexualtiy. It is impossible to think of any major city in this country including San Francisco and New York where a same-sex couple could stroll every area of that city hand-in-hand and kiss at will without being fearful in some of those neighborhoods. Such freedom of expression exists in a number of European cities and small towns.Also, it is quite disturbing to continue to treat the butch-femme coupling in lesbians without presenting a case that many lesbians do not parrot maleness in their relationships and abhor the idea of bonding with the penisless man.Finally, the dawning of the Age of Gayquarius is rarely mentioned in gay histories. With each passing year I observe an increase in the number of students who approve of a gay marriage initiative, freedom of expression, and civil liberties for homosexuals. There undoubtedly is a New Progressive Era especially in the arena of personal liberties on the horizon. Authors give very little account of such trending. The time of police raids and gay baiting will soon be completely dead in Western countries. As transnationalism replaces globalization, the rest of the world will not lag far behind."},{"Title":"Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present","review":"I've been reading this book (and using it as a main reference point for a thesis paper) when I noticed a few date and fact discrepancies.

It also tends to repeat itself a lot, which I guess is good if you have a really short memory, but since I read this book fairly quickly it sort of bugged me. It is a good book overall, since it is sort of a gateway to other reading.

It has given me an overview of the history of homosexuality. It has given me an understanding of how homosexuality was seen and reacted to in the past and how far the gay community has come. It also breaks it down in different societies such as; England, France, Germany and how each had its onw laws to keep the homosexuals down and treated as less than human. There were times when the homosexual were persecuted, imprisoned and punished for who they were. They were treated as if they were sick. They were also entramped, in other words they were set up and in doing so they would lose their jobs and blacklisted for future blackmailing. The homosexual community has come along way but it seems that they still have a long way to go. They are still shuned and don't share the legal rights as any other citizens. It seems that the law doesn't include them in the right to liberty and freedom as any heterosexual enjoys. The day that the homosexual community are totally accepted as part of the fabric of this world, only then will they enjoy total freedom and enjoy who they are for what they are no more and no less.

Although destined for disaster, Jerusalem is also destined for deliverance.There can be no more appropriate time than now to study Jerusalem and it's place in era.Randall Price has provided an excellent work here in examining all the relevant issues, including the error of 'replacement theology' and it's effect on our attitudes towards the Middle East.I also highly recommend his other books on the subject, \\"The Coming Last Days Temple\\" and \\"Unholy War\\"."},{"Title":"Jerusalem in Prophecy","review":"One of the best books I've read on the subject - it avoids the sensationalism that characterizes many other books on prophecy, and presents a solidly Bible-based examination of future events.

We do however see some names back in this history that can also be seen in New York history, especially Stuyvesant and Peter Minuit. He plays a double role, first as an employee of the West Indian Company, later as an employee of the Swedes, who also played a part in the history of the Delaware Region.The rest of the book is like many other books about 17th century America. Hard living, frontier life, slow trade and permanent fights with the IndiansFor those of you interesting in exploration it is very interesting. Weslager notes often how the countryside were described and how maps were made. These maps are important and even an entire capital and how topography was named by the Dutch.For those of you from Delaware and people interested in Dutch settlers in 17th century America this book is one to look out for. Unfortunately it seems to be pretty rare."},{"Title":"Generative Theory of Tonal Music (The MIT Press series on cognitive theory and mental representation)","review":"This book is a turning point in XXth century music theory.It admits &quot;surface salience&quot; as an important musical attribute (chapter 5), distinguishing it from the &quot;reductional importance&quot; of events. Should we work with a double conception of structure: surface structure (focusing on surface salience) versus deep struture (focusing on reductional importance)? The investigation of surface salience leads to questions related to tension and release, an area that is still to find its best approach. What is best in the book: the ability to uncover the making of a theory; the ability to rejuvenate and integrate schenkerian ideas with a critique of Meyer's approach (rhythmic structure versus metrical structure); the linguistic/cognitive connection. What is not so good in the book: the remarks on contemporary music (with an almost fascist view of inherited abilities)"},{"Title":"Generative Theory of Tonal Music (The MIT Press series on cognitive theory and mental representation)","review":"This very technical work is very interesting and uses a very valuable and relatively new approach.

That is, come up with a theory that is dominant in its field in academia, has tremendous prestige, but ends up having almost no explanatory ability for how language or music actually works in the real world. The book is tedious with only a few interesting points.The book has been in print more than twenty years (and that amazes me), but has had almost no impact on any musician outside of a small circle of academic thinkers for whom music is more of a technical and arcane game / puzzle than an art of expression and emotion. In fact, bringing up emotion and expression will cause immediate laughter and a great many derisive comments.Save your time and money.

The moment I saw a preview of the pages for Nightwing and Harley Quinn (my favorite characters) I rushed to order this. However, I was a bit disappointed. I'm used to the \\"Ultimate Guide to ---\\" Books and was expecting this book to be just as detailed. It is very thin, and not very specific. This book is great for people and kids who know very little about the series and want to get acquainted. For true fans, its not even necessary. Only major characters are covered. I would have been more impressed if a character like Rupert Thorne's accomplice Candace would have gotten a page. I don't see why not, she appeared in multiple episodes. However, in this book, Rupert himself only get a paragraph on the \\"Other Villians\\" page. An episode guide would have also been nice.

Feuerstein's thesis is that in order to help Down Syndrome (\\"DS\\") children, the almost banal expression \\"Accept me [him] as I am [he is]\\" is definitely not the way to go. Instead, the idea is to challenge the retarded child in a manner that does not set out pre-established limits. Feurstein et al base their cognitive theories on the basic premise of the ability to modify. Chapter 2 is an excellent discussion of the two opposing schools of thought in connection with retarded children: (a) the passive-acceptant (\\"PA\\") approach versus Feuerstein's active-modification (\\"AM\\") theory. As the name implies, the PA approach is one based on a passive acceptance of the child's handicap, and a well-meaning and even loving desire not to set what at first would seem like unattainable goals. In fact, there are few (if any) expectations for the handicapped person. They arise from well-meaning people that would like to shelter the DS child from a cruel and uncaring world by making sure that he is educated only with other DS children and that only very modest expectations can be held as to cognitive development.Feuerstein's AM approach, on the other hand, is not any less \\"loving\\" than the PA approach, but it does not accept the handicap (physical or mental) as some sort of fatalistic impediment to growth and development. Instead, he proposes that the handicaps (and some much more severe than DS) can be modified and some can be overcome, and that a lack of challenging goals and hard work can easily become self-fulfilling prophesy in terms of growth for children with limitations. Handicapped children need to be fully integrated with \\"normal\\" children as the only way to obtain excellence in achieving these goals. This is similar to the \\"conductive education\\" theory which does not accept the physical condition of the individual as setting unsurpassable barriers to functional change (cf. Dr. Pet&ouml; in Budapest, and his successor, Dr. Maria Hari). Crucial to the AM approach is the active involvement not only of the educator/mediator but also of the retarded child. The goal of modifying the handicap involves hard work that should not be carried out on behalf of, or for the child, but instead with and through him. In essence, AM is not a patronizing approach. Feurstein et al demonstrate that DS children and others with low IQs should not \\"wither away in institutions.\\" These children are \\"neither hopeless nor helpless, and certainly not deserving of society's disparagement or pity.\\" Children with intelligence limitations can lead \\"rich, active, joyous, and even independent lives as contributors to society.\\" Ultimately, that attitude shows more true caring than one which gives up before trying.Despite what seem like very good ideas and concepts, Feuerstein promises in the early chapters much more than he delivers in this text. The book is full of unnecessary jargon, placed into acronyms to make it even more unreadable, focusing too much on the \\"what\\" without the \\"how\\" or the \\"why\\" of changes experimented by DS patients. One can take the jargon at the beginning (such as the \\"PA\\" and \\"AM\\" cited above). However, it gets thicker and in a completely gratuitous manner with expressions like \\"Structural Cognitive Modifiability\\" (\\"SCM\\") where \\"change\\" or \\"adaptability\\" would have fitted as well, \\"Mediated Learning Experience\\" (\\"MLE\\") instead of a simpler \\"interactive education,\\" the rather insane acronym of \\"FRIWAFTT\\" (!) where the author offers the \\"helpful\\" saying: \\"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread,\\" which might have been acceptable if it didn't stand for concepts that do not need acronyms, such as \\"feelings,\\" \\"revenues,\\" \\"ignorance,\\" \\"waste\\" and other such terms. The confusing jargon gets worse with \\"LPAD\\" which stands for \\"Learning Potential Assessment Device\\" \\"IE\\" for \\"Instructional Enrichment\\" and others. Chapter 12, the one on Instrumental Enrichment, is perhaps the chapter that most promises to get into the \\"how\\" of changes detected by the authors in dealing with DS patients. However, it does not accomplish that either. Instead, the chapter is full of examples of the tools used without getting, in any given example, into the how/why and in-depth reasoning process that takes a previously handicapped person to someone who indeed is able to excel.The other aspect of Feuerstein's book that is very unconvincing is the manner that he (or \\"they,\\" as several authors collaborated on the book) describes an apparently hopeless case, and after throwing in some of the jargon in the paragraph above, these people become model citizens and are able to function at previously unimaginable levels. I would not have minded the \\"boasting\\" if they had actually explained with detail how something like \\"IE\\" or \\"LPAD\\" worked instead of saying simply that these tools worked. In that sense, it is a text that lacks a rigorous scientific method, or even a strictly clinical method. I came away from reading this book as if it had been some tantalizing publicity for something to be fully revealed at another later stage. And perhaps that is all the book aimed to do, since the author has indeed published more recent books and articles which perhaps better address these issues.Having said the above, I would also say that the book is worth it just because of it's very clever subtitle, and because of a conceptual approach in the early chapters that encourages an active rather than a passive attitude toward DS, and in fact, any learning disability. It is all too easy to abandon hope under the patronizingly compassionate \\"let's accept him as he is.\\" However, Feuerstein makes a convincing case for taking an active role, and in a persistent and even stubborn way, for finding some way to get through (\\"mediate\\") from a cognitive perspective."},{"Title":"Don't Accept Me As I Am: Helping Retarded People to Excel","review":"This was the first book that I read by this researcher, after reading a small article in a magazine. Feurerstein clearly explains how a learning disability is self referencing. The disability usually induces an environment which offers less opportunities to learn and so the individual learns less,and as a result his environment becomes even less generous. Feurerstein offers strategies for parents and educators to counteract this tendency of the disability to imbed itself. It gives clear names for the cognitive functions which are the tools of thinking, and shows how parents and educators can train themselves to become aware of these behaviours or the lack of them. The diagnostic procedures look not for an average of abilities but for areas of strength and weakness and most importantly for potential to learn in any area. Building upon strength rather than supporting weakness is the basic idea. Feurerstein exposes the dangers of overeliance on concrete aids for students who have difficulty reasoning abstractly. Instead he suggests that they should be taught to reason abstractly, and then shows us how. Some of the language in this book is offputting for the non-academic person and some of the things described may be confronting."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"Manuel's review of this book is excellent - I couldn't have written it any better! However, here's my two-cents worth:This book is a must read for anyone who lacks basic knowledge of the ancient Mexican cultures. It provides the reader with brief (and in some cases, more than brief) summaries of several of the various cultural groups that existed, covering geographic, cultural, agricultural, religious, architectural and political backgrounds. It has timelines and drawn maps to aid the reader's temporal and geographical orientation. It contains many illustrations and photographs of artifacts found, temples, statues...etc. excavated. It even includes a brief section and tips on visiting Mexico.The only gripe I have with this book is that it provides you with a lot of information on some cultures, such as the Aztecs and Toltecs and leaves you with insufficient info on other cultures mentioned, such as the Totonacs. However, this is probably because what archeologists have unearthed of Mesoamerica is only a tiny fraction of what actually existed, i.e. the less than brief information on some of the cultural groups mentioned in this book is probably due to archeologists not having unearthed enough remnants of the existence of these cultures/not being able to fully interpret or place what they have found to date. I'm sure Coe would have provided more info if there was more in-depth info, though in the case of the Maya, there is simply too much information to be made known and hence, rather than trying to simplify everything into one chapter, a whole, separate book has been dedicated to that group.To make up for this lack of info on some groups, Coe provides us with pictures of artifacts found, as in the section on the Olmecs, and illustrations and descriptions of their distinctive artistic/architectural style and states the likelihood of the origination of these styles and what they probably signified. I must admit that I found the more than just brief descriptions/concentrations on the artistic styles/pottery work/architectural preferences...etc. of some of the lesser-known groups a little annoying, for I am not an art/archeology student and was looking for info more on the way of life, beliefs...etc. than on their pottery and carving skills and architectural styles. Nonetheless, I am grateful that these were brought to the reader's attention rather than nothing at all mentioned.I enjoyed this book as a kick-start to my growing interest in ancient Mexican and Andean cultures and think that it makes a good quick-reference book. At least now I have an idea/starting point of some of the ancient Mexican groups. One should read this book keeping in mind that a lot about ancient Mexico has yet to be discovered and will never be discovered (afterall, a majority of the remnants of these cultures were destroyed by conquering forces) and thus, should be thankful for whatever is divulged in this book."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"I have been reading books on pre-Columbian America for over 20 years, and Michael Coe's titles have always been amongst my favorites.

Good reading, good archeology."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This is a simple and easy to use reference to the archeological history of Mexico.

I was hoping to read about the ancient peoples of Mexico and what their daliy lives must have been like as well as their history, ways of life, beliefs, etc.. however this book was mainly focuses on archeological excavation sights and the articfacts and goes into great detail of the finds. This is all good and actually very informative for those interested in archeology alone. The book occasionally does touch on the Peoples themselves. Also, it is written in a very dry and sometimes dull and a high-brow manner which was also a turn-off to me. I recommend it though for the purpose of the many illustations and photos (the most interesting parts) and a must read for those interested in archeology."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This book makes it clear that the bulk of Mexican history (and Central America) has NOTHING at all to do with Europeans or anything \\"Latin American.\\"In fact, only 5 centuries of Mexico's archeological history has any European trace, vs. 28,000 years of indigenous Mexican occupation.Michael Coe tells the story of Mexico through it's common denominator: the indigenous people, the \\"Indians. \\"Dr. Coe shows that Mexico is more than just the Aztecs with whom we are most familiar. He presents a breath-taking parade of pyramid-civilizations going back 4,000 YEARS:Olmec, Tlatilco, Cuicuilco, Izapan, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Mixtec, Tarasco, Toltec, Huaxtec, El Tajin, Pipil, Western Mexico, Zacatecas, Chalchihuites, Cacaxtla, Xochicalco, Chichen Itza, Nicarao and the multi-layered \\"Maya\\".He even includes the Casas Grandes civilization near the Texas border.Prof. Coe presents recent archeology showing that Mexico had developed the elements of a true civilization between 2300 B.C. - 1800 B.C. This Olmec Civilization predates the Jewish presence in Israel and occurred before there was a single town or city in all of Western Europe.(By the time Solomon built the First Temple in Isreal in 960 B.C., the Olmec capital at San Lorenzo was already over 400 years old.)Coe's book is unique in that it presents Mexico's history through an objective long view, and not merely through the ethnocentric cultural lens of Europeans. He presents a refreshing analysis of Mexico that does not use the Spanish Invasion as the starting point (he hardly mentions the Spanish all until the very end). European divisions are not the way to understand Mexico's history, just as British imperial definitions do not do justice to the understanding of the Irish people.Coe delves deeply into the incredible creation of corn domestication 9,000 years ago in Mexico. The corn plant requires human intervention, and the ingenuity of ancient Mexican farmers gave rise to one of the world's most unique and vigorous civilizations, just as wheat did for Iraq, and rice did for China.Coe demonstrates, that unlike Europe, Mexico did not \\"borrow\\" new technologies and ideas from established foreign cultures (i.e. writing, agriculture, mathematics, religion, gunpowder, architecture, political structures, etc). This isolation makes Mexico's achievements all the more impressive, Dr. Coe asserts, making it one of the 3 or 4 \\"pristine civilizations\\" in the world (i.e. Iraq & China)Modern Mexico is really an artificial political concept, historically speaking. The modern boundaries have only existed for 150 years and as late as 1823, Central America was part of Mexican territory. And until 1848, Mexico included everything from Texas to California.This book shows that this history is not confined to the Rio Grande nor to Mexico's border with Guatemala. He includes \\"The Turquoise Road\\" trade relations with the U.S. Southwest and discusses the \\"transmission of Mesoamerican traits\\" into that area, using the Hopi as an example.Coe does a great job of presenting several satellite states of these great civilizations as well, such as the incredible influence of Mexico's mightiest civilization: Teotihuacan, whose pyramid city (larger than the city of Rome at its height) is today Mexico's #1 tourist attraction.Considering that Mexico lacked metallurgy until after 800 AD, it is astonishing to behold the thousands of temple-pyramids, hundreds of ceremonial centers, and hundreds of towns and cities that indigenous Mexicans created across the land-- WITHOUT METAL TOOLS or draft animals. Europeans had animals like oxen and horses to do work for them, but Mexicans had only human muscle and no oxen, hence the lack of use for the wheel.Our indigenous people call the land An&aacute;huac, meaning \\"the land between the waters\\" in the still-living Nahuatl language. Just as there is something historically known as \\"Christendom\\" or \\"Western Civilization\\"(oddly enough, both are based upon non-Western achievements in Sumeria and Egypt).As the reader of both of the recent editions of \\"Mexico\\" and \\"The Maya\\" will also learn, there was a unitary and common cultural matrix which connected and sustained all the cultures of Mexico and Central America down to Costa Rica. The divisions were far more political than cultural, just as in \\"Christendom\\" or the the modern European world.I wish that Dr Coe would have addressed the similarities of the \\"Moundbuilder\\" civilization across the Eastern United States which built flat-topped pyramid structures with a temple at the top, astronomically aligned. These \\"Pyramids of the Mississippi\\" are so similar to Mexican pyramids that it warrants an investigation into cross-cultural contact.(In fact, the Natchez people of Mississippi to this day maintain the story of ancient Mexicans passing through their lands, and is recorded by a French explorer a few centuries ago.)Another small gripe I have with this the book is Coe's insistence on the \\"gods\\" school of thought, when we know from Spanish and Nahuatl records that there existed the Toltec concept of One Single God, Ometeotl, of which all the other \\"gods\\" are really manifestations/emanations. I thought a little more time could have been spent connecting those theological dots.Coe acknowledges the existence of their Supreme Duality named OMETEOTL. But he continues to use the Spanish interpretation of \\"deities\\" instead of the notion of Manifestions of OMETEOTL, according to the High Priest tradition of the Aztec/Texcoco state alliance.(and for the Maya this One God who is the Many is called HUNAB-KU.)Christians are able to accept the concept of a Three-In-One God (Father, Jesus, and Holy Spirit), along with deified Saints, a multitude of demons, Mary the Mother, and Satan the Lord of Hell...and yet Christians still consider themselves to be Monotheists who don't believe in different gods.But hey, the \\"gods angle\\" sells a lot more books to a Western audience who seems to delight in the notion of \\"Aztec polytheism\\" while ignoring blatant Christian polytheism (The Trinity, the Saints, demons, angels, The Devil).A lot of this rich and impressive history has only recently been gleaned from what are it's \\"leftovers\\".95% of the astronomical almanacs and encyclopedias were burned by the Spaniards, by their own admission and only 40 years ago did serious archeological finds occur.What other wonders went up in those flames?! What else lies beneath the surface?This is a fascinating history that reads like a real-life detective story. Buy the book!I love how Dr. Coe ends the book showing that modern indigenous culture still lives on in Mexico today. He didn't assign them a \\"dead\\" status like other books.Well done, Dr. Coe."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"I got this on the right time.It was in perfect shape with perfect covered up envelop when it was delivered.There are nothing more that i can say because I am pretty sure that everyone would love it if they order it.Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This book was in very good condition when I received it and is exactly what I needed for my Mesoamerican Civilization class."},{"Title":"Mexico (Ancient peoples and places)","review":"This is a wonderful book with wonderful pictures and diagrams.

If you have anything to do with senior residences, senior centers, senior drama groups, this unique collection is for you."},{"Title":"Return Engagement Plays for Seniors","review":"Jules Abrams has done it all. In &quot;Return Engagement,&quot; he has captured the essence of the aging process and the durability of the human spirit in facing up to the physical and mental challenges imposed Mother Nature. Morever, Mr. Abrams has done it in a way that bespeaks an appreciation for the way that seniors relate to each other--especially when the seniors are widows--an ever-growing group of women who share a life style that is little understood or appreciated by the larger community. Of all the forms of writing, I have always considered play writing to be the most difficult. Were I to try play writing, I am sure that would be true. So, I have read Mr. Abrams plays with great admiration for the sense of ease with which he creates his dialogue, builds his story line and brings each tale to a satisfying conclusion. As a professional writer, I know that good writing is never as easy as it seems. It is, after all, an art that conceals the art. In writing for senior theater, Mr. Abrams has chosen a difficult task.

I felt for Carmen as she began to realize the man she loved, married, and had children with could no longer be her husband. How hard that must have been for her.

This biography chronicle's Carmen's life -- from her rich tale of meeting and falling in love with Yeslam. The flavour of the 70s and her eventual move to Saudi Arabia. This is where things get interesting. As an American, it is very interesting to get this glimpse from this very strong woman's perspective on a hostile society. The stories of the Binladin family itself and her life (as a Swiss westerner herself) are riveting and very enlightening and educational. Of particular interest is the underpinnings of the corruption of the Binladin family, including Osama, and the turning of Yeslam once they arrive into Saudi Arabia. Are the Binladins all in the same hostile group as that as Osama, who she briefly encounters?A heroic tale and a wonderful read. Highly recommended!!- Chris ( now the owner of www.saudi-binladin-group.com - the site expired 9-11-01 and once owned by the Binladins mentioned in Carmen's book )"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen tells the story of how she met Yeslam Bin Laden in the 1970's in Switzerland and fell in love. At the time and for several years afterward she believed that he had a progressive outlook on life. After several years of living in Saudi Arabia, his personality began to change and at one point he seemed to be having a nervous breakdown. They went to Switzerland for a summer visit and it was there that Carmen caught Yeslam cheating on her & decided to end their relationship. It was not only for her sake, but for the sake of her daughters who would in Saudi Arabia be at the mercy of some other Bin Laden male relation should anything happen to her husband. This is a society where women are under the \\"guardianship\\" of male relatives for their entire lives, as if they were children. Carmen does give some good insight about why Saudi women spoil their sons so much: because they will someday be at the mercy of those sons when their husbands die or divorce them. After leaving her husband, Carmen gets notices from Saudi Arabia insisting that she come back to answer some sort of charges. She is not certain, but she thinks that her husband might be trying to have her put to death in Saudi Arabia for adultery (although she is not guilty of this \\"crime\\", one can imagine Yeslam telling his relations that he left his wife because she committed adultery, thereby saving face for himself in a society where men are always in charge and can easily dispose of wives).Osama is briefly mentioned a few times and Carmen remarks that she doesn't think that he lived a playboy lifestyle at any time despite what the newspapers said after 9-11. She believes they had him mixed up with one of his 20+ brothers, because as long as she'd known him he had been a religious fanatic."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is a valuable book for it's inside look at the Bin Laden family. It shows us how they worked and how they thought, kind of an emic anthropological approach. It should be read because there's simply nothing else out there that reveals this kind of information with this detail.But the book was far too vindictive, especially towards a very quick ending. It reads like a divorced woman writing with her anger still intact, attempting to build a case for why the divorce happened and why she was not at fault. In retrospect, the entire book, even the happy years, are coloured with the perspective of divorce. Certainly, from the perspective presented, Carmen has a case for anger. But it is one side- and, I'd rather read a book on what it's like to live in the Bin Laden family, than a book on why Carmen's marriage failed.Carmen expresses little love for the Saudi culture and little support for the people. It is almost an entirely negative portrayal. It seems like the story of a woman in extreme culture shock and culture stress who has never really recognized that she was in culture stress, or dealt with it. I live in a Muslim, Arab country. It's certainly not as restrictive as Saudi Arabia. But there is a lot I find to value in the culture here, though I am neither Muslim nor Arabic- and a lot I find valuable specifically in Islam and even strict Ikhwani Islam. Perhaps there is negatives in Saudi culture, as there is in every culture. If those are going to be pointed out, 1) it should be clear that this is an outsider perspective (which Carmen does), and 2) the positives should also be displayed. You can search through this book for a long time, and find nothing positive shared about Saudi culture. And after all, this is a culture God is involved with as well.In these times, it is valuable to understand what it's like for Westerners to live in Saudi Arabia, and how the Bin Laden family works. This makes the book important to read. But read it with a large shaker of salt next to you. You'll need to be pouring some on nearly every page."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"(...)Can you tell I just got back from a week of traveling? Two eight hour flights, two nine and a half hour flights, two hour and a half flights. Alot of reading.On the way back from Bombay to Amsterdam I finished (...) Sleeping With The Devil&lt;/a>, and just had to read more about how the Saudi's worked and what was at stake. Carmen Bin Laden's book is first and foremost a book by a mother about her personal struggles as a foreigner in a conservative religious state and her efforts to escape with her children. As you read it, you can hear her lawyers telling her to be nice to the husband because the divorce is not final. I am giving the book next to Alex to read. A couple of things really jumped out at me:- Saudi Arabia is still run by the aging sons of the original king who united the vast wasteland of desert under fundamentalist teachings of a seventeenth century cleric who founded the Wahhabi movement.- Wahhabi is the most fundamental interpretation of Islam and is applied in part because Saudi Arabia is \\"keeper\\" of the two holiest sites in the faith, Mecca and Medina.- All wealthy Saudi's live two totally opposite lives. One inside strict Saudi Arabia, and another over seas where all the pent-up desires overflow with a vengeance.- The Saudi royal family was terrified to see what happened to the Shah of Iran and immediately started placating the Wahhabi with money and power to prevent a repeat.- bin Laden family members were most likely complicit in the fundamentalist take-over of Mecca since company trucks were used to get the fighters in there and the bin Laden organization had the only detailed maps of the place.- The family clan unit (all the sons and daughters of one powerful father) is an ironclad bond when faced with threats from outsiders. By virtue of this, despite public statements, the bin Laden family has NOT disowned Osama.- Osama bin Laden is an overwhelming hero in Saudi Arabia. If an election were held today, he would probably win.- Saudi family life (at the high end) is totally disfunctional in a western sense. The sexes have separate houses. Men can be married to up to four wives at once and any number over a life time. To divorce a woman a man must simply recite \\"I divorce thee\\" three times and it is done. A woman has virtually no rights at all. Children are raised almost exclusively by servants. The appearance of devotion to religion is more important than anything else.- While Carmen and her husband kept the equivalent of $50,000 around the house for \\"emergencies\\", her husband's office was a bare wooden desk with bare walls except for a picture of his father and the king.Overall, 3 of 5. Good for background on the Mid East, but short on facts and long on emotion and personal trials/tribulations. It is a bit of a tweener. Not a great emotional story, not a heavy kiss and tell factual saga. But interesting reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I got this book primarily to see how Carmen bin Ladin would view the society of Saudi Arabia, since she was of a more \\"westernized\\" background. And of course, I wanted to see how she felt about being part of the bin Ladin clan, particularly after 9/11/01.While the book wasn't poorly written, it was in places tough going for me because it seemed like she focused so much on her wealth and spending habits, her house, etc. I think this flaw was picked up by national reviewers of the book.I'm not that ignorant of Islamic culture, but would have liked to learn more about it. The book was an \\"ok read\\" but maybe my expectations were a bit higher than what the book delivered."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is a memoir of Carmen Bin Ladin's life as a child growing up in Switzerland; of later meeting her husband Yeslam Bin Ladin whilst a student in Geneva; of then living in Jeddah amongst the Bin Ladins; and finally to her painful divorce.Carmen was born of a Swiss father and an Iranian mother. It was not accepted in Iran for a Muslim girl to marry a Christian foreigner, so her mother had to leave Iran to escape her family's harsh criticisms. But the marriage did not last long, and her mother could not return back to Iran in fear of being looked upon as a divorced woman, a curse in Iranian society.After the divorce, Carmen and her mother remained in Switzerland. It was in Geneva that Carmen first met her husband to be, Yeslam Bin Ladin. She described him as being quiet, well dressed, and smart (later in life he used to compete with other princes on whom dressed better). Carmen soon started dating Yeslam, and humorously, she ends up getting married in a car in a parking lot in Saudi Arabia. Apparently, she was not allowed to enter the ministry building to sign the marriage papers, so the papers were brought to her whilst she sat waiting in the car. Women in Saudi Arabia are not allowed to mix with men, and therefore cannot enter buildings were men work. Getting married in a car was the first of the many culture shocks Carmen was to experience.Carmen relates her life as the wife of a Bin Ladin. Mohammad Bin Ladin, the father of the Bin Ladin clan, had over 50 children and countless wives whom he kept at his compound at Kilo 7 in Jeddah. I think Kilo 7 refers to the Mecca Road, 7 being seven kilometers away from Jeddah, but someone will have to check me on that.It is quite interesting that Mohammad Bin Laden would choose to keep all his wives together in one compound. In Islam, a man can have 4 wives at the same time. Mohammad Bin Laden therefore had to divorce a wife each time he wanted to remarry in order not to exceed the allowed quota of 4 wives. As long as one of his divorced wives did not remarry, she was allowed to stay in the compound together with her kids. It was even rumored that there was a competition going on between King Abdul-Aziz of Saudi Arabia and Mohammad Bin Ladin on who will have more children. King Abdul-Aziz won, with over 60 children and many more wives.Living at the Bin Ladin compound was hard for Carmen. She couldn't go shopping for she was prohibited from mixing with men. Whenever she needed something, such as a bathing suit, she had to send her driver. Eventually Safeway opened in Jeddah, and Carmen was able to go grocery shopping. She relates one instance where a group of British and American expats were all gathering at the chocolate aisle and filling their trolleys with chocolate boxes. Carmen later realized that the chocolates contained liqueur. Alcohol is prohibited in Saudi Arabia, but somehow the liqueur chocolates must have slipped by the customs officials.Carmen's life was a reasonably happy one in the beginning. She describes her relationships with the other Bin Ladin wives; the relationship of her husband with his brothers; and of course, she talks about Osama Bin Ladin.Apparently, Osama was a quiet man and very pious. Unlike his brothers who at first lived a lavish life and were known for their promiscuity and for being playboys, Osama never embraced the western liberal way of life. Carmen says that rumors of him having been a playboy in his younger days are just false. Even pictures allegedly showing him partying in Europe are not of him, but of his brothers who resemble him somewhat. Interestingly, she says that his brothers do not believe that he could have been capable of masterminding the 9/11 attacks on the United States.Since the Bin Ladin family was the only family given exclusive rights to renovate the two holy sites, Mecca and Medina, the family was given preferential treatment. For example, if a policeman or a member of the religious police stopped one of the Bin Ladins, all they had to say was Bin Ladin, and they were quickly released or given right of way. No one asked for their IDs. This however was not good policy, for it allowed a group of Islamists, hidden in Bin Ladin trucks (which were never searched), to attack and seize the holy Mosque in Mecca in 1979. In fact, one of the Bin Ladin brothers was arrested as a suspect in the attack, but was soon released because he was a Bin Ladin.When Mohammad Bin Ladin died in a plane crash he was piloting, the eldest son was still in his twenties. The king therefore appointed a trustee to run the family fortune. Eventually, as the brothers grew up, they took full control of the family business. According to Carmen, her husband Yeslam was the smartest of the brothers, and this gave rise to envy and jealousy. His brothers frequently downplayed his decisions, and publicly offended him. They also took credit for many of his savvy deals that added to his family's wealth and fame. Eventually, Yeslam quit his family business, was given 300 million dollars as his share of the family wealth, and moved to Switzerland. However, his brothers, eventually recognizing his value to the family business, asked him to return.Carmen relates how she longed to travel outside Saudi Arabia, and how she enjoyed her freedom during her trips to Switzerland and the United States. One thing I liked about Carmen is that she is a bibliophile. She piled books on her travels to read while literally imprisoned in the Bin Ladin compound in Jeddah. She read all subjects, from philosophy to politics.Carmen describes the state of mind of the Saudi Royals during the downfall of the Shah of Iran, and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini. Before the Ayatollah, Saudi Arabia was moving in the right direction, becoming more liberal and westernized. However, after the Iranian revolution, with fear of it spilling to Saudi Arabia, religious fanatics gained power and turned the country into a strict religious monarchy, very much like during the Taliban in Afghanistan. Women were not allowed to drive; had to be completely covered; were discouraged of going to school; were discouraged to go in public places; were forbidden from working; were not allowed to join any health clubs or do any sports; and were raised to be subservient to their future husbands. The country suddenly moved hundreds of years backwards! Carmen, who had high hopes of living in Jeddah, had her hopes collapse. Her life was becoming unbearable in Jeddah. She longed to go back to Switzerland.Trouble between her and her husband first started during her third pregnancy. Her husband did not want the baby, and Carmen eventually had an abortion. She describes the psychological pain she had to endure after the abortion.When Carmen was pregnant again, her husband once more asked her to have an abortion. This time she refused, and she knew that it would be over between them. To make matters worse, she learnt that her husband was cheating on her, and she even caught him leaving one of his mistress's homes in the middle of the morning.Carmen gives us a lot of insight into the life of her husband Yeslam. Apparently, later in his life, he acted strange, was often depressed, and complained of imaginary illnesses. He also had a fear of flying, and refused to fly alone. Like his father, his brother Salem also died while piloting his own aircraft in Texas.I did not like the last chapter which talked about the Bin Ladins. The chapter seemed more like an attack on the Bin Ladin family, as if Carmen wanted to get back at her ex-husband. She says that the Bin Ladin family should make their secret dealings open to public scrutiny, and that their present relation with Osama should be revealed. These statements somewhat weakened her book. If she knows something we don't she should just tell us, or better still, let the CIA know. I am sure she is genuine in her last chapter (chapter 19, conclusion), but I think it is more personal and revengeful than anything else. By the way, an additional chapter was added in later editions. The book I read had the added chapter included.Overall, this is a good read for those who want to know about Saudi society in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s, and especially those wanting to learn about the Bin Ladin family. The reader should note that since King Abdullah gained the throne, Saudi Arabia has been moving forward at a tremendous speed, and the country is becoming more open, tolerant, and westernized. And kudos, women now outsmart the guys. Well done!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book is a quick read and captivating. Although there were some elements missing for me (like other perspectives from within the culture, specifically the poor, and did she see anything about Islam that is positive?), I give it five stars because I can only imagine what it was to sift through her life experience to get to such a dynamic book. Also because of the courage it took to write this book and have it published openly.It was sometimes hard to relate to the author who comes from such great wealth. At one point she talks about her husband and friend trying to talk her into buying a $60,000 dress-but she couldn't see spending that much on a dress she could only wear once!The varied threads of this book give the tapestry its texture: the life of a young, idealistic woman, in love with her husband of Saudi Arabian culture; an inside view from under the chador (black veils that shroud Muslim women); a view of life in the golden cage of vast Saudi wealth; a glimpse of life within the Bin Laden family dynamics, and a mother's passion for her daughters. The author spends most of her words on her lifestyle and the challenges it presents to her western style upbringing. But she does touch, albeit very quickly, on all the high drama of royalty and Saudi oil money, female genital mutilation, submission of women, drugs, homosexuality (within a religious culture that forbids it), adultery. There are not graphic descriptions here, rather an acknowledgment and confirmation of these realities.There are many messages of value woven throughout Carmen Bin Ladin's story. One short quote that comes at the end of the book that I wish all Americans would understand: \\"I fear that if we, in the Western world, are not vigilant enough, there will be no end to their terrorism. They will use our tolerance to infiltrate our society with their intolerance.\\"As Americans, we often think \\"human beings are all more alike than we are different,\\" yet there is a denial of cultural differences that can be very dangerous. Her bottom line: Freedom to live up to your potential is the greatest wealth of all."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Some people fall in love only to find out that a big mistake was made, not only with their husband but with their husbands family. This book is about a family with a very well known name, the Ladin's. None other than Osama Ben Ladins brother. She met him in the United States learning every thing he could about America and it's way of life. The marriage took place in Saudi Arabia and the living hell began. Carmen was half-Swiss and half-Persian, her mind wasn't in the right place being blinded by love. Love can do funny things to a person, it can make you forget what type of a person you may be marrying. The customs of other lands are forgotten until the marriage takes place and then she finds out more than she really wanted to know. The Koran became her only book to read and her rights she thought she had, soon disappeared. The book takes you into the Islamic fundamentalists life style and into the minds of her husband and brother in law. Her husband Yeslam divorced Carmen and her life came close to ending by Islamic law. Read the book and find out what she knew about the men in her life and 9/11. When she heard the news of the attack on America, she knew that her husbands brother and her husband were connected in some way. Her book takes you behind the lines of the terrorist and their Islamic way of thinking. A must read- Larry Hobson-Author The Day Of The Rose"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"We often hear it said that people are basically alike all over the world. However, life under Wahabi Islam defies that statement. We would love to think that every parent loves their chidren and would want to protect them; we would like to think that families could play and laugh together; we would love to think that eveyone wants a life of peace. The family structure under the Islamic fundamentalists is totally removed from anything that we think as normal. This is more than just &quot;cultural differences&quot; -- this portrays basic differences in how we view ourselves, other humans, and God. It will be a long time, if ever, that western culture and the Middle East can agree on anything.The author is brave indeed to have written this book, but in light of her infamous name and the future of her children, I respect her for taking this approach instead of attempting to change her name and hide. This is an interesting book and certainly shows us that the world is definitely a dangerous place."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is a story that is rarely told, and even more infrequently, told well. Carmen bin Laden relates the story of her marriage to a member of what is perhaps the most influential non-royal family in Saudi Arabia. Yes, it's that bin Laden family. Her former husband, Yeslam, is an older half-brother of the infamous Osama.The family and their umbrella company, the bin Laden Organization owe their wealth and influence to Sheik Mohammed bin Laden, the deceased patriarch, who built a small construction business into what might be described as the Saudi equivalent of Halliburton. With the bin Laden Organization winning the right to supervise and effect the renovation of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the family's influence was solidified for good.Carmen is the daughter of an Iranian mother and Swiss father. She grew up in Switzerland, with frequent trips to visit her grandmother in pre-Revolutionary Iran. While she was raised Muslim, the traditions and strictures of the Saudis that she encountered after her marriage where far more confining and archaic than she ever expected. From the restrictive confines of the abaya, the head to toe covering of Saudi women, to prohibitions against conversation or interaction with men other than her husband, Carmen found herself a prisoner in her own home.Carmen's difficulties have little to do with Islam, but the Wahhabi sect of Islam that dominates life in Saudi Arabia. Her stories and anecdotes of life under a harsh social system that has clear delineations between Saudi men and woman, Saudis and non-Saudis, make for fascinating reading. It also give a tiny bit of insight into the religious fanaticism of her former brother-in-law and his followers. If the Saudis are supposed to be our best friends among the Arabs, my hopes for a more peaceful world have been severely damaged.I suspect that the author has tempered some of her stories in the desire to protect her daughters from reprisals, but she offers sufficient tales to give a clear understanding of the restrictions and biases against women within Saudi culture. One such story deals with the trouble that she had in merely having a carpet laid to her satisfaction, barred as she was from speaking directly to the workers. Or the difficulties in dealing with male employees that will not take orders from a woman. I can't help but wonder that if a woman within a moneyed and prominent family should encounter such a stifling existence, how bad must it be for women in the middle or lower classes?"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I myself am almost finished with this book and I find it insightful and very personal. I am a Muslim woman in my late 20's, and I do not agree with the fundamentalist way of Islam. But, for me Islam is a religion of peace in my own mind. I have found much comfort and peace from being a Muslim and I don't appreciate others insulting my religion. It is these people (Viktoria) who are ignorant and backwards in their thinking. You can not write such a hateful review about Muslims when you know few facts from a book. Saying the meaning of Islam makes you want to \\"puke\\" is unfair to Muslims who are truly good people and mean well. Not all Muslims have a twisted view point and to say so is terribly ignorant. I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen Bin Laden's account of her marriage to and divorce from Osama Bin Laden's brother Yeslam has become a best seller. There is curiousity about the Bin Ladens. Indeed, the world is hungry for information about the elusive family. Writing about them has given many auhtors their first best selling book. And none of the accounts are as juicy as this.The book is a breeze of a read. A veritable page turner as you are led into the very hidden world of the inner workings of the second most influential family after the Sauds in Saudi Arabia. But it is the subjective limited account of a wife who ultimately was resented by her in-laws because she never quite settled in. As such it is subjective, as is this review.I am a Muslim woman from Pakistan, of the liberal variety. And I would never consider going behind the veil for and move to Saudi Arabia. Carmen makes much about her innocence as to what living in Saudi entailed, but considering she is half Irani and spent quite a bit of time there, I'm surprised no one warned her. Most especially her own mother, who having been raised in Iran would know about it.But it is one helluva ride, but just for kicks. There is nothing really insightful the Bin Laden family here. Carmen didn't really mingle with the women and no Saudi man ever came close.So what you have is a love story about a girl with stars in her eyes who follows her heart all the way to the Bin Laden lair, lives the good life, jet sets around the world, hoping against hope that Saudi Arabia would soon turn into L.A.Ultimately this is just an overblown love story wearing a socio-political burqa."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I was drawn to Carmen Bin Laden's memoir, Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia when I was doing research about the country of Saudi Arabia. I was pleased to find a fascinating story of a woman trying to protect her children from the fall-out after the tragic events of September 11, 2001 and raise them to be educated free-thinkers instead of grooming them to become chattel in a severe culture.Young and deeply in love, this half-Swiss and half-Persian girl married into the vast Bin Laden family. With her European upbringing, she was not prepared for her several years of married life in the male-dominated Muslim world, where \\"women are no more than house pets.\\" The harsh treatment of Saudi women seems almost criminal, and Carmen doesn't hide the fact that money, status, and location all play an important role in determining how a woman is treated treated. In Saudi Arabia, sequestered Muslim wives are oppressed and treated like second class citizens. It's not only the men who expect women to stay \\"under wraps,\\" uneducated, and out of the public eye; the older Saudi women often force young women to adopt codes of behavior that turn them into pieces of property. Money, on the other hand, can buy a woman a temporary reprieve, a trip to Europe and America, where an almost unfettered life can be led, but when she returns behind the veil, life becomes frightening.Not wanting her three young children to be subjected to this upbringing, Carmen fights her way out of a painful marriage and makes a life for her family in Europe and America. Just when things seem to be leveling out, the horror of 9/11 occurs and Carmen has to fight the stigma attached to her married name of Bin Laden.This painful memoir will be quick to read and difficult to put down, but you may find yourself returning to read again about life Inside the Kingdom.by Rhonda Esakovfor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I pick up a lot of books, read about half of them, and put them down.

I sat mesmerized for hours listening to the audio version of this book. I enjoyed it immmensely."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"The book is an interesting read, however, there is nothing about it that would make me think about world affairs. It talks about a culture and its nuances. It discusses how the life of the \\"free\\" thinking author was put on hold because of the society she was living in and how she felt sorry for women in SA because of their way of life. One of the oddities of this book is that the author talks of nothing but her so called positives while on the other hand has a rather condescending air towards others.Towards the end she talks about how the alimony alloted to her is less than that of her ex-husbands pilots, yet she continues to fight. Life is tough and you make choices based on your own priorities. I know of a Latino woman, who married a Saudi man in Florida, had two kids and when they divorced she got nothing and this was through the US courts. So, why should Carmen be the only one we feel sorry for. Her daughter is making a full blown spectacle of her self because in order to remove themselves from the Bin Laden name, they feel that they must prove to the world how \\"modern\\" they are in their thinking. Yet, they want that money!!! They know nothing about that demon uncle of theirs, and have never met him. Hence this book is anything but a reflection on what the future holds, but is more about - \\"booh hoo, my life stinks, I got the shorter end of the stick, i was not allowed to think, I could have ruled the world but SA culture held me back!!\\" She could have left him earlier, but did not....makes me wonder how much of a role money played.Interesting read if you want to pry in to the life of someone, but certainly not what I had expected."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I found this book to be an interesting and fast read. The book does not really cover much at all about Osama bin Ladin and to be fair they really do not make the claim that it will. I was not disappointed, but I new that the book was a bit light on the detail. If it were not for the large print and wide margins, they could not have got much more then a magazine article out of the text. That point aside I did find that I learned a great deal about what it is like to live in Saudi Arabia, at least from a woman's perspective. Given the rather bland and restricted life styles, it a wonder that the woman of the country have not held major riots. I kept thinking that Saudi is closer to the 13th century then the 21st.I think the author did a good job at trying to explain why the rather fundamental attitude is so pervasive within the kingdom. You can see where the view that it is better to kill ones self in an act of terrorism is acceptable as long as they wrap it up in fundamental religious overtones. Overall I enjoyed the book. It gave me a nice perspective on what it is like in Saudi and why I do not what to visit. The only knock on the book would be the detail, she lived there for over a decade and was barely able to scrape together 200 pages."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book was a first account of the author's life and presented a view of life,as a female, in Saudi Arabia. It appears that women do not enjoy the freedom of the males there and are living a life of servatude and oppression. I am sure that the males would not switch with the females. As an American it was revealing to read that people there live in such isolation and emotional deprivation. It helps one to understand the Arabian culture and how different they are from Americans and other free countries.The product was used, had a few bent pages..but was clean and readable...I would order again from this source. Thanks."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Here we see the similar story, White women marries \`exotic' arab man, moves to arab country, realizes it not what she expected, and leaves in various circumstances of hardship. Unlike some of these similar books, Carmen Bin Laden has both kept her name and is not \`fearing for her life'. It is not clear why but for some reason she has also had an easy time keeping her children and educating in a normal manner away from the fascist ideology of Saudi culture. This is yet another \`insiders' account of what its like to be a western woman trapped in the arab world. The irony here is that like ALL similar accounts the writer takes NO personal responsibility for her actions and the decisions that got her into this mess. Although the book is honestly critical and rightly skewers the 12th century style society of Saudi Arabia, it doesn't seem to ever ask the question \\"perhaps being swept off my feet by an exotic man is not what it seems?\\". Even when she catches her husband cheating on her she doesn't dare to wonder \\"Is Islam perhaps a contraction, its obsession with keeping women veiled while the men violate every verse of the Koran?\\". When the author describes her abortion she also doesn't seem to see the hypocrisy in living in an ultra-religious country in a fundamentalist society where everyone is busy forcing their wives to have abortions, participating in orgies and drinking themselves to bed every night, contravening the exact laws that supposedly are soooo important. This is simply a sad account of someone who should have known better, but apparently, due to the massive volume of literature on this topic, no one seems to have learned since the 1970s, when these kinds of books began appearing, that living in Saudi Arabia, or Egypt, or Iran, is like living in a primeval world where women have less value then a car and less rights then a dog. But, if this book is any indication, we will be seeing the same story played out for the next hundred year, until Wahhibism triumphs, or is extinguished. A good read if you haven't already read the dozen other likeminded book. Apparently this is also a good \`insiders account' of the Bin laden family, much of which most people could have guessed, like gee what a surprise that the kids go to ultra-fanatical religious schools, or that the women enjoy their repressive lives.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Its the nicest book I have read this year. The author very vividly yet in a very interesting manner describes her life story. The cultures are different. Its difficult for a westernised woman to live in a strict Islamic state. However I feel these kind of books are written with a particular bias in mind. For example you are writting a book on middle east, you show how women are repressed etc. If you are writing on India you write about its poverty and the snakes and elephants roaming on the roads. This bias must go."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I enjoyed this book very much as I worked as a nurse in Saudi Arabia for two years and interacted with Saudi's of all social levels, whether they be bedouin shepherds or shepherdess's, members of the royal family or very wealthy Saudi men and women. I also chronicled my experiences in the book I have written-\\"Single in Saudi\\" by Genia. It is a totally different perspective on life in Saudi as I challenged and managed to break most of the rules in this formidable country. I was a young, single blue-eyed blonde American, and a raving feminist. I wore the obaya out of convenience, not necessity, but found it was a very humiliating experience as I felt like I lost my identity and became a non-entity. Somehow I survived and look back on the experience as one of great adventure as I flaunted my American feminity, broke most of the taboos and- got away with it. Something the poor women born or married into that society cannot do. If you are interested in the culture of this country, my book will give you a totally different look at this secretive society, one seen from the eyes of a liberated Western female. Genia"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is an extremely intelligent, insightful, humane book. Its author, part Swiss & part Iranian, fell in love with a young Saudi without realizing what her marriage to him with involve, in the way of sacrifices of personal freedoms. The full impact fell slowly, as his society itself took strides backward. Finally, he had changed enough, in ways that threatened the happiness & freedom of her daughters, to lead her to break with him. That one of his many half-brothers turned out to be THE Bin Laden adds to the fascination of this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"While Carmen's story is certainly interesting, and probably compelling if one isn't familiar with Saudi Arabia or fundamentalist Islam, it's not exactly a riveting page-turner.In fact, it reads more like a script from Oprah.The writing is weak; the details are few. She covers thirty years of marriage; three babies; an abortion; her relationship with not only a world-renowned terrorist, but also one of the world's most influential families; assorted tidbits about Saudi society; PLUS, an earth-shattering event in all of 200, widely spaced pages.Frankly, if she didn't share her name with Osama, the book would probably have never been published on its own merit.However, if one knows nothing about the Kingdom and its all-too-accurately told oppressive nature, it's a great place to begin research. For those who are familiar with Saudi, Wahabism, and Islamic fundamentalism in general, it's just a trip down another tabloid lane."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book is insulting - how can one just view the world only from their lenses... oh my goodness she is insufferable - she had a life better than 98% of the World, she is shopping in Switzerland, tennis socials and soirees --- and YET SHE IS COMPLAINING THROUGH OUT!!! She is another priviledged woman who just wanted to cash on the her Bin Laden lastname .... she knew what family she was marrying into, being in Switzerland she had access to normal regular guys (well her version of normal anyway) -- but she chose a rich porsche driving Saudi heir.... eish!! this book is a disappointment... She could have written a better critique of the nation... oh! what an insufferable woman - her comparisons with the West were not objective at all, too black or white for me.... societies are gray!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen bin Laden is a pampered Swiss of Persian decent who married Osama bin Laden's half brother. Her well paced book presents an interesting story but one that seems to be missing some parts. Westerners such as myself are shocked by Saudi customs, but marrying into the family and moving to Saudi Arabia were choices she freely made. It seemed to me that the book was moving toward a climax, but Carmen briefly wraps up the last few years of her life by saying that she did not want to discuss details."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"A nice little book that gives a personal, candid look at life in Saudi Arabia. The author's style is unpretentious and makes no attempt to draw sweeping conclusions, but she did succeed in drawing a fine picture of her experiences in that kingdom."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen bin Laden's father was a Swiss and her mother an aristocratic Iranian. She married Osama's older brother Yeslam.There is not much about Osama, other than the family, even in secret, asserted that Osama did not orchestrate 9/11.However, there is a tremendous amount about what life for woman in Saudi Arabia is like.The author paints a very unflattering portrait of herself as naive, self-centred, shallow and petty. This lends authenticity since the important things she says in passing as she focuses on the trivial.The first theme of the book is the fanatical segregation of the sexes. Women are virtual prisoners. I would say a prisoner in the USA has more freedom than an Saudi woman.Bizarre as is sounds, she did not even attend her own wedding. A male relative served in proxy, holding the groom's hand.That black abaya (head to toe black covering) actually makes it impossible for women to see. It is like walking around at night. Even in the sweltering heat of Saudi Arabia, they wear gloves and thick black stockings to hide every inch of skin.A woman is allowed to be seen by only other women, her husband and her brothers. So a family restaurant works like this. There are locked rooms for each family. Each time the waiter comes, he knocks on the door. The women all cover their faces. He pours the water. He leaves. Then they take off the veils to eat. This ritual is repeated for every dish he brings.A man may not help his wife who has fainted up off the ground since \\"embracing\\" in public is not permitted. If he does so, religious police will beat him.The author insisted on going shopping for some Similac canned breast milk when servants failed to find it. But women were not permitted in a store run by men. So they had to empty the store of all males before she could shop. There are special all female shops.Women get no education, have no access to books. The rich onesentertain themselves memorising the Koran and shopping by having stuff delivered.A man may have four wives at a time. He can divorce her just bysaying \\"I divorce thee\\" three times. Adultery in women in punishable by death, but beatings and adultery by males are not grounds for divorce, only some obscure religious violations.You'd think the females would be up in arms at this oppression, but they are the ones who work hardest to keep other females in line. This is the most important revelation of the book.The other theme of the book is the belief you can't be too religious. These people are puritans on steroids. Ashcroft and his $8000 robes for naked statues would be right at home.At the same time they are big on hypocrisy, with rampant promiscuityand homosexuality, never acknowledged. Appearances are everything. Anything denied does not exist.She only hints at some of the decadence of the Saudi Princes (e.g. Prince Bondar). She hints it is just too decadent to be believed but gives scant detail other than a comment about importing planeloads of call girls for parties. Bush of course attended many of these parties (not discussed in the book).Osama himself is fanatically religious. Non Islamic people are not supposed to sully the Holy Ground in Saudi Arabia. That truly is the bee in his bonnet, just as he claimed. After reading about what religious fruitcakes ORDINARY Saudis are, it all makes perfect sense. Saudis spend their entire lives obsessing about minor sins.One of the amusing things is the Saudi snobbery. If you aren't Saudi, you're a nobody. I thought only Americans thought that."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I found Jean Sassoon's \\"Princess\\" three-part trilogy more interesting in its depiction of life for women inside Saudi Arabia. Carmen Bin Ladin's book also takes the perspective of a foreign national, so it is somewhat skewed in that regard.If a princess and wealthy foreign woman can suffer so much under the strict Saudi regime, just imagine what hardships underprivileged Saudi women must face.One author did just that, and in a recently released novel set in contemporary Saudi Arabia, follows the tribulations of a fictional Saudi heroine. The book is called \\"Saudi Match Point\\" from Blacksmith Books. It's a quick, informative, and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Ms Bin Laden's book told me all sorts of things I never knew about Saudi Arabia; that the word there for women means \\"evil\\" and that the schools only taught the Koran. It shows that Saudi men are so afraid of being tempted by a woman's face that they won't look at her (even a sister-in-law). The women can't go shopping if men are in the store. They can't drive, walk across the street, leave the country without permission from a male relative or show their faces in public.If you want to understand how Osama could do something so destructive, look at the way he treats his kids. His son was sufferering the heat of the desert, but he wouldn't let the baby drink water from a bottle, only a spoon (hey, the man's word is law here). Carmen's husband, Yeslam, eventualy rejects his daughters because they are too \\"Western\\" and sinks into a life of complete selfishness.At the same time, I'm not that sympathetic to Carmen Bin Laden. She knew early in the game that her daughters were getting a lousy education, and she should have taken the girls back to Switzerland. I think she had a sort of co-dependency with her husband. Why else would she put up with habits she despised so much?Not all Saudi women live behind veils. There are women there who uncover their faces, sell goods in markets, have jobs-but these are women whose husbands aren't wealthy. Carmen Bin Laden was married to a millionaire who could afford chaufers, servants, etc."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Having lived in the Kingdom from 1990-1998 I found this book to be factual, however, women who write of their experiences in Saudi Arabia annoy me in relation to the wearing of the Abaya. We all know we have to wear this garment, why go on about it??? It is their country, their custom - so obey the rules. We Westeners all go to the Middle East to make good money for our future, just enjoy the experience and \\"go with the flow\\". Carmen wrote a very good book, but I sincerely believe in my heart of hearts that her daughters need to change their surname, i.e. Bin Laden, so they will not experience problems, pretty easy really! If you are born with the name \\"Hitler\\", you would change this for obvious reasons. Good read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Being a born and raised Muslim woman in western society, I can clearly say that I have never been more ashamed of the ideals of many Americans as I am right now, after reading the appalling reviews on this page. I personally believe that the blame lies on both sides: Carmen's and the Saudi Kingdom.\\"Inside the Kingdom\\" is Carmen Bin Ladin's autobiography of living in Saudi Arabia with her husband and his Bin Laden family. A Western-born and bred woman, she was born to a Muslim mother and a Christian father, neither of which educated her thoroughly in either of their religions. Naive and innocent, she married into a culture of which she had no knowledge. In today's world, no self-secure person would EVER enter into a commitment of which he or she had no prior knowledge of. Ms. Bin Ladin decided to do so and chose to go to a \\"foreign\\" world, fully aware that the ideals she found there were completely different from her own. Later on, she placed the blame on them, forgetting the fact that it was her decision to live there that even LEAD her to blame anyone.My main reason for buying this book was to mainly gain insight into one of the most notorious families in the world. However, I was not prepared for incredulous gasps of \\"This is SO not Western.\\" Carmen mainly depicted every single bit of negativity she could find in an apparent \\"scapegoat\\" nation and neglected the abundance of positivity as well. For someone who describes herself as an optimist, every single word dripped with disdain.I am not, in any way, spreading any type of propaganda for the country of Saudi Arabia nor am I Arabic either. It seems that Carmen encountered a fanatical group that DOES NOT appear to be anywhere else. I also DO NOT agree with anyone who says it is extremely common in the United States. Spraying acid in women's faces if they're wearing makeup, not being able to help your pregnant wife up after falling, and depriving your child of water just because a bottle signifies need and vulnerability, is not part of any religion that I know of and it CERTAINLY IS NOT a part of Islam. Many fanatical forms of Islam (and I'm sure other religions as well) exist worldwide and Carmen seems to have come across one of them. This does not extinguish the fact that the religion itself IS a peaceful one and NOT at all meant to be followed as the way it has been depicted.\\"They treat their women more like pets than as partners.\\" This is clearly an act of fanaticism as it is definitely NOT one of a Muslim's. In Islam, marriage IS a partnership, contrary to the beliefs of most. Respect and mutual satisfaction go BOTH ways.As much as I respect this woman for her own moral beliefs as a mother and human being, I must disagree on her portrayal of what is clearly another world to her. She's being \\"commended and applauded for her courage in lashing out against the Saudi Kingdom.\\" Excuse me but why wouldn't she? Why wouldn't she jump at the chance to appease a bloodthirsty society with her negative condemnations of YES, a peaceful religion? Islam seems to be under direct brutality in recent days and frankly I believe that the use of ulterior motives was in DIRECT use in the writing of this book. Why wouldn't she jump at the chance to isolate herself from the current pariah of western nations, by declaring them \\"evil and barbaric?\\"Most of the reviews that I have had the unfortunate pleasure of reading are a direct insult to the religion of Islam, basically written by westerners who believe themselves to be just, moral, and right in their opinions. Anyone beside them and their beliefs is \\"backward and ignorant.\\" Before you go judging an entire community of arrogance and beliefs of superiority, based on the opinions of one indecisive individual who seemed to be entirely subjective during her life in that country, I suggest you take a look at yourselves in the mirror because I'm sure that what you would find there would be nothing short of \\"superior\\" as most Westerners believe themselves to be.I feel I must protest on behalf of Muslims everwhere, that one women's (and one seemingly BIASED woman's) negative accounts of a Muslim country and it's people do NOT count for Muslims WORLDWIDE as some people so desperately want to believe. If you believe yourself to be correct, I suggest you read the Quran and see just how much of what is depicted about Islam in Carmen's book is actually NOT incorporated in Allah's Book.If you buy this book, do so with a clearly objective and thoughtful mindset unless you're looking for more anti-Islamic sentiment, in which case I then suggest you put this book right at the top of your Christmas Wish List.One Muslim's actions do not define that person's religion. Nor do they define the rest of the community. For example, Yeslam and Carmen lived together before marriage. This is prohibited in Islam just like aborition is. The actions of a few individuals do not speak for the rest of us. There are two sides to every story and I myself, as a woman and as a Muslim, am witholding my own judgment before the other side is \\"unveiled.\\"I give this book 3 stars for a woman's struggle as a loving wife and mother but that's about it, because 5 stars would mean that I approved of her biased opinion, and of that, I do not."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book may have suffered in comparison to the others I've recently read on the subject, so take this review with a grain of salt. However, my overall impression of this book was that it was a little Jackie Collins-ish and drama-queenish.Written by Carmen bin Laden, this book purports to provide some insider knowledge into this very large family as well as into Saudi Arabia itself. The reader should be aware from the start that Carmen barely knew Osama Bin Laden; it appears that she met him once or twice and of course had nothing very kind to say about him. No insight into the most infamous Bin Laden is to be found here; if you have an interest, I would recommendGrowing Up bin Laden: Osama's Wife and Son Take Us Inside Their Secret Worldby Bin Laden's first wife and son instead.Now that that elephant has been cleared from the room, what does Carmen bin Laden have to offer? Not much, quite honestly. This book read like a text version of Real Housewives of Saudi Arabia. While there is some information that is worthwhile, for the most part the reader is treated to an endless list of complaints about life in Saudi Arabia for Carmen and her daughters. I was really intensely annoyed that she seemed so surprised that there would be limitations to her freedom in the Kingdom. She excuses this repeatedly by saying \\"I was young; I didn't know any better\\", and while this argument may have some merit, it got a bit tedious after awhile. Someone with her apparent intelligence and her education probably should've known better, or at least had friends and family to steer her in a different direction.To make a long story short, there are many better books with much deeper insights into life in Saudi Arabia."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Intercultural marriages are challenging, but 'Inside the Kingdom' is in a league all of its own! I remember a young woman being taught at university, her first exposure, by a muslim professor and being very favorably impressed. The picture she received was nothing like the reality that Carmen bin Laden so graphically potrays. Carmen, herself, in the glow of love saw nothing to fear in the handsome, reasonable, thoughtful, and apparently westernized man she came to know (she thought!), who blended in so well to the life she led. And so it was, in the beginning. But his soul, and his financial opportunities, were bound by an unseen umbilical cord to Saudi Arabia, and to a life there that for a woman was dehumanized and beyond shocking for anyone who has not experienced it. The repression of Wahhabism is beyond belief--if women must be so 'protected' from the lust of men, why is it that women walk about freely, drive, study and contribute to society in America with no more sexual assault than exists in Saudi Arabia? What a poor reflection on Muslim men!!by the author of 'Graffiti On My Soul'"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I hate these really long and drawn out reviews so I'll keep it brief. I loved this book at it was written almost from a western point of view. Carmen saw Saudi Arabia as an outsider, not someone born and raised into such oppression. She was a part of the most revered family and as such received special benefits. If you want a look at Saudi life from a perspective you (a westerner) can understand, this is your book. Its very easy to understand and she doesn't dwell on one subject. She covers it all, beginning to end."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Most of the women in my book club were disappointed with this book because they expected it to be great writing and a remarkable story. In reality, this is an easy and interesting read about a western-raised woman's singular experience within a strict Muslim family. The author entered into her marriage with delusions that a man with the kind of money that the Bin Laden family has as primary building contractors to the great Saudis for whom Saudi Arabia is named, would give her an easy life with few strings attached. By her account, she was a devoted wife to Osama's brother (getting up in the middle of the night, for instance, to play chess with her stressed-out husband when needed). But slowly, her freedoms within the family became more and more restricted. Apparently, the Bin Ladens feel a social obligation to live up to the teachings of the Koran and set an example for their collective society, and this could explain the production of a zealot like Osama. As the situation in the middle east became more volatile, instead of parties entertaining diplomats in their home, Carmen found herself sitting in with female family members for spiritually nourishing Koran readings and unable to even cross the street to visit relatives without a chaperone. For a girl brought up outside of Saudi Arabia, this life eventually became too restrictive and she broke free.Unlike books written by authors who grew up in the culture, I found this account was more accessible because the Carmen Bin Laden originally came from my world and had a western perspective. She knew all that she was giving up, and I had a respect for her willingness to try to make the parameters of muslim life in Saudi Arabia work for her and her marriage. One suspects that she felt compelled to write her memoirs of being married to Osama Bin Laden's brother because she was at the time involved in a nasty divorce and custody battle with her ex. All in all, Inside the Kingdom was a unique perspective and a good quick read, with occasional glimpses of the radical engineer of 9/11."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I really liked this book, the insight into Saudi Arabian culture and thought was very eye opening. To be a woman, (equal to an animal) in that society is horrendous. What God would create a human being (woman) for the sole purposes of sexual gratification for a man, breeding sons,and cooking? Only a god concocted by sick, selfish men.I would prefer not to have been born than live the life of a female in the middle east. I wish Carmen had not stayed in that marriage for 14 years and I question her reasons on that. I am only happy that she got out in time to save her girls and herself from the many horrible scenarios that could have happened to them, with government and family sanctions!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen bin Laden gives an account of the life she lived in Saudi Arabia when she married Yaslam bin Laden, the half-brother of Osama. This book goes to the heart of what it means to be a woman in Saudi society: according to her account, it is a life of imprisonment. Women are denied basic rights, such as the right to think independently or choose fulfilling careers. They are under the absolute rule of their husbands and are given no room for creativity, decision-making, or intellectual engagement. They are cut off from literature, philosophy, great books, and the free press. In many ways, they are seen by men as objects or property and even their husbands' servants will often refuse to take orders from them. In one account, Carmen describes an episode in which she was going to have the carpeting in her home redone. After the hired worker failed to do the job correctly, she gave him instructions. He refused to look at her and when she insisted that he obeyed his orders, he scornfully grunted, \\"I do not take orders from women.\\" Only after Carmen was able to get a male member of the family to intervene did the servant come to understand that he was to obey the orders of Carmen when her husband was absent.According to Carmen bin Laden, the rules in Saudi society are extremely burdensome and inefficient. Because women were not allowed to be seen in public during her years in Saudi Arabia, shopping was conducted by having the family's male driver go to a local store, pick up a few samples of inventory, come back to the home, have the woman select articles that she approved, and returning the unwanted items back to the store. When none of the items brought to the woman were satisfactory, several trips conducted in his manner were often necessary. In one account, she had her driver go back and forth several times to bring home Similac for her baby. After several unsuccessful trips, she decided to go out on her own to procure the formula. When she arrived at the store, however, it had to be completely evacuated before she could enter, lest a woman, even one fully covered up behind an abaya, be seen by a man.The book is extremely well written and engaging. Carmen bin Laden has succeeded in presenting to the reader the tensions experienced when a woman raised with the freedoms of the West is immersed in the restrictive culture of Saudi society."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is an interesting eye opening look at life in Saudi Arabia.

Carmen goes over what it was like to live in Saudi Arabia and how opressive it is for women to live there. She tells it like it is neither overdoing it or glamourizing it. In a way, she tells it like an outside observer might without playing herself to be a victim.I definitely reccomend this book. It is not too in depth and is suitable for teenagers to read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book gives a very insightful look into the lives of Saudi women, and their role in the lives of their families and in their religion. It also says some interesting things about Osuma Bin Laden who was one of her brothers-in-law. It is easy to read and well written. Sometimes it is hard to believe that the author was so taken in by her husband, but love does strange things. They definitely did lead two different lives, depending on whether they were in Saudi Arabia, or elsewhere in the world (Switzerland or the US). I learned a great deal that helped me understand things I learned in some other books I have read in which the practice of Islam played a key role. It is a fairly quick read, and quite interesting, although the end gets a little repetitive"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. I got it on a Sat evening and finished it by Sunday evening - could not put it down. It is very well written and despite the fact that Carmen was married to Osama Bin Laden's brother (Yeslam) there are only a few mentions of Osama - most relating to how the family revered him for his fastidious religious practices. The rest focuses on Carmen's growing dismay and final realization that, despite all the wealth that is found in Saudi Arabia it can not buy was is needed most - the modernization of the culture and end to the oppression of both women and children (especially the female children).It is a scary book when you realize it was written in 2004 and reflects a time even 10 yrs earlier - especially when you see what's happened since then in the Middle East.This is a must read for anyone who wants to get an insider's view of the social/cultural climate of Saudi Arabia and at least a small understanding of why they view the Western world as they do.Kudos to Carmen Bin Ladin for her courage, dedication and love for her daughters in coming forward to putting her experiences down for all of us to read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book should be required reading for every American girl/woman and husband. My wife and I devoured it. This Persian/Swiss woman who married into the most powerful family in Saudi Arabia - the Bin Ladens; tells a great tale of her life behind the Abaya (female body/face covering) and offers great insights into the world of the Bin Ladens and Islam. Her story covers the breadth of her experience being married to Osama Bin Laden's half brother and even her contact with OBL himsef. An amazing tale of love, family, stultifying tradition, history, and divorce."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"When I first saw this book, I expected more whining from Arabs about how tough it's been for them in the post-September 11, 2001 world. (One of my \`favorite' quotes off the news media was some Saudi billionaire saying, \\"We in the bin Laden family are victims of 9-11, too.\\") In reality this is an entirely different sort of book, my misconceptions were wrong, and nothing could be farther from the truth about \\"Inside The Kingdom\\". Carmen Bin Laden, a woman of Swiss-Persian ethnicity, one of many sisters-in-law of Osama, has delivered via her personal story what amounts to an expose of the atrocious trampling of female civil rights that goes in daily inside the Saudi nation, into which she married.I am sick and tired of being told \\"we must tolerate the diversity of other cultures and respect the Islamic world.\\" Why? Why must we tolerate intolerance? Why can't we focus our outrage onto these wrongs? Don't Arabs deserve to have liberty? In Saudi Arabia in 2005, women are at best third-class citizens who are denied nearly every right we westerners take for granted: denied education, denied custody of children, denied the right to drive an automobile, own property or vote, denied status in society and in the courts. Perhaps the only true right women there have is to live as property--as slaves--of their husbands. And we are continually told we have to tolerate this lest we be unenlightened and bigoted?Though I do not agree with everything she says within it, I want to praise the courage of Carmen Bin Laden in writing this book about her personal struggles. The story of her ordeal as person and a mother in a socially retarded nation makes for gripping reading that should anger those with any basic decency in their soul. One thing I took away from Inside The Kingdom is the sad fact that so many Saudi women seem their own worst enemies, entirely willing to accept the conditions under which they dwell. In fact, it is not merely men but women, too, who do not challenge the sheer inefficiency of their culture.I'll close with a quote from this book that demonstrates this point. This is Carmen Bin Laden writing of an experience shortly after her arrival among the Saudis. It shows how basic human instincts of kindness and compassion draw outrage in this repressed society. It is on page 120 of the hardcover edition and it says:\\"All of sudden I began noticing little things, as if society was going backward. One afternoon, I was in a supermarket when a pregnant woman fainted; her husband rushed to help her up. The mutawa were there, and they stopped him, yelling at him that he must not take his wife in his arms in public.\\"An extremely minor incident compared to the real horrors that go on in this Islamic kingdom, but it makes a small point and I ask: this is the culture we Americans, blessed with liberty, are not supposed to criticize?This is an exceptional book that anyone quick to get \\"PC\\" in defense of Islam should read. Good luck to Carmen Bin Laden. I know she made many enemies because she was a woman who dared to tell the truth about the treatment she and her daughters bore. It must be terrifying for her to think of what might happen. Heck, after what I've said in this review I think even I'LL look over my shoulder for a while. (Insert laugh...at least I think that was a joke.)"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I enjoyed Carmen Bin Laden's memoir, although it doesn't have the staying power some other memoirs may have. Still, because of the subject matter, I think it's an important read and one that can shed some light on how women are treated in this backward misogynistic Saudi culture.Wahhabism is unforgiving-- a strict and literal Koranic interpretation, and what is practiced in the country of the Bin Ladens. Carmen Bin Laden was fortunate enough to only have to spend part of her time here; she also lived in the United States and Europe.She shares with us what it is like to be a woman in such a repressive culture. The women she knew there who were raised that way didn't even question the status quo. That, in itself, would be blasphemous to do, since women are taught to believe that the way they are living is the way Allah wishes them to live. They are literally second class citizens. And, imagine what happens to men who live among themselves being taught to believe that they are superior to women in such a grand way? Well, they believe it. And, they treat \\"their women\\" more like pets than as partners. Marriage isn't considered a partnership there. How can it be when men are permitted 4 wives and the women often are not able to choose their mates or the three other women who may share their lives. In Bin Laden's book, the women accept their lives and are unquestioning regarding their state. In other memoirs I've read regarding Islamic life, some of the women do indeed question their status but they just do not have the power to try and change it.Although this book may have included detail of day to day life in Saudi Arabia, it seemed to lack some emotion regarding its horrors. The author didn't share as much how she felt so, at times, it seemed to be more of the sharing of facts rather than the sharing of her feelings regarding these facts-- which is what makes great memoirs great.Still, it's worthwhile reading and another indicator of why Islam is so incompatible with Western Civilization. We all may know by now that Islam is the fastest growing religion, but I'm not sure all of us are aware that Wahhabism is the fastest growing type of Islam in the United States and Europe. As a matter of fact, the spreading of Wahhabism in prisons is a formal agenda that is funded by the Saudis. More information regarding this can be found on the web. . . just enter wahhabism prisons and see what you come up with."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"The best part of Carmen Bin Ladin's story is her openness and honesty about herself and others, for good or bad. She not only lifts the veil and lets us see the lives of the ultra rich Saudi women she socializes with in their harem world, and how narrow, paranoid, arrogant and selfish they can become as shut-ins, deprived of intellectual stimulation and subject to the absolute power and whims of their fathers, husbands and sons, but she also lifts the veil on parts of her own heart and mind that many of us would prefer to keep private. I think she does that so that we will believe in her and what she is saying about the looming cultural crises as fundamental Wahabi Islam rapidly spreads through both the Moslem and the western world. What Carmen Bin Ladin says is not politically correct but has to be said so that western women hold on to their rare and precious freedoms and are not seduced by an extremist culture that will force them into absolute submission."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book should be required reading for women who take their freedom for granted. We truly never know just how hard life can be for women in other countries around the world. This book, written by a former wife to a Bin Laden, begins with a beautiful love story and ends in heartbreak and abandonment. The author details day-to-day life for women in Saudi Arabia with it's brutality, oppression, manipulation and boredom. The author married a Saudi because she truly believed he was different but when push came to shove he shows her that he is no better than his brothers. This is one book that you can't put down and you will never forget."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen Bin Ladin was married to one of Osama's many brothers and spent many years in the 1970s and 80s living in Saudi Arabia with her husband, Yeslam. Carmen was herself the daughter of a Swiss father and an Iranian mother.This memoire is not a fact-filled examination and dissection of Saudi or even Wahabi culture but rather a first-person view into a dark world, one that has not and most likely will not change for centuries. It saddened me to read this book - cultures are supposed to be active, to thrive, to adapt, but Saudi culture is portrayed as stilted, totally male-dominated and bereft of compassion. No wonder Ms. Bin Ladin divorced and returned to Switzerland in 1988, she feared what the invidious environment there would destroy her young daughters.There are some things I would like to have seen in this book. For one, Ms. Bin Ladin was from the very upper crust of Saudi society and had an extremely wealthy and politically influential extended family. How then did ordinary Saudis live? And where did she see Saudi society heading?I finished reading this book feeling unsettled. Ms. Bin Ladin paints an unflattering portrait of Saudi Arabia and its culture and gives us a great deal of anecdotal evidence to support our outsiders view that it is a culture with a lot of issues to grapple with. I hope more memoirs of this type are forthcoming for while Ms. Bin Ladin's one view is valuable, others will hopefully shed light on areas untouched by this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"The fact that Carmen Bin Ladin has a notorius brother-in law called Osama is a motivation to read this book.Carmen who is half Swiss and half Persian was raised in the west and, on marriage, became part of a culture she neither knew or understood.Carmen flourished in her western education and freedoms for women and determined to protect her daughters from the restriction in a Saudi society riddled with hyprocracy and contradiction. Her husband was a powerful influential man and through him, Carmen gained an intimidate knowledge of a poweerful, secretive kingdom. This was most unusual for a woman.Her unravelling of life in this Saudi kingdom is an eye opener to her struggles with a backward-looking view of religion and an education that fosters intolerance. Her struggle with the scorn for what is foreign and the non-muslim is captivating. The book really highlights Carmen's fight to be true to herself and to give her daughters priceless freedom of thought.I purchased what I thought were two different books by Carmen Bin Ladin - \\"Inside the kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia\\" and \\"The veiled Kingdom\\". The first was a hard cover and the second a paper back . However, they were the same book under different names!Dr Ken Williams"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I could not put this book down. It is an eye opening account of the opressions faced by women in Saudi Arabia. She also emphasizes the hypocrisy of wealthy Saudi men who study in the west, clearly revel in western freedoms and then return to SA to decry the western infidel. In the final chapters, Carmen includes dire warnings about the future of western freedoms we tend to take for granted as fundamental Islam spreads."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Normally I don't read biographies. Usually they focus on rags to riches stories that I can't relate to. This book was the exception.This bio starts normally: boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy and girl get married. But this is where the normality ends. Carmen marries into the Bin Ladin family,which back then were not synominous with terrorism. Carmen, who is foreign to Saudi life, is forced to live in isolation. She cannot come and go as she pleases without being completly veiled. She is forced to live in a world where women are property of the men; she is viewed as a foreigner by the other women because she was not born Saudi. Women,imagine going in a time machine from 2004 to the mid 19th century. At least that is the closest analogy I can think of.This book made me appreciate the simple freedoms that we Americans take advantage of. I couldn't imagine living a life where I felt so powerless as a woman. I admire Carmen for being strong enough to get away from Saudi Arabia once and for all. Every female should read this book. It is an eye opener how far we women have come in America."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I found this book to be very enlightening in pointing out the impasse between the western world and the Saudi way of life. Carmen's descriptions of life in Saudi Arabia mirror what I have read from Jean Sasson's books about Princess Sultana; I can't believe anyone would consider these books fiction! The experiences described in the book made me think about the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, and also lead me to be concerned over the expansion of fundamentalist Islam."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"As another reviewer commented, one should not pick up Carmen bin Ladin's book in search of literary artistry or creative style; but that's okay. These were not bin Ladin's motives for writing the book. She has a story to tell that is immensely relevant to these times, and every citizen of the world should read it, particularly my fellow Americans. In a clear and direct narrative voice, bin Ladin tells of her life as a semi-outsider in the ultra-conservative and closed society of Saudi Arabia from the 1970s through the 1990s, and of what she came to know about men and women born and raised in this culture. After reading this, the fanaticism of Muslim zealots like Osama bin Ladin is just as frightening and repugnant as ever, but no longer such an incomprehensible thing. The type of Islam practiced in Saudi Arabia, with its strict, medieval interpretation of the teachings of Mohammad, cannot help but produce these individuals. How many of us are really aware of the subtleties of Saudi culture? We know that they are very conservative and they are Muslim, and that's about it; but that's not enough for us to know, especially in light of current events. Carmen bin Ladin, in writing this book, tells not only a moving story of personal courageousness but also achieves the goal of giving the world the highly unsettling truth about an otherwise enigmatic and shielded society."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book was great. I was not an avid reader and get bored and distracted quite easily and this book kept me very entertained and I was able to finish it quickly.

In spite of wealth, it is definitely not much fun to be a woman in that society. This is the story of an attractive, intelligent young woman who was raised in Western Europe, who then met, fell in love with and married one of Bin Laden's many brothers who was also living in Western Europe. This of course happened before 9-11. At first they lived in Europe and then the US and all went well until he took her back to his home in Saudi Arabia to live. As it turns out, the Saudis are almost as repressive as the Taliban. Very revealing! I recommend it."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This Book written by Carmen Bin Ladin book should be given to every college aged woman of free societies,so they never make the mistake that Carmen did by getting involved with a Middle Eastern man! These women must be informed to avoid these men like the plague!It was sickening and infuriating to learn what hypocrites these men(especially the men) and women are, in this and other similar books. How they go to free nation's colleges,or to vacation and enjoy our freedoms,and even for our medical care.(what with all their oil wealth,they don't have decent schools or medical care,too busy spending their money building mosques to spread Islam in our countries and financing terrorism). Then return to their countries and vilify our societies! Saudi Arabia should have been on our list of terrorist nations now and for past several decades,but our government prostitutes itself for their oil!Carmen shares her love story,and how her husband was totally different from the man he became when they moved to the Kingdom so he could help in the Bin Ladin family construction business. He still was much more liberal than the normal Saudi husband and that caused hostility from the family for both of them. I believe they truly loved each other,but she became terrified of what life would be like for her and their daughters if anything should happen to her husband,and the hostile brothers-in-law would then have all say over their lives. She only came to realize this after coming to understand their culture,and their version of Islam.That was the fear that drove her to leave him. Thank God she never gave up her swiss passport,but she still had a time taking her daughters and escaping the kingdom.In many ways it was a very sad book,and a sad ending to a marriage of a loving couple.It was fascinating and enlightening to learn with her as she reveals to us what that culture is like,as she was forced to learn. The description of her marriage ceremony,with her sitting out in the limo while a male stand-in takes her place at the \\"male-only\\" marriage ceremony, is 'freaky' and makes one understand how these fanatics(many just hormone raging teens)that segregate the sexes through toddler-age,are so easily swayed to become martyrs of terrorism,being taught in Islam that they will get all those virgins in Paradise if they die a martyr in jihad!Her book was also the first account I was exposed to,telling how several Bin Ladin family members were in America on 9/11 and that even though our own planes were grounded,they were allowed to fly out!I think this book must have been very painful for her to write,and it also took much courage.I am thankful that she shared her painful eye-opening experience,as an outsider of that culture,and for her warnings to the west. Carmen God Bless You and Your Girls."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book serves two purposes for Ms. bin Ladin: getting some much need money to fight the legal battle for custody of her children and to let everyone know that not all members of Binny's family are not homicidal maniacs (er, Wahabbi observists).As insight into the House of Saud's indoctrination, hatefulness, and complicity in 9.11, the book serves little purpose (except for one explicit assertion, more on that later). Instead, I would recommend the bestseller\\"Hatred's Kingdom\\" by Dore Gold.For her self-serving goal of clearing her family (or daughter's) name, the book is very useful. Ms. Bin Ladin is about as Westernized as a Muslim can be, albeit one that is non-practicing. Living in California and Switzerland, (and even Iran prior to the mullah takeover), convinced the author of the need for basic freedoms, i.e., speech, religion, suffrage, etc.Why then did she marry a playboy Saudi, move to the kingdom, and then come back after each long vacation where she could drop the veil and other Saudi only customs. Well, for the money of course. Her husband was very wealthy, and this presented Ms. bin Ladin with a choice of incredible wealth, no rights to drive, shop etc., or leave the security this lifestyle brought. She chose to bed down with the devil.At every opportunity, the author portrays herself as a revolutionary in the Kingdom (egads, she reads!). From her walks across the street to visit other Binnys, to her Thursday night parties, Bin Ladin is convinced she is helping bring much need change to Saudi Arabia.In reality, she was a coward, a high priced call girl who sold her soul to live the high life. Bin Ladin never fails to assure us that the reason she left SA was for her children. Frankly, her words fall on deaf ears for me. For example, she says she was shocked, SHOCKED, to see her Saudi educated children write in a notebook, \\"I hate Jews.\\" Are you kidding me, Carmen? All Saudis and most Middle Easterners at the time (and many today) indoctrinate their impressionable children with propaganda and victimization rhetoric about the \\"Zionist Entitiy.\\" Of course, she soothes the reader with assurances that she told her teacher to not inculcate in her children to hate Jews and Christians.The story progresses with the failure of her marriage to a guy in desperate need of some Prozac and Valium (anxiety attacks). Ms. bin Ladin realizes that in Saudi Arabia men can instantly divorce their wives, take the children, and leave the women with no visitation (great stuff for an alleged US ally, huh?) All of her servants and haute couture can't put Humpty Dumpty together again.Sadly, bin Ladin takes a pass on discussing the Saudi/male/children issue completely. It is an amazing fact that in the 21st century, an alleged US ally does not afford women ANY rights.To her credit, she calls out both the House of Saud & the family of Binny for funding Wahabbi type madrassas and jihaders. She convincingly makes the case that it is nearly impossible to believe that both SA and Binny's crew did not know their copious donations were going to terrorists. (Just like the Jerry Lewis-like telethons were for the families of martyrs, not the martyrs themselves.)I do admire her for now having the courage to write about this misogynistic country, and its backward thinking citizens."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen Bin Laden is the ex-wife of Yeslam Bin Laden, Osama Bin Laden's older brother. After 9/11, unfortunately her and her daughter's lives were turned inside out with our \\"accurate\\" media capturing the story of how one of her daughters \\"escaped\\" from New York a few days before 9/11. When in fact she had actually graduated from Columbia University and left to her home in Switzerland in June.Carmen Bin Laden is the daughter of a Swiss man and Persian women. This gives her special insight into two different worlds. In addition, she visited and lived in America for a few years while her husband was studying at USC in California. Bin Laden starts this story out simply enough with how she meets Yeslam. They fall in love and get married. Yeslam desperately wants to live in Saudi Arabia after he graduates so they live there. When they get there, Carmen is hesitant, but her husband seems accommodating. After this, Carmen goes into detail about Saudi life, tradition, rituals, etc. This is all very fascinating. (Princess by Jean Sassoon is also a remarkable book of an actual Princess's life in Saudi Arabia).Carmen tries desperately to make her life as \\"American\\" as she can. She remodels her home, invites Europeans, Americans and other diplomats on Thursdays, has a tennis court made, etc. What I really like is the fierce love that she has for her daughters and the devotion and respect she has (had) for Yeslam. All of these things coupled with Carmen's creative ability to try and transform Saudi Arabia into a more welcoming place make her life in Saudi Arabia bearable.Of course, this book is not vivid or exceptionally written like some books are. But that's ok, this book is easy to understand, clear and concise. In my opinion, Carmen Bin Laden is intelligent (she understands different cultures and religions), brave (she writes this book to make her daughter's lives better), and devoted.

She was both sympathetic and repelled by the abysmal state of affairs in the \\"Kingdom\\" of Saud.And what a kingdom it is with royal men having 50, 60 even 100 children by numerous wives, with women covered from head to foot, with \\"marriage ceremonies\\" in which a man is substitued for a bride. The place reads like an insane asylum. Just one example - when she demanded to go to the store, it was first emptied of all men so that they would not \\"see\\" another woman.Her marriage, its failure and in particular, her daughters, are the core of the book. More and more she felt she could not subject her daughters to this non-treatment. And the hypocrisy was everywhere - when they met other Saudi couples in Europe, they dined and talked like \\"normal\\" people, yet once they were on holy ground the craziness began again.Her insights into the ultra-orthodox brand of Wahabi Islam, peculiar to Saudi Arabia and now being exported abroad, was especially informative. By the way, all practicing Muslims are fundamentalists in that they accept the Quran without question. The events of 9-11 affected Saudi society deeply - it seemed to descend into even further primitivism with women - their existence ignored - devoting their lives to religious ideas in such a way as has not existed since the convents of Medieval Europe. Hatred of the Jews, the West, foreigners, infidels (other religions) - even shunning those who offer to help - are part for the course. In the end, Carment and her daughters find freedom.

But you will learn about the author's experience in a rapidly-changing Saudi Arabia from the early 1970s onward, and her feelings about being a woman in Saudi society. 1979 was an especially pivotal year, with the hostage crisis at U.S. Embassy Tehran/Islamic Revolution in Iran, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and assassination of the U.S. Ambassador there, the storming of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, and the Shia intifada in eastern Saudi Arabia.

But, what kind of person would marry into such a world knowing what awaited her.

(Spellings of this now-infamous name vary, depending on whether one refers to an individual or the family.)That she escaped (along with two young daughters) a veiled and psychologically suffocating life in the most restrictive Islamic nation in the world, and chose to tell about it so many years later, is remarkable in itself. Even today, although legally divorced and financially independent, she alludes to living under the pressure of periodic harassment by Bin Laden clan operatives.Lured by what seemed to be true, youthful love and (at first) an extended \\"honeymoon\\" of affection, respect, and material indulgence from husband Yeslam --- whose elusive sibling is the notorious Osama --- the half-Swiss, half-Persian Carmen had fewer illusions about her new role than most Saudi outsiders. But even she didn't imagine the full impact of living in a rigidly patriarchal regime where internal family politics proved every bit as onerous as the heavy, tent-like abayas all women must wear if they dare set foot outside the home.Viewed through the often humbling lens of perfect hindsight, life in Saudi Arabia a quarter-century ago looked full of promise. Young Carmen and her equally idealistic husband lived a cosmopolitan and sophisticated life, sustained effortlessly on the abundant resources of old family wealth and the sudden influx of vast new oil revenues. In Europe and North America, they lived as Westernized jet-setters; in Saudi Arabia, they slipped through a kind of Alice-in-Wonderland looking glass, where everything was in flux, where an ancient Islamic society was struggling with seemingly opposite demands of theocracy and modernity.And for a while, as Carmen poignantly recalls through personal anecdotes and several dozen black-and-white family snapshots, it seems as if the forces of liberalization and openness were gaining the ascendant. There were more opportunities for women to study and work, more freedom of unchaperoned association, more personal autonomy in conduct and apparel. But this tantalizing taste of freedom and equality, this crack in the door of religion-based oppression, abruptly slammed shut with the Kuwait invasion and 1990 Gulf War.By then, her volatile marriage to the increasingly distant, extremist and hypochondriac Yeslam Bin Ladin had been emotionally over for some time, which made Saudi Arabia's accelerated rush back to the Middle Ages even more onerous for Carmen and daughters Wafah and Najia. With almost no genuine friendship to draw on from among the passive, materialistic and often self-absorbed wives, sisters, mistresses or daughters of the vast Bin Laden household, Carmen (while pregnant with a third daughter who would be born in Europe) orchestrated a meticulous plan of escape. Not surprisingly, many details of that plan are not divulged, except that it succeeded in giving the former abaya prisoner and her children a new lease on life in a world where women can speak, move, dress, and believe for themselves.Carmen Bin Ladin didn't start out as a feminist, social activist, author, or even a student of applied religion. But her passionate and often breathlessly told story says much about her commitment to genuine transcending love; as a mother, daughter, even (however briefly) as a wife. Just critics will find here no opportunistic infidel (of which she's been accused numerous times), nor an opponent of true Islam. She is by no means alone in contending that the Wahhabist sect that rules Saudi Arabia according to its own interpretation of Shari'a Law is in fact a perversion of the faith revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, and is in dire need of reclamation and reform. But perhaps that's the substance of another book.When I closed the cover on Carmen Bin Ladin's fast-paced but often gut-wrenching INSIDE THE KINGDOM, it didn't even matter to me that the rather sensationalist hook of the \\"Osama connection\\" never amounted to more than a name in the background, nor that she never apparently even met the alleged perpetrator of the catastrophes of September 11, 2001. Like her, all I wanted to do was rush outside into the sunshine, breathe unveiled air, and thank God/Allah for creating a world whose beauty still manages to transcend the terrible things human beings keep doing to one another.--- Reviewed by Pauline Finch (paulinefinch@rogers.com)"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It's exceptionally good."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I was lucky enough to grow up knowing an Arab, Muslim family, so I was able to see many of the positives of the culture that most Americans don't know. Not even Sept 11th made me paranoid of the Arab world or Islam. However, this insider's view of the world of Saudi ethnocentrism and fundamentalist Islam gave me food for thought.We Westerners don't usually take in the idea that anyone could truly find our culture, and in particular our religion, completely inferior, or if they do that it could matter. We are accustomed to seeing these attitudes in caricature on our evening news, comfortably removed. But Carmen Bin Laden's mother in law proudly states \\"There is not a drop of Christian blood in me,\\" showing typical Saudi disdain for all foreigners and non-believers. That also sums up the attitude of Wahabist Islam.Most telling to me was reading about the way Saudi women, in particular Bin Laden women, throw themselves into religion as an outlet for all the energy and intelligence they are not otherwise allowed to express. With no rights and no freedom of movement, they are treated like pets by their husbands and fathers. The only sure road to respect and power is through religion. In Saudi culture, there is no such thing as being too strict or religious.With fundamentalism sweeping the Islamic world, a country governed by these principles is a real possibility. The thought of these attitudes allied with a government and an army is not a comforting one.I docked the book 1 star because it was so short. With 14 years in Saudi Arabia, there must have been much more Ms. Bin Laden could tell. In that sense, it fares poorly in comparison to a similar book, Jean Sasson's Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia. THAT is a book with stories I guarantee will keep you up at night. You absolutely will not forget them.Still, the world needing reminding, and the perspective on the Bin Laden family is invaluable. Thank you, Carmen Bin Laden."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I rushed to buy this book because I lived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for 12 years. Later I wrote several books about friend of mine, a princess in Saudi Arabia. So many people (who knew nothing of Saudi) claimed that everything I knew was not true--women not allowed in neighborhood mosques, etc., among other things. Carmen's book reconfirms everything I knew about the country. It's a good thing for more and more of these stories to come out of Saudi Arabia.I only deducted one star due to the fact I really wanted more information about her life. I felt it was sparsely written and readers would have loved getting more information. There was almost nothing about Osama, but that is understandable as Carmen only saw the man once, and then for a few seconds.Still, I'm pleased about this book and happy to see it doing so well."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"A must read for all Saudi women. Unfortunately they will not read this English version. If there is an Arabic version, it can certainly change the whole country... As a professor, it is very difficult to teach courses in International Management without in-depth culture knowledge of Saudi Arabia. This book provides the insider look of its male-dominated, familty-over-expertise, royal-connection-over.... details. I would recommend it highly to all my students and business professionals."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book was so touching and revealing in its honesty. At first I went out to all my friends saying \\"every American woman should read this book,\\" but that is selling it short. Everyone should read this book, and it is so well written that there is no reason not to. I could not put it down and finished it in three days despite my busy schedule.I won't take the time to summarize the story because you can read that elsewhere. I applaud the courage of Carmen bin Laden for writing what must be a dangerous and scary tale to reveal. While she is obviously biased by her experiences, she does such a good job of telling her story as a person among other people, the pain and hearbreak as well as the love and laughter. She never claims to be telling the Saudi story, only her own. And she shows that sometimes people are torn between themselves and their world. Just as we cannot look at her and equate her with the evil using her name (bin Laden), we cannot assume this is a story beyond her frame of reference.The final chapter is a chilling warning to the world, and the US in particular. It is a chapter that is so simply told and logical that it cannot help but keep you up at night."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Inside the Kingdom garnered much favourable verbiage from the international press upon its debut: \\"Shady business dealings, power struggles...Carmen reveals the intimate secrets of the most powerful clan in Saudi Arabia\\"; \\"... makes a fiery case against the oppression and fanaticism....of Saudi society...\\"; \\"...her struggle to cope with rules and strictures as suffocating as the desert climate.\\"Perhaps the media didn't read the same book as I. In any case, the hype raised my expectations and ruined for me what otherwise might have been an interesting personal chronicle.While I don't mean to belittle Carmen bin Ladin's emotional distress or her very real concern for the safety of her daughters, this is little more than a gossipy memoir from a poor little rich girl who marries a handsome young man she barely knows and has difficulty adjusting to life with the in-laws. Her failing marriage and determination to retain custody of her children would interest no one, if not for the fact that her husband's brother is the infamous Osama bin Ladin.This book has nothing new about Saudi Arabia or the conditions under which women there live and nothing particularly revealing about Osama bin Ladin, beyond a few cameo appearances in the role of tyrannical husband. Carmen also fails to convey any sense of depth to her marriage and personal relationship with her husband, Yeslam, who comes across as a remote stick figure. Perhaps for legal reasons she is being careful.While she devotes several admiring pages to her father-in-law, the 22-times married Mohamed, the anecdotes are all second hand; he was already dead when Carmen came to Saudi Arabia.There are brief hints and glimpses into the lives of other women - her friends and sisters-in-law --but Carmen never gets below the surface. \\"Saudi women don't open their lives to each other\\", she says. A pity! It might have been a better book if they had."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I picked up this book last year after I saw an interview with Carmen Bin Ladin's daughter on a cable news channel thinking that it would be an interesting story.The book describes Carmen Bin Ladin's courtship, marriage, and (subsequent) divorce to the older brother of serial-terrorist Osama Bin Laden. Although the book is interesting in some passages, it is also predictable; it seemed obvious that Carmen would eventually leave her emotionally-crippled husband because she was a modernized women raised in Switzerland who wanted to lead her own life. The book also seemed somewhat careless, choppy, and rushed. Carmen Bin Ladin just breezed through the last few chapters so she could complete the book. It would have been a much better read if it were longer (only 206 pages total) and included more detail and insight from the author.Three stars and that is still being generous.If you're interested in reading about Saudi/Middle East culture then I recommend anything by Jean Sasson whose books are light-years more superior than Ms. Carmen Bin Ladin's."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and could relate to so much of it because I am an American living in the Middle East. I think the average reader would find it interesting, but seeing the culture up close and personal makes it more relatable. She speaks with such candor about the things that she experienced and lived with and lived thru. She was always respectful of the members of the Bin Laden family when she addressed them in the book. Never trying to belittle or demean them but share a view into their life. She just hit so many nails on the head about the way women live and are treated who are a part of this culture. I feel for her and her daughters because though they are no longer tied to the Bin Laden family legally, because of the girls birth right, they will always be Bin Ladens and the world will forever associate them to their uncle Osama and his world. Good easy read!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I just want to make clear that in Islam, women should be treated with respect. not to be held in their houses. If they need to go out somewhere, no one should stop them. It is when people start to bring their own culture and mix it with religion, that's where they go wrong. This women obviously was treated bad. But she shouldn't blame the Religion rather she should blame the culture of Saudis. I know Saudis say that 'its Islam we are practicing' but that's not Islam at all. Islam is very easy to follow its just the people who make it difficult upon themselves."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This was definitely interesting and an easy read, so I recommend taking a look if you have a spare hour or so. It told me what I already know: life in Saudi Arabia sucks for women. It kind of pounded the point home though; I think Saudi Arabia is actually the worst of the worst as far as that goes, and they don't have the economic (though flimsy) and war excuse of Afghanistan or Iran. They have no excuse. The book disgusted me with that country even more than I had been to start with, and that's saying a lot. Ms. Bin Ladin, though, I didn't feel overwhelming sympathy for. She pretty much lived there by choice. She could have just stayed in Switzerland; they went there to visit every year. That she would allow her daughters to grow up in such an environment, never mind live there herself, astounds me, especially when it was, like I say, entirely by choice. Why did she stay? I'm not sure, and I don't feel like spectulating extensively, but I guess not being able to leave your house isn't as bad when your house includes a swimming pool and tennis courts. Being married to one of the richest men in the world surely helped. I think among other things she wasn't willing to give up the money. (At one point she discusses considering buying a dress for $60,000 - to wear once!) She was Muslim and her mother Iranian, so she wasn't as morally appalled at the situation as she might have been otherwise."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book is a fascinating look at life in Saudia Arabia, specifically on how women are treated like prisoners and how hypocrisy invades Islam. I wasn't able to put the book down for long!I can only hope that all Western women (especially) read this book and decide: (1) not to date or marry Muslim men and (2) to do everything possible to keep America from being turned into an Islamic society. We should enjoy our freedom to live, to worship, and to love--and fight for it. I know I do. And if you read this book, I hope it wakes you up to the reality that Islamic fundamentalists hate us and want to take over our country."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen Bin Laden did the world a tremendous favor when she picked up this pen. As enlightening to the western world as it is engaging, I find myself recommending this work to colleagues constantly.I am not sure if the author knows how shocking to americans life in Saudi Arabia is. During the Bush years, most had no idea who these people of the desert kingdom were, other than important-looking robed arabs who liked to kiss and hold hands with Georgie.Carmen Bin Laden lays it bare. With a death sentence back in Saudi Arabia, and the most shunned name since Hitler, she boldly lands the reader in the heart of Saudi life, in the middle of one of the most influential families in the arab world. The insight is extremely unique, and such a text is a rare intellectual treat. I hope we hear more from her."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I read this with interest and, while not exactly perfectly written, it wasn't real bad, and I hold that to the professional editors anyway, especially when written by a foreigner, even one partially educated in the US. Some may argue that it was a ploy to earn money, again: so what? Her husband totally deserted his children and she was left with three to raise on her own. The thing I take most from this sad story is her concern more for the welfare of her children and with what poor future was in store for them if she remained in a hostile environment. I still wonder if her being so outspoken about Saudi Arabia is that great for her and her children's welfare. The only thing I can say concerning how bad the countries in general are, especially against the western world, is that extremist/ elitists are no better just because they have a different name, be it Christian or any other organized man-made religion. With the history of the United States concerning what they did to the Natives that lived here, slavery, televangilism, and a few other things we politely don't think or talk about, it makes me shudder every time I hear someone speak about how this \\"nation\\" was founded on Christian principles. Brother, if that is Christianity, I do not care to have anything to do with that!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Some people complain that they found a boring biography instread of depiction of secrets of Saudi kingdom. I had opposite experience : I suspected it to be meaningless book written by a shadowwriter just to make some bucks using the hype of writers last name. Actually I found the book quite interesting. The extent of misogynism described in the book is shocking beyond belief : no surprise that some societies do not treat men and women equal, but it is much harder imagine a society where some poorest kind of handyman or driver can ignore commands of (the only) wife of the billionaire they are working for, saying 'I do not take commands from women'... I do not thinks there have been many cultures in history of mankinf where lowest class males feel free to offend billionaire females because of their gender.Some paradoxes in the books : his 'evil' husband Yeslam actually looks one of the most sane and pleasant characters in the book. While the book really decribes the life of 'opressed Saudi women', I must say most of Saudi women in the book look deeply insincere and hateful gossiping imbeciles who are in part reponsible for their own misery."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I had always been very curious about the way Saudi women lived. This book sheds light into a medieval way of life where women have absolutely no rights. As the author put it herself, they are amputated of their very basic rights from the time of birth. It's truly shocking to realize that the freedom some Western women have the privilege to enjoy is not shared by many Muslim countries. To think that they feel protected by being denied their basic rights is, in my opinion, very shocking as well. Every woman should read this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"An easy read (1-2 days); one woman's informative experience with Saudi culture and her marriage into the infamous Osama bin Laden family, namely to Osama's older brother, Yesham, who lived and thrived in America, clearly with all the benefits of American citizenship and culture. Mrs. Bin Ladin (note the spelling difference-she covers this in the book), establishes a suspiciousness of something being hidden within and between Saudi and American governments in the 9-11 incident (et alii), and somewhat, if not completely controversial to what has been reported by media and government as strictly a \\"terrorist act\\". She suggests deeper political implications in this book.Family struggles, child rearing concerns for daughters with harsh social restrictions of personal freedoms, socializing (or the lack of it) and strict adherence to Islamic/Moslem religious life in Saudi Arabia is also covered, following her personal relationships/interactions within the strata of this particular family.As well, she covers some interesting historical data about historical Saudi developments and its transitions, while she also witnesses the personal side of the Bin Laden family business, yet from afar.She also describes her life as a female, entrapped with a limited existence indoors, never being allowed to partake in outside activities, or at least rarely. She compares American freedom with Saudi restrictions on females, especially in relation to her return to America with explicit intentions to raise her daughters absent of an oppressive lifestyle."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"What a fascinating inside look into the role of women in Saudi Arabia. Thank you Carmen for sharing your expereinces and opening your life to those of us who wondered what it was like for a woman in the Middle East. The honest sharing, dichotomy of lives from Western to Eastern cultures gave tremendous insite into this culture and its impact on women. This was a book I did not put down and shared with my friends. Thank you."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Ms BinLadin's book adds knowledge to my attempt at understanding Saudi culture as it relates to women. Also, Osama BinLadin. Her story of a woman raised partly, or mostly in a Western culture, then moving to an Islamic culture is mesmerizing. From her, I learned much about the BinLaden family and also Saudi ways. This book is well worth reading, although it is too short. I wish she had shared more with us. What this book provided to me was more information on how the BinLaden family was also a financial empire and how it worked. That is something I had not really understood. I am learning now."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Interesting story of what life inside Saudi arabia is like, also with one of its most influential families. Carmen and her husband Yeslam fall in love in America, but when they are married for a while they go back and live in Saudi Arabia. It shows how Islamic societies live and how they are dominated by men.Carmen has two daughters(and a third later) and because she was not from Saudi Arabia, she always felt like a foreigner in the society. Her husband and her start well in their marriage, but eventually her western values and his embracing more and more strict Islamic fundamentalist values, they come to war with each other and the marriage comes apart. In trying to provide the freedoms that she so needs for her daughters makes her very noble to me, because she went through a lot for them, but I also think she went through it for herself. The book shows how women are repressed and can not be in present with a male in society and they have to be covered fully in a man's presence. This book really made me think, and it was a good introduction to Muslim faith. It was an easy read, fast-moving book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"An amazing story - a brave woman for coming out and telling her story Excellent and a very easy read!"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I'm glad I read this book although it left me quite disturbed. Ms. Bin Ladin gives us an enlightening glimpse into elite life in Saudi Arabia. She warns us though that, &#34;America's tolerance for intolerance will be their undoing&#34;. Many of the things she warns of in regards to fundamentalists and their danger to women's rights and rights in general apply to Christian fundamentalists as well as Muslim fundamentalists. It left me thinking of how many rights have been lost and denied here already due to fundamentalism and how many more rights can be lost if we do not recognize it for what it is. Definitely thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi ArabiaVery revealing view of life as a wife and mother in Saudi Arabia.

This is a real page turner - I ended up reading it in a single sitting as I was so engrossed in her story."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"A fascinating look into the ethos of the Kingdom of Saud. Very entertaining and educational. A worthwhile read for anyone interested in Saudi Geo-Politics."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this book. What an eye opener for me. I had no idea what life is like for women living in Saudi Arabia. After listening to this book, I'm so grateful to live in this country."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This was a great book all around! It really shows the life of a well-to-do person in Saudi Arabia. I've read similar books from a perspective of people that have lived there their entire lives and were in poverty. Those stories are very hard, but this one shows the life of someone I can really identify, with lots of exposure to freedoms that is then dropped into a world very different."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Inside the Kingdom is a well-written book that flows easily, making it a fast read. It gets straight to the point with its vivid desription of Saudi Arabia and its customs without being boring or redundant. The author was married to one of the younger brothers of Osama Ben Ladin so she knows firsthand the customs of this country. After reading this book, I am appreciative more than ever of our servicemen who fight for our freedom. Freedom takes on a whole new definition after reading this book, especially for women. I thank God for our country that God has so graciously granted mercy to time and again so that we might enjoy the wonderful freedom which makes us all rich in itself.She also stresses the importance of people not losing their identity by giving in to a dominant figure whether it be spouse, parent or friend. To know oneself and to be true to that character is so important. It was a fight for her and took a lot of boldness and determination but she didn't give in to the system. I think her three daughters will always be thankful to her for that.She wanted a boy so much because there is such a high premium on males in Saudi but I believe God in his infinite wisdom did not allow her to have a boy because I don't think she would have ever been successful in taking him from the father. It is evident that the father did not care for the daughters as he would have for a son. I think the pain of losing a child and never being able to see him again would have been too much for this mother, as it would for me.If you like non-fiction and like the history and details of a country, you will certainly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"The couple meet in L.A., live in Switzerland, and then have to move to Saudi Arabia where she faces all the prohibitions and restrictions that a 7th century morality can impose on a woman. A most interesting read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"As the author Carmen relates, life in Saudi Arabia is not good. In fact, it is almost as if the men marry the women and then have them as pets for the rest of their life. A man can divorce a woman very easily. A man can marry other women if he pleases. In this male dominated society, women turn to religion for their salvation. If they don't, they face a difficult life living among their peers. Carmen Bin Laden relates the story of her nine year marriage to one of Osmana's brothers. Her husband was more liberal in his thinking than other Saudi males. However, as he gets older, he reverts to his old beliefs and there is a split in her family. Bin Laden eventually frees herself of him and raises her three daughters in Switzerland.There are several great books about the life of Arab women in Saudi Arabia and other countries. Bin Laden's is of interest because this is the richest family in Saudi Arabia with many males raised and educated in the West. Even with that, this family still treats its women with low regard. An interesting tale."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"In this book, Osama Bin Laden's sister-in-law Carmen Bin Laden gets a final word in edgewise, and it is quite a word indeed. It exposes what she describes as the crude opulence, emotionally shallow, debauched, harsh and often ignorance, overly rich Saudi royal family. According to her description, the desert kingdom drips in waste, gaudiness, opaqueness, mean-spiritedness, internecine snipping and betrayal, and is grounded in utter and base religious hypocrisy. In short, Saudi Arabia, like the Taliban, is a cult-like religiously based state -- only richer.The book is about the author's plight to save her three daughters from a life of a slow \\"death by religious constriction.\\" She succeeds in painting a graphic picture of a society that values appearances over its own pious beliefs, one still rooted in the nomadic desert tribal mentalities and still driven by primordial desert tribal fears.As one would expect, there is very little here about Osama that we did not already know: For instance, that he is a very tall, not particularly intelligent, but very pious, a very wealthy religious warrior and the \\"nth\\" son of one of the richest and most powerful construction company magnates in Saudi Arabia. During the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S supported him and his cause, and a large majority of Saudis still support his extremist views. Even in the post-911 world, he remains an iconic, a very much revered and protected religious hero in a nation where being a successful religious warrior amounts to a lot.The book shows that Osama Bin Laden and those like him do not spring, fully formed, from the desert sand. But that they are carefully nurtured by the workings of an opaque and intolerant medieval society, that, until this day remains very much closed to the outside world.In its essential outline it is not unlike Harsi Ali's \\"The Caged Virgin,\\" for it too is as much an expos&eacute; on how religion becomes a self-enforcing form of mental enslavement on women, even as it is used as the foundation for a decadent, oppressive and a rigidly inhuman social order. Saudi women never become legal adults in Saudi society. They have few meaningful legal rights. The Bin Laden women were kept shut in their homes like pets kept by their husbands. The certainty of their inferiority and subservient status is bred into their bones as it is done to blacks in America.The intelligence and energy of women in Saudi Arabia can only be expressed through religion. They live only through, and for, their faith, which as it turns out is also the primary instrument of their oppression. Yet, most lack the courage or the will to resist the oppressive social order religion imposes upon them. The result is that their personalities are completely annihilated. They become dependent for their survival on their ability to manipulate their husbands. A disobedient woman dishonors her family and can be killed legally. Yet, because Islam is their way of life, these women do not chafe at the restrictions they live under: They embrace them. It is a willing form of self-enslavement. While there is little new here, it does come with a personal touch and much passion. Four starsFour Stars"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Carmen Bin Laben's book is an insightful look at life for women in Saudi Arabia. The book provides an insider's view of life in this Arab nation beyond what the news media or other reports might disclose. Carmen narrates just how much in conflict the thoughts, traditions, and religious life of Saudi Arabia are with those held in Europe or the United States. As a male reader, the book was slow in parts because of the ongoing references to her motherhood and attachment to her children. The book also enticed the reader with a glimpse of her infamous brother-in-law, Osama, but never fully delivered any insights beyond what might be gleaned from other writing about him. Overall, a worthwhile read for understanding the life of women in this Arab nation. The reader will find Bin Laden's book of more value if they have read an Introduction to Islam prior to undertaking her story."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I'm certain there are a lot of books detailing the life of women in Saudi Arabia and doubtful this one is significantly different. That said, the book was very informative for someone who has had no exposure to how these women live or how the Saudi society operates, save for the media. It is a very fast read with simple sentence structure. None the less, it held my interest, so I do recommend it. My only criticism is the author did seem to have an agenda to point to Osama Bin Ladin as a terrorist, as well as the likelihood of the Saudi involvement in general, tying the Bin Ladin family and Saudi royalty together. Given this attention was given only in the initial and ending chapters, I was OK with it, though it did come across as a marketing ploy."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is an incredible view into the submissive lives of women in Saudi Arabia. I could help but cringe as I read how women live lives shielded from the outside world, with very little mental or visual stimulation. However, I must admit that I found myself a bit turned off at the 'holier-than-thou\\" attitude the author had when describing Saudi women. She would chastise them for not rebelling and wanting to discover more about the world, but when all that you've known has been to live in submission--acting out is an incredibly foreign concept. How can you want to read a book when all you've seen is the Koran? She also chastises them for being \\"gossipy\\", but I saw them as women starved for attention and companionship-- they don't have much to talk about except for their families and others.Instead of looking down upon them in some ways, I would have been more impressed had Carmen served to kindly educate these women on the world outside of their homes. You can clearly see how Carmen has put up a divide between her and the Saudi women, and I think this is unfortunate because she could have offered a lot."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Having lived in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for over a year I understand and remember the limitations I felt inside this \\"Magic kingdom\\". Saudi Arabia is a place where men have it very easy and women are the responsibility of their husbands and fathers/brothers.Carmen Bin Laden is a conscious writer and someone who understands the challenges of living and being married to someone in the kingdom. Recently living in the Kingdom has become much more tolerable however it is still a dictatorship and not a monarchy just as Carmen describes."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"These are confusing times. There is so much information and misinformation out there about the mid-east that's it hard to keep everything in perspective. That's why I liked Carmen Bin Ladin's book; she brings forth a slightly different view on the mid-east and on Saudi Arabia.It's a short easy read that has you wanting more, but it's also a read that's refreshing in that the author does not ask for our pity. Carmen could have spent the whole book whining and asking us to feel sorry for her. She could of sounded like a spoiled rich girl who got in over her head, but this book is not about ego. This book is mostly about fundamentalist thought in Saudi Arabia and how it is not only fueling a holy war with the west but how it is also suppressing half it's population (the female half) by imposing obscene restrictions which endanger women.Carmen Bin Ladin, like many beautiful smart women, fell for a charming attractive man who later turned against her and her children. Her husband was from a rich family in Saudi Arabia, the Bin Ladins. At first only the marriage was to take place in Saudi Arabia, but soon she is living in the country with her husband during the oil boom of the 1970's. Carmen pinpoints her troubles, all of our troubles really, to the fundamentalist movement in 1979 and the fall of Iran to radical students. As the Iranian movement spread through the Mid-east, a conservation Saudi Arabia becomes fundamentally conservative. Carmen with two little girls could see the writing on the wall. In a country where women have no rights, no say, no power...the lives of her children become threaten.Another disturbing theme that runs the course of the book is Carmen's descriptions of the Saudis. If she is right, we face a tremendous threat not from Iraq, Syria, or Iran, but from a country where arrogance reins supreme, children are taught to hate in school, and an anti-west attitude fuels aggression and terrorism. It's no fluke that her brother in law Osama, is a Saudi and I believe her when she says that when Osama dies... thousands are ready to take his place. It is an ominous sign.I recommend \\"Nine Parts of Desire : The Hidden World of Islamic Women\\" by Geraldine Brooks as a companion piece to this book. It goes into greater detail than \\"Inside the Kingdom\\" and is slightly more satisfying."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I enjoyed this book and I value her courage to speak out against such a powerful clan and kingdom. However, while the first few chapters were extremely detailed, I felt that the ending (divorce from Yeslam) was rushed and quickly summed up. Given that this event was highly built up, she could have spent more time/detail on how the marriage separation worked out. It seemed like it was and is still a huge struggle, but we were spared the details."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"What a read. I couldn't put it down. It gives a terrific insight into life in another country. You will appreciate the freedom that we, as women, have in the United States. It makes one really understand our free agency as women in America. Carmen faced so many trial that we take for granted and yet made the decision she felt best for her family. Don't miss it. We passed the book around and every one of the five women readers raved about the book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"\\"This book had me spellbound from beginning to the end. I loved this book because it sparked my curiosities and gave me the in-depth look inside the daily routines and extremely sheltered lives of women in Saudi Arabia. What drew my attention to this book was that it entailed the personal life experiences of Carmen Bin Ladin, while being married at the time to her now ex-husband, Yeslam Bin Ladin and brother of Osama Bin Ladin. What a tangled web poor Carmen fell into and was trapped for many years while married to Yeslam. In her book, Carmen describes the many layers of the required codes of conduct, both inside her home in the kingdom and outside in public, and describes the beliefs and interactions she had with the other women of the Bin Ladin clan. The Saudi Arabian lifestyle became difficult for Carmen to conform to and accept, in every aspect of her life as a wife, mother, and daughter-in-law in Saudi Arabia. Carmen, the author, describes in her book how her freedom to make her own decisions and to voice her own opinions became a privilege she desperately needed to recover, which she lost in Saudi Arabia. Her human rights of freedom became a valuable necessity for the happiness of herself and her daughters. I admire Carmen for having the strength to stay true to herself, not change her beliefs to please her husband and his family. She didn't allow her young daughters to accept the Saudi lifestyle and the nightmares she had endured. Therefore, she followed her heart and instincts by divorcing her husband Yeslam and attained full custody of her daughters. It was heartbreaking that Yeslam turned his back on his own children and cut them off financially and denied he was the father. To make matters worst, Yeslam's side of the family also turned their backs to Carmen and her daughters. This book served as an educational tool for me, because it taught me that not everything that sparkles is gold, and to be cautious of who you open your heart to because you can end up with a wolf in sheeps clothing\\"."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This is a very interesting tale from the sister-in-law of Osama Bin Laden, who was married to one of his many brothers until the mid-1990s. While the author does comment on Osama from time to time, the real interest of the book is her insider's perspective on how the Saudi Arabs behave, the women as much as the men.I found myself having a lot of compassion for people who live so bifurcated a life as the author says the Saudis do. She relates many instances of Saudi women and men behaving entirely differently when visiting Europe than they do in their daily lives in their own country. And she tells of some of her own behaviors that would seem entirely appropriate to most of us -- such as walking across the street to her sister-in-law's home -- that were scandalous for a woman to do in Saudi Arabia. Apparently, accepted practice was for a woman to be DRIVEN IN A CAR across the street, since to appear in public, even covered by a black abaya (aka chador, aka burkha), was immodest according to the Saudi's fanatically strict interpretation of Islam. These guys are so afraid of women that it would be laughable if their treatment of women weren't so criminal. And the older Saudi women are as bad as the men, forcing young women to adopt codes of behavior that reduce them to chattel property of the men in their families.And the author doesn't shy away from pointing out the role that money plays in Saudi society. Like everywhere else in the world, when money talks, everybody walks, but the incredible wealth of the Bin Ladens sets them above the inhuman strictures of Saudi society so that they were -- and presumably still are --able to escape much of the oppression that afflicts those of more modest means. One wonders how the poor survive in that society.The scariest part of the book for me -- and, trust me, there are many frightening parts -- is when the author characterizes Saudi women as pets, who are kept inside the home ALL OF THE TIME and expected to greet husbands and brothers with joy when the men deign to arrive at home and venture into the women's part of the house. (Yeah -- women live among themselves in a sort of harem arrangement.) And because they are inside all of the time, women are prone to vitamin defficiencies and other diseases brouht on by lack of fresh air, sunlight and exercise. One is reminded of animals that are kept in tiny stalls their whole lifes and used only for breeding.This stuff is truly unbelieveable, which is probably why intelligent Western women continue to be suckered into marriages with guys like Yesalem bin Ladin, to whom the author was married for many years. Who would actually think that a man who professes to love you could treat you in such a barbaric manner?Once it was clear to him that his wife was getting a divorce, Yesalem bin Ladin tried to forcibly take the author's children from Europe to Saudi Arabia, doubtless never to be seen again. Then, when he failed to do that, Yesalem bin Ladin cut his children completely off, even refusing to speak to one of his daughters during a chance encounter on a European street.There is a lot of food for thought in this book, which can be read quickly but will stay with you for a long while after you finish. The free nations of the world will do well to take seriously the challenges posed by societies such as that of Saudi Arabia."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I bought this book this morning, started it this afternoon and it is now early evening and I just finished it. I will be passing this book on to my three daughters. Carmen bin Ladin, half Swiss and half Persian, tells a love story of herself as an independent European woman falling in love with Yeslam bin Ladin, a half-brother to the infamous Osama.Carmen is accustomed to living in Europe, mainly Switzerland, and she and her husband also spend time in California. Family matters take them back to Saudi Arabia where she is always an outsider and a foreigner. Life really begins to change in 1979 when Saudi Arabia begins to turn back to the strict rules of Wahabi Islam after the overthrow of the Shah of Iran. Life for women and all females becomes even more oppressive, to put it mildly.I once worked in a bank where one of the many Saudi Princes had his accounts while attending college in Calif. His free spending habits and the arrogance of his groupies was mind-boggling. Carmen bin Ladin tells of the exhorbitant wealth of the royals and some of the decadence.The author's struggle to raise her three daughters as independent, educated thinkers and her crumbling marriage against the backdrop of the bin Ladin family is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Have you ever wondered how on earth a Western woman could marry a man from a culture that is totally alien to hers? In Inside the Kingdom, Carmen Bin Laden tells the story of how she went from being a free spirited Swiss schoolgirl to the wife of one of the members of the Saudi Arabian Bin Laden clan. It was easy. She was young, he was charming, handsome, rich and seemingly easy going. They fell in love. She thought they were going to live in America and Europe. She was wrong.Imagine living in a place where it's against the law for you to show your face in public. Imagine not being able to go shopping even for your own clothes or personal items. Imagine shocking your in-laws becuase you want to go for a walk.One of the most vivid and sad scenes from the book describes how Carmen's husband had to make special arrangements in order for her to go to a grocery store to buy baby formula. While she rushed to the baby section the customers (all male) left the store and the staff turned their backs to her.Carmen quickly discovered to her horror that listening to music was considered sinful, reading books was considered odd and having a thought in one's pretty head was seen as completely unnatural.Eventually, the marriage soured and Carmen decided to leave Saudi for the sake of her daughters. The book will attract attention of course because of the author's infamous brother-in-law, Osama (he was apparently a foreboding figure even as a young man) but it's more than a tragi-comic look into the Bin Laden home. This book is a clear eyed look at Saudi life.Carmen Bin Laden went to Saudi thinking that modernity would prevail and that in a few years Saudi women would have more rights. She was wrong then and things don't look any better now. Since Saudi Arabia is ostensibly an American ally taking an honest look at it makes sense. Can such a culture really change? Are we fools to it expect to?Inside the Kingdom is a very good book.I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"After reading Azar Nafisi's \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" and Khaled Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\" I opened Carmen Bin Ladin's book with great anticipation. I was disappointed and yet I would recommend it. It was a quick easy read, eliciting no strong emotional or intellectual response. It is however the first glimpse of this life of a woman in \\"the Kingdom\\". It was interesting in the sense a tabloid can be interesting but at it's heart does not have the power to transform or enlighten the reader. I found her depiction of her life in Saudi much less tragic than I suspect it actually was. There is no depth of character in her main players. I would have loved to have more detail about her mohter and her grandmother in Iran. I wanted to know more about her own inner life and less about shopping and being wealthy.I believe there is a rich life of emotions and loss and gain in all of her characters that we never really are allowed to see. I do not know why this book is so shallow. She seems an interesting and intelligent woman. I also ask what is the purpose of a memoir of this type. Kahaled Hosseini's life with his father in Afghanistan and later in America is deep with character struggle and growth. It is a social history as well as a personal one. The same is true of Azar Nafisi who manages to write literary criticism as well as social and political history that brought me closer to understanding what I believe Carmen Bin Laden tried to portray.I hope Carmen Bin Laden turns her hand again to a relevent social and political discussion about the life of women in fundamentalist muslim communities in Saudi, or even the experience of her life in Europe. And I hope she finds more meat and less bone to offer."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"The first Iranian and Eastern actress to be nominated for an Oscar, Shohreh Aghdashloo received the nod for Best Supporting Actress in the memorable The House of Sand and Fog. Who more suited to read this amazing true story? She performs with delicacy, understanding, and a natural ease. All of this plus Carmen bin Laden's intimate memoir, her firsthand knowledge of a woman's lot in Saudi Arabia make this a can't stop listening-to audio book.In 1974 when half-Swiss, half-Persian Carmen married Yeslam bin Laden, Osama's brother, she was a cultured woman with an international background, and she was in love. She didn't realize that with those wedding vows she was becoming part and parcel of a culture she did not know nor would she ever understand. &quot;Parcel&quot; may be an appropriate choice of words as under Saudi law a husband may divorce his wife and take her children. Carmen would find that to be true.But, suddenly, she was thrust into a place where she was confined to her home, forbidden to read anything but the Koran or to go outside without wearing a long black garment that covered her face and body. How could she raise her three daughters as she knew they should be brought up in a society such as this? What of the other women who had married into this family; what was in their hearts and minds?The marriage lasted 14 years, many of them painful. Then, in 1988, Yeslam divorced Carmen and her struggle to gain custody of her daughters began.Listen as she relates her thoughts upon hearing of the Twin Towers tragedy, and hear her warnings for the future.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book is an intelligent, page-turning treatise of the enslaving of women and other horrific dangers of Sharia law and extreme Islamic fundamentalism. I am saddened by the forced lifestyles of women and girls in so much of Saudi Arabia. I am frightened by the implications. If you want to understand the threat of the spread of this intolerant way of life to basic freedom, please read this book and give it to your friends."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"My family and I lived in Saudi in the early to mid-80s. What Carmen bin Laden wrote is factual and we experienced what she did, even as expats. I was hoping for more insight but frankly, one has to read between the lines. It was an easy read, and provides real but limited insight into the kingdom for those who know little about life in Saudi."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Ever read Atwood's \\"A Handmaid's Tail\\"? I read it three years ago, and all I could think of throughout Carmen's book, was that the Saudi society was a current version of an otherwise fantastical society created by Margaret Atwood. My nine year old daughter befriended an Egyptian girl in Northern California, and she witnessed many of these attitudes in this girl's home. My daughter strived to understand, and I'm not sure I was ever able to completely explain her friend's docility and lack of spirit in the presence of men. Her friend was literally frightened by my husband if he entered the room. When my daughter invited her over one evening to visit, the hunger she exhibited for friendship was heart-wrenching. She seemed to float on air when she said goodbye at the end of the evening, knowing she had a friend. Unfortunately, we soon moved, and I still think of her and hope she has a friend."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book is simply written yet factual, telling it like it is for women in Saudi Arabia. I had previously read Sasson's books about life for women in Saudi Arabia and it was good to see that so many of the seemingly unbelievable stories Sasson detailed were confirmed by second woman who lived in that land, so hostile to women... Sasson's books are more reader friendly and go into greater detail (a chance I believe this author missed--so many important topics were skimmed over while Sasson takes the time to explain the various situations, such as how it feels to walk around under the veil or the horror of honor killings, far too common in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, I deducted one star from this book because I think the author should have put more work into the stories. I felt the author was in a hurry to get finished with the book. Also, the publisher should have made an effort to put more facts about Saudi Arabia, so important for the reader to put into context. However, having said this, I believe that if you read this book, along with Sasson's PRINCESS TRILOGY, you will have a wide range of information regarding women's issues in Saudi Arabia. One set of books is written by a Westerner (on behalf of a princess) and this important book is written by a woman living the life of a Saudi woman, although she is not a Saudi.The question that kept going through my mind is when is this nonsense going to stop? It is time for all countries to give full freedom to all their citizens so women can began to build lives of dignity."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"\\"Inside The Kingdom\\" is Carmen Bin Ladin's auto-biographical account of her life in Saudi Arabia as a woman married to Yeslam Bin Ladin, half-brother of Osama. As an \\"insider,\\" she is able to tell many fascinating, though highly disturbing, stories about being a member of the Bin Ladin family. I have read a fair amount on the extreme restrictions of Saudi life, especially for women. But Bin Laden was able to provide many appalling details that I was not aware of. For instance, she was heavily frowned on by the other Bin Ladin's for celebrating her daughters birthdays, which is apparently considered \\"un-Islamic\\" by the religious fanatics of Saudi Arabia. She also described the women as being treated like \\"pets\\" by their husbands and suffering from numerous health problems because they were restricted from even going outside. Bin Ladin used a \\"ghostwriter\\" named Ruth Marshall to write this book. Marshall's professional skills shine through as the simple and easily readable prose, along with the astonishing facts of life within the Bin Ladin clan, make this a real page turner.However, the problem I have with this book is the person of Carmen Bin Laden herself. She can perhaps be forgiven for the foolish decision to marry Yeslam Bin Ladin in the first place because she was young, naive and in love. But what I found more disturbing is that, even while extremely oppressed and miserable in Saudi Arabia, she continued to stay married to him for 14 years. In fact, it was Yeslam who finally left her, after an argument over one of his numerous infidelities. By the way, the difficulty of \\"escaping\\" from Saudi Arabia is not an issue here, as her family spent most summers in her hometown of Geneva, Switzerland.So why did she choose to continue to stay with her husband? Perhaps the answer is that she had become so caught up in the opulent lifestyle of the extremely wealthy and powerful Bin Ladins that she wasn't willing to give it up. For example, she was surrounded by a huge staff of servants who attended to her every whim. This was a tiny expense for the the family as she believed Yeslam to be worth $300 million dollars. And this was back in the 70's! They even left as much as $500,000 laying around the house for \\"spending money,\\" which Bin Ladin clearly enjoyed using on her numerous shopping trips to Paris and elsewhere. The fact that she was willing to sacrifice her own freedom and dignity for life in a \\"gilded cage\\" speaks poorly to me of what her true priorities in life were. In fact, one of her biggest complaints about her current living situation is the low level of alimony she is receiving from her ex-husband.So, obviously, Carmen Bin Ladin is not my favorite person. But she does have an extraordinary story to tell about life in the bizzare country of Saudi Arabia with the world's most notorious family. It's worth a read."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"This book gives a good picture of what the very wealthy peole live like in the country, but it doesn't include the ordinary people. It gives no idea of what the average person in Saudi Arabia thinks and does.

This is from the outside looking in and still valuable. Though slightly bitter how can one not be?

I can only hope that the brave act of writing and publishing this book hasn't made her a target. I can only hope that today and in the future her and her daughters are safe and as happy as they can be under the circumstances. Bravery is written in every line."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"You may have noticed this book because of the name of the author. To clear it up right away: yes, Carmen bin Ladin was once related to Osama bin Laden. She was married to Osama's brother Yeslam for many years, and met Osama several times, most of which are mentioned in this book.Carmen begins and ends with a reflection on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This changed her life as it did so many others, but it also had a unique effect of putting her in a spotlight, and in \\"Inside the Kingdom\\" she uses that spotlight to light the darkness of Saudi Arabian culture and its deplorable treatment of women. As a native of Western culture and a natural-born son of the freedoms we enjoy here, I found it hard to believe, at first, that a culture still exists that supports the subjugation of women so utterly. But in reading this book, I am forced to face the hard reality...and still, I am lucky. Carmen bin Laden had to live it.In this book, you will see what she saw, delivered in honest and open terms by her words. You will see what it's like to wear the abaya, the stifling black cloth that must cover everything, even the face, in public at all times. You will feel the frustration of being unable to talk to any man in public. You will understand the fear that comes from knowing that your husband could leave you childless and penniless at any time, even have you killed with impunity for some offenses. And finally, you will see the hypocrisy of a culture which pretends to hold itself to the highest standard of piety and holiness, but in truth hides the worst of its sins away in the dark and tries to convince the rest of the world that they don't exist.Carmen bin Laden is not a great writer, frankly. She tells her story in a fairly straightforward way, with no flourishes and very little stylistic flair. This is not a book to read for style or literary talent -- it is a book to read for substance and for educating oneself. Her lack of artifice in her writing gives the reader a chance to focus more on what she is saying, and this works to the book's benefit.If you're looking to learn something about Osama bin Laden specifically, then this book may be something of a disappointment. He makes appearances here and there and is certainly a major figure in the Bin Laden clan, but he's not a big part of Carmen's story, other than as a prime example of the worst of what Saudi Arabian culture has come to represent. The Osama we see in these pages, in brief glimpses, is a zealot who cares more about his beliefs than he does about the welfare of his own children, and believes firmly in the overall authority of the male over the female in all things. But here's the thing...in this book, you will see that Osama is not unique in this, and in fact that while many Saudi Arabian men are more moderate than Osama in their beliefs, many are not. When Carmen makes the conclusion that \\"The Saudis are the Taliban, in luxury,\\" she is not exaggerating in the least.Saudi Arabian culture is one in which children, when they are schooled at all, spend a great deal of time during the school day learning about religion. They are taught that things like birthday parties and dancing are \\"haram\\" (shameful), and always, that boys have ultimate authority over girls. While reading the book I found myself angry that this culture exists, but more than that, I became angry that my culture, my government supports these injustices. There are those in the United States who make a great deal of political hay out of \\"liberating\\" the women of Afghanistan or Iraq, but when those same people are making deals with and supporting the Saudi Arabian culture the hypocrisy of our own culture also becomes clear. If we are to truly say that we fight injustice, then we must do it everywhere, among our enemies and our allies alike. Our support of Saudi Arabia and its culture of exclusion is shameful in itself.What Carmen bin Ladin did in taking her daughters and herself out of Saudi Arabia was nothing short of courageous. What she has done in writing this book is equally brave. I hope that more people will read it so that the truth is no longer hidden, so that someday, the hypocrisy will end and freedom will become the way of life for all cultures -- not through war, but through understanding. Carmen bin Laden, with this book, contributes to that understanding and contributes to the process of making things better for all."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"I found this book to be a chilling journey inside the personal life of a woman torn between love for her husband, and the life she needed to live -- a real life of meaning and value. It is so easy to understand how the young, naive Carmen was won over by her charming, rich, educated husband. I was also impressed by his ability to \\"permit\\" Carmen to live between two worlds for so many years. My major complaint about audio books is usually the reader. Shohreh Aghdashloo's reading has a spell-binding, almost unearthly beauty. Every young woman (and every young man, too) should know what Carmen learned.

But the reason for the disintegration has more to do with deeply rooted, inflexible Saudi culture than with personality issues. Their marriage and eventual distrust and hatred for each other seem to be a frightening metaphor for our own relationship with our so called allies, the Saudis. That their ancient and modern history are so recently separated and so vehemently inflexible, not to mention so different from our own as to make any understanding between us seem impossible, provides an insight that is frankly rather scary.Even if we weren't personally tied to the Saudis, for those interested in different cultures it would still be a fascinating view of another culture operating on the same planet at the same moment in time as our own, because it really is surreal.If you want a better understanding of the tightrope we walk in the middle east and how our closest allies there REALLY feel about us, read this book."},{"Title":"Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia","review":"Incredible!

I can understand how the name \\"Binladin\\"is so appealing coz people associate it immediately to Osama binladin and I believe that's what the author aimed to do when writing this book. The author lived in Saudi Arabia so many years ago and things have changed a lot ever since. 50 years ago, women were completely illiterate with exception to basic reading and writing skills. Now, most of College's students are female. Yes, we do it our own way, we have separate colleges and universities but at the end we are well educated.

Written in the first person, the author makes no attempt to be the hero of the story-line. It is a matter of fact approach to the real life adventures of a man who truly had &quot;Been there, Done that&quot; in the wilds of Africa. The author relates not only the adventures of safari, but also the mundane, and sometimes dangerous aspects of it as well. His somewhat controversial recommendations of suitable calibers for elephant hunting are backed up by hundreds of real life experiences, with sound logic, as opposed to theoretical arm-chair ballistics. I didn't want to put the book down until I had finished it."},{"Title":"Karamojo Safari","review":"I have been a professional hunter since 1994 and having worked and lived in countries like Botswana, Tanzania, Republic of the Congo, and Mozambique and having been in Bell's environment, albeit many many years later, his stories and his accounts are absolutely marvelous and it depicts an Africa that once was. His innocent comments on the natives and the abundance of wildlife is an absolute pleasure. Even more delightful, is his casual way of describing how you should go about brain shooting five bull elephant within a matter of seconds...a must for all serious hunters."},{"Title":"Karamojo Safari","review":"The old adage \\"Can't tell a book by the cover\\" certainly held true for the second of Bell's well-written accounts of hunting the African elephant. Unlike his other titles, this book covers a single year long adventure into what was then, the uncharted Karamojo region of central Africa. Bell gives a first hand account of camp life, native interactions, jungle politics and the unyielding search for premium elephant country. To quote from his descriptions of the trip, \\"this was a hunting safari, first and last\\". As a result, his writing does not suffer from the slow sections that force less experienced authors to embellish or referencing the age-old ballistic tables from the Birmingham Proof House. Soon after beginning, I understood that Bell did not act or plan on anything that didn't fit in with his goal of hunting elephants. This relentless focus at a time when there were complete regions of Africa that no European man had ventured through, enabled him to emerge in good health and spirits after bagging one hundred eighty elephant in fourteen months. Compare this to the other successful ivory hunters of the period who averaged between seventeen to twenty-five elephant per year and you begin to understand why he was considered the absolute best at his profession. Karamojo Safari is among my favorite titles for many reasons but if forced to choose one then it would have to be Bell's ability to describe the feelings and passions associated with hunting in general. Clearly, he loved hunting in Africa and this enabled him to be consistently successful. A century ago at the end of his life, it was not only Walter's ability with a rifle that what made him both rich and famous, but also his skill with the pen that has ultimately maintained his legendary status making Karamojo Safari a classic Africana title."},{"Title":"Karamojo Safari","review":"What an interesting person!

Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom","review":"In my opinion, the blastingly negative review is unfair, and the reviewer has an axe to grind.Kline neither says nor implies that eugenic ideology in the early 20th century was confined to (what this reviewer chooses to characterize) as those who are right wing. Nor does she maintain that female social activists were somehow able to transcend the social and political context that made eugenic 'solutions' (the word choice is intentional) seem attractive. Ignoring the fact that the coloration of Progressivw reform was heavily influenced by women is a serious oversight. Had the reviewer not been so interested in bashing Kline, or vilifying those who do not share his very narrow (and to my mind, rather misogynist) vision of the Good, he might have been able to keep this in mind.Before I posted this, I took the time and trouble to read through other of this reviewer's deliverances. The slant is hard to miss.Kline's book has its faults. It certainly needed editing. It also could have been shorter, and would have been more accessible if it had been, which would have been a Good Thing for a number of reasons. (Hence the dictum: never publish your dissertation unless you have a ruthless editor.)But the very negative review is unfair. The bombast does not hide the bias."},{"Title":"Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom","review":"Building a Better Race is a compelling narrative. This is an important addition to the history of eugenics, weaving together evidence from patient records, professional journals, popular magazines, manuscript collections, and eugenics tracts. It is also very well written and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Building a Better Race: Gender, Sexuality, and Eugenics from the Turn of the Century to the Baby Boom","review":"This book is a published dissertation, so it's very thick and can be a slog at times. Still, it's an informative, scholarly look at the roots of the eugenics movement that is a real eye-opener to the role eugenics has played in our culture--a more significant and fundamental role than we would like to admit."},{"Title":"Faberge at Hillwood (Hillwood collection series)","review":"This book is a must to anyone interested in Faberge art. The book is written by the chief curator at Hillwood,which is the Washington, D.C. residence of the late Marjorie Merriweather Post, cereal heiress, collector, and philanthropist. There are 53 exquisite color photos in 80 pages of text. Some photos are extreme close up of intricate detailed artworks. Mrs. Post owns two imperial Easter eggs which are also featured in this book along with elaborate boxes, silver tea service, clocks, and notebook covers. Ann Odom knows her subject well with background information and family history. This book is well worth having in your collection."},{"Title":"Koran Interpreted","review":"I'd recommend this translation only if you have one of the standard English translations - Dawood (my personal favorite), Shakir, Pickthal - because you're going to be searching for some of the more well known ayat (verses). For some reason, Arberry chose to number some of his verses differently, making it nearly useless if you use the Tafsirs for amplification. If you're discussing Islam with others, you'll need a standard of reference, and Arberry doesn't provide that. You'll need to sit with a Qur'an numbered in a common standard, make notes in the margins of your Arberry, then you can compare the verbiage of the translations. I don't regret buying this translation, but I don't recommend it because of its awkward and difficult navigation."},{"Title":"Koran Interpreted","review":"The Koran Interpreted - This author presents the Koran in a clear - concise - readable - view. I recommend a red pen and ruler when you read it - Look up God's love for man or Man's knowledge of God, etc..You can come to a better understanding of the Koran - EG"},{"Title":"The Battle of the Somme: A Topographical History","review":"This is a thoroughly researched account of the battles of the Somme, 1916. All areas fought over, and the rear lines are well covered with good descriptive accounts. What makes this book useful are the descriptions of the numerous Commonwealth War Graves which abound in the area. There is a full list of all military units which took part in the battle. Ideal for students and those who are familier with the terrible events of 1916."},{"Title":"The Battle of the Somme: A Topographical History","review":"The Editorial Review/Product Description on the page listing the \\"The Battle of the Somme: A Topographical History\\" (1996 hardcover 0750913444) incorrectly states that it is a new edition of \\"Legacy of the Somme 1916: The Battle in Fact, Film and Fiction\\" (1996, 1999: 0750911603), when in reality it is a new edition of \\"When the Barrage Lifts: A Topographical History and Commentary on the Battle of the Somme, 1916\\" first published in 1987 hardcover (0947893024) and 1990 paperback (0434292753). Both \\"Battle of the Somme\\" (488 pages) and \\"Legacy of the Somme\\" (256 pages) are by the same author, Gerald Gliddon, and publisher, but have completely different purposes and content.In the \\"Battle of the Somme\\" and \\"When the Barrage Lifts\\" the author provides a short history of each town, village and wood associated with the battle, drawing on the testimony of those who took part and including a chronology and bibliography. It is organized like an encylopedia with each topographical place listed in alphabetical order with its location and the units engaged in the events which are described based on hundreds of cited records. The \\"Battle of the Somme: A Topographical History\\" (1996 hardcover, and 1999 paperback: 0750919833) corrects occasional errors and adds some new material, including an order of battle and formations, along with 22 pages of photographs and 24 excellent maps. This book has proven a necessary addition to the library of any student of the First World War and an essential handbook for the increasing number of visitors to the battlefield."},{"Title":"A Time For Us","review":"I love all Josephine Cox books . All those English Characters and towns are so good .I love all there sayings"},{"Title":"When Skylarks Fall (Joe Box Mystery Series, Book 2)","review":"Mr. Robinson takes Joe Box, an everyday average Joe (pun intended), and makes him a hero, not by might or by some super power, but by logic and common sense. Joe is not your everyday hero, for example, Joe is a Christian, and uses his faith in his work. I read two to three books a month and I put Mr. Robinson's writing up there with any of the \\"big name\\" mystery writer's. I strongly suggest that you pick up his other books also, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"When Skylarks Fall (Joe Box Mystery Series, Book 2)","review":"When Skylarks Fall is an interesting detective type story told in first person, and done well for that style. It is second in a series (When the Last Dog Dies is 1st). I enjoyed the writing and character development in this second book. It could stand alone, as the author does explain what happened in the first book. He does this fairly effectively and without the feel of \\"on previous episodes\\" spoon feedingThe main character, Joe Box is asked to look into the case of an oddball older country music star, Kitty Clark. She is quite wealthy and has real characters surrounding her. These are interesting and seem oh so true to life. In Joe's reflective style, he ponders the case and its ramifications. There are many unusual twists and turns which I enjoyed. The plot is well laid out and the reading is smooth and easy. There is some violence, but not as graphic as in the first book When the Last Dog Dies, and I appreciated the better way the author handled the violence in this book.I would have given the book 5 stars, but I did not like \\"the start in a life threatening crisis and then backtrack and re-build to that crisis, and then go beyond it to explain it all\\" format. I would have preferred a straight plot, but that is a personal preference. I will certainly be reading the next book in the Joe Box Mystery series (To Skin a Cat)."},{"Title":"When Skylarks Fall (Joe Box Mystery Series, Book 2)","review":"Joseph Jebstuart Box is an endearing character, battered by life but not completely broken. With typical self-effacing humor, Joe labels himself a \\"low end private investigator.\\" He lives in a ratty apartment with his cat, drives an ancient Yugo, and maintains his sobriety one day at a time. When country music icon Kitty Clark hires him to investigate a stalker, Joe is shocked. How did a rich and famous singer hear of Joe Box Investigations? He's reluctant but needs the money, so agrees to her generous retainer. Our rough-around-the-edges PI soon decides he should have stayed in Cincinnati and away from Kitty Clark. His investigation leads to first a Mafia don and his son, both ruthless killers with a streak of madness, and then to revelations that could change Joe's world forever. IF he survives to tell about it. Only God's grace will get Joe out of this one intact.Joe Box is a flawed Southern gentleman, a compassionate tough guy who would make an ideal movie hero. This action thriller is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Kissing Hand","review":"A wonderful book that helped my son get through the tough times of going to pre-school and being away from Mom.
