I have already read each of the books 6 times and I can 't wait till the 3rd book comes out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Not every sequel is as good as its companion, but in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, J.K.Rowling outdoes herself! This book is a perfect sequel to the Sorcerer's Stone, with both lovable and detestable characters to enhance it. The setting of Hogwarts is colorful and fascinating. I couldn't put it down, and I can't wait for a futher installment of Harry's adventures!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It seems that everyone has now discovered Harry Potter. I continually felt that in this volume that the author tried to fill the reader in on the essential elements that might be needed if they hadn't read Sorcerer's Stone. A sequel should stand on its own without without continually retreating. Background is essential but the way it is done here creates a disjointed plot. I would have liked a clearer picture of what skills the budding wizards have mastered. I don't know what it is they are capable of doing making their behavior unpredictable. The character development seems to have stalled and this needs attention if interest in this series is going to build instead of fade. There is much about this new world that needs to be fleshed out. I loved the Sorcerer's Stone but was less enthused about the Chamber of Secrets. I hope that in the next sequel the author can create a plot that stands on its own and delves into and expands our understanding of the fantasy world she has created. Right now I don't believe she really has more than the bare framework settled in her own mind. I am willing to wait, if need be, for her to figure it out before she presents us with her next effort."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is definatly funnier than the first book.

I am seven years old and loved this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"We started to read this to a 7-year old, who also loved the first Harry Potter book, but we had to stop because of the intensity of the adventure. The age guidelines, 9-12, seem appropriate, but you have to know your child's capacity for excitement, fantasy and for being scared. The humor is wonderful and we continue to laugh at some of the passwords, situations and characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My teacher read our class the first Harry Potter book.

I was seriously creeped out in the last few chapters! It also leads U 2 bealive da wrong thing.

I was enchanted then but with the onset of the movie franchise of the series my book memories became tinted, if not overwritten, by memories of the movies. After recently deciding to read through all the books anew, I've been enchanted all over again it seems. JKR cleverly injects different plot points into the story that weave through it again and again, in this book (and in subsequent books in the series). I feel transported back to my childhood again, when magic really did exist, in my imagination."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think it's amazing because it has a great imagination and is so addictive. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves magic. Also an example of why it is addictive can come from me because I would sneakily read this book at night when everybody is asleep.

So far Harry has had a weird experience. A house elf named Dobby has warned Harry not to go back to Hogwarts because danger will strike but Harry doesn't listen. Strange things have been happening at Hogwarts. Students have been getting paralyzed by a mysterious creature. Suddenly when Harry, Ron, and Hermione are searching for it, disaster strikes. Soon they find out about the Chamber of Secrets and they must save someone they care about before it's too late.Don't judge this book because it's amazing. I love this book because it keeps you guessing with every page. It's so full of detail you can't put it down and they're lots of twists and turns that surprise you. I also enjoy the unique characters, like Fred and George who are practically waiting for trouble. Also like Professor Lockhart who is really full of himself. So if you want to get caught up in a world of magic and suspense then I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I can see why these charming stories are so popular.

Rowling illustrates the people in her books with brilliant words. You seem to think that the world she writes about exists, and that maybe you, any day would get a letter to become a student at Hogwarts! For any person, young or old, this would be an excellent gift!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This exciting book tells about Harry's second year at Hogwart's. Harry finds a diary and figures out how to talk to snakes. Harry has to go fight off Tom Riddle, the person who owns the diary, to save Linny, Ron's little sister. It's a great action book, packed with comedy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was unsure if I would like this book being that it was aimed toward children. I was so wrong. I couldn't read fast enough. I was totally enthralled from the very beginning. It had action, suspense and it took you on a totally wild adventure out of the mundane. I loved the trials and tribulations Harry Potter had to go through. From living with a family who despised him to learning that he was a powerful wizard. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys fiction, even if you are an adult!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book so much-- it was my favorite out of the 3 published so far. I think that it was the best because it is so suspenseful with the monster. Also it was humorous and had very good characterization. The only fault I think J.K. Rowling has is that she tends to use names instead of personal pronouns too much-- for example, &quot;she had HERMIONE in a headlock and HERMIONE was whimpering in pain&quot; and &quot;'Thanks, SEAMUS'&quot; Harry said while watching SEAMUS pile ketchup on his sausages&quot;. Has anyone else noticed this? Anyway, I think this is an excellent read for someone who likes action, humor, and excitement."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Many people wouldn't recall Bobby Brewster, maybe I made him up, but if my memory serves me right he was the Harry Potter of 20 or so years ago and I loved him. I know I should have outgrown this stage by now but JK Rowling is a truly excellent writer. Cliche as it may sound I couldn't leave The Chamber of Horrors down (maybe there was a spell on it! ). Its so imaginative, funny and almost believable. The different courses they study - Herbology, The Dark ages, Potions - who would have thought of them. It must have been so difficult to write such an unpredictable book with little twists and turns all over the place. If my 8 year old nephew doesn't hurry up and finish the third one, well suffice to say you can imagine which one of us is the bigger. Please tell me there are plans for a fourth..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm an average 15 year old boy, and even though this a book recommended for pre-teen children, I still thoroughly enjoyed the book. I was entranced by all three books because of the wild characters, dialogue, and plots. I went through all three books currently in print in under a week, and I don't usually read more than two books a year. So, anybody who wants to read a few good books and who wants to give their imagination a treat, I would say the Harry Potter books are for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's that time again! He's back and so is trouble. Someone has opened up the chamber of secrets and something is turning Mudbloods (people with one unmagical parent and one magical parent) to stone!

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Going from mysteries to adventures this exciting book is the one to read. I recommend this book to almost everyone. So be sure to read this fantastic book and find out of Hagrid uses magic when he's not suppose to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am not exactly an avid reader, and I was actually bribed into reading the first installment by my mom. To my surprise... it was amazing. I couldn't ask anything more in a book. It's hard to resist all of the characters' charms, the writing is outstanding, and the creativity is top notch. I HIGHLY recommend the entire series to ANYONE, of any age. Now, I'm gettin' my friends to read 'em!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You can't imagine how much this author can slip you in to this fantasy world. In my mid forties, I bought this book to read to my two boys, ages 5 and 7. While they love to hear the next chapter each night, I was smitten with this book and found myself reading it without them so that I could keep going, going, going. This little (boy) man is so courageous, passionate, compassionate, brilliant and composed. The story weaves in and out and the clues abound. You keep trying to figure it out, but you can't! Then it all makes sense at the end and you don't find it one bit trite! A creative masterpiece."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets was better than the first. And it DOESN'T promote witchcraft. And for all those kids out there who can't read it beacause their parents won't let you, I feel awfuly sorry for you. As for the parents, you need to lighten up a little. I'm eleven years old and belive me, I did not at all feel that the book was promting anything. IT'S JUST A BOOK! Kids aren't going to go out and learn about witchcraft beacause of something they read in a book! And I do not feel like they were going too over the edge with the murdering. What about all that violence and horrorwe see on televistion everyday. That doesn't even compare to the 'violence' and 'horror' in these three books ment for children aged 8-13. I hope you see the light and let your children read the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Mary from the USA claims that J.K. Rowling's works are imaginative, but in a negative aspect because it's &quot;violent&quot;. Well, I'll like to tell her: my little brother of nine just finished reading &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (believe him, he's smarter than you think, frankly), and he simply adores this magical book series even more, having completed, also, Rowling's tour de force in the first book of her series. Yet he doesn't comment on anything violent in either stories, and I supportingly second him! I've just read &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkhaban&quot;, up to the point where Mary commented (&quot;the wizard killing thirteen people while laughing menacingly&quot;), and I seriously think that it's unreasonable of her to talk about Rowling's writings as such! I'm sure you can see that I'm an avid fan of hers, but I'm not biased in this literary world - Rowling's merely writing stories for the pleasure of, mainly, young kids! You think any old story on violence would be approved for the enjoyment of those 9 and above? Besides, read how the wizard proceeds to &quot;killing&quot; his victims - through MAGIC! What, the next thing you know you see your toddler waving a wand and shouting &quot;Alabahoo!&quot;? PLEASE! I think Rowling's a wonderful author - decent and purely talented in creative imagination! In fact, I'd say of all her books I've read so far, this one (&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;) has the most mystifying, curious and funniest plot. Well done, Miss Rowling! Good luck on your future works! I'm certainly looking forward to them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Here is a sequel I was afraid wouldn't stand up to the original. Well, Iwas wrong. In his second year at Hogwarts, young wizard Harry Potter meetsnew challenges as a student, as a friend, and of course, as a hero unawareof his greatness. New and colorful characters appear, like the flamboyantProfessor Lockhart. Rowling's story continues a lovely parable that pitsthe lifestyle of wizarding folk against non-wizards, the muggles. Thecomparison is between living one's life passionately and heroically versusliving a normal life by the book.Since the unfortunate events of last September 11th, I think Harry Potter offers children and adults alike a wayto answer the question: how do I live my life fully and make a difference to others? If this is a question you find yourself asking, read all the Potter books as well as a beautiful little book by Ariel and Shya Kane called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK.\\" The Kanes' book is a clear and simple guide to living a magical life. I recommend these books because they have touched me. They demonstrate that we can all be wizards in our own right."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Once I read the first book, I was so excited about this one. All of the characters are now drawn out, and you get to learn what they do. I opened the book, excited already, and read it through to the end. I could not find one boring sentence, everything was there that needed to be there, and the emotions were there too. I was on the edge of my seat, heart racing through most of the book, happiness on part of it, and sympathy through the rest of it. A beautifully AMAZING BOOK! Worth every single penny of the price, and much more. A truly well written book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a GREAT book! I got it after reading the first one, and it totally surprised me. Also,I don't think these three books should be banned from school's just because they talk about &quot;witch craft&quot; because they really don't. It's like saying all S.S. textbooks should be banned because they might mention God. But it's a great book, and definatly worth reading"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I could not put this book down! It is by far the best book in the series and the best book I have ever read. I reccomend it for ages above 7 (I tried reading it to my little brother, he did not get it at all)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is just plain embarrassing. Although the UK publishers changed the cover of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers'/Philosophers' Stone so that (us) adults could read it without it being Too Obvious that we were reading a book in the 9-12 age group, the Chamber of Secrets still has the cover for children. Yet I couldn't put it down and it made me laugh numerous times - it is so inventive! Comparing the two books, I would say that this 'sequel' is, fortunately, that rare form of sequel - as good or perhaps even very slightly better than the original. The moment I returned from the UK, it was nigh on snatched from my hands, and no more was seen of my 12 year old daughter for the day or so that it took her to finish it. Had it been a weekend, she would probably have read it even more quickly. Joanne Rowling has created a classic.(...)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is my favorite one. So dark, so cool, so funny, so magical. And no, this is not just some half-a^*ed franchise like Goosebumps, these books realllllly are classics."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"No words I write can justify the unrivaled imagination of Rowling. The second book is as good or better than the first in the series. It's Harrys second year at Howarts School and his adventures this year are no less riviting than those of his first year, aided of course by his two best friends Ron and Hermione. I just can't wait for the next in the series. Keep them coming, Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I haven't exactly been the biggest harry potter fan ever, but I got the first two books for Christmas in 1999. The stories were great(if long). They let you escape into a strange and different world. This second book is quite memorable, because it's a wonderful mystery. What happens, is Hogwarts students are being turned into stone. They say it's the heir of Slytherian. Who could it be? We get to find out about Hagrid's past which I wouldn't tell to those who haven't read the books. It's got so much. Ghosts, a flying car, an attacking tree, mysterious writing, a secret diary, and even a village of spiders. Sorry if I gave too much away. Everything comes together when the mystery is solved!! That's why it's so good!! But this book had one big fault,(which is why I gave it 4 stars). You see, the ending, though adventureous, was quite voilent. I hear the Harry Potter movie's coming now. I might see it, but if the second one has theatrical release, I might because of the voilent ending. I haven't read #3 or #4 in the series, but I hope I will. So, please read this book. It is quite worthwhile."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Being the Harry Potter Maniac I am, I rushed out to the store and bought the second book right after I had finished the first one. I was slightly disappointed when I read it though. I feel that J.K.R. could have done a better job as this book isn't, in my opinion, as good as the first one.It's really creative, however, I didn't like the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Gilderoy Lockhart is a bumbling idiot. Although I found him extremely funny, I prefer it when DADA teachers play a bigger role. Like Quirrel and Moody being evil. I liked Lupin because he's a Marauder, and my favorite at that. Lockhart is just a person in the book who doesn't have an effect on the ending.Dobby is one of the funniest characters! The little houseelf that thinks he's helping but isn't really just cracks me up. House elfs are a bit over exaggerated in this book however. Getting Harry stuck with the Dursleys was the perfect way to get him back to the Burrow without plainly stating it. In a way, Dobby did help Harry, but not in a way that he had intended to.I think the ending was the worst out of all the books. It wasn't as action packed and it didn't end with Harry passing out. I won't say anymore because I might tell you exactly what happens.Even though the Chamber of Secrets isn't my favorite, I still like it. There are other books that you could buy. If you don't like Harry Potter or you are just starting the series, I suggest reading another book, such as the Prisoner of Azkaban. However, if you've read the first book and liked it, definitely read this book so you can read the third book. I don't suggest skipping around as it leaves holes in the story plot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is my FAVORITE book of my FAVORITE series(I guess that makes it my favorite book)and I don't understand why this is rated 4 1/2 stars, when all the others are 5.

The mysterious Chamber of Secrets is a mystery that Harry and his friends must resolve or it could mean the end of Hogwarts! Harry faces incredible dangers in this books from the very beginning, and experiences a whole host of new characters including a troublesome house elf, a magical bird and a moaning ghost that haunts the girls restroom. A wonderful tale wrapped around a setting for great childhood adventure that only J.K. Rowling could spin. You will marvel at this author's imaginative story and her ability to capture you as a reader driving you to cheer for Harry as he really gets into and out of the most incredible situations a young wizard could ever dream of! This series is very enjoyable, and spans a whole generation of readers young and old alike. There is something for everyone within this exciting series of Harry Potter. You will be captured and find yourself eagerly reading every book. Fantastic fun! Entertainment at its best!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"First things first. You folks might want to read this beacuase this is a rarity...a good sequel. In fact, a sequel which is better than the original. This one has far more characters, more details about the existing characters and about how things have come to be as they are, with more details about Harry's past and Hogwart's history. This book has a far better plot(if there can be such a thing), a more darker story and a better plot twist. Basically its all about Harry's 2nd year at Hogwarts and how it seems to appear that someone or something is out to get him. It is about how Harry and his plucky friends Hermione and Ron get into and out of trouble..and it has more Quidditch. It must be said that the best bit about this series of books is that the entire story is like one big jigsaw puzzle and though the individual pieces may not make sense when viewed individually, at the end everything falls delightfully into place. In fact so into place, that one is tempted to read certain portions of the book again just after finishing the book the first time, just for the satisfaction of having understood how everything fits in. Please do not miss this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There's nothing left to add to the barrage of words written about these wonderful books. So let me just add a few regarding the audio versions, which strangely, are more easily available on Amazon than in my local bookstores. I can't imagine that reading the books is a better intellectual or emotional experience: Jim Dale's performance is pitch-perfect. Each character is so fully realized that the tapes sound more like one-man shows than book readings. I listen to audiobooks during a relatively long commute and I judge them by my unwillingness to get out of the car before the end of a chapter. The Harry Potter audio series is worth a few otherwise pointless trips around the block.

I can't wait until she comes out with more of the Harry Potter books. I don't agree with the age group, however. My english teacher, mom, dad and all my 13-14 year old friends have read it, too. I suggest everyone who's interested in magical,adventurous mysteries read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry was living with the Durseleys and when ever he would say the word &quot;magic&quot; Petunia and Veron would yell at him .

Rowling has an easy-going style that stands out. The books are inventive and entertaining. This one is actually my favorite of the three, possibly because it was the first one I read (and admittedly, possible because of the slightly -- emphasis on SLIGHTLY -- macabre ending.And a note for other readers: I have heard many fans of the fantasy genre express frustration with the series, simply because it is not the best example of fantasy on the market. To those (and to anyone else who loves the books): I agree that Rowling has not yet matched Tolkien or Lewis. But think of these books not as a literary dead end -- consider it as an introduction to greater and more complex works. That, in the end, is the greatest value of the Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"it is the best book ever. i think adults and children should read it. it is certainly a good book for everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is back again! After nearly dyeing in J.K Rowlings first Harry Potter book, the sorcerers stone, he is eager to come back to Hogwarts school of wizardry and witchcraft, to see his friends, and to get away from the Dursleys . Harry Potter is a spunky 12 year old wizard who is famous among other wizards because when he was a baby, he barely survived Voldemort/he-who-must-not-be-named. His mother died, he was very fortunate to escape with only a scar shaped like a lightning bolt on his forehead. (This scar is what makes him so distinct and special). In the first book of the Harry Potter series, Harry survived Voldemort/he-who-must-not-be-named again, so now Voldemort will do anything to get him back in this sequel. By going back to Hogwarts for his second year, he is taking a high risk. If you liked the first on, you will love this one! I would recomend Harry Potter for all ages who have a wild spirited imagination. There is nothing not to love about this famous twelve year old wizard. When I read Harry Potter, I felt like I was actually there helping him save Hogwarts from the evil Voldemort. I don't know how Rowling does it, but however she does, she does a good job of it! You will see what I mean after you read this fabulous book about an average ordinary adventure-loving wizard. I can't wait till I read the 3rd book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This series was bought for my 11 year old daughter and we had discussions about it for days. For Christmas she received a set of audio tapes of Book 1 (Harry Potter and the Sourcer's Stone) which I listened to on a long distance drive. I confess, I am hooked on this delightful series. Upon my return, I read the remaining two books in the same amount of days.Any writing(s) that encourage children and adults to read is to be blessed in this day and age. Buy these charming books for your children, but make sure to take the time to enjoy this read as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have so far read the first two book's in the Harry Potter series. They are magnificently whimsical and fun, and are superb reading for young and old alike. I would recommend these books to ANYONE. I heard so many great things from other people about Rowling's books, I had to see for myself...And they are truly wonderful. The many adventures of Harry and his young magician friends are reminiscent of Roald Dahl's classic children's book writings, and have a charm that no one can resist! I should also mention that the illustrations are gorgeous and are a testament to the quality of these books. Cheers to Harry Potter and his friends, and for Ms.Rowling for bringing another light into the world of young adult literature! These books transcend what is dubbed 'young adult literature' through their charm and wit, and become something that everyone can enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hello and welcome to my reveiw , have you read my other reveiw\`s , I wrote about the 3rd Harry Potter book.

There is a monster of some sort on the loose, and a lot of people think Harry is the one trying to kill everyone or petrify them. Harry hears strange noises coming from inside the wall.

Read the book.-the second in a sequel, you might want to read the first one first"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, by J.K. Rowling is clearly one of the biggest page turners of the year.I thoroughly enjoyed this new novel of magic and wizardry. While there is an excellent plot line and meaning in the story, The Chamber of Secrets was hardly a difficult book to read. However, personally I don't think that this affected the quality of the story too much and as a result, it was still a great book. Far and away the best quality to The Chamber of Secrets was the highly entertaining story line. Harry Potter, obviously enough, is the comical main character. He is always finding himself in trouble but this helps keep the excitement going. When Harry was only a todler, he survived the wrath of an evil dark wizard. How this occurred is a big mystery. As a result, Harry is an extremely famous aspiring wizard. The main issue in the story pertains to the mysterious student who has been petrifying other students and may be conspirating with the same dark wizard whom Harry had already faced. Rowling does an excellent job in The Chamber of Secrets of completely surprising the reader with a spectacular ending and making sure that the story is very interesting through the entire span of this novel. I would recommend this story to anyone looking for a good story about mischief, magic, and mayhem."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished reading this to my 7 year old. She loved it so much she has started reading it herself for up to 3 hours at a time! The story is adventurous enough to captivate children, and the characters in the school are indentifiable as personalities they may know.My only complaints are that the Muggle family with whom Harry lives goes a little over the top on cruelty. The ending was a bit contrived, more so than her other two books. Furthermore, I feel it was rather unneccessary to turn an annoying character into an evil one.However, it builds nicely on loose ends in the first book and leads into the third rather well. It seems to be the weakest of the three published so far, but the standard characters remain enjoyable and are developed nicely. I would recommend this for most children and a few adults as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the Harry Potter books. Once I started reading them I couldn't stop. Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets has a lot of suspense in it and I just love suspense. Harry Potter No.2 is as good as any of the others. I've read No.1 &amp; No.2 and I'm reading No.3. If all the books are good then No.2 is good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although everyone seemed to love this book, and gave five stars, I beg to differ. While the book was well thought out and clearly very imaginative, it is, on the whole, a pure self-indulgence read. I happen to think that a five-star book should change its readers and their ways of looking at the world, and touch its readers deep into the heart. A five-star also feels as a completely different, new book every time one reads it. This book, while thoroughly enjoyable and worth reading, does not do that, and remains, therfore, a fairy tale without much point. However, if one wishes to simply have himself a good, enjoyable, light read, this book is highly recommendable. To sum it up, it is a delightful children's book, good for reading once."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was very good but I found that the best part, the ending, wasn't as good as the 1st. But, I recomend getting this book after reading the 1st so that you can get onto the rest of the series! I'm reading the 3rd now and the 4rth has just come out so I can't wait to get that. Oh, I am 11 years old and I think that magical books are the best for kids to read because it gets our imaginations soaring! So don't listen to the other people who say that magical books are bad."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I recently finished the Chamber of Secrets after egarly reading the Sorcerers Stone and it was simply wonderful! I don't know how she does it, but J.K. Rowling gives this book an appeal for people of all ages, and I'm glad she did. This is a book that makes people WANT to read and LOVE doing it! Keep up the great work! Did I mention it was one of my 3 favorite books, well now I did. This one, along with Sorcerers Stone and Prisnor of Azkaban are my favorite books hands down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love these books. I am 38 years old and am reading them so my son, who is 8, would get interested. He is now on book 3 and loves them too! You just do not want to put them down! I am holding off on getting the 4th book until my son is ready - but I honestly cannot wait to get it. The longer the story, the better we like it!

The Book has the same magic as the first one, this is both a relief and an invitation to continue reading the series with the same enjoyment and infatuation."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second I closed book one of this series which I loved (check my review there), I opened this one. I was very curious to find out how Mrs. Rowling will manage not to repeat herself and how she will cope with the fact that the material will not be as fresh anymore. And to my great delight, after finishing the novel, I have to say that she succeeded brillantly in this! And that even though she kept the same structure as in the first novel (Harry with the Dursleys, Harry taking the trip to Hogwarts, Harry at Hogwarts, a plot coming up, the plot thickens and ends in a grand finale)! Her constant struggle not to repeat herself is clearly visible and she comes up with so many new ideas and so many new twists and turns that this book is at least as enjoyable as the first one. I consider it to be even a bit better than the first one because it is even more complex (and maybe even too complex for smaller children), she places many hints during the course of the story and ties up all the loose ends in the end in a way that only a good story-teller can. This woman knows how to construct and structure a novel in a professional way which is astounding for someone who just pubilshed her second novel. And, off course, it is deeply gratifying to meet again all the characters that you have met and began to love in the first novel. If you, like me, read this novel immediately after the first one, you might be annoyed that she explains everything that you know from the first novel again, but you have to agree that it is a great help for people who read this novel first or read the two novels with a considerable distance of time. And still: Some things you will not understand if you haven't read the first one. Again, I had no choice but to award this novel five stars. After closing this book, I immediately picked up book three, so check my review there if you're interested if it is as good as this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read the first 4 Harry Potter books at this point, and while this one would not be ranked as my favorite, it still is well worth 5 stars. Certainly you need to read this before continuing on to books 3 and 4! But this book did not have quite the novelty of the first book, the wonderful characters of the third, or the great plot developments of the fourth. It just sort of falls between all of them on these counts, giving us an interesting plot, further development of the main characters and a few things we will see again in later books. But the book is still certainly engrossing and a fun read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I didn't wade through all 1500+ reviews below, but I waded pretty far and didn't find a single one that mentioned a theme that leaped out of the 2nd Harry Potter book for me: prejudice. A recurring topic in this book is &quot;who is better than whom&quot; with a lot of talk about bloodlines and purity. Malfoy is revealed to be a &quot;pureblood&quot;, that is both his mother and father are wizards, while Hermione is branded a &quot;mudblood&quot; because both her mother and father are Muggles. Argus Filch is found to be a 'squib', a person descended from wizards who somehow managed to avoid getting a drop of magic in his blood. There are spirited discussions about the fact that blood does not matter; Hermione, a mudblood, is obviously a superb witch, while Neville Longbottom, a pureblood, is a fairly hapless wizard. The children raised in wizard families (Malfoy and the Weasleys) have very strong opinions about and reactions to this topic, while Harry and Hermione, raised by Muggles and ignorant of these prejudices, have no immediate reaction to the controversy aside from confusion.All of this represents a fascinating way to present the topic of race prejudice to children. Ms. Rowling should be applauded for not simplifying the topic and for burying in the story well enough so that most readers are distracted by the plot. I hope that, in spite of the camoflage, many readers, particularly younger ones, get the message.As if the above subtext weren't enough, Ms. Rowling also takes on the topic of narcissism in the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, a publicity guzzling wizard who can't get enough of his own image and is shamelessly self-promoting. Early on it becomes obvious that Lockharts abilities do not match his reports of his abilities. Also instructive is Lockhart (and Malfoy's) assumption that Harry wants to capitalize on his fame. Harry, of course, is repulsed by the entire idea.Finally, Harry's innocence about the 'blood' topic and about abuse of his fame begins to make me see that Rowling has drawn (perhaps unconsciously) some elements from the legends of Arthur and the Round Table. Lockhart is mentioned as being a member of the 'order of Merlin', but in the broader sense the wizard-pupils in this series are also presented as knights-in-training. The Quidditch game serves as the analog to jousting and other athletic/military exercises. Harry in his innocence and his ignorance of this past resembles a young Arthur, especially as represented by T.H. White in _A Once and Future King_. Dumbledore has so far resembled Merlin (although far more competent than White's Merlin). But Rowling is not making much of this reference yet. I will be interested to see if she borrows more from the Arthur legend in future books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Some say Chamber of Secrets is the weakest of the four Potter books.Yes, the incident in it is &quot;minor&quot; compared to other Potter books, than say, the third or fourth. But the plot is tightly woven up. It doesn't ramble, like the third or fourth. And the first time you read it, face it, it's a lot scarier than the others. Why? Because students are being stunned --frozen in time-- left and right. Roosters are dying, GHOSTS are practically dying.Meanwhile, excellent points are being brought up.In the second (might have some spoilers here), Harry finds out that Voldemort transferred some his own powers when he gave Harry the scar. That means that besides speaking Parseltongue, Harry probably has some of Voldemort's strenth and &quot;brilliancy.&quot;Notice, too, that this is the first book where Harry truly realizes Professor Dumbledore's store of knowledge and how much Dumbledore believes in him when no one else will. Only after this book does Harry start asking for Dumbledore's help. I'd also like to note that Dumbledore was transfiguration teacher before principal, and when Dumbledore was gone, McGonagall, the current transfiguration teacher, became principal. Transfiguration teacher must be pretty powerful and high up on the hierchical ladder.From this book on, Voldemort knows Harry's own past --his performance in school, his personality, his attitude. From this book on, Voldemort has a decided advantage over Harry.Chamber of Secrets reveals the past --Hagrid's, Tom Riddle's, even Dumbledore's. Many people don't like this book as much because there's not as much &quot;ambiguity&quot; as some of the others. But I don't think it's meant to be that. I think it's meant to be a sort-of-background of the past."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am hopelessy overtaken when I open up a book of Harry Potter! I must say that I liked this one even better than the first, and I hope that the series conitnues in this path. There are more moments of magic, mystery, and excitement to be found once again. It is nice to open up the book and see that you are returning to Harrys life that you came to know so well in the first. I like the further development of the beloved characters, and there is never a dull minute while reading this second book. I highly reccomend this book if you fell in love with the first one! Great read for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In the 2nd installment of Rowling's popular series, Harry finds himself back at Hogwarts, despite a houseelf named Dobby and his uncle, who forbids him to visit the school again. Harry thrives again in the familiar walls of Hogwarts, but a mysterious person/thing is attacking the \\"mudbloods\\" at Hogwarts! When it comes to the possibility of Harry's haven being closed down, he takes action--especially when Hermoine Granger is attacked.I recently reread all the books in the series (well, I'm on the 4th one) and this was the first time I had read the 2nd one in probably 3 or more years, since I lost my first copy. I found it, at times, incredibly boring and it was hard to read every word. Maybe it was because I've seen the movie so many times (although that didn't happen when I read the 1st one), or maybe it was just my preference. Whatever it was, I think that the 1st, 3rd and 4th ones are better.One thing positive..it was hella better than the 5th one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very scary, exciting, and action-packed. It is very scary when Moaning Mortal tells Harry and Ron how she died. There is also a part when Nearly Headless Nick almost takes his whole head off. I think this book is very exciting because Harry and Ron find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. I think this book is action-packed because there are lots of parts where Harry fights bad guys."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling is a book put together with the use of the literary device of irony. It is said that Rowling puts together an excellent book thorough the use of the device of irony. Much of the book would have to be written differently if irony was not included.For instance throughout the book students at Hogwarts are petrified due to the sight of the \\"monster\\", later known as the basilisk, hidden in the chamber of secrets. Almost every time this takes place Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter are found at the scene first. Also it just happened to work out that the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart is a fake and can't perform magic. Therefore Ron and Harry have to step up and take the lead in finding Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who was captured by Tom Riddle.Although irony made it possible for every thing to work in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it is said that there is too much. Everything in the book keeps happening because Harry, Ron, and Hermione happen to be there. Then it is argued as mentioned before the book would not have been able to flow with out the literary device. So all in all Rowling's book was made possible because of irony."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is about Harry going back to Hogwarts.And there is a snack that is petrfiing muggie born people, and the snake is in contol of young Lord Voldomort or Tom Riddle.And Harry is trying to save Jenny from Tom.And he was about to get eaten, and then he killed the snake, and a few minites later he killed Tom.Then saved Jenny, and the whole school!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is about a boy who came from a wizard school and the family he stays with treats him bad and they locked up his wand and broom even his owl.When harrys family found out he could not use magic they locked him in his room,but then his friend Ron saves him.Harry told Ron about a warning he resceved from a houseelf the warning was not to go back to school because he is in danger Harry and Ron suspect it could be the plot from Harry's rival Lucius Maifoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This review is about Harry and his friends going on another great adventure.Harry is yet again back at his Aunt and Uncle's house and things aren't looking too good for him.

Coming fast on the heels of the first Harry Potter adventure, this second tome is more rounder, introducing new characters and new, darker situations for Harry to overcome. In this book we are introduced to Dobby the house-elf, Lucius Malfoy, Ginny and Mr. Weasley, and the incomparable Gilderoy Lockhart. All these characters (with the exception of Lockhart) are now vital parts of the Potter stories' tapestry with their own important roles.This book is substantially darker than the first book, with much more dangerous situations. The Whomping Willow may be whimsical to some, but it's the first situation where Harry could be seriously hurt, if not killed. The diary is a dangerous prop, and the subplot of Ginny being possessed by Voldemort is no laughing matter. Harry gets seriously hurt in this book: his elbow is broken during a Quidditch match and through a mistake, his bones are removed. The climax in the chamber of secrets is highly exciting, and Harry is again almost killed at the hands of the Basilisk.This second book showcased Rowling's intentions to write a serious series where she doesn't rewrite the same story twice, lest seven times. Harry and the kids gets older in the books, maturing with their age and handling their problems with ease, whether it's with homework or with saving the wizarding world from evil. Another winning read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"never would i have believed that j. k. rowling could possibly have written a sequel to \\"the philosopher's stone\\" that equalled it in terms of originality and suspense. the truth is that \\"the chamber of secrets\\" is even better than her first book! the fact that its target audience is children does not make me embarrassed to say that this genuinely is one of the best books i have read in a long time.if your first impressions are that it isn't quite as good as its predecessor, keep reading! the first few chapters are setting the stage for the forthcoming events, and believe me, it's worth the wait!what makes this book so outstandingly excellent is its absolutely brilliant plot. harry is now in his second year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry, although he and ron had a bit of trouble getting there as they missed the hogwarts express for some mysterious reason.once again, j. k. rowling conjures up some wonderful characters, such as gilderoy lockhart, a very good-looking, glory-seeking wizard (\\"five times winner of witch weekly's most-charming-smile award\\"), who manages to get the job as defence against the dark arts master at hogwarts, and whose unabashed vanity and groundless bravado provide a lot of the book's humour.the first sign that there is trouble looming is when harry starts to hear a sinister voice threatening terrible deeds, although he can't see who's speaking and no one else can hear it. shortly after, the caretaker's cat, mrs norris, is found hanging from a nail on the wall underneath some puzzling but undoubtedly menacing words.i will resist a terribly strong urge to reveal any more because it really would spoil what is an ingenious plot. you will find yourself wondering whether the chamber of secrets really does exist at all and who on earth the heir of slytherin could possibly be. and i bet you any dooyoo miles you like that you won't be able to guess!!It's a much scarier book than the first, I thought, and I did actually wonder from time to time whether children would be too frightened by it. (There again, I used to get scared watching Dramarama Spooky, so maybe I'm not the best judge).But I cannot rate it highly enough for the clever gradual build-up of suspense, the mysterious (magical?) power that prevents you putting the book down, the wealth of imagination and originality in the ways of life in the wizard world (e.g. Floo Powder - brilliant!), and of course the ultimate breathtaking finale.I think you've got the message, so I'll now leave you with some wise words from Albus Dumbledore that I thought were a nice little message to us all:\\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities\\".So true, Dumbledore, so true."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter book #2, was wriiten with a darker plot than the first book of the Harry Potter series.In the 2nd book you are able lern more about the charaters and thier personallaty's, you also lern more about the diffrerent culters and background'sof the magical world.I give Harry Potter #2 by J.K. Rowling a four star becuse of the problems in the story,I belive the certian problems could be a little more elaborate.Thank You."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Gilderoy Lockheart is the character you love to hate! He is so full of himself, that I'm surprised he can even get out of bed.He spends every waking moment telling everyone how good he is.Of course, Harry, Ron and Hermione have to bail him out in the end, but hey, no one's perfect!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I mean, after all, what's not to love! I usually shy away from reading \\"what everyone's reading\\", but am I glad I made an exception to pick up the first HP book--and have not stoped reading and rereading them yet! Well written for adults and older shildren alike (I fight with my 11 and 13 year olds for reading rights) its great reading, period!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"First of all, I am only comparing this book against the first three. I have not yet read Goblet of Fire (Book 4) as I am waiting for paperback.Second of all, a brief note on who I am. I am a 23-year-old guy, your average working guy, computer geek, metalhead who usually has no time or tolerance for children's stories and thus I never considered Harry Potter anything more than a passing fad. Then a guy loaned me the movie (I was not about to pay to see it, even though I had to admit it looked decent) and since then I have seen it seven times and read the first two books twice. I am going through \\"Azkaban\\" for the second time around. Now I love it - the whole series and the movies.If there was any flaw in the first Harry Potter book, it might be that it was too short to take place across an entire year. Chamber of Secrets is longer and while it is only 341 pages, it does not move too quickly. Rather, at the end it feels too short, but any child will tell you that's what the last day of school feels like, which I think was the point.Author J.K. Rowling takes a lot of typical children (Harry being the likeable nerd, Ron being the typical boy, Hermione being the know-it-all girl, Draco being the bully, Ginny being the shy girl and Neville being the slow guy that only the hero really has compassion for) that almost anyone can relate to at least one of them and places them in a world that nobody can relate to, and subtly describes the world in such detail with so few (but effective) words that you can just see it.Chamber of Secrets was not only longer than Sorcerer's Stone, but it was more in depth. It was much funnier (Hermione's feelings for Professor Lockhart), had more adventure (the whole bit about the Weasley's car), and the ending was more complicated yet made much more sense.Snape, Hagrid, and Dumbledore, who were all very unique characters in every way, all offer us more insight into their mysterious lives. The rivalry between Potter and Malfoy is heated and heated some more. And two new characters Dobby and Professor Lockhart, are absolutely hillarious.I would reccomend this book (and the whole series) to anyone who enjoyed movies such as Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory, The Never Ending Story, and Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a great book, and now i am obsessed. I always go on about Gryffindor, etc. The book has some creepy characters, like Snape. I think it is a must read for anyone with an imagination. So if your looking for a book, this is for you"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Many people around me, my sister, my friends, and even my teachers read Harry Potter series, and suggested for me to read it. I've already read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and it was a very amusing book. I have also heard that many people thought that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the weakest book of all four. But I enjoyed it as much as the first one. I don't read scary books and also boring stories. This book, Harry Potter and Chamber of Secrets, dragged me to the world of fantasy, where witches were real and brooms were really flying. I liked reading this book, and I am planning to read also the third book.Hogwarts is a school for Witchcraft and Wizardry and is divided into four main groups, Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. They were four names of people who found Hogwarts. Harry and his friends, Ron, and Hermione were in Gryffindor. After running away with Ron and his brothers to Ron's house, they left to Hogwarts. It was basically about some bad strikes that Petrified many students of Hogwarts, from Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Gilderoy Lock hart is a famous author who used Memory Charms to clear someone's memory...Many liked him, but he was very immoral and Harry didn't like him. Colin Creevey was a first year student at Hogwarts and he was so fascinated to meet Harry, he took pictures whenever he saw Harry. Harry was on Quidditch team. Quidditch was a sport which players on brooms are supposed to hit the Bludger over to the goal at the two ends of the fields. Harry was a seeker, which he has to find a Golden Snitch and it marks the end of the game. Crazy Bludger, as if it was on spell hit Harry and Harry fell right after he caught the Snitch. His arms were hurting and smug Lockhart degenerated the situation by making Harry's bones disappeared and Harry was sent to Hospital Wing. During the time at Hogwarts, he heard some weird noises. Then the people at Hogwarts heard about the opened Chamber of Secrets and were scared. They knew it was Slytherin Heir, but didn't know who. Their suspect was Draco. With Polyjuice Potion, at Moaning Myrtle's \\"out of order\\" bathroom, they transferred themselves into people in Slytherin during the Christmas break...Through the diary Harry found, When Chamber of Secrets was opened 500years ago, Tom Riddle suspected Hagrid, Harry's friend now, and Hagrid was expelled. Hermione was soon petrified as few others, and by following spiders, Hagrid's friends, Harry found out Hagrid didn't open the Chamber of Secrets. When Harry and Ron went to visit Hermione at Hospital Wing, they found a note. It was about Basilisk, type of snake, which have deadly stare and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. That solved the question...Then, they saw Hermione's writing that said pipes. Soon, Harry realized it was snakes going through the pipes hissing that Harry had heard, since Harry was parseltongue. After the other teachers asked Lockhart to go and save the Hogwarts for them, Ron and Harry found Lockhart trying to escape. Then, they took Lockhart to the bathroom to go trough the pipes...My favorite part of the book was when Harry was facing Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort once again. Voldemort's power would have been much stronger, but I think Harry was being smart...Harry was very brave, but I kind of knew that he was going to win someway, since he beat Voldemort when he was a baby, and when Harry was at Hogwarts as a first year students. I think the most interesting about this author, J.K. Rawlings, is that she made up many unique names and had many uncommon ideas which people wouldn't really think of, even though I didn't mention in this book review. There were names of Nearly Headless Nick, Dobby, Professor McGonagall, Pomfrey, Gringotts (harry potter1), and many more. I think she's a really good author. I can tell by the way she wrote the series of books, Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting and fitting sequel to Book I. Although some parts of the 1st book have been mentioned again (i.e. background on the Dursleys, how Harry ended up at Hogwarts,etc.), it didn't stop me from reading. The development of the plot and the characters is like going up a ladder, taking the reader on a new level in every chapter. If in Book 1 I felt Harry's emotions, here in Book 2 I ended up caring for Harry and his friends. JK Rowling has (again) brillantly put together a story that has everything in it: adventure, magic, humor, mystery but never failing to emphasize on compassion, courage, self-sacrifice, loyalty and true friendship. And though I found some of the characters annoying and ridiculous (Lockhart, Colin Creevey & Dobby), they nevertheless paved the way to bring out Harry's best qualities. While Lockhart prided himself with his fame, charm and good looks, Harry has proven himself humble and not at all hungry for fame and publicity. Dobby, the house-elf who tried to keep Harry away from Hogwarts failed because of Harry's determination to go back, and was even more determined to stay upon learning of the threat against the lives of the Muggle-borns. The events that happened to Harry and his friends has proven once again that Harry is not just a wizard, but also a compassionate and self-sacrificing individual who will go to great lengths in saving another person's life. And although he was suspected to be the Heir of Slytherin (because he is a 'parseltongue'), it nevertheless showed that his inherent goodness has the power to outweigh whatever qualities Voldemort passed on to him on their first encounter where he ended up with the lightning scar.The combination of Harry, Ron & Hermione is like forming a dream team. In Book 2, all three characters had their moment to shine, and their friendship has grown stronger. Ron has proven himself a caring and supportive friend to Harry. Aware of Harry's plight with the Dursleys, he 'rescued' Harry with the help of his brothers, brought Harry to their home and treated him (Harry) as a part of their family. And at Hogwarts, Ron never left Harry's side, and despite his abhorrence with spiders, he still went out with Harry in following the spiders' trail in the hope of solving the mystery that was lurking inside the Hogwarts castle. And who could forget Ron's reaction when Draco Malfoy insulted Hermione by calling her a 'mudblood'? That is true friendship indeed! Hermione, on the other hand, provided the 'brains' in the team. Her intelligence, combined with Harry's courage and Ron's oftentimes funny taste for adventure, plus their common desire to search for the truth makes them the kind of team any league would like to have.Book 2 has also given us a mirror image of what we see in society today - from the rich and abusive (the Malfoys) to the struggling but compassionate (Harry & the Weasleys). Above all, it gives us a lesson that has been told and retold many, many times : that evil, in whatever form it takes will never overcome what is good. Harry is a model of bravery, compassion and loyalty which I hope we can still find in the Muggle world.Once again, my congratulations to Ms. JK Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry,Ron, and Hermoine are at their second year at Hogwarts.So many good adventures in each chapter!The great author J.K. Rowling has put together a masterpiece of humer and thrills.... My favorite chapter is \\"The writing on the wall\\".I am very sorry for Ms. Norris and I think that the way the chapter is writen is great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I strongly encourage you to get caught up in the Harry Potter frenzy! But if you are just \\"browsing\\" and deciding, be sure to read Book 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) first. While J. K. Rowling does an good job of trying to catch anyone up who doesn't know the background, the books were just meant to be read in order. Each book builds on the previous book really well. The characters continue to develop and the stories, while unique and individual, all tie together. So there are some wonderful reviews below to tell you more about this specific book, but I thought it was important to point out that they should be read in order. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Everyone at Hogwarts knows the legend of the Chamber of Secrets, but mysterious occurences have led this school of Witchcraft and Wizadry to believe that this legendry is actually history.Halfway through summer, Harry Potter has had enough of the Dursleys, and is ready to go back to Hogwarts. Just as the summer is ending, Harry receives a warning from a house Elf called Dobby not to go back to Hogwarts. Harry ignores this warning and goes to Hogwarts anyway. Once there, Harry is grateful to be back, and lives the life of a typical wizard. One thing not so typical is that students and animals are being petrified by an unknown being, and Harry is getting the blame. Wanting to prove his innocence and stop the attacks once and for all, Harry fights his arch-enemy Lord Voldemort and defeats him once again.This book was very intriguing. I was hooked after only a few pages and read it to the end after three days. I liked this book because it was full of mystery and adventure, and some parts in the book were pretty scary. I think my favorite part about this book is how J.K. Rowling (the author) came up with such a magical and wonderful world.My favorite part in this book was when Harry defeated Lord Voldemort's younger self by destroying the diary in which he had entrapped his soul. See, when he was sixteen, he preserved his body in the diary. When a little girl named Ginny Weasley opened the diary, she made contact with Voldemort. To destroy Voldemort, you must first destroy the diary. Harry destoys this diary by taking the severed fang of a huge snake and impaling the heart of the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second, and in my opinion best, novel in the fantasy/fiction series of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As you all probably know Harry Potter is a young boy with an extraordinary life, in the muggle world at least. Harry is a wizard, unlike his aunt and uncle with whom he lives. Harry has inherited his wizarding skills from his late parents who died at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry grew up knowing very little about his parents or his magical past and how he had been named, \\"the downfall of Lord Voldemort.\\" During the first book Harry finds out he is a wizard, and is faced with battling the remains of Lord Voldemort.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts with Harry receiving a visit from a house elf warning him against going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry ignores the warnings and after a few minor obstacles, he finds himself back at Hogwarts for yet another year.The school year seems to be going great, with the addition of a new defense against the dark arts teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. However, messages have started to appear written on the walls, walls in which Harry is hearing voices from. It seems that yet again the chamber of secrets has been opened, and by the heir of Slytherin. Even though Harry is a Gryffindor, students, and some teachers, suspect he is the culprit. If the messages on the walls aren't threatening enough the fact that students are being petrified surely is.Throughout all of the Harry Potter Books J.K. Rowling has created this wonderful fantasy world of wizardry, with the readers being able to really relate to the characters, and possibly learn from their struggles and triumphs. Not only does Rowling create such a positive and inspiring group of characters, but she does so in a way unlike many authors, that I can not even try to explain.So it seems Rowling has made Harry's second year at Hogwarts yet again difficult for him. From a deathday party, to a living diary, and a giant talking spider, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good read. Whether Harry is the true heir to Slytherin or not, I'm not going to say, so I recommend you go out and read it this book to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that the Harry Potter books are great. Some parents are insane to think that their child is going to fly out the window on a broomstick. If your child is between the ages of eight through adult, then he/she should know the difference between reality and fiction. If he/she doesn't then they shouldn't read the books. I think it is great to get your child to read three-hundred page books. Why should a child miss out on a great book just because of the cover of a book. Hopefully parents should read the book themselves and see what their child is missing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that this book is awesome.

Her children were reading and listing to the series, and the talents of Jim Dahl as narrator are superb. I have all the books on audio, but the first four are on cassette and I thought it a good time to upgrade to CD since cassette players have become obsolete. I ordered this on CD and it arrived as cassette tapes - she had no way to play them for her family and ended up buying an adaptor for her car because they were ready to listen to that book. I received permission to return, but since I didn't have them in my possession until last month, and very busy schedules for both of us, the time to return them expired.

The first book was great and you couldn't think it could get better than the Chamber of Secrets came out and astonished each person to read the Harry Potter book. The character description is so meticulous that you know exactly what the characters look like. I didn't even like reading much until I read this book. I heard about the Harry Potter books and I decided to read the first chapter and I got trapped I couldn't set the book down.

'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' defintely live up to its predecessor! JK Rowling is obviously one of the top authors out there right now, if not the best. She is most defintely my favorite author right now! Rowling produces another sweeping magical adventure in this second installment of the hit series. The same wit, humor, description, suspense, and magic is still there. I'm guessing that it will always be there after reading the fourth book and discovering it to be even better than the previous three.The plot is great in this one! I really love how the whole storyline has matured and become darker and more mysterious, generally becoming more fit for teenagers and adults. Children can still enjoy the Harry Potter books, but adults and teenagers will simply love the new maturity in Rowling's writing!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read many books and I must say that the first two books by JK Rowling have kept me enthralled as no book ever has.

I just had too many other books to read on my list. Anyway, I'm glad I decided to read this one. The one thing about Harry Potter is that you (the reader) escape to a fantasy world filled with magical fun. I love how the books end with key morals to the story, too. There are definite messages that we must live by. The last 4 or 5 chapters in this sequel really keep one on edge for 'what happens next'! I understand HP &amp; The Sorcerers' Stone (Philosophers' Stone), the movie, is released on Nov. 19, 2001 here in the U.S. Warner Brothers quickly starts filming the sequel (Chamber of Secrets) in Nov. 2001 for fear of the stars getting older--haha. I can't wait to see the movie...from the character still photos I saw in the Vanity Fair Oct. 2001 issue it will be Magical Fun...and relatively close to the book storyline so we (Potter Reading Fans) shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is hands down the most brilliant book in the Harry Potter series. It's darker and scarier than the first book and that's what makes it so interesting. The books, they have me addicted to them. J.K. Rowling is also one of the best and creative authors out there. May the fifth book top this one in my list."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It took me about four or five chapters to fully get into this book as opposed to the first in the series.

Now it's on to The Prisoner of Azkaban!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"'Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrets' is the second book in the seven part series of stories concerning a young wizard (Potter), and his life at Hogwarts School of Wizardry, where he learns about his heritage, and continues to grow into a decent young man of magic. He is once again accompanied by his best friends, Ron and Hermione, and all the familiar wizard professors are back to scold the students for &quot;breaking the rules&quot;. The story is very much a mystery, as someone (or something) has re-opened the dreaded Chamber of Secrets, and evil is afoot. It's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to get to the bottom of things and uncover the culprit, before Hogwarts is closed forever.Though it may be unfair to do so, I can't help but compare this book to the first in the series, 'The Sorcerer's Stone'. I was somewhat sedate concerning the array of characters in this book, compared to the last one. Perhaps that is because most of the characters were returning ones, and the ones who *were* new were usually bad guys (or creatures). The mystery kept me intrigued until the rather convoluted revelation at the end, which explained too much for its own good. Upon the book's end, looking back, there were some parts of the plot which didn't quite make as much sense as they should, and even some characters (and scenes) which seemed unneccessary.All that said, the story was still *very* enthralling, was written well, and had me captivated from beginning to end. I love the world which J.K. Rowling has created, and look forward to visiting it again. We should have more writers as talented as her."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Genre: Fantasy/FictionThree Sentence Summary: Back to school Harry goes, leaving the Dursleys, Harry thinks everything is going great, until something horrible happens at Hogwarts and Harry knows he has to fix it. Ginny Weasley, the younger sister of Ron, and youngest in the Weasleys, finally goes to Hogwarts, but is captured by an unescapable creature, and a whole myster to solve unfolds. Harry knows he has to do something, for Ginny's sake, but what?What I Liked Most About The Book: Its more \\"out of the ordinary\\" than most books i've read and its one of the only books i've actually followed along with.What I Didn't Like and Why: There wasnt anything I didn't like, but if I had to choose, I would say that I don't like the character Malfoy, not something J.K. Rowling did wrong, i just dont like how he acts, which is obvious because all books have a character like that.My Favorite Character and Why: My favorite character would have to be Harry, he always knows the most and conquers the enemy no matter how big it is.The Scene, Line, or Passage That Meant Something To Me and Why (Page#): \\"You're not..., Not the greatest sorcerer in the world, sorry to dissapoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore.\\" I thought it was very brave of of him to sand up to someone that had almost killed him before. P. 314What I Would Say About This Book To Someone Else: It is a good book, but to understand it, you might want to read the first one, Harry Potter And The Sorcerers Stone.One Question I Have After Reading This Book: Why doesn't Harry run away from the Dursleys, if he's treated like garbage and he doesn't like them, why not run away.My Strongest Reason For Recommending This Book: It is very fictional, but follows an excellent story line, Harry has a more exciting year than the first, and Harry meets Lord Voldemort face to face."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wow I was really impressed with this book I think it was alot better than book one.

The first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, let you hanging at the end and it made you want to read the next book. And that's what I just did. This second book finished the ending to the first and I thought was a lot better than the first. This book is so interesting and well written that I found myself reading this book in two days. I am not the type who likes to read a lot, but this book was so excellent and well written that I saw the story being played in my head like a movie. It was in impossible to put it down. I have to say that my favorite part of the book was the climax where Harry enters the Chamber of Secrets. He fights enormous serpent snake, which they call the Basilisk that was under control of a dark wizard. Could it be possible for a young boy to kill and survive this horrible creature? I don't want to spoil the ending to some of the people who haven't read it yet.

However, there comes a snag in his plans: the Dursleys forbid him to ride the Hogwarts Express to school. No matter; Ron drives him to school in their flying car- but the car doesn't actually make it. It flies into a Whomping Willow and is totaled. Fortunately, Harry and Ron make it there on time for the beginning-of-term feast... and what a surprise: Ron's younger sister, Ginny, is beginning her first year at Hogwarts (thus making her an \\"ickle firstie\\" in the terms of the school poltergeist, Peeves).Through the novel, Harry's friendship grows with Ron and Hermione... and with Ginny, who has fallen head-over-heels in love with Harry. The best scene in the book: definitely when Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets and eventually saves Ginny (and fights an extremely large snake/serpent known as the basilisk). Overall, a 100,000/100. Very good, very good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first Harry Potter adventure was definitely a breath of fresh air, but if it stood alone it wouldn't have the lasting impact that it has today. The close of the story was definitely open-ended and left you with the impression that there should be more. The Chamber of Secrets picks up where the first left off and really pushes it into high gear.The story begins where Harry gets a mysterious warning not to return to Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft. Harry of course ignores this and starts into his second year of schooling. Everything you can imagine starts to go wrong and Harry begins to realize the validity of the warning.On Halloween night, a message written in blood is found on a wall in Hogwarts, claiming that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. This starts yet another mystery for Harry and his friends, while they attempt to further their studies of wizardry. Eventually they come to realize that an ancient terror is stalking the hallways of the school.It's been a long time since I've cared this much for fictional characters. The old favorites are back: the logical Hermione, the poor but proud Ron Weasley, the slimy professor Snape, and of course the humble hero, Harry. Plenty of new exciting personalities and places are also added to the mix. J.K. Rowling kept what was right about the first and vastly improved on it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book is good. I liked it because it was interesting. It had lots of adventures and mysteries. They had to find a secret chamber, only the heir of Slytherin knew how to open it. They also had to beat Slytherin at Quidditch. Quidditch is a rough game on a broom in the rain, sun, or a blizzard. There were mysteries they had to figure out to save a friend from going in to Azkaban for a long time. They had to prove him innocent by following the spiders that would give him some answers to there questions. They also had to prove Harry didn't do the attacks on all the muggle born that were attacked by something else. They had to figure how a big monster was getting around they found it was using the pipes in the castle. They also wanted to find who was behind all these attacks so they made a potion to turn them into a couple of Slytherins to find out if a Slytherin did it. I won't tell you the whole story so this is were I stop."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This story is about a little wizard \\" Harry Potter\\" with the second year in Hagwarts School for wizardry and witchcraft.

This second book in the J.K. Rowling series is a must read! Not only do the main characters Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger set out to solve a new problem but, they realize that somebody has opened the Chamber of Secrets. Through trial and error our heroes search for clues to save one of their friends. Again Harry must put his life in danger to save others who are important to him. J.K. Rowling has introduced us to some new characters in book two. We meet a magical elf, Dobby, a new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart and finally Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who joins the famous trio. I liked this book because it was a true page turner. As the reader you can search for possible clues along with Harry, Ron and Hermione. I would recommend this book to anyone. J.K. Rowling did an excellent job on this book because it's exciting and full of adventure. I have learned from this book that life is full of tough challenges and problems. No matter how hard it is you have to be brave and trust in yourself to do the right thing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was written by J.K.Rowling. This story falls under the fantasy genre, because witches and wizards are usually considered fantasy. This story has new charaters and Harry has many more problems to face like before.Harry Potter is in his second year of Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is warned by a house-elf named Dobby not to return to Hogwarts, because he would be in great danger. Ignoring Dobby's warning Harry escapes his aunt and uncle's house to the Weasley's house with Ron and his two brothers, in a flying car. When Harry arrives back to school, strange things start to happen. People are becoming petrified, and no-one knows what is doing it. Harry keeps hearing a voice..a voice which seems to be coming from within the walls. Harry learns about the Chamber of Secrets and it turns out that he is a Parsel-tongue. This means that he is able to speak and understand snakes. When everyone suspects that it is Harry, the trio then set out to find the culprit and find out more than they bargained for: the diary of Tom Riddle, why Hagrid was expelled and what the Chamber of Secrets is and why is it so feared in Hogwarts.Although many adults read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I think that children would be more attracted to this book. I would definitely recommend this book to any and everyone who enjoys a good fantasy book. Having seen the movie before reading the book I was somewhat aware of what was going to happen next. I found myself comparing and contrasting the book and the movie. Even though the book was far more exciting and longer than the movie. Now I see why Harry Potter is so loved by many."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the chamber of secret is the second book of the Harry Potter series. And compare it to the first book, this one is much better. This book described what does a young wizard do in his second year. Harry Potter like the last book also met the Lord Voldmort. But this time it's the memory of the Dark Wizard magically written in a diary. And this book write why is he trying to find out what is the chamber of secret. And then it described how they find it and also in the end how Harry have battle the servant of the Dark Wizand and encounter many dangers. After read this book, I can't wait until I read the next book which is the Harry Potter and the Prizoner from the Azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Makes a page-turner until the end. Who is opening the Chamber of Secrets and what is causing the people to become statues of their former selves. A little longer but still a great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is one of the best books I have every read because it is very exciting. The main characters (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) are role models because of all the things that they do that helps people at Hogwarts. This book is also very exciting because of all their adventures. This is a great book and people should read it especially if adventure is what you like."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was enjoyable, but it was a little slow in how it finally present the clues to discover the final showdown, I think it gives the good lesson in good things are worth waiting for. I didn't like how the characters were acting like total incompetents in seeking help and basically acting like airheads, but I guess that should be expected at 12 years old and only second years.For a small summary: see the movie!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Chamber of Secrets is a very good read. I have read numerous reviews on how this book is the worst in the series. To tell you the truth there is no worst book in this entire series so far.Chamber basic theme to me is showing how much Voldermort and Harry are alike and how people who are not pure wizards are treated.Chamber is the shortest book in the series so far, but is very rich in details. JK wanted to name this book The Half Blood Prince, which now is the name of the 6th book. In my opinion there is a lot more going in this book than we realize at this time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"lots of twist you never see coming, I can't help but enjoy her work. its just what you expect since the last book, lifted up a notch. Just watching the movie, though I myself am impressed with how true to the story they have kept, doesn't give you all the explicit details and thoughts of the characters as this does, so read it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling manages to make the second book in her Harry Potter series just as interesting and creative as the first.The novel begins with some useful background information for those whose memorie may have gone fuzzy since reading the last book. Harry is enduring the summer with the Dursleys when he is visited by the house elf Dobby, who gets him into even more trouble with the Dursleys, and warns him not to go back to Hogwarts. Harry is rescued from his punishment of being locked in his room by Ron and his trickster brothers Fred and George in a flying car.Back at Hogwarts, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the vain and incabable Gilderoy Lockheart. He is the least of Harry's worries, however, when students start turning up petrified at Hogwarts. Rumors circulate that the culprit is the one who opened up the Chamber of Secrets. As fear on the Hogwarts campus increases, Harry and his friends set out to find out the truth about the Chamber of Secrets.In this book, Harry discovers a little more about his past, and we are also shown more character devolopment and fascinating glimpses into the wizarding world.This book, like the last, is a page turner, and a very satisfying read. My only complaint is the character of Dobby, whom I wanted to kick by the end of the novel, but then again, maybe that's the point. The ending of the novel wraps the plot up nicely, but still leaves readers longing for more stories about Harry and all the other characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A well done sequal it's not as good as the original but still is entertaining for begging to end.Full of suspence and mystery makes this a good read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets written by J.K.

I learned that lots of fiction books can be excellent and adventurous. My favorite part in the story was when Ron and Harry started to catch up to the Hogwarts 9 and 3/4 train going to the castle of Hogwarts. I think you should read this book, trust me you will definitely enjoy this book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets... if you enjoy very exciting books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was better than the first. And the first was pretty good. We see Harry's powers growing faster as he learns more about magic at Hogwarts and himself. Filled with humor, mystery, drama, suspense, and some young puppy dog crushes, this book has it all. Every character in the book is brought to life and the details behind each character provide enough background to make the story fit like a perfect puzzle. Rowling is an amazing writer and had me guessing to the very end. And there were more twists and turns than a country back road. This book is for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets for an English project and it was awesome.This book starts out with Harry living with his Aunt and Uncle untiol Hogwarts is in session.

It was easier to read much more descriptive and the storyline was much better and easier to follow. I understood the lingo better and the characters were easily recognizable. If I had to change anything it would be to Hagrid, he comes across as a bonehead. He should have a more central theme in the storyline and a better closer relationship with Harry Potter. I also don't feel that Harry should go back to his aunt and uncle, he should stay with Hagrid, or with Ron's family. His aunt and uncle , that whole thing is a bit too much.Overall, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was very pleased with the creative ideas theauthor used to support the development of her storyline, as she did in the first book. This book hadgood continuity with the first book. I felt that thisbook lacked the creative imagination that the Sorcerer'sStone displayed, and had difficulty completing the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

It was made by the first Slytherin, so only the heir of Slytherin knows how to open & find the hidden chamber.

Will Harry & his friends find out who the attacker is? Will they find the hidden chamber?

After seeing the movie and loving it, I read the first. And after that, I was hooked.I decided to read \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\" I found it to be even better than the first one. It's filled with suspense, humor, twists, and surprises. The story is so creative and imaginative, and allows you to escape from reality for a bit.It is now Harry's second year at Hogwarts, and is he ever looking forward to it. Mostly so he can get away from the dreaded Dursleys. However, he is warned by a very strange house elf, Dobby, that he must not return to the school or terrible things will happen. Ignoring the warning, Harry is off to Hogwarts, and terrible things do start to happen. Something is lose and is turning Hogwarts students to stone. What's worse is that the students and even some of the faculty are starting to suspect that maybe Potter has something to do with it. As Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, are determined to find out just exactly what is going on, deadly and dangerous obstacles stand in their way.The writing is so creative and well done. Once you start the book, you literally cannot put it down for one second. You'll want to keep reading until you get to the end. It's also very unpredictable, leaving you surprised when you find out just exactly what is going on. This second installment to the series is more suspenseful and entertaining. And that's saying a lot because the first book was great as well. This isn't a book that can only by enjoyed by kids, it's something I think everybody could like.I was very entertained by reading the second book in the Harry Potter series, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,\\" and found it to be a terrific read. Now I'm hooked and I'm currently reading the rest of the books in the series. If you love to read books filled with magic, danger, humor, and some of the most creative and out-there characters, then this book is for you. Don't be fooled in thinking you're not going to like it because you think it's just for kids. It's NOT. It's a great book that can be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...which warn that Harry Potter books are part of a satanic plot to capture the minds of our children? The point they all raise is the obvious one, of course--the central theme of Potter books is sorcery and witchcraft: \\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\\", and so on. ...But Rowling gives her books a family dimension. Her important characters all have families, even if they are lousy ones--Harry's, for example. In this book in particular, we get to meet the large, wacky and loving family of Harry's friend Ron. We already met Ron's brothers as upperclassmen in \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\"--now we meet his parents and kid sister. We meet Draco Malfoy's father and discover why he's so mean-spirited--he's a \\"chip off the old block\\". We get a look backwards in time at \\"dropout\\" Hagrid as a difficult student and Dumbledore as an young professor trying to bring him round, which includes an insight as to why Hagrid failed. Issues like bigotry are addressed--such as the disdain \\"pure-blooded\\" wizards have for those with \\"muggle\\" (non-sorcery people) or mixed (one wizard and one \\"muggle\\") parentage. Purebloods such as Malfoy & Son call them \\"mud-bloods\\"...In truth, this series is in keeping with a lot of other youth-readership fiction. It sends a great message about human dignity--what sort of behavior and attitudes are consistent with it, as well as what sort harm it. When a writer can do that and still tell an enjoyable story, that writer is going to be a big success in the \\"kid book\\" genre..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I NEED THE NEXT BOOK Now!!!!!!I know someone who has it &amp;I'm gonna read it or else!!&amp;&amp; NO wise cracks about country music stars bein' illiterate!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm waiting for the other book and I am upset because it is coming out in September.

I love how even accidents can happen to her characters, such as when Ron's old wand breaks and causes multiple backfires. I also thought it was very clever and funny when he accidently shoots himself in the stomach, causing him to burp up worms and bugs for days.Before I read this book, I was a little apprehensive. I thought, \\"After all that happened in the first novel, how can Rowling give us something even more exciting in her second novel?\\" I thought, \\"Surely the second novel will be a let-down like most sequels. I will want more.\\" But, to my pleasant surprise, this novel was even better than the first.

This is the best childrens book of the millenium."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter i s exciting, Thrilling, and very well writen,at least that's what I thought.It just blew me away when harry potter coudn't get on the Hogwarts express, and when he and his firends take a magical flying car to get there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Most astonishing book i ever read!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the best book I've read in my whole life! Filled with excitement and adventure, I couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter &amp; the Chamber of Secrects is just as good as the first one. In this book though Harry has to face a little bit harder task then what he delt with in the Socerer's Stone. He is in for more danger. Now I can't wait to read the third one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first book that I read was Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. My daughter had gotten to take it home from school, all the other kids were begging for it! I sat down to read it for fun and found myself totally absorbed in the story of Harry Potter and how he began learning magic. For once, a hefty novel written for children that isn't dumbed down to the lowest level of comprehension. This is an excellent story that speaks to children's love of adventure. I can't wait to buy the next novels!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was the first of the Harry Potter series I read. I got into it because someone gave the book to me. It looked boring-but I read the first few pages and was instantly enthralled in Harry's emotion, J.K. Rowling's clever word usage, and Hogwart's mystic secrets. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read. I have now read all three of the books and have become the # 1 fan of Harry Potter. Go out and read this book a.s.a.p!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What can you say about these Harry Potter books? They are absolutely wonderful! J.K. Rowling continues to amaze me with the things she dreams up. I'm now reading the Prisoner of Azkaban with my sons and they can't get enough of it. Who would have ever thought that my children, (even a 14 year old boy!) would be waiting for me when I get home from work asking if there would be enough time to read tonight! I know there's some controversy surrounding these books, but what's the harm? It's only the age old battle of good against evil. They also teach a valuable lesson: that is, that evil doesn't always look bad on the outside. Sometimes the bad guy doesn't look like a bad guy till you get to know him. I'm all for the spell that these books weave! It's made my kids love reading, and is great quality time for us! This book was just as good as the first if not better!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and then bought it. At the same time I bought &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, but did not have &quot;The Chamber of Secrets.&quot; For a week I was in agony, waiting for Book 2 so I could continue in proper order and not have the book spoiled for me. I was afraid that this book would not be worth the wait. I was wrong. I kept reading &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; in awe. It is so clever and it defies my poor description. Long live J.K. Rowlings. My new literary hero."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is a very funny series, and very fascinating for one who believes in magic. :) I feel a bit weird saying that I am a 13 year old reading and enjoying this book. Most of the fans seem to be 4th and 5th graders. But this book, though very easy to read by me, was interesting, simply because the style and plot were unique. I know my adult teacher also likes this book, though she says she buys them to read to her kids.I really like reading about the Dursleys, (they're so MEAN they are funny) Gilderoy Lockhart, and Dobby, the house elf who tries to save Harry and nearly kills him. I hope other people of all ages read this book, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next ones. Also, the people who gave this book only one star are insane, and must seriously not like to read, hate fantasy, are Dursleyish, and should try a nice murder mystery, maybe that would be exciting enough for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is just plain embarrassing. Although the UK publishers changed the cover of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers'/Philosophers' Stone so that adults could read it without it being Too Obvious that we were reading a book in the 9-12 age group, the Chamber of Secrets still has the cover for children. Yet I couldn't put it down and it made me laugh numerous times - it is so inventive! Comparing the two books, I would say that this 'sequel' is, fortunately, that rare form of sequel - as good or perhaps even very slightly better than the original. The moment I returned from the UK, it was nigh on snatched from my hands, and no more was seen of my 12 year old daughter for the day or so that it took her to finish it. Had it been a weekend, she would probably have read it even more quickly. Joanne Rowling has created a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book for the second time several weeks ago in anticipation of Book 4. I was every bit as pleased and entertained (perhaps a bit more) as I was the first time around. These books have earned a place of honor on my most-loved book shelf.&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is the second in the series following Harry Potter at Hogwart's school of wizardry. In this book, we are served ample portions of our favorite characters and introduced to some new ones, most notably, Gilderoy Lockheart, the new celebrity professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts. We learn some new things about Harry and the mystery surrounding Vold... You-know-who.This book is full of twists and turns, unexpected surprises, enemies you love to hate, and wonderfully entertaining fantasy.I would recommend this book to ANYONE (any age) who enjoys the writings of Roald Dahl, C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, or J.R.R. Tolkien. This is a very fun, humourous, and enjoyable fantasy novel, and one that should be read more than once!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"BUT who cares. I, too, can still enjoy a great book when I read one, even if it is a kids' book! Enough with this nonsense about Rowling and her so called publicity blitz...for once there is a series of books worthy of the media attention; on a par with Tolkien and L'Engle. Any book that encourages children to turn off the TV and read is a classic in my opinion. Harry is my new best friend! Makes me wish I weren't a muggle!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am 34 years old I have read the first two books and can't wait to read the next one. I really enjoyed them and I believe they are for people of all ages not just 9-12 year olds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read Harry Potter& the Chamber of Secrets& LOVED IT it was the bomb.It was so cool & interesting book I've ever read.For some reson I always get into theese books so easy. but it's a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this series, the sequels get progressively better (so far).Often thought of as a kid's book, the Harry Potter series also makes for entertaining light reading for adults. Though voluminous, the books can be read quickly taking only a day or two of focused reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I personaly think that Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone is the best book I have read. I would reccommend Harry Potter to kids at a young age. Harry Potter was is an excellent book to read.I like the way the book was desined and the characters were awsome.the one thing that I most definatly loved in that book was the words. The words were chosen so carfully.The book Harry Potter was so incredible that I made pictures in my head while I was reading the book.For the adults out there this book would be a great book to read for yourself or your child or children. Harry Potter is a very good fantacy book you would love it.The book was about a child who's parents were killed by an evil sorcerer. Harry Potter about 10 years later was a normal child that lived with his Aunt, Uncle and his couisin.Dursley (Harry Potter's couisin) was a spoiled kid that basicly ruled Harry Potter's life. Harry Potter didn't get attention from anyone. One day Harry gets a letter in the mail and Dursley took it away from Harry and gave it to his dad and said \\"Harry has a letter\\". But Harry's Uncle didn't believe him and said \\"who would be writting to you Harry\\". Then the Uncle fliped the card over and stood there saying nothing. When Uncle Vernon fliped thw letter over it said Hogwarts(the school of withcraft and wizardy). Then Uncle Vernon said \\"there are no post on sundays\\" and then a lot of letters start coming in from the fireplace. Then Uncle Vernon said they were moving far away."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a middle-aged mother, school counselor, and Jane Austen fanatic, I never thought I would be obsessed with a series of books written for children. Granted, I love children's literature and use books extensively in my counseling programs but Harry Potter has grabbed my heart and is constantly tugging it! Books become classics when they not only stand the tests of time, but when they can appeal to all ages. These Harry Potter Books become classics the day they become published! THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is another powerfully written, dear and sweet novel about the adventures of Harry Potter and his two best friends. This book is about how good wins over evil but the exploits that the children get involved in are so delicious, so compelling, that only the hardest hearts would be able to put down these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm hooked and so is my young son. I'm still reading Book 1 to him, but I skipped ahead and read The Chamber of Secrets on my own in just a day.My son's imagination is engaged by Harry's world, and he can't wait for the next bedtime and the next chapter.Rowling's language is rich and her sentences are much more complex than in the average children's book. I like this. My son hears complex language construction at home all the time, yet so much of his school material is simplistic and one-dimensional that I worry just what he's really learning.A book like this can engage his mind (the fantasy, the strange other world) and can exercise his growing linguistic skill.My son is fascinated with the mythological and historical elements -- when I mentioned to him, reading Book 1, that some of the characters on Harry's Chocolate Frog trading cards were real historical figures he was amazed. He wondered if Ptolemy, Agrippa, and Paracelsus were really wizards and witches. Well, some thought so, as has happened to many throughout the ages. We had a good little discussion about history and fiction and legend and myth, and of course the role of legend and myth in history.We'll be reading all the Harry Potter books, no doubt, and looking for other books this engaging for our nightly read-together time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love this book! It has to be the best one, even though I can't really judge, because the magical world of Harry Potter is all so good! I highly recommend this book, and the same goes for all the other Harry Potter books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In book two Harry goes back to school for yet more excitment and non-stop adventure.Buy it for your kids, but make sure you read it too!This is the best series for children to come along in many years. In spite of the seemingly mystical nature of the stories, they actually have a very different theme than one would expect. Harry almost never relies on magic, but rather he thinks, works, and judges for himself. That is the real draw of these books! Children can recognize a hero when they see one, and are naturally drawn to characters who take matters into their own hands and act on their own judgement.Harry gets into so many situations where it would be easy to run for help or rely on someone else, but he doesn't! He is a true individual.I highly recommend this book for children and also for adults who enjoy a good hero story.I can't wait for book 5!:o)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"...Another well done book. I bought this Monday morning and was done before bed that night. I learned my lesson with all the lost sleep last time.Ms. Rowling is truly an imaginitive author and yet she has the ability to let you see her imagination, something too many writers lack. Her stories are smooth and flowing and always keep you guessing until the end. She has the ability to tie everything up nicely in the conclusion.The only part that seemed ackward was the very beginning. The short \\"rewriting\\" of a previous book in a series has always been a pet peeve of mine...Aside from that, this book is flawless. I hope she will be an encouragement to other children's authors to write a great and commanding story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit that Harry Potter is beginning to grow on me, nor am I too ashamed to admit that I enjoyed reading this book. It's much like enjoying a nice dessert after a meal. It's a fast read, enjoyable, and certainly suspenseful. It beats some of the more convoluted books out there.Chamber of Secrets invokes a story that's almost mythical in nature. A secret chamber, a monster within terrorizing the peaceful student community. You can go nuts trying to over-analyze this stuff. You can see it's rich in symbolism and metaphors. Maybe that's giving Rowling and a simple \\"children's book\\" too much credit but that is also perhaps why these stories have been so successful. It's not that it's rehashing an old story. After all, there are really very few \\"new\\" stories aren't there. It's repackaging an old myth with new characters that makes it successful and enduring for new (and old) generations of readers.Rowling keeps us interested by crafting a novel that has mystery elements. For a second I recalled when I read \\"The Three Investigator\\" mystery books and got so caught up in volumes and volumes of them. (Others might have found it with \\"The Hardy Boys\\" or \\"Nancy Drew\\"). I feel that guilty pleasure once again.Oddly enough, it also recalled my days when I was educated in a British school. When we were separated in houses (Muir, Fairfield, Scott, and Fleming) and we were given points for good behavior or grades. (Although no points were ever taken off for bad behavior and teachers themselves didn't belonged to the Houses). I guess it's an educational tradition the British have kept through the years."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Forget the hype. Forget the Hollywood-busting film. The Harry Potter books, especially the second book 'Chamber of Secrets', are truly enjoyable reads. Whereas the first one served as a perfect introduction into the Potter world of Wizards, Muggles and everything in between, 'Chamber of Secrets' does what all sequels should; continue the story, elaborating what was said before without treading upon the original text. This book does just that. It introduces new characters and mythology while expanding upon the original ones. Not forgetting anything laid out in 'The Philosophers Stone', the sequel also hints at things to be seen in it's following novels. Great stuff! Can't wait to see the film!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I would say this book is funny, imaginative, and is mysterious. I think it is mysterious because you never have a clue what is going to happen.I thought this book was full of curiosity.

People who liked this book should check out the writing of Philip Pullman, Daniel Pinkwater, and Brian Jacques too, but J. K. Rowling is truly the best. It's amazing how suspenseful her books are! I voluntarily stayed in from recess (I'm in 5th grade) finishing the book. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although I like many books, my favorite book would have to be Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling. One of the reasons this book is so good is all of the excitement. One exciting thing was when Harry and all of the Weasleys used floo powder to go to the wizard shops to get school supplies. When using floo powder they did the following things: they grabbed a small pinch of the floo powder and threw it into the fire, jumped in, and yelled where they wanted to go. The most exciting thing was when Harry and Ron couldn't get through to platform 9 so they flew an enchanted car all the way to Hogwarts. The last exciting thing was when the car go out of control and ran right into . . .. The next reason why I liked this book was because of all of the mysteriousness. Dobby, a small house elf, went to the Dursley's house to warn Harry about something at the school, but Harry wouldn't listen he went anyway. Then as he was running through the barrier to platform 9 3/4, the barrier wouldn't let him and Ron in and no one knew why. Then, when they got to Hogwarts, Harry could hear a voice in the wall that no one else could hear. There was also talk of a \\" chamber of secrets\\" being opened by the heir of Slytherin. Some people thought it all rubbish, while others believed it true. Finally the strangest thing was that no one knew who the heir of Slytherin was. The last reason why this book was so good was all the strange and abnormal things. One thing in this book that strange was Harry's invisibility cloak that made him invisible whenever he put it on. Then ther was Tom Riddle's diary. Harry found it and started writing in it and to his surprise it wrote back! There were also the giant spiders and all the people getting petrified. The by far strangest thing was that Harry found out he was a parseltounge, which means he could talk to snakes! Hopefully I have inspired you to read this wonderful book and"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What do you get when you put together a school for witchcraft and wizardry, an impish house elf, and horrific torments abounding? Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, of course!

The book opens with Harry nearing the end of the most miserable summer of his life with the Dursleys and is warned by a strange creature not to return to Hogwarts School in the fall. But Harry, unable to stay away from his favorite place in the world, returns to Hogwarts and some very strange occurences that leave everyone at Hogwarts on edge.

I was nothing but amazed at the book yet again.J.K.

As soon as they get to Hogwarts strange things start happening. The students at Hogwarts are scaried of what might happen.Harry and his friends set out on a mission to find out what is causing all the strange things.

When Harry Potter has trouble getting back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry because he and his friend Ron cannot seem to get onto platform 9 and 3 quarters to catch the Hogwarts Express. Not thinking, Harry and Ron take Ron's fathers bewitched car and fly it to Hogwarts. Bad things are happening at Hogwarts during Harry's second year and Harry soon learns that Doby, a house elf, was the one who tried to keep Harry away from Hogwarts and is now trying to get him to leave. Doby warns Harry Potter that bad things are going to start happening at Hogwarts and when wizards and witches born into common muggle familys start being petrified the school looks towards Harry Potter because they have all found out that he can speak parseltongue. A sign of a dark wizard. Destined to prove that he is not the attacker Harry, Ron, and Hermoine carefully unravel the past of the chamber of secrets and Harry leads himself, Ron, and Professer Lockhart, right into the Chamber of Secrets (can't seem to stay out of trouble can he?) and finds out that the secrets in the chamber are a lot deeper than he suspected.Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets is excited right the start. Thins happen when you least expect them too. This is definately my favorite Harry Potter book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you enjoyed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone then you better hang onto your broomstick, because Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is liable to knock you off! This action packed sequel is even more engrossing than the first. Harry and Ron have a license to fly in this book, but not just their brooms, a CAR! Forget the Hogwarts Express, Harry and Ron fly to Hogwarts school this year and yet again manage to get in trouble. A mystery person opening the Chamber of Secrets is enough to make you stay up all night trapped in the book. Ming Boggling warnings from Dobby lead Harry to confusion but he will not give up. The sheer ambition of Harry, Ron and Hermione will make you wish you were there at their side helping them to seek the opener. The on going battle with Harry's adversary Draco Malfoy will have you on the edge of your seat wishing Harry would just grab that snitch right then and there, and somehow shut Malfoy up forever. J.K. Rowling has done it again. Her mind blowing ideas and compelling stories will have an elementary school kid and teacher skipping lunch just so they could read some more of that captivating Harry Potter.

I liked the first one, but this was truly masterful storytelling.I really love the boarding school aspect to this series and enjoyed seeing the kids return for the 2nd year. This time the plot centered around the dark froces at Hogwarts being unleashed from the Chamber of Secrets. There were so many plot twists and surprises. The author offers hints, there is really no wasted information in this story. I honestly could not put it down for the final 50 pages!It was so much fun to read- I have to go read volume 3!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The best suspense book that I ever read.

I quote it because while looking through all the one star quotes you see a lot of &#65533;Don&#65533;t let your children read it, it should be banned ect...&#65533; In other words they want to ... burn the book &#65533;cos of their frail mind and &#65533;idea&#65533;s.&#65533; What also irritates me is the large amount of fellow Christians here bashing it and calling it &#65533;Satanic&#65533; I am a strong Christian, and guess what? It&#65533;s not. Witch&#65533;s magic? Oh dear if a kid can&#65533;t handle that however will they handle the real world? The point of a Fairy Tale is to prepare kids for the real evil in our world! No these books aren&#65533;t The Narnia. The Chronicles Of Narnia is my favorite series, and these books o course are not supposed to be anything like them so don't expect them to be. Harry Potter isn&#65533;t allegory (well according to Lewis&#65533;s idea neither was Narnia) so don&#65533;t expect the same level of skill or style. He had witches and goblins as well, will you ban him next? (Oh I forgot some \\"Christians\\" think Lewis is evil as well.) Besides \\"The Last Battle\\" was more horrific on a psychological level and in its vivid description of battle and mayhem then anything in this book (remember the horses and dwarfs?). There you have the destruction of lands, and all hell (literally) being rained down upon them. Here they have people in a state of shock and a villain getting killed. True the purpose behind the events in Narnia were different, all I&#65533;m saying is that the &#65533;disturbing for children&#65533; was even more in \\"The Last Battle\\". These books are in no way evil; they are however entertaining, un-offensive and fine for kids. Don't worry about polluting minds, being sent to hell or comparing it to a completely different style of writing, just sit and read them for what they are. The ironic this is I never even intended to read a Harry Potter book, I made a promise I would in order to get someone to read Bradbury and here I am defending it, so... don&#65533;t pre-judge and just get and enjoy them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What an amazing series of books, Harry Potter is. Not since Tolkien has the world seen such (almost) unanimous approval of the works of one author. The few negative reviews seem to come from religious fundamentalists who, for some reason known only to themselves, feel that Harry Potter is weakening their control over others. As an non-young-person (actually I'm older than the oldest wizard), I find the H.P. series refreshing and uplifting in a simple way. Here we see a young boy fighting the forces of evil on his own and, so far, he has won each round. I fail to understand how religious crusaders can find fault in that - but they do!What is also amazing is that the author manages to speak to young and old alike. When I first told my wife (who is even older than me!) that I was not to be disturbed because I was watching a game a of Quidditch, she thought I was heading into senile dementia (she's a doctor, so she knows about these things!). I challenged her to read the books and NOT get involved. She did. She failed. She became even more involved than I had (and she was reading them in English, which is not her native language). This is the magic of J.K.Rowling's writing. She entertains, she takes us out of the humdrum world of work and worry, she writes a darn good story.It is the job of the fiction writer to get the reader to suspend belief. Few authors have the ability to do this like 'J.K.'. If I named, Stephen King, John Grisham and Tom Clancy as three of the best known, you'll understand why their books are instant bestsellers. They, too, can draw the reader into a world of make-believe so that the lines between reality and fiction become blurred. In Harry Potter, Rowling attempts to draw us into a world of wizards and magic and, if you look at all the five star reviews, it is clear that she succeeds.Power to J.K.'s elbow, and long may she continue to entertain and amuse us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am getting fairly sick of beating these books over people's heads only to have them look at me and say, \\"Aren't those books for kids?\\" Yes, they take place in middle school, and yes, they deal with wizards and flights of fancy and yes, the main characters are not even teenagers. However, Rowling has created books with an excellent sense of plot, she throws in twists and turns that certainly threw me for a number of loops. She is amazing at crafting characters that are engaging, original and a lot of fun to spend a few hours with. To top all of this fact, let us not forget that these are books in a series. In the first book there is a sense of safety, that these are children's books and that a wave of a magic wand is all that is needed to make everything come out alright. But this series is slowly shifting as the books continue, and there is a presence looming at the end of the fourth book that clearly shows us that Dumbledore, the schoolmaster who bails Harry and his friends out here and there during their adventures, is NOT going to be able to wave his magic wand and make everything better. The stakes are raised by the end of the fourth book, the danger is very real and an epic battle is shaping up between good and evil. These books are quick reads and deal with the lives of children in a fanciful world, but they are by no means books for children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is another great book by J.K. Rowling. Harry goes off to Hogwarts for his second year at studying to become a wizard. Much tries to deter him from arriving there and staying there. A new character, Dobby, is introduced to us and Ginny, the Weasley's younger sister, becomes part of the story at Hogwarts. There is also a new defense against the dark arts teacher that plays a significant role in this book. This book seems a bit scarier and a little more gory than the first one. A warning may be prudent before reading aloud. There is more mystery to this book as the heir of Slytherin is not identified until almost the last two chapters. I again echo that Harry is a wonderful role model and suitable for almost any ages. His qualities of kindness, perseverance, intelligence, and sensitivity are ones to be strived for by all children and adults. A marvelous read for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think Harry Potter is a good book because i learn alot about his family. I think this is a good family book. Or just plain a great book.He is close to my age so i can kinda see what he means."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. rowling has yet another hit! If you are into any kind of fantasy books, then these are for you. This book, which is the second in the seven book-to-be sreies, is a great read for all ages. Even though it is targeted for a younger audience, it has many underlying messages that make it enjoyable for everyone. In this book, I think the biggest hidden theme is prejudice. The story involves a similar situtation to that of our racical injustices between blacks and whites. Except the emphasis isn't on skin color, but on magical backgrounds and ability. I think this book could teach readers a lot about equality and the value of friendship. It is a bit monotonous through the middle, but the descriptive language keeps it interesting. This is a fun book for anyone. If you read this, you should also read the sequels. J.K. Rowling has incredible talent. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Okay, so I am not in junior high. I am a 27 year old mother of three and I am now a fan of Harry Potter. I got into it on the advice of my 40+ year old sister in-law. She gave the books rave reviews. Although I am not yet finished with Book 2 (I still have yet to read Book 1) I am amazed at the fact that does not seem like a children's story. True, it deals with the trials and tribulations of the average preteen, but the way Rowlings writes, she makes you forget that her books were written with children in mind. The plot is as good as any adult thriller in the sense that it keeps you guessing and looking for more. Once I finish with Chamber of Secrets, I will backtrack to read Book 1 and then continue on with the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Alex again. J.K. has another fascinating book. Maybe you don't, but I like the reptile idea.Snakes are cool! Chapter Sixteen is when you get parts of the puzzle solved."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is definately one of, if not the, best Harry Potter books yet. People keep saying this book is boring at the beginning, but I disagree. How could it be? The opening allows the readers to observe the Dursleys' reaction to any word, phrase, or action that could possibly remind them that Harry is a wizard. Mr. Dursley won't even say the word &quot;magic&quot;; rather, he refers to it as the &quot;'m' word&quot;, and forbids anybody, especially Harry, to speak it. I think that's fascinating.Also, The Chamber of Secrets was NOT predictable. I never knew what was going to happen, and the end shocked me. I could NOT believe what happened, though I probably should have guessed. But I was so wrapped up in the story that I didn't even THINK of it.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that the suggested age bracket on the back cover said &quot;ages 9-12&quot;. That is so messed up. It should be something more like &quot;ages 12 and up&quot;. The Chamber of Secrets, like all the other Harry Potter books, is not for little kids. I'm not saying they're satanic or anything - believe me, that's the LAST thing I'd say - but they're too scary for young kids.Oh - and about everybody saying the Harry Potter books glamourize/promote/whatever you want to call it witchcraft - get a life! I mean, yeah, some kids have started practicing witchcraft, and OK, so maybe it was, IN PART, because of Harry Potter. But those kids needed help BEFORE they read Harry Potter, not after. And anyway, I lot of people who say the books are satanic haven't even read them - they've heard the books are &quot;bad&quot; from a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend who has a friend whose cousin's daughter's niece read, maybe, the first three chapters of The Sorcerer's Stone. And as for the people who say they're satanic because they actually HAVE read one or two of the books - well, they're either stupid, or paranoid, or both. So there.Another thing I don't like is how commercialized the Harry Potter books are becoming. I mean, come on, people - you're not really going to buy Harry Potter PILLOWS, are you? J.K. Rowling said in a 60 Minutes interview that a company actually called her to see if she would let them make Harry Potter MARGERINE. She said NO - of course. But it's still pretty sad.Anyway, I meant to write how great The Chamber of Secrets is, so I guess I'll do that now. It was SO exciting, and Ginny is one of my favorite characters now. And like I said before, the ending is simply AMAZING."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really liked this book. Not that anybody cares or anything, but it was great.

Although the story sagged a bit in the middle (just a bit!), this one was just as good as the first.Terrific plot twists and vivid imagery. It was wonderful to get re-acquainted with some old friends and meet new ones...and as always, I love how Rowling depicts the Dursleys. She has a great sense of humor.The first chapter will have you in stitches.Get this one!Cris"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"i think the book i really good and really intertaining. I think the writer was very creative. And if he made the book for kids he did a good job because i know adults who like this book i even like this book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love Harry Potter! I read this book like there was never going to be another book written. The mysteries Harry encounters, still has you turning the page well into midnight looking for the answers.I must admit though, certain parts of the Second Year were bogged down. The action seemed a little slower to that in the First Year and the action sometimes seemed predictable rather then surprising.However, these inperfections are small and insignificant since they did not stop me from buying the third book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a marvellous book and part of a marvellous series. It's incredable how these books are loved by children, adults and seniors alike. I'm 33 years old and I've read the four published books and I'm eagerly waiting for Book 5. So has my mother who's 68 and lots of kids and teenagers I know. What makes this books so loved? I think part of it is the fact that Harry is a real character. He has the some problems we all had when we were his age; he has friends and has kid's who hate him, are jealous of him or just don't like him. He's liked by some teachers and abused by others.He's good at some subjects and not so good at others. He's a great Quidditch player, but sometimes his team can't make the House Championship. But these books also make a point of the moral guidelines that are so lacking in today's world. Although Harry is a real kid, he's also someone to be emulated. He makes friend both with kids that aren't so good students such as Ron and with kids that are real suckers for study, duty and deadlines as Hermione (the ones that are usually just made fun of in real life). He teaches us that we should help and befriend those less able than ourselves and seek help and friendship from those who are more intelligent than we are. He is rich, but is not always making a big point of it as so many people do in the real world. He's scared, but he doesn't run away from his fears.Aside from all this this particular book is a real good detective story. Harry and his friends work hard to figure out the way to the Chamber of Secrets and all the secrets it holds. And once again Harry faces the dark forces and comes out thriumphant. A great read. Don't miss it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am 7 years old and have just started reading chapter books on my own but I had trouble putting this book down. It is full of majic and mysteries and I would recommend this book for any other kid who is looking for a fun book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter - And the chamber of secrets is a great book. I didnt know that, that book exists until one day when I went to work with my mom her boss told me is a great book so I decicded to read it. Well lets begin with the overview of Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets. Harry Potter attended Hogwarts School of Wirchcraft And Wizardy. But,when the school semester was overhe went to live With The Dursleys(with his uncle)family. Harry Potter didn't like it there. Harry Potter was always wondering why his friends never wrote back he tought that his friends had forgot about him but the owl was not delivering the letters.When Harry Potter want it to returned to Hogwarts a little strange creature appear and told him that if he went to Hogwarts again something was going to happend(he was going to make trouble)but Harry didnt believe him and the liitle strange goblin told him why his friends never wrote bsck to him. But,Harry's uncle was always screamin' at him and that is why Harry didnt like it there.His uncle didnt even want his frineds to know that he exists(Harry).Well that's all Im going to say for know so if you read the book you are not going to know what it going to happend next so it could be more exciting.I really like Harry Potter_and the Chamber Of Secrets. It is reall funny too.I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a Great book. First of it teaches kids lessons. There is Great charecters (Very Unique). I wonder how they thought of the Great Theme. I suggest you read this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was definitely one of my favorites. It starts out with the Dursley's doing something to Harry that would have gotten them in deep trouble with the child welfare authorities in the US. It makes you hate them all the more. This book has it all, humor, a great mystery, a horrible monster, a brave hero, and some great friendships. Highly recommended as are all the books in the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book is equally as good as the first book and as usual, there is always a twist at the end of the book, where the last piece of the puzzle is fitted. Some of the mysteries in Book 1, such as why Hagrid was expel is discussed here.In summary, Harry returned to Hogwarts, the School of Wizardy with his best friends, Ron and Hermoine and Harry discover a diary, which is able to transform him back to the owner of the diary's memory. At the same time, there is a monster out to kill muggles and Harry was the main suspect! He was also believe to be the Heir of Slytherin! To find out, how he solved the mystery, you should definitely read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all the books but this one is the best of all. Harry Potter is a very interesting kid when everyone sees him they start tovwhisper because his parent died saving him. The scar on his head is from lord voldermont or is it. If you haven't read and figured out who did it you ought to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'd already given in to the hype that came along with Book #4 and ponied up the money to buy all four volumes. After surreptitiously devouring #1, I got into the swing of the storyline and decided to read the entire set. Don't get your hopes up -- this isn't &quot;deep&quot; reading -- but it IS fun reading. You'll find yourself trying to outguess the mysteries -- and you can probably DO it -- but the point is that the author brings you along and makes you enjoy the story as you pretend that it is too &quot;simple&quot; for adults to read. But, give in -- even if you have to pull off the dustjacket and pretend you're reading something from the &quot;nonfiction&quot; shelf. You'll find yourself smiling and then looking for the 3rd volume."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just got this book less than a month ago and i finshed it.It's really good! i like it better than the first one because this book has more adventures in it.I couid'nt put the book down! it was that good.I reacmend it for all harry potter fans(or beginers who just started reading the first book.).

However, I liked the first book more because it was all so new to me. When Dobby kept warning Harry not to return to Hogwarts I couldn't stop reading until I finished it. My reading teacher liked the Harry Potter books so much that she bought two copies of the first book and had to order the second one because everyone wanted to read it. The Harry Potter series is bound to become a classic. I can't wait to read the up-coming book; Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter was introduced to me by my 12 year old nephew. He asked that I read it so we could discuss it. What an honor! I, a 41 year old aunt, am now a confirmed Harry Potter fan. What a wonderful way to bring young and old together through reading. I am passing it on as gifts to all the youngsters that I know and the feedback has been dazzling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book in my class at Bowman Elementary in Anchorage, Alaska. It is about the Chamber of Secrets being opened and a lot of muggles ( that is what the magical people called regular humans) got petrified by the animal that lives in the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a wonderful book especially for anyone who read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone! I couldn't put this book down so I finished it in one day! I know you will enjoy this book as much as I did! Amazon shipped it to my house right away so i could start reading! I promise you will love this book! So buy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I got Harry POtter and the Socers Stone for my birthday, and after I read it I couldn't stop! When my freind who is also a Harry Potter buff told me Rowling was writing 6 other books, I was so excited! We are known in our school as the &quot;people who are crazy about some book.&quot; We both talk about it non-stop whenever we see each other! HArry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is wondeful. There aren't words to describe how great this book is! I love this book and anyone should read it. There hasn't been one day yet that has past when I havn't read for a least a half-an-hour! I'll be so sad when the last Harry Potter book comes out! No more for me to read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just bought it yesterday and am already on chapter 10!!!! A GREAT READ!

So, BUY THIS BOOK!! I'm sure you will like it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This new Harry Potter book is so good!!! Unbelieveably, this one is even better than the first. I cant wait till she releases Prisoner of Azkbar!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. This is a great book and I heard that J.K Rowling is finishing the series after the seventh book. I can't wait to read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I know that it's going to be as good as the first two."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was a good book to read if you like witchs and wizards.If you like books that trick you this the one for you.The characters are neat because the names are neat.Its the best book I have ever read because I really like wizard books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I was reading this book, I couldn't tear my eyes away from it! I've read all of the Harry Potter books in the series and they all are very intriguing, but this one was my favorite! The story is interesting right from the beginning to the end. I thought that the story's plot was easy to grab, so young readers wouldn't have trouble reading this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K.Rawling is amazing. I have read 3 out of the 4 harry potter books and i read them all in a day. I bought them for my little girl but i read them before they even got to her. I would recommend this book to people of any age group. i guess i can find one word which is apt for these books &quot; captivating&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As Harry's saga continues, J.K.Rowlings success does too. Once again, this Harry Potter book like the first struck my imagination and created a whole other world. I must admit, being introduced to Harry Potter by the first in the series made the first book my personal favorite. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets however, continued Harry's journey and was an exceptional story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It hardly seems necessary to write another review for this wonderful book. I am an adult, and my 12-year-old niece and I have made a summer project of reading and re-reading all four volumes in this series so far. I love these books because they remind me of the best children's literature that I read as a child and I find I can still become completely involved in these adventures because they create a whole world that is fantastical but makes perfect sense within itself. The wonderful inventiveness of these books amazes me and always keeps me guessing. I especially liked the Mandrakes in this book. To say too much about this book would be to give away the plot, but this is simply great fun reading for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm 17 years old and have read the first 3 books in the Potter series. All of them were made for very pleasant reading, though I'm no fanatic. (Have to admit I'm curious about the Goblet of Fire though) The reason I'm impressed with this series is because it's managed to do what I wouldn't have thought possible. It's taken my brothers full attention from Pokemon! And until now, that's been something unheard of. Aside from that, it's also nice to see kids back into reading again, instead of numbing their minds over hours of computer games. I found my self gaping when I realized that a little kid in my school was going through the 700 page Goblet of Fire. I mean, that's natural to see in adults, but a kid? For that, J.K. Rowling deserves congratulations and also my thanks for writing a book that has provided me with a wonderful way to escape from a teenager's world and once again imagine a world where magic exists."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter and the chamber of secrets is my favorite in the series so far. the non-stop action and the witty humor makes this book an excellent read. New characters enter the scene while some of the old ones are better than ever.I am 17 years old, and I think the hype about the books corrupting the children of the world is ridiculus. It is FICTION! But, anyway. It is a step above the first book, and is sure to excite you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love Harry Potter and whoever doesn't must be an idiot! this is a great book and Ive heard people are trying are trying to get them out of libraries and I think thats stuped because if kids are reading then what matters! Some people who hate reading are now the best readers in their class! I just think you should really think abaut it before you even try to take them from our librarys."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Having read all 4 books, more than once, The Chamber of Secrets has to be the best Harry Potter book (next to The Goblet of Fire). It has adventure and comedy, and all things a reader would want in a book. You can't just stop reading it, you have to read it all the way through. And then you have to read it again and again. And each time, you discover something new about the book that you missed earlier. J.K. Rowling is a literary genious. The books are said to be for readers aged 12, but as a 15 year old I feel no embarrassment when telling people about these books, but feel slightly mad when I hear that these books get called boring and occult-ish when reviewed by 50 year olds that read The Wall Street Journal for fun. You have to buy these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that the Harry Potter series of now containing 4 books is wonderfully written and is great for all ages. You get to explore Harry's life and how he attends the Hogwarts School of Magic and wisardry. This series is full of many surprises, and you just cannot stop yourself from reading these books. You read about many adventures that Harry goes through to keep his life at Hogwarts normal. He fights Voldermort (you'll find out about him in the books) which tries to kill Harry in every book. The reason he tries to kill Harry is to finish off the Potter family. If you dont have this wonderful book, you need to buy it for your kids or even for yourselves. This book will both expand your childrens and your imagination. Its a great learning expiriance and actually makes kids want to keep on reading no matter how thin or thick the book actually is. J.k Rowling is a great author, and because of her, people all over the world are enjoying her wonderful books with great inerest and excitment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It starts out with Harry back living with his Muggle(non-wizards) Aunt and Uncle. He does not like it there because for the past twelve years they have been treating him like a dog, locking him in the cuboard everytime he does something wrong. When he goes back to Hogwart's(Wizarding School) a couple of kids are found practically scared to death. they are stiff as a board. Everyone is saying it's the relative of the Wizard who formed the Slitheran house and everyone thinks it's Harry because the hat wanted him in Slitheran and he can talk to Snake's. When he does finally find out who is causing the kids to freeze he is in for more than he expected."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A relentlessly stupid sequel to the promising opening of \\"Stone\\", \\"Chamber\\" is a dull, boring book with a \\"mystery\\" you'll figure out before the protagonists do. Ron has a few good moments but for the most part the humor and the so called \\"human drama\\" is very flat and sadly lacking. Also features Hermione making the most incredibly stupid out-of-character mistake in the history of out-of-character mistakes. As hard as it is to believe, the film adaptation of Chamber is even worse.Followed by the superior \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\"."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I rated Harry Potter 1 star becuase I did not think it wasn that exciting. Harry Potter was not a realistic book, it was just a made up fantasy. I think an adult might enjoy Harry Potter becuase they could understand it better. However someone my age could not understand many of the things the author states in the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't like this book because you could not understand whatthe author was trying to say. I don't think kids should read this bookbecause the book is really hard to read. A adult might like it if theycan understand it. Another reason I did not like this it is because there was nothing realistic about it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hmmmmm...let's see...it's okay to break rules if you're the &quot;good guy&quot;, but not okay if you're the &quot;bad guy&quot;? It's okay for the Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts to bewitch a muggle car as long as he's the father of one of the &quot;good guys&quot;, but at the same time it's not okay for a governor on the school board to keep illegal items because he's the father of one of the &quot;bad guys&quot;--but the &quot;good guy&quot; can get away with it as long as he's got &quot;the scoop&quot; on what's under the &quot;bad guy's&quot; drawing-room floor (let's just completely ignore what's in the &quot;good guy's&quot; garage)? The &quot;bad guy&quot; looses his job for doing something illegal, but the &quot;good guy&quot; (who also did something illegal) doesn't? So, it's okay to &quot;turn the tables&quot; and use the same tactics on the &quot;bad guys&quot; as they used on you as long as you're the &quot;good guy&quot;? ...the ends justify the means? ...how Machiavellian. Is this REALLY what we want to teach our kids? Of course kids like these books...now they've got a hero that can break as many rules as he wants and get away with it. I would hope that anyone with a decent set of moral values wouldn't buy into the hype and buy this book.If you're a parent or a teacher, I would STRONGLY suggest that you read these books before allowing your children to read them and really think about whether or not you want your children influenced by the behavior in these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"the book was in great shape considering i bought it new, but the pages themselves were wrong it goes from page 228 to 331, and then repeats whole section againg still missing about one hunderd pages worth of reading"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes, I am deeply sorry for not liking this book at all. The first book was alright but as I read on in the series I find it somewhat incapable of liking it at all. i am finding out more and more things in the book that make me like it less and less. I thought that from her religious stand point she would have something good to say but apparently not. This book is mainly used to criticize others. You will see that she refers to the Weasley's a lot because of their not being able to afford things. She always refers to Ron as poor and filthy. Sure, it may be Malfoy talking but he's only a character in the book. He has no real voice. She may only be using her characters in her books to cover up some deep issues she may have. Not only does she pick on Ron but Hermione as well. She makes fun of her book smarts and calls her things as 'Know-it-all' and makes this character ashamed of her smarts. There's a lot of feminism to do with this book, The Chamber of Secrets. There is a new character that seems to be only a 'stupid little girl'. She is of course, Ginny Weasley. She is told that she is but a stupid little girl by Tom Riddle. She is somewhat stating that women are weak because she states in her books that we are nosey, bossy, demanding, silly people. She is stereo typing woman in this book. I find this type of behavior to be appalling and offending. She is clearly stating that most of the women in this book seem to act stupid and trust anyone or anything. Ginny Weasley pours her heart out to Tom Riddle's diary and ended up being betrayed. Not ALL women feeble minded. Hence, me not liking this book very much. If I wanted to read about chauvinistic comments I would have gone to an all male bar! As I stated before, I'm sorry to all that have the same feelings as I."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was barley a mystery novel due to the mysterious petrifactions at the very end. Then again comparing it to a magical themed book it would be very much a mystery novel. While you are reading this book you are reminded with subtle hints of its intended audience such as a blushing little girl running away and ending up having to be rescued by the hero that is a little older."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"i kinda feel akward writing this review, since im the only known person to hate harry potter books, well besides those super religious people against witchcraft. Anyway, I honestly didnt read all of it, but enough where i can say YAWN. i was reading it, and was really getting into it, but it seemed to go on and on, and by the time i got to the chapter that said \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" and closed the book. It took me so long to actually get there, by the time i reached it i didnt even care any more. Im not bad mouthing the book or anything, go ahead and buy it, im not stopping you, most people like it. I just think its sad kids waste weeks and weeks reading every single one of these books. Its as thick as a dictionary for God's sake! I'd rather wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hi my name is Kelsey and I did not enjoy Harry Potter at all.I really did not enjoy the book and I don't recommend the book to anyone. The reason I did not enjoy the book is because I am not interested in magic and fantasies. It was hard to understand and hard to read. I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoy other books that I have read. The opinion I have may be very different from yours but I don't think that I would like to read any other Harry Potter books ever again. If you don't like fantasies or imaginative books this is one of those books you won't enjoy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I feel very sorry for anyone, no matter what age, who thought that this book was hard to read. I was very disappointed in this book, and yeah, maybe it's a kid's book so I shouldn't have gotten it, but with all the hoop and holler about it I thought it must be something special. Not so. This book is just like any old Hardy Boys or Sweet Valley Twins or Lloyd Alexander book I ever read in elementary school to pass the time. There's the little hero who can do no wrong and the loser bad guy who hates him for no reason and is, of course, the latest spawn in a long line of bad guys who were bad for no reason. Even Star Wars is better than this. Okay, so maybe if you are in elementary school it would be an alright read, but even then I can't understand getting THIS excited about it..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was great how it described ever person Harry met.

I can't see how people can't like it. I don't understand why people don't let their children read it. It's only fiction people! My little brother who is eight can't stop reading this book. My mom who is 42 refuses to put down the third book. I have a friend who is 11, and when we went fishing trip, he spent 12 hours reading. He started and finished this book on a fishing trip!!The descriptions in this book are phenomenal. I can paint a vivid picture in my mind of what Harry is doing. The plot of the book is amazing. The suspense builds up so fast that you can't put it down. The ending to the book is also so different that what you would think. If you liked the Hobbit, then this is for you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is wonderful and I'm so glad they made a braille edition.

Harry rox!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I throughly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets! I finished the book in 3 days. I couldn't put the book down. I found it to be a thrill from the beginning to the end. From the beginnining the author gets us attached to Harry.

If you've read the other book, it will be easier,but it works both ways.I highly reccommend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"With over two thousand reviews posted, I doubt that there is anything new that I can add about the second installment of the international phenomenon known as \\"Harry Potter\\". I saw no need to start with the first book, inasmuch as I had become familiar with the characters, the setting, and the situations by listening to my students and catching glimpses of the first film.Fortunately, Rowling used enough references to the first book that I was able to follow and enjoy the plot lines.I don't qualify this as \\"great literature\\" but it is a fun and infectious read, making one want to find out what happens in Potter's continuing education at Hogwarts.Like other reviewers, I found some of the images a little disturbing, especially the \\"headless\\" character and the girl that lived in the toilet, along with the \\"Dark Lord's\\" obsession with Potter's demise.If I were a parent, I'd become familiar with each book BEFORE I allowed my child to read them, offering any explanations that might be deemed necessary for the precocious, and somewhat impressionable, reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I know - I work in one of those huge British Multinational Corporations, and I'm surrounded by all the characters of this book... Draco Malfoy works in the office next to mine, trying to bully his way around. Draco's father is on the Board of Directors (of course - the bad guys always have the most power). Prof. Dumbledorf is a nice old gentleman with a white beard who takes care of us all when we need it most. Ron is a nice guy who works in the canteen. I'm Hermione, studying the hardest because I was born of Muggle parents and have to work 5 times harder than pure-bloods to get the same grades they do. Lord Voldemort is around here somewhere, but we're not sure where, working his evil deeds. And Harry Potter, we suspect, is an apprentice working in the factory - there is a young man with the most amazing scar on his forehead!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This bok is just as good as the first one. It also is filled with suspensful twists, and humorous stories. Right before Harry goes back to Hogwarts, a house-elf named Dobby warns him that terrible things will happen if he returns to school. Excited to get away from the Dursleys for another school year, Harry ignores Dobby and goes back anyway. But soon after he returns people start turning into stone. Harry's worst fear is that he without knowing it, is making this happen. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good fantasies, but be sure to read the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling does it again, delivering another classic fantasy tale. She preserves a sense of mystery throughout the book.But I'm annoyed with her trend to make the mysteries of both books 1 &amp; 2 unsolvable. There's no way the reader can figure out some things with the information given.All this aside it's a very entertaining book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling did an outstanding job on the characters, how they said beleivable things, they were smart, and did smart things. She also made the places they went to have such good names like Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, and Knockturn Alley.I liked how Harry is famous, and Hermione is the smart one. Hermione likes Gilderoy Lockhart but Harry is always the one that has to go up in front of the class and do impressions of the werwolfs etc that Lockhart fought.I also like how the defense against the dark arts job is supposed to be cursed. I definitely reccomend this book! This book is a mystery, but it is not your classic Whodunit? mystery. It includes suspense and excitement that only J.K. Rowling can brew up in her cauldron. The addition of the wide eyed, self disciplining Dobby was a good side mystery. Lockhart's arrogance is not written very believeably but it fits in perfectly. The irrepressible trio(Ron, Harry, and Hermione)once agian have to face the challenging subtle life of a magical kid."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think my opinion of these books has been marred beyond repair. I didn't catch on when they came out; I've seen the movies out of sequence and some of them incompletely; and now I'm reading the books a little begrudgingly and all I can see are negative bits. So even if I enjoyed the book, I don't feel like I enjoyed the book. All I got out of it was a possible allegory on Nazism and the same, predictable formula:Harry Potter goes to schoolHarry Potter gets in fights with DracoHarry Potter discovers a mystery to be solved with his friendsPeople at the school have mixed feelings for Harry Potter as he tries to solve the mysteryHarry Potter fails to tell the teachers what he knows about what's going on because this is how every kid mystery story must go (very frustrating)Harry Potter (and friends) run to solve the mystery and defeat the evilness lurking aboutHarry Potter's friends get caught behind and cannot continue with Harry.Harry Potter faces Voldemort alone.Harry Potter wins.School ends.The End."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is hard to escape the first without wanting more, and this does it without re-treading everything from Book One."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is one of the best Harry Potter books out of all three. Harry is at home with his Uncle and Aunt and then something special happens. It also makes you wanna never stop reading. Great for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have just finished reading a wonderful book titled, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;. After reading the first book (&quot;Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone) I automatically became hooked on the delightful series by J.K. Rowling. Before reading the Harry Potter books, I was uninterested in reading and thought it was rather boring. However, when I picked up the first Harry Potter book, I couldn't put it down. It was simply amazing, and yet at the same time an exciting and intriging mystery. The second book, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is even more exciting than the first book. It is Harry's second year he will be attending Hogwarts (the school of magic and wizardy), but a mysterious visitor named Dobby visits Harry and tells him if he attends Hogwarts that something terrible will happen to him. Harry ignores the visitor and goes to Hogwarts anyways and runs into a whole new year of trouble, magic, and a serious yet complicated mystery that he has to solve. You learn more about Ron Weasley and in general the whole Weasley family. Quite Suprisingly, Harry has a secret admirer, Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who is attending Hogwarts for the first time. While Harry is trying to solve an odd mystery with Ron, they run into many obstacles, never giving up. This book is a definete must read, in the Harry Potter series and I strongly reccomend it to anyone who wants to be touched by the magic of a strong, kind, heartwarming boy named Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling keeps you reading, and turning the pages, and don't be surprised if you don't watch TV for a week, its very addictive! This book maybe harder to finish for little kids, because of the number of pages(342),but I recommend that parents should read this story to their young children because it is simply something you can enjoy together and remember forever. I have enjoyed the magic and fantasy in reading this book, and I never wanted it to end. I also reccomend that you read the first Harry Potter book first, since this is a series and goes in chronological order, so you can understand things better. I also want to add that this book is for all age levels from 5-90 yrs old. I hope that you choose to read &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; because it is a wonderfully written book and an enchanting fantasy that has been and will be enjoyed by all for a long time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have just finished reading a wonderful book titled, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;.

It kind of makes me sad that some individuals are so strongly set in the belief that fantasy, or make-believe, is misleading and just plain wrong. These people are missing out on so much and I feel sorry for them. I can understand that some parents would be reluctant to let their children read a novel with a protagonist that stops at nothing to destroy his opponent, and vise-versa, but Harry is the exact opposite. He, along with his friends, learn the true meaning of friendship, trust, loyalty, self-reliance, compassion, and persistance through their many zany efforts in trying to solve the mystery in each book. These are qualities that our world's youth need to learn today, myself included. What do you think? Oh, by the way, the only complaint that I have about this book is that it was too short!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book and couldn't put it down! It is a very well written book that holds interest for all ages. I can't wait to finish the 3rd one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was like the other Harry Potter books, both before it and after it, wonderful! MY favorite books include those of C.S.Lewis,Tolkien, and most deffinately, J.K. Rowling. Of my contemporary favorite authors, which the numbers are few, The Harry Potter books are number one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is very exciting. Picking up the Chamber of Secrets means that you will not be able to put it down. Every single moment is soaked up into your head; it's like the words are being handed to you to hold onto for a long time. The dullest moment doesn't even exist in this book. I recommend this book to children and adults of all ages because it sparks your imagination into another complete world."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter's a really cool book.It's about a wizard.I think it's the best book I ever read.I know you'll like it.It's very amazing.It's a great book.Plese read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"this is a great book for 9 and up, this has action, and adventure it is a little scary for young ones but i read all 347 pages in 24 hours this was the best book out of the 3 i say and who could say it better for a kids book then a 10 year-old i think all should get this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"a series that i only read because my little brother recommended to me. and since my little brother really hates to read, i figured, okay, why not?why not indeed! the first book was really awesome, but you have to read it to gain full understanding of this one. also, this book lacks the excitement and twists of the other two books of the first three.harry potter is kind of a reflection of what everyone wants to be in life...someone popular, but not for nothing, someone who can maintain friendships, someone who can go to a fabulous school and break the rules without getting in too much trouble...even jesus broke the rules sometimes. so how can parents say that this is a bad read for children because it teaches them to turn to witchcraft?this book, along with the rest of the series, illustrates how so many people are biggots, afraid of what is different and unlike them. that is why, i think, that 'muggles' are portrayed through uncle vernon and his sniveling wife...to show that most people resent differences. i hope that all of you 'paranoid parents' that think this book will turn your child against god will read the book for yourself first. then maybe you can see which will have more influence on your kid-a book or a lifetime of your dedicated teaching."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is an exellent book! Harry Potter's adventures continue in this stunning sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"At the end of this book the reader is certainly going to be left speechless. The tension and uneasiness set from the very beginng when Harry meet Dobby to the very end when he, Ginny, Ron, and Lockheart arrive back to the school on Fawkes is incredible. One can not believe the caliber of stylistic writing and detail Rowling has poured into this novel. I'm 17 and desperately await the arrival of the third and fourth installment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What can I say? It was the best book I have ever read!

I think anybody who thinks this is bad stuff and it &quot;glorifies witchcraft and evil&quot; is nuts.(no offense to the religious people out there) This book can't get any better!

J.K Rowling knows how to write a suspenseful novel and knows how to get the attention of the reader. The Basilisk was very eerie and even I (I'm 17) got a little creeped out when Harry was hearing the Basilisk kill people. Who says the second is never as good as the first? Chamber of Secrets was just as good as The Socerors' Stone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Book 2 is very good, but I wouldn't read it without reading the Sorcerer's Stone first.This book was very good and I recommend reading the other 2 as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read the scorcerer's stone I was extatic about the way the seires went, the whole blot combobalating thing was fabulous, so I new I had to get the second which was better then the first!

I already have mine saved!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well here I go again. I wrote a review of Book I (2/9/00) andhere I am writing a review for II. I am over age 50 and I love thesebooks. Their outward simplicity should not dismiss that GOOD, when ithas to struggle, and take chances, wins out over EVIL, because genuinegood is based on a true heart and in the case of Harry Potter, is also based on faith and boundless friendship.Granted the stories are aimed at younger people (I think) but the lessons are inspiring and not unlike Tolkien or King Arthur.I agree these books are hard to put down. I strongly suggest that one begins with Book I and reads them in order because each book is a chronological experience of Wizard's school in Harry's life. Beginning with the first book, the reader develops a better understanding of the characters.Finally these would be great stories for a parent or grandparent to read to youngsters. Looking back on my past, this may well provide many rich and wonderful memories for children...Good luck, Harry, I am off to Book III.

Cuz I jus luv all the whole Harry Potter series! They are just fascinating.People often think that magic is not scientifically based and everything and we shouldn't believe it. That's what I think before I read The HP books, but now I think magic might jus be everywhere. (but don't get da wrong idea cuz I'm not dazing off everywhere and saying EVERYTHING's magical! ) Harry Potter is like a dream come true for children. Brave, adventurous, exciting, fun, all the right things for kids to idolize. I've never ever considered I'd like to read Fantasy books until now.

It's time for him to go back to Hogwarts, wizard and witchcraft school. Or is it? Just like I said Harry's an orphan. He lives with his Aunt and Uncle. Now don't get me wrong. They're not mean people. They're mean, crazy, messed up humans. Now the question is how will he escape? Watch Harry go through danger or possibly death. You're gonna love this book. This was my favorite Harry Potter book due to the huge fight at the end. I'd recommend this book to anyone that has a fairly good imagination. Now if you wanna know the truth, when I first heard about the Harry Potter series I thought it was a dumb messed up idea. Now look at me. I'm actually reviewing the book to others.

You won't regret it..BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book to my daughter of 3 years old. We both found it fun and captivating.

I hope the fun keeps going on until he ends up an adult."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really think that this book is so wonderful to read. i think that every elementary teacher should have this book to ryan to their class. it takes you on a fantastic journey through a mysterious place in London."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really think that Ron, Harry &amp; Hermine put together is just the stuff I'm looking for in my books!

I was drawn to the cover, and I LOVE books about magic. I almost didn't buy it-but now I'm glad I did! All of my friends have read it. When this boook came out, I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to the original Harry Potter-but it sure did! I could not put this book down. It twists and turns more times than you would think possible, and the ending is completly unexpected. I LOVE this series! JK Rowling rates up with Brian Jacques, JRR Tolkien, and Terry Brooks. I don't think I'll wait for the Prisoner of Azkaban to come out over here-and I can't wait for the fourth book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K.

I'm very picky about the books i read and try not to read unless i have to but i couldnt put this book down. You could almost wish the whole story were real and you were Harry or Hermione. The storyline is very suspensful like the first book and you feel you need to keep reading to find out what happens. I read the whole book in 2 and a half days which is pretty fast for me because i needed to know what happened next. This book is an all around good book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My son and I started out reading The Sorcerer's Stone to each other. It quickly became an individual race to the finish, especially after purchasing Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets, prior to completing The Sorcerer's Stone. We both finished both books in less than two weeks. A wonderful cast of characters and amazing creatures to keep young and old alike alike enthralled. My 10 year old son hopes Mr. Spielberg or Mr. Lucas are reading the books and that one of them will like the books as much as he likes them and that they will think Harry Potter would make a great movie hero. He also wonders if there is any possible way to really play Quidditch. We are now impatiently awaiting the arrival of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Kudos to J.K.

Not since &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; has a children's book enabled its reader to escape so completely to another world, that is Harry's eccentric school for wizards, and the name Voldemort, Harry's nemesis, instils a palpable sense of fear.

Have you ever felt that your favorite book was yours and yours only, and you never wanted to share it? Well, that's how I feel about this one. It seemed to me, that the adventure was more powerful and the mystery was deeper, and I liked that Herimone stayed during the holidays to help with the potion.

The whole series is great"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts, and things aren't going well. Harry starts off the year on the wrong foot and faces the possibility of expulsion should he do anything wrong. Students at Hogwarts are being attacked by something that Petrifies them, and nobody knows what it is, how to defend against, or how to defeat it. But rumors say it's a creature from the titular Chamber of Secrets, a hidden room in Hogwarts left by Salazar Slytherin, which only Slytherin's heir can open -- to inflict horror upon the school and purge it of any impurities (namely, non-pure-blooded wizards). Hogwarts is becoming increasingly unsafe for its students...All things considered, I'd probably rank this the weakest of the Harry Potter books. It lacks the novelty of the setting, characters, and so on of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (which is otherwise a fair contender for the title). It lacks the backstory developments that mark Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It lacks the extent of Harry's character development in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire or Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (although it does somewhat develop Harry, but not enough to truly satisfy), or the truly heightened stakes that mark the fourth to seventh books (and to a smaller extent the third book). And this book's overall significance really only becomes clear with all or nearly all of the series under one's belt. Dobby the character, and some of Dumbledore's ruminations at the end, are about the only mind chestnuts this book provides. Really, this book is a slightly zany mini-whodunit in which our favorite characters get more than their share of luck along the way toward solving the problem of the book.After books six and seven this book becomes less than throwaway to me. But before then, it doesn't do a huge amount for me. Three stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Even better the second time! My 7 year old son and I read it side-by-side.

It gives hight to the main characters and having introduced us to the wizarding world in book one, we are far more prepared for the excitement and adventure book two has to give us.

After reading the first book I took this one and could not put it down, I had to take it to work, I had to stop eating, and my loved ones forgot how I looked like, at least for the couple of days it took me to read it. The author really knows how to handle this amazing world full of imagination, you\`ll end up loving the characters and wishing for your own magic wand or Nimbus 2000. But also the book has a great plotline, complicated (at least for a grown up like me, probably the kids get it from the beggining) but interesting, with a surprise ending that will slap you in the face. Make sure to get it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that this book was wonderful!

Will he prove his innocence , and catch the culprit , or monster.Before everyone is turned to stone.By the help of his friends he just might do it.I loved this book , and the ending was the most surprising and unexpected.I highly recommend this book , and the rest of the Harry Potter series !!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book. J.K. Rowling wrote this book with a lot of description and conotation. This book's writing doesn't only tell it shows so that it can be pictured in young peoples minds. The beginning of the book starts off slow, but gradually gets more exciting as it reaches the climax. From then on the book is really exciting. The ending is great because it is unexpected. This book is awesome."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J.K. Rowlings, is the second of the four books in the Harry Potter series. Although it followed closely to the others in characters and themes, the way J.K Rowlings wrote her story did not catch my interest as the others did.Chamber of Secrets begins as the others do, describing Harry Potter's past and his life with his non-wizard family that hates him. His parents, who were wizards, were killed when he was just a baby and he life was miraculously spared. His aunt and uncle raised him, but they hated him because he was a wizard just like his parents. He led a miserable life until one day he received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwart's, a school for wizards in training. Harry is a very famous student; all the children know how an evil wizard killed his parents. This often puts Harry in the spotlight.In Chamber of Secrets, someone is putting a curse on many students and turning them into stone. There are a number of suspects, and one of them is Harry. He seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Although most people love and respect Harry, there is a student, Draco Malfoy that hates Harry. He tries to do whatever it takes to hurt Harry and blame him for all the accidents that are happening around Hogwarts. He even manages to convince most of the students that Harry is the one turning everyone to stone.Most of the book is about the accidents that happen at Hogwarts, Harry and his friends and a new teacher at the school. Although Harry wants to prove to everyone that he isn't the one behind all the accidents, this part of the storyline doesn't begin until the end. In the other Harry Potter books, the final adventure is build up throughout the story and that is why they are page-turners. In this volume, the beginning of the final scene starts at the very end and is solved quickly. Just as the book picks up, it ends almost abruptly.This volume, out of the four Harry Potter books, was my least favorite. It seems like J.K Rowlings was so excited about the fame of the first one that Chamber of Secrets was written quickly. In the first of the series and the ones after this one, there are many more details, both in the characters personalities, each of their storylines, and in the plot itself.Chamber's of Secrets is an enjoyable book. It is not as suspenseful and charming as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first of the Harry Potter series. It is worth reading though if one wishes. One does not have to read Chamber of Secrets to understand the third and fourth books in the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Since everything I could possibly say about this book has probably been said by the preceding 1750 reviewers, let me make this as quick as possible:1) All the humor from the first book is still here.2) This is the textbook definition of a perfect sequel. Keep in mind that there aren't too many of these (think of Star Wars and Godfather). Perfect sequel: in the style of the predecessor; moves grand plot forward; new characters do not detract/distract the old ones.3) Gilderoy Lockhart is the reincarnation of Gaston in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. Did I feel slighted? Not in the least. Not when it's done this well.4) Do I want to read the next one? You better believe it.About the only bad part was the last scene with the Head Evil Dude (inevitable, like that big boss you fight at the end of each level in a godzillion video games), which, again like the end of the first book, was just too...childish. That's about the only word that fits. I had the same complaint with the first book, so at least she's consistent (and I am, too). The more I think about this, the more I believe that this is an inherent, unavoidable feature for this type of a story. So take my diss with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the best of the harry potter series, I am not a real harry fan but this book was awsome and inspired me to read the rest in the series and still I think this one is the best"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I couldn't put down the first one, and I wasn't dissapointed with this either. It is truely play for your imagination to let your mind go and enter Harry Potter's world. And for the adults - don't let the fact that it's a &quot;children's&quot; book deter you. This is just the type of refresher we need in playfulness of the mind."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a fan of the Harry Potter series, altough i started reading it, just last summer, because of all the hype surrounding book 4, and i love it, really love it, i loved this book, but the first two chapters and the half of chapter three are weakley written, but by the half of chapter three, the story matures and gets better and better, this book it's really suspenful, great and wonderfully written, also if you love Harry Potter read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; series by J.R.R. Tolkien, they are really great as this series,i love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.r. Rowling has done it again.Harry potter has captured my sons and I imagination ! You cant help become imersed in Harry's world.All the characters (Ron,Hermione Hagrid,ect) have become more dimensional and quite lovable. The story line keeps you in total suspense! I love the way she portraits the ghost (Headless nick,Moanning Myrtle) they where my sons favorites..The whole book is just magical. We cant wait to see what happens to Harry next in 'Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;! Harry potterbooks are a must read for those who love the world of Magic.These books have begun the love of reading ,to my son, and that is a great gift. Plus we have so much to talk about now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After I've seen the movie of Harry Potter, I decided to read the next book, because I wanted to know, how the story is going on. The story of Harry Potter's life in the second year is again very interesting and exciting. Starting with the first page, you don't want to stop any more. It's like disease ridden, because all the time, you need to know the following pages. So only start reading this book, if you are sure that you have enough spare time ; )By reading the first few pages, the reader builds up a relationship with the person of Harry Potter. You imagine what he really feels, what he thinks and you will identify with the story. In the beginning of the book, Harry is again at his aunt and uncle in the Muggle world. Here, everyone can identify with the person of Harry Potter, and can imagine his problems. The reader hopes for Harry, that he can enhance his situation. In the world of wizardry Harry is a famous person, but he has also enemies, that want to see Harry dead.All these chapters are not only interesting for his content, it is also nice to build up a imagine world with all the huge buildings, the feasts in the big hall, the forbidden wood, .... and of course all the creatures and monsters.Till the end of the book you get many important and interesting clues, so that it is really challenging to try to solve the mystery while you are reading the book. I can congratulate J.K.Rowling to the end of the book. She took all different clues and combined them to a logical ending.I think, the different books of Harry Potter are not only interesting for children, also grown-ups will be fascinated by the relationship of the magic world on the one hand, and the our real world on the other."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hi it's Cristina Weaver again. As you know, I've read the series.I think that the 2nd one was actually the worst so far.Yeah, it's exciting and all, but I think the other books were better. So, that's why I only gave this book a 4."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was not as good as any of the other three. It was confusing and gruesome, near the end. I wouldn't NOT read it if you haven't yet, because it's interesting and if you don't read it, you'll miss parts and then parts of the third book won't make sense. It's not as good as the others, but it's interesting, so I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love this book and I don't understand why some people don't like it!!

I thought that you might not like a book in a series but you should read it so the other books make sense.so I recomend this book to all of you reading this not because it is super good but because books 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7(when 5, 6 and 7 come out)will make more sense."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books like the rest of the world it seems and this one is the bad one. It was just awful. You should read it though if you want to know whats going on. The end was just so dum I was literally laughing my head off. If you want to skip this book and go to the next which is much much better. If you know your fanasy animals like me you would know that they totaly messed up on the whole baslisk thing. So that is why I give this book a low rating. This one is the bad one. The rest are much better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Some people say that Harry Potter is too overrated and is way to commercialized. I agree, but it's still a great book. Read it and find out for your self. You enter a fantasy world of wizards, giants, floo powder and flying cars. This is the best book I've ever read. No doubt."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the Harry Potter books! I turely think they are really interesting. I read this book for school because i needed 100 hours of reading and now I am reading it for pure enjoyment. I cant wait to get the third book! I think the series is a book for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling books are great! I never liked to read but after I read the fist Harry Potter book I was hooked and I couldn't stop! Some opened the Chamber Of Secrets and everyone is getting petrified. So if you want a really good but not boring book,chose Harry Potter and you to will like reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the best book ever written. It has a great plot and great new charecters. I can ruin a little bit of the story by saying that Hermione and Ron think that Harry is the heir. I'm not going to say much more about that concept so you'll have to buy the book yourself. My favorite charecters happen to be Harry (of course) and Dobby. I don't think Dobby should have to shut his hand in an oven to be punished but he is a house-elf. So what I'm trying to say is... Get off your big butt off the internet and go buy Harry Potter and The Scorcer's Stone and Harry Potter and The Chmaber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I suggest that you read this book. After reading the first book, I knew immediately that the second book was going to be &quot;The Bomb&quot;! And it was! I was hooked on it till the end! Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was just as good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was as suspenseful and quirky as the previous one and so hard to put down that I read all 341 pages in a single day. Who wouldn't fall in love with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger as they search Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from top to bottom for the mysterious monster that whispers to Harry and kills muggles, or non-magic folks, during the night. I highly recommend this novel. It is a delightful summer read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was as good as the first one! J.K. Rowling has done it again!!

I'm just kidding.I don't know who it is yet.Im in the middle of the book.But anyway, this book is great, and J.k Rowling is the best author in the whole wide world.Who else could write such a revolting, keeps-the-reader-peeing-in-his-pants book? I don't anybody else, but if they could write better books, they've got to be real geniuses.As you know there will be seven harry potter books in all, so hurry up and get the prisoner of azkaban, before everyone beats ya to it!!!!

Not only do I highly recommend this book, but even I could not put it down!!! It is very imaginative, intelligent and funny!

I can't wait for the next one!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"People, People!!!!!!!!!!!! READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!! If you haven't already. In ten days I will be getting both books for my birthday although I have already read them both!! I made my parents buy the books for me because they are the best books ever written. Thank-you for reading this!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Teachers, if you want to turn on your students to reading, the Harry Potter books are an excellent beginning. J.K. Rowling keeps the reader (or listener) in grand suspense and she uses colorfully fun language. They are both very easy reading for youngsters but keeps adults wanting more. They are a must-have in your personal library. Harry is a truly loveable character... you feel sorry for him because he is treated so unfairly but he triumphs in all his endeavors. The first book was a blast and the second was just as great as the first. Ms. Rowling, please keep them rolling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I adored Harry Potter and the Soreceror's Stone, and suprisingly, I liked the second one even more! It was much more exciting and the plot was more complicated. It is brilliant how J.K. Rowling tied the story together at the end. I kept on switching back and forth on my guesses of who was the attacker. I could't close the book for one minute!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is looking forward all summer to go back to Hogwarts. One day a elf like creature named Dobby not to go back but Harry goes back anyway. Later on everyone who is not a pure-blooded wizard turns into stone.Some people who are pure-blooded get turned to stone because they know something about the Chamber of Secrets. Harry finds the truth about who really opened the Chamber of Secrets. Moaning Mytle died from the creature and is turned into a ghost. You will really enjoy this book. Some parts scared me but I have never read a book like this. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just as good as the first. A very hard thing to accomplish. I have to wait 'til October for the next one. Darn!!!!! Harry Potter would be good to read around the campfire. Just alot of fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book this last week and stayed up until 11:00 to finsh my book. It really kept me interested. Normally I wouldn't have read the whole book, but this one I did along with Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. I really think all kids my age (11) should read the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am going into grade 5, and I LOVE Harry Potter so much. I read each book at least 1 time a week. I love reading about Harry because he can do magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book non-stop for 2.5 days, I didn't do much of anything else. It appeals to me because I always have longed for wizards to exist, and in Harry's world I can shed my muggle skin enter a world of magic and mayhem. J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius. All the stars in the night sky aren't enough to rate this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am going to be a Junior in high school and I absolutely loved it. I found this book lying on a table at home where my little brother dropped it. I skimed through and started reading. I finished it that afternoon and decided to look through his books for the other Harry Potter story. It is a wonderful book and you should definately read it even if you are older than 12."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you enjoy reading to your child or having your child read to you, I strongly recommend this book. It has everything a child likes, a good-hearted child, a mean family, magic and lots of suspense. I would recommend this book for children 5 to 100."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I pre-ordered this book to read aloud to my 5th grade students after having read the first Harry Potter book to them, which they absolutely LOVED. It arrived about two weeks before the end of school, so we had marathon reading sessions, and once again fell under the spell of J.K. Rowling. I'm absolutely amazed that she can write with such an uncanny ability to say exactly the types of things kids want to hear -- Ron and the slugs was a masterful touch! As a teacher, anything that keeps my students enthralled with books is a winner with me, and the Harry Potter books are a phenomenal success; I even did a bulk order through Amazon for half my class after they begged me to order the books for them! Truly amazing!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The best nook I have read in a long time since Roald Dahl. I think J K Rowling should keep making Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The sequel to 'Harry Potter and The Sorceror's Stone is almost as enchanting. The Characters weren't as 'tight' as they were in the first book, and in some places things seemed to be forced out by the author. Still Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you like heroes to be heroes, always, and villians to be villains,evil and forever, read the book and don't go any further with this review, it's beyond you. If you know that good and evil are mixed in all, keep reading.In these books, you can safely assume that good and evil will remain separated forever. Each character contains one and only one of the two. I'm not counting pre-adolescent hijinks, which the good characters indulge in, as evil.Not to contradict myself, but there are a few dark tones in the good characters--but these seem to be because the author has overlooked it or not had enough moral character to realize the problem. For example, why has the headmaster permitted a certain individual to remain unjustly accused and convicted for fifty years? It doesn't speak well for &quot;the greatest wizard&quot;. This is beyond the ken of the 11-year-olds the author is shooting for, and so goes overlooked.The author plays to the prejudices of the 11 year olds. The fat are treated cruelly--they sit on items and break them, or have their clothes falling down, anything for cheap laughs. Needless to say, none of Harry's friends are fat.The logic puzzle in the first book is useless, since the reader cannot see the bottles--it is necessary to know the position of the largest and smallest bottle for a full solution. However, the reader is not supposed to solve the puzzles in these books, I think. In the second book, a character's name (including the middle name, never previously given) form an anagram of another's, PLUS THE WORDS &quot;I AM . . . &quot;. No way for the clever reader to solve it, he is never given all the clues.Quiddish is a nice idea. However, the author has not been able to come up with new ideas for the game, and in the second book, it is mostly ignored. Kudos to the author for coming up with the minor character of the quiddish captain, noble but obsessed, might have come straight out of Tom Brown's Schooldays.The author might have been smarter not to try to describe the elements of magic society in the second book. All are extraneous to the plot, and lend themselves to contradictions (what WERE the consequences of the sighting of the flying cars?) The author could have just concluded that a pre-adolescent wouldn't see or understand much of it, and let it go.As far as I can see, we're being set up for a final confrontation with the Dark Side, which should please the young readers, and a love triangle, which should bore them out of their minds. I hope the author makes the characters more interesting and fallible, the villians a bit nicer, some interesting ideas, and a better editor (at one point, &quot;ancestor&quot; is used where &quot;descendant&quot; is meant).By the way, shouldn't these kids learn a little algebra and so forth at Hogwarts? Not to mention sex ed!g"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I know by doing this, I risk the hatred of the entire world. Please don't hate me. I'm only voicing my opinion. I think that Harry Potter requires no thought; you hate the villans, you love the heroes. I'm not saying that they're bad. They aren't. They're imaginative, and funny, and all-round feel-good books. I do recommend them, but not if you're looking for marvellously worked-out, amazingly profound books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Three stars is nothing to be ashamed of, and I grant them here primarily for grownups; kids from about 14 down would surely award four or five.&quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is just as good as the first Harry Potter book. Darker, yes; there are more scary elements (a giant-spiders-in-the-forest scene highly reminiscent of &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; but with a different twist), and more characters hurt or imperiled. But quite a bit of humor, too, from the &quot;Happy Deathday&quot; party and Moaning Myrtle, the ghost in the toilet, to just about everything to do with the flashy but fraudulent wizard Gilderoy Lockhart.Lamentably, there is only one Quidditch game in this book, but the self-driven car, the inspired new character of the elf Dobby, and other elements (I especially loved the paragraph -- I think it comes from Ron -- describing deadly books) almost make up for that. I found the climax just a little less compelling than the one in the first book, but perhaps that is partly because the novelty has worn off just a bit.(Typography note: my hardcover copy misspells &quot;minuscule&quot; in a way that is all too common on page 242; but otherwise this book appears to be cleaner than many published solely for grownups these days.)Happily on to book three...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book shows the talents of an extremely good author, and a very imaginative plot. Actually, this would be a superb book, if it werent for the hero himself, Harry Potter. Harry is a mean, lucky, and rather snobbish character who never deserves the fame he gets. In all three books of the series, he defeats his enemy through luck or the help of some other character. He recieves presents anually, but NEVER GIVES ANYONE ANYTHING BACK! He is rich, yet won't spend a cent on his 'friends'. I say, keep up the good storytelling, great plots, and fantastic use of imagination, BUT GET A NEW CHARACTER! Sheesh!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a better book that the first book. In fact, I told my daughter to read this one first, which you can do because the author goes to great lengths to reexplain anything that is mentioned from the first book (which is fairly annoying if you did read the first book). This book had nearly the same plot as the first, just different scenery.I like the lead characters. I can't really get a good mental picture of Ron other than his red hair. The author just doesn't describe him like she does the other characters, you just know him by his actions.So, after my first two years at Hogwarts I can now turn my '91 Astro into a owl. I'm on my way the the Jaguar...On to year three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is certainly a quite a good book, but it isn't the best. Everyone is saying how wonderful Harry Potter is, but personally I've read better books. The plot is rather weak, and I think it's just a bad novel that happened to atract an audience. Good literature is hardly ever on the best seller list."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that the only reason this book gets the kind of reviewsit does it because it is written for nine year olds. The plot issimplistic (for kids) and any adult who found this book to be great fantasy novel, should probably look in the adult section next time they go into a book store. For all of you that want to read a great novel that will envelope you without the need to spell everything out, read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Ordering from Amazon was a very simple and mostly pleasant experience.

At the same time it's mysticl and magical which goes into a mystery storyline. i also rate this book 3 stars because the chararcters connect when they are solving thier problems.i recommend this book to ages 10-12 because they will understand the difficult words better than little kids. The storyline changed and a more advanced mind like a 11 year old might understand the words better than a 7 year old.i think the protagonist Harry Potter is very suspicious during the time the first strike happene's. Tom Riddle is soneone that is very precise of his work.I think is very slow in the beginning because it is telling the basics of the storyline. I also think the action is very well described."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry's second year back, what will he do now? Harry Potter and his to friends Ron and Hermione are back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for more adventure, even thought in the last book, Harry defeated Lord Voldermort she story doesn't stop there.

They search for the hidden Chamber of Secrets, and eventually find it with evil Tom Riddle, a basilisk, and Ron's little sister Ginny. With the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix he defeats the basilisk and Tom and saves Ginny all in a matter of hours. I enjoyed this book because it was packed with adventure.I liked that there was a sense of mystery wrapped in the book and it kept you thinking what was going to happen next.I liked that even thought it was in a series, it had its own originality in it, unlike some other books that you read. Most of them are just a continuation of the many books.I liked that this book shows that good always wins over evil not only in books but in sometimes in real life situations.I really liked reading this book, and I would like to continue reading the other books in the series.TA"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought this book because I had read the Sorcerer's Stone which had really pleased me. This entertained me just as much. I think that the Chamber of Secrets really is much more funny and filled with jokes, more entertaining than the original.

I've enjoyed reading about them so much that I'm waiting in deep anticipation for the 3rd book, which I've already ordered. I think J.K. Rowling is right up there next to Roald Dahl.

Now, All I talk about is Harry Potter. he's my hero even though he is only a book. I read the 2 every month, and know everything about them. I'd dare anybody to challenge me to a trivia quiz on Harry Potter. I even convinced my teacher to stop reading Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, and read Harry Potter. Even some of the wild kids sit down and listen to Harry's adventures at Hogwarts.

New characters are introduced nicely and there is a lot of good action to keep you reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"...The world-building also becomes a little more developed since the first book - Rowling takes us to a few new places, and we learn a little more about the wizard world: new methods of transportation, for instance, and wizards' apparently complete ignorance of anything non-magical. Ron's dad works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department at the ministry, and when he seems so genuinely dazzled by the workings of non-magical items, asking Harry about things like escalators and the Underground, I always think of the line from that Insane Clown Posse song - \\"f____n' magnets, how do they work?\\"One thing I like about Chamber of Secrets is how much more action there is than in The Sorcerer's Stone - there's a lot of suspense, then once the pieces are in place, it gets very exciting. I mean, that sword at Harry's hip? Yeah, not just cover art. He gets to use a sword. He also gets sprayed with blood (though it isn't too graphic for the age group of the target audience). It is kind of awesome.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"THIS BOOK, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBERS OF SECRETS, IS EXCELLENT, WE BUY THIS BOOK ONE YEAR A GO AND ALL THE FAMILY READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Added to a collection of Harry Potter books for friend at Christmas.

But just as Harry was planning to go back, he received a warning from a house elf that if he go back to Hogwarts, he will be in danger. Harry really wanted to go back to Hogwarts so he did not care about the warning. Harry's second year at Hogwarts was dangerous and has some mysteries. One day at the school, Harry saw a sigh that the Chamber Of Secrets was opened again. Everyone in the school has the same mysteries about the Chamber of Secrets: where the entrance to the Chamber was, who opened it this time, and who was the Slytherin heir. In the meantime, two Gryffindors, one Hufflepuff, and one Ravenclaw was petrified. When the news spread and the whole school knew what happened, they walked together in groups to their classes. Harry and his friends then started their adventures."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well the day after finishing the first in the series I raced out to get book 2.

When i had it bought for me i decided to read it anyway. When i got started i just couldn't put it down, i found it very addictive and thrilling!!In some books like this i can almost always guess and be right at what the ending is going to be or even what's coming next, but Joanne Rowling wrote this in a supurb way and even if i did guess there was a twist in it and it all changed.This made it exciting and fun to read on to the next section.Whilst reading the chapter:Dobby,i felt really upset at the way that he was treated. In the end i was really pleased that he got freed and was away from all of the slavery and horrible treatment that he was given.This book is a very well witten and thought out book, i enjoyed it very much and recommend it for my age group!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You have to read the first bool to understand the first few chapters.

Not because it's a good book. But because it's a excellent book. The super imagination of J.K Rowling is what the book needs, but not the only thing. The book needs YOUR imagination as well. It needs you to imagine it and lock it in your mind as you read about the magic, fun, and HORROR that happens at Hogwarts. It is not a really scary book, but when you read it, you get a chill that runs through you. There are new characters and they don't take away from the story... they ADD to it.

However the Chamber of Secrets has always been my favorite of the books. I have always thought of books 1-3 and books 5-7 as separate groups with book 4 connecting them. This said Book 2 foreshadows the Horcruxes and later events in the series but without the overly dark tone that is in 5-7 where these themes become more prominent. In Chamber Harry and Ron have to overcome the temporary loss of Hermione who is always the brains of the group, they overcome the suspicion that Harry is the villain, as well as dealing with a incompetent professor with an over-sized ego. There is a great bit of character development along with a suspenseful plot. So as I said, the best out of all 7 books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just now reading the books so I can have a movie marathon lol fun to finally read all the books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter book is even better than its predecessor.

Of course, we know Harry and his friends now. But Ms. Rowlings seems to have stopped practicing and is doing a really good job here. I am an adult and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And the Harrymania has achieved one good thing: even kids that do not usually read discover books now, and they get to know what an exciting pastime reading actually is."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love all the Harry Potter books, but this is my favorite so far. I enjoyed the intricate puzzles in the chamber, and as always, the interaction between Harry, Herimone and Ron. I've been unable to put any of these books down, and have ended up scheduling to start them on a Saturday morning, so I won't be disturbed by the little things that get in the way of my reading (like, food, work, my dog, etc...). All of the Harry Potter books will be kept on my \\"To Keep\\" bookshelf, where only my really favorite ones reside, but when I'm in the mood to re-read my old favorites, the Chamber of Secrets will be the first one I choose."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"First, I absolutely reccomend that you read the first book (even if you've seen the movie) before reading this 2nd installment to fully appreciate and enjoy the work. Although \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" does stand on its own and contains all the basic info in case you didnt read \\"Sorceror's Stone\\", the first book does such a wonderful job of setting up the exposition and world of Hogwarts so that you are already excited as Harry is to see Ron again when they reunite in this story.Although \\"Sorceror's Stone\\" does capture all the wonder and discovery, I did find this book to have a bit more excitement and mystery which was needed to progress the adventure in this fun series. The first few chapters each end with great \\"cliff-hanging\\" page-turning suspense and the wild excitement happens even before Harry reaches Hogwarts for his second year.There is a few new characters introduced such as ego-maniac Prof.Gilderoy (the new defense against the dark arts instructor), and Ginny (Ron's younger sister), along with a few new ghosts roaming the halls (or stalls) and monsters of the forbidden forest. There's also a few new tricks and magical discoveries without negating what we've already learned during our Freshman year.I do worry that parts of this story may be too intense for younger readers. Some of the final scenes involve abstract psychosis and even death. By the end, most of the hero's are restored, but some parents might find it still disturbing and use caution.(just read it yourself beforehand and use your judgement. It might even lend to good discussion with your child)I did find the plot twists and final confrontation exciting and caught myself off-guard with surprises (\\"I can't believe I didnt pay much attention when that happened in the bookshop!\\"), especially because the reader is usually caught in the daily life, humor, and mischief of life at Hogwarts School.As an adult, I have the guilty pleasure of finding great fun and escapism in these books. I think J.K.Rowling has done another wonderful job capturing the anxieties and friendships of a childhood and presenting them in the magical way we wished we had them.PS: After reading books 1&2 in paperback, I instantly invested in getting the box set of 1-4 in hardcover."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is a bit of a let down after the excellent Sorceror's Stone. The story is still well written and engaging, however the plot seems to be rehashed from the first book. Too often I felt as though elements of the Sorceror's Stone were lifted wholesale and placed in Chamber of Secrets. Because of that everything seemed familiar and as though you'd been there before. A writer as talented as Ms. Rowling should be taking us places we've never been before instead of resting on her laurels.I'd really give it 3.5 stars but since that's not an option I'll round up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"All of J. K. Rowling's books are very good, but Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would have to be my favorite. It had such good writing that while I was reading it, I could picture everything happening in my head. My family owns every single Harry Potter book that has come out so far. These books are so good that I am reading them all over again. My favorite part in Harry Potter books would have to be Quidditch. If you haven't read the books Quidditch is sort of like a mix between basketball and soccer. My favorite part in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would have to be when he meets up with the Basilisk. I won't tell you what it is because you have to read the book to find out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Even as a senior in high school, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets! Well written and delightfully imaginative, J.K. Rowling's tales of Harry and his Hogwarts pals are thoroughly refreshing and not a bit too juvenile. Readers of all ages with a bit of imagination will enjoy Rowling's writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that the Harry Potter books teach wonderful values: sharing, kindness to others, not judging others by appearance...all the values that I think children should learn. Besides being a positive influence, the books, Chamber of Secrets included, are all witty and entertaining for both kids and adults alike. And, Chamber of Secrets was a pretty good one, as far as Harry Potter books go!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"With all respect the book had a wonderfull theme and great characthers, but poor illustration and a writing for childrens of 8 years; it surely was not boring but it was poor on details and a very rudde writing, but anyway i enjoy the book.Sergio Arguello."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was really interesting and it made you want to countinue reading the book.

With a mystical beast unleashing havoc during the nightime at Hogwarts, the school is placed in a constant state of fear and paranoia. Harry, furthermore, begins to be suspected of nefarious deeds, as it is revealed to the world that he can speak to snakes, a trait possessed by Voldemort himself. When talk arises that the heir of Slytherin has come to Hogwarts to rid the school of Muggle-borns, Harry becomes the prime suspect of a large number of students due to his ability to speak Parseltongue.Many students are found paralyzed by a mysterious force. Professor Dumbledore is forced to leave the school, Hagrid is taken to prison, blamed for the attacks, and the tragic nature of the attacks hits home, as one close to Harry is taken to the brink of death. Harry and friends scramble to unmask the true heir of Slytherin....the only question is, will they do it in time to save one they love?This is an exciting continuation of the Harry Potter magical journey. Continue to read with the Boy Who Lived!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked this book a bit better than Sorcerer's Stone, just because it was a bit more action-packed. The best part I thought was either when Harry went into the Chamber Of Secrets to rescue the kidnapped Ginny Weasley, or when he learned he was a Parseltongue (person who talks to snakes.) I'd recommend this book to any Harry Potter fan out there!(:"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is about Harry's second year at Hogwarts and he's having a good time. Things have been running considerably smoother than his first year and his summer spent with the Dursleys until Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover a message written on the wall of Hogwarts. The message is written in blood. The trio know this isn't a good sign, so, they decide to investigate. Through a series of trials to save Ron's younger sister, Ginny, you'll find yourself rooting for Harry, Ron, and Hermione more than you thought was possible."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets seems to be the least favorite book of many HP fans. However, for many years The Chamber of Secrets was my second favorite book (this was before I read Deathly Hallows and followed my other favorite The Goblet of Fire). There's just something about it that's so captivating, a bit moreso than The Sorcerer's Stone.I think my love for The Chamber of Secrets stems from the fact that this is the first time we get an in-depth introduction to the elder Weasleys. In fact, I think the chapter where Harry goes to the Burrow might be my FAVORITE chapter out of all seven books (or at least my favorite \\"fluffy\\" chapter). Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are just really great characters and so my love for that chapter knows no bounds.Of course, The Chamber of Secrets also holds my LEAST favorite chapter out of all seven books: Nearly Headless Nick's Deathday Party (I can totally see why it was excluded from the movie). It's just such a boring chapter. I do like St. Nicholas, but mostly in small increments. Devoting a whole chapter to him, though, is not my idea of fun.I also loved the whole rivalry between Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slythering. I found it fascinating how Slytherin only wanted \\"pure\\" bloods in the school and didn't want any Muggle-borns in (there has to be some allegorical meaning behind THAT). Plus, I remember reading the line \\"The Chamber of Secrets has now been opened. Enemies of the heir, BEWARE\\" and literally getting chills on my arm (I'm a bit weird that way).Oh and let's not forget the inclusion of two very lovable characters: Dobby and Gilderoy Lockheart. There's no need to go in to why Dobby is loveable (he's sweet, loyal, and he's so easy to sympathize with), but Lockheart needs a teeny bit of explaining. He's hilarious. That's it. That's the only reason why I love him. Sure he has a big head and thinks he's God's gift to the wizarding world, but again, he just has such fantastic one-liners (\\"celebrity is as celebrity does\\" and my personal favorite \\"It's like magic!\\").So, yes, I love Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It's always one of the books out of the series that I look most forward to reading. But, let's face it, I look forward to reading ALL of the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After watching the movie, I have wondered what's it like reading the book and by knowing how the characters looked like and their voices, just reading the book was much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is Harry Potter's 12th birthday, and no one is there to celebrate with him. The Dursley's don't remember a thing, and why should they care? But what's bothering Harry most is that Ron and Hermione haven't written him all summer - and now he's stuck in his cupboard room, trying to keep quiet.That night, however, he is visited by a strange little elf named Dobby, who has a secret. He tells Harry not to go back to Hogwarts - if he does, his life will be in great danger. When Ron, Fred, and George Weasley break Harry out of his locked room, they lose Dobby and Harry forgets all thoughts of what the elf was trying to warn him about....until even stranger things happen. The entrance to the train stop to go to Hogwarts won't allow them through, there's a voice that only Harry hears, and there's writing on the wall about the Chamber of Secrets being open.But when someone - or something - starts Petrifying students, and Harry's reputation is on the line, he, Ron, and Hermione must investigate the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets and discover who is behind these dreadful attacks...before the monster can strike again - and this time kill.______________________________________________My thoughts -I love this book! I'm so happy to be further into the series now and I can't wait to read book #3! There is so much to love about this book... The fun characters, the original atmosphere, and the well-built story. This is quality literature and I'm definitely a fan.Character notes -These characters are just so wonderful. From Harry Potter himself to his best friends to Colin Creevy to Draco Malfoy - they all have something to offer. My personal favorites include Fred and George, the mischievous Weasley twins who never fail to make me laugh. But then, why not mention the whole family? I like Percy and how brooding he is but part of me says I shouldn't trust him; Mr. Weasley's curiosity of Muggle's and their lives is hilarious; Mrs. Weasley has a loud voice and a temper, but a kind heart and you can't help loving her; Ron is just adorable with his fiery red hair; and Ginny made quite a debut in this story!While Harry isn't my favorite character ever, I do like him, and he made more of an impact on me in the second book than the first. I love how, when the story came to an end, he and all the rest of the characters had grown a little more - showing off Rowling's smooth development skills and making me smile with delight.Story notes -If I had to pick between this book and the first, I'd say this one. It immersed me more into the whole Voldemort/Harry war, was better written, and had a bit older feel (after all, Harry is a second year)...but all the while it kept to the same lightheartedness that I loved about the first one. The atmosphere is any author's dream for his or her story. I laughed at all the street names, shop names, and even the names of people (Gilderoy Lockhart, for one). I cringed when I thought of what could happen to the students if the monster of the Chamber of Secrets was let loose on Hogwarts. I rooted for Harry and Ron and felt bad for the bullied kids. I despised a few certain Malfoy characters (who doesn't?), and, when the climax came around and the twists were revealed, my jaw dropped and I gasped. I hadn't been expecting anything near what I got - and I was so pleased with the results. Good, satisfying storytelling.One word to sum up this book (final thoughts) -Can I be cheesy here? My one word description for this lovely book would have to be charming. Quite literally. I was charmed into their world and didn't want to be let go! It's a good thing there are five books left for me to read, and that they're quite long, too. I'm pleased. I had the notion, when The Chamber of Secrets was just beginning, that J. K. Rowling could write a bunch of nonsense about wizards and witches and potions and funny shops and malfunctioning wands and ghosts and I'd still be fascinated... Can't wait for the next book, The Prisoner of Azkaban!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the entire Harry Potter series. It transports the reader to a fantasy world full of mystery and intrigue, yet is appropriate and enjoyable for all ages. To have this book in a leather-bound collector's edition makes it even more special. I only wish all of the volumes were published this way. This particular edition is leatherbound with gilt-covered page edges and comes with a protective clear sleeve cover. I found my experience with the seller on Amazon to be very professional and pleasant. I appreciate the fast shipping and quality customer service."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In the first book we see young Harry Potter who lives with his uncle and aunt, experience his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this one Harry is about to start his second year at the school, but it seems a little house elf is conspiring to stop Harry from returning to the school.It is summer vacation, and Harry is not having a good one, since he hadn't heard from his friends, Ron and Hermione. One day, Dobby, a house-elf, appeared and warned Harry not to return to Hogwarts. In fact, Dobby was the reason Harry did not receive letters from his friends. Dobby also caused a ruckus so Uncle Vernon locked up Harry, but he managed to escape when his friend Ron and his twin brothers came with a flying car.Harry also had problems getting on the Hogwarts Express, as he and his friend Ron couldn't pass through the barrier to platform 9 3/4, so they took the flying car to Hogwarts and was almost killed when they ran into the Whomping Willow. The year definitely did not start very well for Harry, not to mention soon Harry was hearing strange voices in the walls. Then, incidents began to happen where students were found petrified in the hallways, and Harry, being our young hero, found himself in the midst of it, especially when it was discovered that he can speak Parseltongue, aka speak to snakes.The second book to this series is just as delightful as the first, if not more so. There's plenty of dry humor spread throughout the book, little moments that will make any reader smile. However, there's also serious moments when you hope nothing bad will happen to Harry and his friends, although you know nothing will happen to them. Also touching is the strong friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione, formed over the first book, a bond that became unbreakable over the course of the series (although there're always spats like any friendship).Now off to the 3rd book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I might read lots of books but I kind of resisted getting on the Harry Potter bandwagon. However, I finally succumbed and now I see what all the fuss is about. I loved the first book in the series and have just finished this one. I am now officially hooked. I am kind of glad I waited now as I can read them all at once instead of waiting a year for the next one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes, I was a latecomer to the party!

This book is excellent for all kinds of readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling is one of the most gifted writers I've yet come across. The first Harry Potter book was recommended to me by one of my fourth grade students who had been sent the book by an aunt in Great Britain. He carried on so about how wonderful the book was that I felt I ought to give it a quick read. Little did I know that I was about to be swept into a wonderful world of wizards, witches, and magic (not to mention Muggles) and entertained in such grand style. Rowling's talent cannot be overstated; she is masterful at bringing Harry's worlds--both Muggle and Magic--to life. Since I have gotten hooked on Harry, it seems the disease has been spreading throughout the entire fourth and fifth grades in our school. We were able to get the Chamber of Secrets via our British connection over the Christmas holiday, and we have all been delighted by Harry's latest adventures. J.K. Rowling, keep those books coming! Your faithful readers are impatiently waiting!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After finishing &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; I couldn't wait for the next one. I was really excited when my older brother brought &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; home from England for me. It wasn't quite as good as the first one because it didn't have as much action, but I found his new adventures still to be very exciting. I really want to play &quot;Quidditch&quot;! I can't wait until the third Harry Potter book comes out.Peter"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you are the kind of Harry Potter fan that has to have everything, then you probably have considered purchasing the Collector's editions. This Collector's Edition is very similar in binding and looks to its predecessor, Sorcerer's Stone, and markedly different from the last two Collector's Editions, Order of the Phoenix and Half- Blood Prince. It is my honest opinion that if you are looking to invest in a collector's edition of any of the HP books, the first two are the most handsome and display- worthy. The \\"Box set\\" feel of the latter two Collector's editions are lovely, however the bindings are no different than the Hardcover editions (although the dust jacket artworks are unique to the collector's editions). The first two Collector's editions are a leather binding, with gilded page edges and have the feel of a true collectable for adults.This edition of Chamber of Secrets is bound in red leather with a lightweight, translucent plastic dust cover to protect the leather. The leather binding is very tight and clean and the gilded page edges can suffer a fair ammount of page flicking without flaking or rubbing off. It also includes a small piece of jacket art (same artwork from the dust jacket of the hardcover edition) that would be suitable for framing. This edition would be better kept away from the hands of children if you want your copy to stay clean and pristine.I have to honestly say that my favorite portion of this edition is the spine of the book, which is just beautiful to look at in red leather and gold lettering, and Harry's lightning- shaped scar in gold along the spine adds a touch of whimsey, reminding the reader that, as beautiful as this binding is, this is a book about fun and adventure for all ages.If you are looking for a Harry Potter collectable edition, this one is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I must confess that as an adult I too have become addicted to the series. As a Christian, I was somewhat concerned about the magical elements at first.

A fun book to read to your children!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The huge snake was cool, but I liked the phoenix a lot better than the snake. The phoenix was really really cool. I thought it was pretty. The book is a little bit too bloody, but it was still good. Recommended for twelve and over, even if I am 7."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of was an exciting novel to be read by any literate person young and old. Although short in length when comparing it to the final book, The Chamber of Secrets leaves nothing short of pure perfection. The descriptive dialogue between Harry, Hermione, Ron and the deceitfully evil Draco Malfoy entangles the reader with the problems of being a famous wizard at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Twisting and turning through writings on the wall, whispering voices and a fifty year old percieved myth, J.K. Rowling makes each step of the Harry Potter legend better than before, crushing the previous books with ease and precision. Harry Potter is not just a book about a tale of a secret chamber and it's inhabitant, but the unraveling of a mysterious life. Inside of each experience there lies a small chunk of Harry's life and the life he never knew. J.K. Rowling entangles Harry's Quidditch lessons, classes, teachers, and trouble with information about the young wizards past and family. How his parents died, what the man was like who killed him, and everyone that is hiding Harry's life-threatening fears and most potent of hopes. It is he alone who must uncover the mystery to the Chamber of Secrets and save his friends from turning to stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Needless to say, I am an avid Harry Potter fan. I'm seventeen and I decided to give this whole Harry Potter thing a go. I picked up the first book (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) in paperback and finished it in a day. I've read ALL FOUR Harry Potter books in a week and a half time period (No lie! The 4th one took the longest, being as that it is 734 pages long). Anyway, I must say, out of the series, this is one of the best Harry Potter books (number 4 is the best) and you must read it. The Cover art is vivid and captures the imagination along with J.K.'s excellent choice of words. PARENTS: Don't just think these books are for the kiddies. I guarantee if you read them, you'll love them too(trust me, I'm a teen and we don't like anything!)In this series you deal with Malfoy being a jerk (nothing new),students turning to stone, Moaning Mertyle, giant spiders, flying cars, and the possibility that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named could be back...Ginny joins her brothers (The Weasleys) in the Hogwarts traditions and many more surprises are in store for you. I PROMISE YOU:Get this book and you WON'T be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love books and am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and this one is definitly one of my favorites (after number one). It continues the story of Harry Potter and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. In the begining Uncle Vernon is having guests and Harry in his room is suprised when a a elf like creature named Dobby (prounoced Doughbe)comes and tells him not to go to Hogwarts. To find out why read the rest it's great!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was fabulous. I'm 27 and I love that I can enjoy these books at my age. They are very easy reading and the story takes you out of your ordinary life and brings you into a world of magic, flying brooms, three headed dogs, dragons, and talking hats. J.K. Rowling is a mystical genius. It's not too often you find stories that parents and their children can enjoy and get excited about. You go girl for bringing families together."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a fantasy story-teller about the world of magic, J.K. Rowling has enjoyed remarkable success. The adventures of Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts, the school where young wizards learn the skills of magic, are highly imaginative and thoroughly enjoyable. It is no wonder that this series has captured the imagination of children and given pleasure even to adults. Many of Rowling's concepts are strongly reminiscent of the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by the British writers Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl, and she likely has been influenced by their work. But Rowling clearly has a style of her own, and in this fourth book of the Harry Potter series, has confirmed her reputation as a story-teller for children. This novel has all the ingredients of a good children's novel - suspense, imagination, and excitement.The remarkable popularity of the Harry Potter series has led to its author J.K. Rowling being frequently mentioned in the same breath as the fantasy greats J.J.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Yet this is not entirely deserved, because the works of Tolkien and Lewis go far beyond the level of story, imparting great truths about human nature and theology on a deeper level. Rowling's books do not have this deeper level, but are simply imaginative books that entertain. That is not to say that Rowling's novels are not good. They clearly are. The incredible sales record of the Harry Potter series tells its own story of success.The Harry Potter series has been much criticized for the extent to which magic has been incorporated into the story-line, and the increasing interest in the dark side of magic has left people wondering whether Rowling is leaving the door open to the occult. Rowling herself has publicly denied any personal interest in the occult, and explicitly repudiated being an advocate of the occult or intending to attract children to it. Most of the magic she describes is clearly fantastic and bears little relation to the magic of the occult. Yet it must be conceded that there is a growing contemporary revival of the occult, and that occultic themes and ideas are hardly absent from Harry Potter's world, but rather play a key role in it. When accompanied with an increasingly dark and macabre tone, this element did make me seriously question whether the Harry Potter books are suitable for children.But in the end it is not the magic of Harry Potter that has made it so successful. The real reason is that readers can identify with its characters. Although Rowling describes a fantasy world that exists only in her imagination and ours, it is clear that this fantasy world is largely a mirror image of our own 20th/21st century Western world. What makes this series so successful, is that we recognize ourselves in the novel - our system of education (Hogwarts), our ideology of human rights (Hermione), our worship of team sports (quiddich), our love for competition (school contests), our political world (ministry of magic), our media (interviews with the Daily Prophet), our concern with health and beauty, our fascination with love and guy-girl relationships, and our love of feasting and food (The festivities around The Sorting Hat). Unlike Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Lewis' \\"Narnia Chronicles\\" which are more demanding and deep because they bear little resemblance to our world, Rowling's world of \\"Harry Potter\\" bears a great deal of resemblance to our contemporary godless world and its idols. Although \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is outwardly about a fantasy world, beneath the fantastic trimmings it is essentially about our own world. And that is why we love it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is scary. It is exciting. It is sweet and honorable. My 7 and 9 yr olds can't wait until bedtime to see what will happen next. I had to finish the book on my own - and know that they will sit their with their mouths open and eyes wide until the very end, just as they did with book one. This is a book that appeals to the adult as much as to the child. The writing is witty and I really should get out my dictionary to understand a bit more of the double meaning of some those names. A word of warning when reading aloud - the alliteration can really trip up your tongue."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am 14 and love these books. What is the most interesting is how the complex plots unfold from book to book. This is definitely a two-thumbs-up book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm 32 and reading this book to my 5 year old son. We love it.. I get to laughing so hard I can barely read it to him. Tears streaming down my face as I cackle my way through Quidditch matches and potions class, flying cars and my own sad attempts at a cockney accent for Hagrid. My hat is off to you, dear lady. You have produced a treasure that me and my children will read and reread for years to come. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was the last person in my family to read the first Harry Potter and by then this one was already out. I read the whole thing in one sitting. This book is fantastic. It has interesting, imaginative characters, both wizards and animals. The plot twists are improbable, yet when you look back on the whole book, you realize you might have guessed them. Hermione, Harry and Ron have some wonderful conversations and there are some nice Quidditch matches (Quidditch is a broomstick game sort of like basketball)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was definitly the best book I have ever read. I like it because it was very exciting and I just couldn't stop reading.I read it 3 days thats very good for a 12 year old to read 341 pages in 3 days."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I got &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; for Christmas last year, and it was sitting on the shelf for about four months before I finally got around to reading it. And when I did read it, I couldn't put it down. I read all three hundred and nine pages in one night. And even though I was expecting the sequel to be just as good, it exceeded my expectations. Everyone should own a copy of &quot;Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have never read a book that was second in a series that was as great as the first. Yet, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets lives up to the first installment, being just as funny and clever as ever. The plot has many interesting twists and turns, but it wasn't confusing at all. The logic in this book made perfect sense. Already J. K. Rowling has a great career in store. I can't wait for the other books to come out, and I already have my name down for the third installation in the series. People of all ages will enjoy this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't know how she does it!! She puts so much soul, so much heart, it, it, it's indecribable!! I cannot express how much I love her books!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book is as good as the first! How often can you say that! Pick up the second adventure of Harry Potter and his diverse group of friends...and enemies...you won't be sorry! Read these books to your kids...read them to yourself...share them with your friends.... this is a series that shouldn't be missed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read several books a year. I just put them on the bookshelf and never read them again. I can pick this book up later and read it again and never get tired of reading it. It is a fun and exciting book to read. I just love little Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series is one of those great series that come along that you want to devour as soon as you lay your hands on them. I know that the Harry Potter series is going to have seven books, but what will we do when the series is done? J.K. Rowling is my favourite author. She writes the kind of books that you fight over with your whole family. I am a loyal fan."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a very exciting book. Our whole family has become Harry Potter fans. Our 8 year old read all three books more than twice. He says they are his favorite books in the whole world! JK Rowling is a genius!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read the first 2 Harry Potter books, and not sure if there are any more, but boy I hope there are!! Harry is funny, magical, (litteraly and figuratively) and suspensful all at once. All of the peices of te puzzle fall together with extreme perfection. I urge you to read this book, its a true adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've read this book half a dozen times, and I never get bored with it. It's sensational. I loved the arrival of Gilderoy Lockhart, he was so stupid it was funny. The storyline was very cool as well, I liked the plot, and the way the suspense built up, it was really cool. I was guessing wildly the whole book through who the Heir of Slytherin could possibly be. Rowling is doing a great job of developing her characters; I can't wait until the next books come out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My 16-year-old daughter is laughing at me for reading these books but I don't mind. I don't believe any adult needs to have a young child to enjoy Harry Potter. He is a great character as are his sidekicks. Rowling writes with a humor that is as, if not more appealing, to adults as to children. The characters are fully realized and the plots interesting with enough twists to keep adults entertained and interested. I couldn't wait until September for the third book so I ordered from amazon.uk and am enjoying it as much as the first two."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought this book and &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone&quot; for my 10-year-old daughter but read them first so we could talk about them (yeah, right). I love science fiction and fantasy and these are on a par with The Chronicles of Narnia,(which I didn't read until high school) if not better.But I like my fantasy worlds to be complete and consistent, and that is missing from these books. The facet of the scenario that is incomplete is the lack of knowledge of the wizard/witch families of the day to day workings of the Muggle world: muggle-money, telephones, autos, etc. Are they living in another dimension concurrent to our own? If not, how do they own property/buy groceries/use transportation/ school their children prior to attending Hogwarts? If they intermarry with Muggles, they must be functioning in the Muggle world somehow. And how can the Muggle-world not know of the existence of Magic when Muggle-born children are found to be magic-gifted and recruited to Hogwarts? Does someone cast a forgetfulness spell on them? I know that this is probably of fractional concern to the children reading the books, but I hold children's fiction authors to the same standard of completeness and consisitency as &quot;grown-up&quot; fiction. Please, Ms. Rowling, correct/explain the inconsistent scenario in the upcoming books.Despite this glitch in the magic-world-view, I love the books, have to leave them out of my briefcase so I'm not tempted to read them at work, and am eagerly awaiting &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; to read, and for my daughter to read further into &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; so we can talk about the world of Harry Potter.I love the fact that Harry's thoughts, motives, and inner workings are getting more complex as he grows up in each book. I hope that he exacts some appropriate revenge (other than living well) on the soul-destructive Dursleys. Ah, but there I go, projecting again........"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all the Harry Potter books and they are amazingly astoningshingly exellently spectacular! All of my friends are missing out on this book and they are so unlucky. I read about four chapters a night or even five. I would not skip on night of reading even if it was three in the morning. I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A NEVER ENDING LINE OF STARS"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a middle school librarian. I can't wait to get back to school to share Harry Potter's latest adventure with the children! Ms. Rowling has the gift of storytelling. Her imagination never ceased to amaze me.

It's marvelous."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I believe this book was so sucessfull was because everyone can relate to Harry Potter. We all at one point in our lives have been in a world where we were amazed by the occurances that seemed regular to the natives. And I am sad to say I have delt with my own Draco Malfroy. But the Rons and the Hermoines are the best friends you could ever have. I am sure some of us have wished to be part of wizzarding scociety. The chemistry between the characters (even the baddies) was wounderful and realistic. Still, behind the magic and the scocial affairs we find a story of a heritage that was deprived and shamed by muggles and we see the same heritage welcomed. A child who has lived through this turmoil and confusion must surley have hidden powers of their own... Maybe thre REALLY is a Harry Potter in everyone..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Every once in a while a great book comes along that is so goodthat I want to shout about it.

Whatmore can happen to Harry Potter? I laughed out loud; I say &quot;OhNo&quot; several times. This is wonderful writing.

Can't wait for #3."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There is a little too much catch=up in this book to tie it to the first book.

Way to go!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is doubtlessly an entertaining adventure for children, but I was suprised to find that the stories, full of symbolism and wonderful messages, can entertain adults, too. The general moral of the stories is to believe in yourself, but the second book in the series even surpasses the first with it's lessons against prejudice and even has a Hitler-like villan. The child inside me was truely enchanted by the story, and my mind was pleased by the wonderful messages and deeper plot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the bomb.

Then Voldomoart (the dark wizard) came for Harry and he mistirically lost all of his powers. Harry his famous in the magical community. This books combined many eleminits to make a great series. 1.) supense, you never know what the end will bring2.) humor, the books are extramly funny, in part to his aunt and uncle who are so mean to him it is down right hillarious.3.) great writing, Though largly thought as a children series Harry Potter is for everyone.

I started the first book just over a week ago and am now half way through this, the second in the series. Miss Rowling's effortless ability to make the incredible seem credible is endless. WhileHarry Potter's adventures grow steadily more daunting Harry himself retains a charming innocense thatis irresistable.

When I was telling my mom about the book she asked me what quiditch was. When I finally got do explaining it she was interested in it. So now she is reading all the Harry Potter books to her class. I just finished all the books you have out now. I couldn't decide which one was my favorite.

I love these types of fantasy stories...everything is given such detail by J.K.; the characters enchanting, the settings fantastic and the plots suspensful. Another bonus, is the incredible art work done in pastels. The covers are fantastic and the pics before each chapter are great as well. I find one problem though... I don't think J.K can write more books fast enough for the fans! I can't believe how much I love these books, it will be hard to wait for the sequal(s)! J.K has hit a nerve all around the world!

But, alas Harry has Ron, Fred and George to thank for turning around his vacation.This year not only do they have more homework, but they have to contend with something that is turning the students into stone.Can the group figure out who is doing this? Can you figure out who it is before the book tells you?If you like the Madeline L'Engle books, or the Black Cauldron Series, this series is a must for you!

The books are so popular because Ms. Rowling captures the heart of a child. She knows the fears and fantasies of children and she writes for this audience. If you remember what is was like to be a child, and believe in magic and dragon and to be afraid of ghosts and to have a best friend whom you love so much that your heart hurts when she or he is not around, you will appreciate this book. This book is not for young kids, but then again, I assume you already knew this. These books are perfect in that they simply capture the heart and imagination of a child. I will keep this short so that you can read the other 2,000 reviews. Enjoy. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is absolutely great.

Hagrid? Malfoy?You are introduced to a new character...a strange little creature named Dobby, who is a slave with a good heart.You learn of Moaning Myrtle, the ghost who is constantly haunting the girl's bathroom so nobody will use this particular bathroom. She is constantly crying...but why?Hogwarts gets a conceited, stuck up, new professor, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart, who doesn't seem to know what he's talking about, yet he's very famous for doing things that are very daring.There is a series of puzzles and obstacles that Harry and his friends must go through to get through the Chamber of Secrets.You will absolutely LOVE this book and it will make you want to buy the 3rd and not be able to wait for the 4th to come out(like me). If you buy this book, you will surely not regret it. Harry Potter books are certainly for people of all ages. ^_^"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Usually in series or in a triology, the first book is very good and then the second is good and the third is not bad and so on, but here we have a sequel which is as good as the first book.

My little brother hardly ever reads and then he read the Harry Potter books and is hooked. I think it's going to be a classic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The overwhelming critical acclaim for these books gave me expectations of timeless greatness! However, the Harry Potter books are simply good fun for kids of all ages.Poor Harry has had the worst summer of his life on the heels of his first season of wizardry. The authorities at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry have forbidden the students to use their new skills in the Muggles (ordinary, non-magic) world, and no one could be more tempted than Harry, living as he does with some of the worst Muggles in the world, the Dursleys! Disaster after disaster befalls our underdog hero Harry, and only his upright character and good friends are on his side.Back at school, a mysterious monster is on the loose, and the legend of the Chamber of Secrets, a tale of historical bigotry, has all the students trembling with either outrage or fear. Harry and his friends soon realize that they have a large stake in this battle, and that it is more or less up to them to solve the mystery of the monsters identity and location.A farcical romp in a hilariously unlikely magical version of the English boarding school, The Chamber of Secrets is a nicely plotted mystery loaded with schoolboy humor. Thrills and chills abound, and valor is tested and ultimately rewarded.This is a good book to pull in borderline young readers; the vocabulary is not challenging, the action is nearly non-stop, and it's filled with engaging details."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"it was a very recamendable book. Its fast, exiting and suspenceful. JK Rowling makes very good and consistent charictures, I'm already attatched to them. I LOVED it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought the book Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets was fantastic! I thinck it is a great book for anybody."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry continues his adventures as he learns more about his background. This is just as entertaining as the first novel, and was definitely able to keep my attention."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Summary: 3.5 to 4 starsHarry Potter's second year at Hogwarts is chronicled in the book. The adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermeine are documents for everyone's enjoyment. The book is a quick-read, enjoyable and a good follow-up to the first Harry Potter book. You can tell J. K. Rowling has created an interesting world that you want to know more about.Setting:The strength of the Harry Potter series is in the new fantasty world created by J. K. Rowling -- a twist on the normal and fey world...magically with humans and beasties vs. non-magical people. The book does an ok job of describing the world; the scene designers and artists for the movies have done a tremendous job of filling in this world. If you would not have the context of the movies, the books descriptions seem lacking to me.Characters:The character development is interesting and decently done through the mixture of the characters actions in a wide range of moral dilemnas and dangerous situations. The use of consequences for the characters actions is lightly done but it is nice to see that being done still.Plot:The plot is tight and well-thought out. The story is linear but it makes sense for the target age range for the books. Clearly, J. K. Rowling has developed a complex story line with this just being an element on the storyline -- the develop of background comes through.Action:The action is quick and to the point -- a nice feature for a book where you want to find out more about the setting as well as have the characters advance along in school to get more developed, more interesting/multi-faceted and see how the dynamics of various characters evolve.Prose:The prose style is clean, simple and effective. The simplicity vs the effectiveness of the prose shows a good command of the English language and a distinctive enjoyable style. It is not a great literary work by any stretch of the imagination but one does not expect that from this type of book.Summary:Setting: 3.5 to 4 stars -- I would give it 5 stars but only because of the world created and desribed in the movies but the book descriptions are thin and not well developed.Plot: 4 stars -- good for a child's bookCharacters: 3.5 starsAction: 3 starsProse: 3 to 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the adventure known as Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts. On a side note, do you ever wonder what is happening in the lives of the other students? How is it that only Harry, Ron and Hermoine notice the subplots? I wonder what life is like at Hogwarts for people outside of Harry's circle. Enough of that though. During Harry's first year, he learns about his past, starts playing Quidditch and develops an arch-enemy, Darco. After Harry's room is hexed in a Quidditch match, Harry and his friends begin to think Professor Snape is trying to steal what is being guarded by the school and kill Harry. But Harry and his friends are in for a surprise when they discover it is another professor who is attempting to steal the Sorceror's stone for Voldemort.The second book begins much as the first, with Harry having to escape his muggle family to attend school. But Harry can't even make it to school without \\"borrowing\\" a flying car from Ron's family which lands him into trouble before the year even starts. Harry and his friends encounter a force that hates muggles, and must stop what is in the chamber of secrets before it kills. These books are entertaining and a pleasure to read. I recommend them to everybody."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book as I do all Harry Potters. I especially enjoyed reading the character Dobby."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets very much. It had a lot of details so you can picture everything very well. I also think that you can change a lot in the in the story. I did not like how you found out about the chamber so early. You can almost tell what is going to happen. I do like what was in the chamber though. They also had giant spiders who nearly killed Harry and Ron. Harry has some friends at Hawgwarts like Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Harry can even talk so snakes!!! This is a great sequel to the first book. I would recommend this story to my friends and anyone else. In order to find out what happens you will have to read the book for yourself. You will be very surprised."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes it's true; after all these years, I'm finally reading the Harry Potter books, although we've seen the movies out thus far. Usually I prefer to read a book before seeing the movie based on it, but this way is great fun too, because the casting, costuming, and scenery of the movies seem so close to what Ms Rowling wrote that I can picture scenes from the movies as I read. Anyway, as with the first book, this one just sails along, with writing clearly geared toward children, yet still entertaining for us oldsters. I've got the next two out of the library and it's just about all I can do to keep going on the other book I've started in between and not throw it over so I can dig in to Prisoner of Azkaban! If you don't think you like to read, read these books, and you'll change your mind!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The chamber of Secrets by: J.K. Rowling- a must read book. The book Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is about a boy named Harry Potter, a wizard warned about Hogwarts but go's anyway mot knowing what he is going to face. while Harry is at Hogwarts he meets up with his friend Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasely. When Harry Potter is at Hogwarts the mood is very scary as the atmosphere is to. Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is a very thrilling fantasy book. This book is also very mysterious. I would strongly recommend this book if you like long exciting books. Also, I would recommend to read the first book in the Harry Potter series before reading the second to help resolve any questions that you may have. I hope you will read all the Harry Potter books and enjoy them to the fullest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is by J.K Rowling, and it's a fantasy.In the beginning of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry, who is staying with the Dursley family, has his worst birthday party. Harry goes off to Leaky Cauldron to get his books and other supplies. Then, Harry goes to Hogwarts, where Ron and Harry miss the train. Then they go on many other adventures.I really liked this book because it was a mystery and it kept me reading. I think that this book would be best suited for fourth and up because it's a little long and a little bit of cussing"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked this book because it was very interesting. Even though it was only the second Harry Potter book I\`ve read ,it was the best. Many of the minor characters introduced in the first book were more fully developed, such as Nevile and Justin. The main characters also developed,especialy Harry. He learnd that things are not always what they seem to be.For example, Harry initially thought that Tom Riddle was trying to help him when Tom revealed himself as the Dark Lord Voldemort. I look forward to reading the next Harry Potter book and discorving how these characters continue to develop."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter and the chamber of secrets is a very good book. its full of magic and mystery. you never know whats going to happen until the last minite. with very good discription I give this book an A+.

I read both of them in two days! I was amazed that they were very good and appropriate for children without being childish. I can't wait for the rest!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My 5th grade teacher started reading it in class but had to stop when we were in the middle so I bought it at a book fair. Then I couldnt put it down. I think that Harry Potter is great for young readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is an extraordinary book, not only for children but also adults. I recently shared the novel with my eighteen year old nephew and it had a magical effect on him. He began discussing the book with such enthusiam that I read it myself and concurred. Again, the word &quot;magical&quot; applies. Rawlings is a sorcerer herself of the highest calling. She conjures up goodwill and understanding. Another children's book that works in this extraordinary way, casting its spell over adults as well as kids, is Kim Doner's BUFFALO DREAMS. It has the same wonderful quality of transcending our everyday confusion and reminding us of what really is important."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was quite fantastic. I f your not convinced, look at the fact that there are eight hundred something reviews, and the average custumer review is Five Stars.All three harry Potter books are excellent, not one is better than another."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've been reading this book to my kids - and we all are enjoying it very much. I've heard all the negative comments about the 'evil' side of the story. Think about it - many children's stories have evil characters - Aladdin, Little Mermaid, gosh, even Bambi! The 'bad guy' shows up all the time. I think the Harry Potter books are delightful and imaginative. They get kids to read and love reading. (Also, a quick recommendation for some great books on parenting - check out these: Kid Cooperation, The 10 Greatest Gifts I Give My Children, and Perfect Parenting"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"IF YOU ARE A PERSON(ESPECIALLY A PARENT)AND YOU ARE NOT SURE WHETHER TO BUY HARRY POTTER OR NOT, PLEASE READ THIS o.k. you've been reading these reviews and the main idea people have of these books is either they love them or they hate them, right? Well I'v been reading them too. I have nothing against the people who just don't care for the books. It's the people who think these books are &quot;EVIL&quot; that really annoy me. They have a problem. I have books 1 and 2 of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and they are the best books I have ever read. And I have read OVER 100 books. No joke. If you go through these reviews, you'll see people who have said &quot;These books are just TOO EVIL for our kids. They give our kids the wrong idea. They make kids think that death is o.k.&quot; If you are an adult this is know problem for you. But if you are a kid, or thinking about buying this book for a kid, that is totally 100% WRONG. You have to know the kid I guess. And parent who's kids wil get &quot;the wrong idea&quot; from reading these books, the kids must have a pretty messed up mind to be thinking of death and dieing and witchcraft all the time. I'm feel so sorry for the kids who want to read these books, but their parents won't let them because they are too over-protective of their kids. I'm really sorry if this affends anyone, but the reason why &quot;those&quot; parents think Harry Potter is so bad (just my opinion) is because the only books they let their kids read is boring stuff about &quot;milking cows in an open field.&quot; BORING!!! I have that kind of knowledge because I have a sort of over-protective mom too. Please don't hate me for expressing my opinion. But Harry Potter books are the best books ever and I would recomend them to anyone who has an open mind. Oh and if you were wondering, I'm only 12 years old."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I feel sad about all the muggles who don't get it. There is no hope for them, so the rest of us shouldn't be too hard on them when they don't like Harry. My very magical 79 yr.old Mom loves him. My 20 yr. old son loves him. My very cool 16 yr. old nephew loves him. I'm 54 and I love him. And,yes,we all would rather read than eat. The books are piled high and we have multiple copies of Tolkeins and Dahls and these books are right up there with the best of them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter books are my favorite new reading find, and I can't say enough good things about them. This latest in the Harry Potter saga is better than the second in the series (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) and almost as good as the wonderful first (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). It's somehow not quite as dark as the second book, although parts of it are still too scary for bedtime reading to a six year old. It's perfect for 9-12 year olds, or for 41 year olds. Harry is back at Hogwarts, beset by his old adversaries Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy, and the wonderful returning cast of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. There are some delightful cheer out loud moments in the book--the appointment new Care of Magical Creatures professor and the climactic quiddich (sp?) matches. J.K. Rowling continues her wonderful comic touches with minor characters (the Divinations professor Trewlaney), her charming offbeat world (the Knight Bus) and the emotionally powerful theme of Harry learning more about his parents and their final struggle to save his life by giving theirs. There are new dangerous creatures, the menacing Dementors, and the delightful mystery of Sirius Black and the mysterious Grim--are they the sinister characters they seem, or does J.K. Rowling have another plot twist and secret villain in mind, like in the first book? You'll have to read this new one to find out, and it's a delightful read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a grandmother of 2 boys 11 and 7, I have read all 3 of Harry Potters adventures in Hogwarts school, these books are the most enjoyable childrens books I have read since grimms fairy tales,I could not put them down,I read one after the other.The author takes you on a roller coaster ride,a ride you will never forget.! Fast paced, an excellent fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, the famous wizard in training, is back in the sequel to the popular first novel. In this book, Ms. Rowling's imaginative language and skills are brought out as in the first book. In this story, however, Harry find himself visited by a house-elf named Dobby, slave to the Malfoys. He warns Harry about going back. Of course, Harry doesn't listen (does he ever?). What could be worse than the Dursleys? Obviously, everything. A new, conceited professor, Lockhart, shows up, teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, a new ghost, Moaning Myrtle haunts the girls bathroom, and someone is turning students into stone! In addition to that, Lockhart has a bad impression of Harry as an ego-maniac, and Hagrid, the gamekeeper, has secrets to tell. Of course, Harry is back to Quidditch, which he's most looking forward to, only to discover that mean, stuck-up, (and a personal favorite of mine!)Draco Malfoy has become the Slytherin seeker using his fathers money, (conviently turns out to really be bad at Quiddtich) and has the newest broomstick- a Nimbus 2001! Now, after all he's been through, everyone suspects Harry of truning them into stone! Muggle-borns now fear him and call him 'Heir of Slytherin'. Among the turned-stone students is Harry's friend Hermione Granger! No one believes him-not even Ron! How can he prove that it's not him, become the Quidditch champion, catch the criminal, handle many new characters (and old ones) and still survive? He's Harry Potter! Read the book and find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all three of the Harry Potter books and anxiously await the fourth.... I love the books, my children love the books. The only problem is that my daughter is mad at me because I kept reading ahead when she went to school! (we were reading it together, but I just couldn't put them down! ) I thank J.K. for creating such an imaginative world that intices children away from the TV and video games and allows them to get lost in visions of quiddich matches and Hogwarts feasts. Bravo! I have seen so many wonderful Harry Potter inspired projects displayed in my children's school. These books are making children create their own visions rather than depend on those transmitted on TV! Buy the set for your families! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. In my ninteen years of life I have never been much of a reader...until I picked up this book! I bought it as a Christmas present for my 9 year old brother....and I read the whole thing before he did. This book contained all the childhood fantasies I'd ever dreamed of. I loved it, and now I own the complete set of books 1, 2 and 3. I applaud J.K. Rowling for her wonderful imagination and for the descriptive ways she puts it into words! I will treasure Harry Potter always, and one day share it with my children!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm a 15 year old girl who got hooked on Harry Potter books by reading them to the girls that I babysit for. In fact, I'm borrowing the 3rd book in the series from the girls tonight! I read the first two books in two days- they're great. While I did feel a little embarassed realizing that they're books written for 12 year olds, that didn't stop me. The plot lines are great, and both of the first books have endings you'd never see coming! The only drawback is that they make our lives seem more boring! Great book, great gift, great fun!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I only have one comment to make about those who feel this bookis in some way objectionable for children to read.... TRY IT YOURSELF! I am a born again Christian and find nothing objectionable in this book .. it is fiction a fairy tale of the highest order ... LIGHTEN UP! No where in the BIBLE do I read... LET THEE NOT HAVE AN IMAGINATION or thee will go astray ... NO this is a book ment for fun SO ... LET there be FUN.... They talk about witchs and warlocks ok so what ... DO lions really talk ? would you put down C.S. LEWIS ? One of the greatest of the Christian fiction writers ... GIVE kids a break ... let them have a Harry potter book .. it will not stain their souls but amuse them and it will give them hope... THERE IS GOOD in the world that NO EVIL thing can KILL..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read the first Harry Potter book voraciously,hoping the next ones would be as enchanting. Ms. Rowling delivers in this sequel. I haven't experienced such a child-like sense of wonder and joy from reading a book in years! This one is meant for all ages,not just children. Harry's a wizard,but has everyday problems just like us &quot;Muggles&quot;. The Harry Potter series is fun and unique. Most 300 pg books aren't interesting enough to make you want to finish them in a day. And the Harry stories aren't Satanic,as some people say. I'm from a Christian family that's hopelessly devoted to them. No Harry fans have been reported practicing occult rituals. Parents don't have to censor these novels. They actually teach moral messages,but in a non-preachy way. If you want a book series that's guaranteed to be good,that you won't feel you've wasted days of your life on,try Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm 14 years old, and I these books are awesome! Harry comes back yet again with Ron and Hermione. I actually think that these should be for all ages, not just up until twelves. This book is very thrilling and is great to read. I recommend this book to whoever can read! Those of you whom your parents won't let you read it: info: Go &quot;study&quot; in the library! It's worth it, trust me. Those of you who live for fantasy, and great books, these books are for you! Parents: Lay off a little. These books aren't evil. They teach the quite kids to stand up for themselves, troublesome kids to cool down, and studious children to chill out and have fun. This book is great for your children and you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Okay, here's the scoop. I attend Church every Sunday and I have read the entire Bible. I have also read all three Harry Potter Books, and, quite honestly, there is nothing in any of them that teaches Witchcraft as a religion. Yes, Harry and his friends have magic wands and take classes in Potions and Transfiguration, but there is no subtle message in these books that Magic replaces God. These books don't teach witchcraft, but they do teach something else, something our society is sadly lacking. Morals. Besides how to turn toads into tadpoles, Harry learns the value of friendship, the importance of loyalty, the price of deceit. True, Harry does break school rules, but sometimes, you have to break the rules to do what is right. (For all you religious fanatics, think Jesus breaking the Pharisees's Laws) One more tidbit to add. You can't judge a book by its cover...or its summary. Before you judge Harry, read the first book with an open mind and heart. Then decide whether or not to let your children read this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Forget the hype that this is an evil book for children to read! These books are wonderful fantasty stories about good vs. evil, done in tongue and cheek...and by the way, Good Wins! My 12 year old could care less about reading and it was showing in his grades. I was able to challage him to read a chapter in the evening. I would read it that night and we would discuss it. It became a race to see who could finish it first and get the next book! We talk in codes about the book [so the &quot;muggles&quot; don't understand us]. He even got his grandmother to read all the books too. His reading grades have improved and float between A's &amp; B's! WE can't wait for the next book(s)! Get these books..HIDE THEM..so you can read them before your kids! EXCELLENT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I injoyed this book HIGHLY, and thought that Jk Rowling took a big step to show everyone who impressive she is at writing on with her 7 book series. You get to learn more about Lord Voldemort(his rival) and more duels, humor, sneaking around, and suspense. It is nail-bitting deadly, with good Quidditch matches and Baslisk fighting. I found it one of greatest one's in the series. It is impossible for me to forget."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry returns to the dursleys for the holidays.

Harry goes back to Hogwarts for his second year at school. There is a new character and his name is \\"Dobby.\\" He is a slave. He does not want Harry Potter to go to Hogwarts. Dobby made it so that Harry could not get on the train so Harry took a flying car. And Dobby made the Blunger in Quitage chase him and break his arm.In the book I did not like Dobby. He was pointless. All he did was try to stop Harry Potter from Going to Hogwarts. I liked that all the old characters were still inthe book.I love the second book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets than to the first book Harry Potter and the Sorcer Stone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great book, but did anyone notice that they left there trunks in the trunk of the car yet had them when they got to school...?is it addressed in the movie?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsMy book's title is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The author is J.K.Rowling. The genre is fiction. The theme would be never be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Harry Potter is trapped in the Dursley's house. His friend rescues him. Theycannot get to the train to go to school. Harry starts hearing a voice and figures out thatthere is a secret chamber. Harry and his friends go and find clues leading up to the culpritbehind the attacks.My favorite character was Harry because he gets in trouble and tries to clear hisname. Harry flies to school with his friend in a car they stole. Harry goes to a schoolcalled Hogwarts, where they practice and history about a secret chamber in the school.The chamber was left there by one of the four founders of the school.I disliked about the book a character. The character was called Malfoy. Malfoy was a rich boy who got whatever he wanted. In the school he wanted a good broom and to be in a team. He got in a team and was not a great player.My strongest reason for reading this book is that it has suspense and mystery. Also there are different kinds of creatures like screaming plants, giant snakes, and an elf. I enjoyed the book and hope you will too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is a little bit darker than J.K. Rowling's first book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". Gone are the magic sweets and wizard collector cards, and in come spiders, snakes and petrified bodies. Still, there is still some whimsy and fun to be had. There's a flying car, some grubby garden gnomes, a violent tree and to top it all off Harry finds himself in a place where no man has dared go before: the girl's bathroom. Personally, I like this book a little better than the first. The writing's a little slicker, and with the fictional world established, Rowling is free to explore.It is nearly time for Harry's second year at wizard school when a self-flagellating \\"house elf\\" called Dobby comes to his house and tells him not to go. Dobby has good reason to warn Harry too, strange things are happening at Hogwarts. A bludger from Quidditch goes crazy, a cat is found mysteriously petrified in the hall and a message has been painted in large letters in the hall. \\"The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware!\\". To make things worse, Harry starts hearing nasty voices in his head, which is not healthy at all, even for wizards. Will Harry and his friends be able to figure out what's going on before it is too late?Within the book, Rowling fills out the world she created in the first book just that little bit more. We find out more about the Weasleys and Malfoys, more about the lives of the ghosts, and the history of the origins of the school and of the four Hogwarts school houses. On his adventures, Harry discovers Floo Powder (a substance used for teleportation), finds a diary that writes back to him and hitches a ride on a phoenix. The characters begin to mature (a lot in Ginny Weasley's case, she's rather more childish in \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\"). I noticed there was a subtle change in the words the young wizards use, and the way they choose to say things.The first book showed what it would be like if training for a wizard was like being in an English boarding school, complete with school houses, house points, dormitories, detention and sports. These elements are all still there, but they're not emphasized as much. Rather, I felt the book showed more specifically what a wizard eighth grade would be like. I don't know about everywhere else in the world, but I found eight grade to be a lot easier than the seventh (and a little pointless) and it seems to be the same at Hogwarts. Ron seems to get through, despite the fact he has a broken wand, and Hermione passes despite her own dilemma so close to exams, and despite the fact they often drift off during the ghost professor Binn's history class and learn practically nothing in Lockhart's dark art's class, the second year class ends up doing pretty well for themselves. I can certainly relate to this. I wonder if its a worldwide phenomenon, this eighth grade business...There's a bit of an interesting theme running through this book to do with celebrities and the tales connected to them. Among the new students to Hogwarts is a fan of Harry's antics, Colin Crevey, who takes lots of pictures of Harry with his camera. Harry doesn't really know exactly how to handle this extra attention, and I can't help feeling that Rowling felt a similar way when she herself got famous. Also, there's a new professor at Hogwarts, Gilderoy Lockhart, who is a celebrity who has written many books about wizardry, who is vain, a boaster, and in fact doesn't know that much about the world of wizards at all. Could this perhaps be a personification of Rowling's fears of what she herself could become if she's not careful? I wonder, I really do...As I've been reading the series, I've been wondering whether or not the \\"Harry Potter is promoting real life witchcraft\\" lobbyists have a case or not. I'm pretty sure they don't. Yes, things get a little darker and morbid in this book, but that's really the fault of the dark forces at work more than anyone else. A nastier side to life exists in some form both here and in the Hogwarts world, and in both worlds it isn't appreciated. The students and honest wizard professors just want to get on with things, to learn to be wizards. In this context, however, it does beg the question, why do wizards exist in Rowling's fictional world? What is their purpose? Why do they do magic? When did they start? Is the risk of being wizards worth it when there is the potential for forces as dark as Voldermort? I'm interested to know, and I hope I find the answer in one of the future books, which I'm yet to read.Worth a look, but I'd definitely read the first book, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", beforehand."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A book for all ages.

At first, I was skeptical because when they first came out I didn't get what the hype was all about. But now after seeing the movies and reading the complete series, I understand it now.This book is truly captivating, more intense and frightening than the first. I absolutely loved it! It was both entertaining and funny, much like the other six in the series. It is engaging to read, and I honestly think it appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the days when the border between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the books would keep the modern teenager entranced. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the story may get slightly boring, but don't worry, it gets better. This series blurs the ordinary design of which children's books are written. But most are not always written with the same stylish elegance J.K. Rowling seems to successfully integrate into the plot, and they each carry their own sense of magic, to the point in which the reader can't seem to put the book down!

I often think that something that everyone raves about just can't be as good as the say, but Harry Potter exceeds the reviews.The incredibly rich detail in all the Harry Potter novels is really the best aspect of the story. JKR creates a whole world that readers can't forget about. There many subplots, but JKR keeps them all straight.I can't tell you how great all the books in this series are, you'll have to read them for yourself. Harry Potter is the new Star Wars, the new Lord of the Rings. It already is a legend."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Book 2 is really a replay of book 1 and works to reinforce the basic structure of the series. The plot, including the finale, is actually better designed than in book 1, but there isn't as much emotion behind it. The fact that Harry is a wizard isn't new anymore. We spend the book getting used to life inside Hogwarts alongside Harry. It is a fun journey, but not quite as exciting as the initial discovery."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Received item quickly. Just as described.

We meet a magical elf, Dobby, a new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart and finally Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who joins the famous trio.CHAMBER OF SECRETS shows, more than anything, that the success of PHILOSPHER'S STONE was not a fluke accident, and it is with this novel we get the first real rumblings of the Pottermania that was about to take over the globe. This book is easily as readable as the first, and most readers will fly through this novel.I liked this book because it was a true page turner. As the reader you can search for possible clues along with Harry, Ron and Hermione. I would recommend this book to anyone over seven years old. J.K.

He has a few mishaps even getting to the school; by now the wise reader pays attention to the small episodes that can have significance later. Harry's first-year friendships with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger have solidified. They'll rely on those bonds to deal once again with the truculent Lord Voldemort. This time the school is plagued by a series of mysterious attacks against some of the school's muggle-borns, assaults that literally petrify the victims. The mystery is compounded by Harry's hearing a murderous voice that others cannot hear, and the appearance of an enchanted diary that spills secrets that imperil favorite Hogwarts characters. Moreover, Harry is tormented by the thought that maybe he was supposed to have been a Slytherin--indeed, that he may be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin!The book includes many references to the first volume, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, to help the reader who's either forgotten key aspects of the first story or who's never read it. The latter reader is better off going back and reading the first volume. In addition to many returning characters, this volume introduces important new characters including Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy's equally sinister father; Ginny Weasley, the youngest of the many Weasleys to go to Hogwarts and who's besotted with Harry; and Gilderoy Lockhart, a famous wizard author whose braggadocio seems to embarrass everyone but Hermione. The story generally is written well, and becomes ever more suspenseful as it nears the conclusion: my daughter begged me to keep reading beyond her lights-out time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I bought this for my fiancee's sisters, but ended up reading it on the plane to see what all the fuss was about.

I loved it even more for that. It is through some kind of magic the Rowling transports us into this mythical world, making us believe in giant spiders, terrible monsters and ghosts. After reading the first two books i found myself reaching for a 'wand' trying to zap annoying characters around me. It is difficult, sometimes, to not believe that there are two types of humans after reading this book and it is the the way that Rowling brings us so close to Hogwarts and this world that doesn't really exist that makes Harry Potter books an adventure in a nutshell.Just what if, all this -was- real?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love this book it is the best book I have ever read (along with the others) I love this book.

You cannot read this book and not be transported to Hogwarts School of Wizardry. You believe that you are right there beside Harry the whole time. I loved this book because I felt like it dug more deeply in Harry's life and what went on in the past. These books are already my favorite and I can already tell that they will be classics.

I have already started no.3 and I'm wishing there were more. This book was just as good or better than the first. Harry is maturing and his wizardry skills are improving.

This school teaches wizards and whiches how to do magic. It goes up to 6th grade only and you don't have to go back after the 6th year. There had been a rumor that there is a hidden chamber in the school. Teachers say that it isn't real but the students know better than that. They say that the only person that can open it up is the Slytherin heir.This book is mostly about a couple of wizards, Harry, Ron, and Draco. There's also two whiches named, Hermione and Ginny (Rons little sister). Harry, Ron , and Hermione find out about the Chambers of Secrets at their school at Hogwarts. Hermione finds out where and what it is. When Ron and Harry find out about it they they go and try to find it.In my opinion this book was splendid.

While all of us fans are waiting patiently (or anxiously, for that matter) for the film version to be released on November 15, 2002, we can re-live Harry's troubled second year by reading the book--again, or for the first time, if you have yet to read it.\\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is probably the funniest novel yet. It may not be the darkest or best, but it has the most humor in it, and I happen to really love JK Rowling's stylish and witty sense of humor. In this book, Harry had an even more miserable summer break while staying with his mean aunt, uncle, and cousin on Privet Drive. They forbid him to use any sort of magic--and locked all of his Hogwarts supplies in the cupboard where he used to sleep. At first, Harry liked teasing his cousin Dudley by muttering nonsense words and making Dudley shriek of fright and run away, but it soon gets boring and Harry hasn't heard at all from his best friends, Ron Weasley or Hermione Granger. Then, one night towards the end of the summer, Harry is locked up in his room because the Dursleys are holding an important business party and his uncle Vernon doesn't want Harry to ruin it. To Harry's surprise, a house-elf from the magical world called Dobby, appears and warns Harry not to go back to Hogwarts because he will not be safe there. Harry, who doesn't think the warning is serious, ignores Dobby and the next night, is picked up by Ron Weasley and his twin brothers--Fred and George Weasley--in their father's flying car and takes him to their house for the rest of the summer! At the Weasleys' Harry Potter is treated very differently--they actually like him and appreciate him. On the day they are supposed to return to Hogwarts, the Weasleys and Harry get to the trian station in London and are very late. To avoid missing the Hogwarts Express train, Ron and Harry decide to get onto the platform together--only to realize that they cannot get through the burrier because it's been blocked! With no way else to go, Ron and Harry \\"borrow\\" Mr. Weasley's flying car and fly off to Hogwarts! They are found by Professor Snape and taken to see Dumbledore, luckily--they only get detention. And that is just the beginning...Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch rival, buys his way onto the Slytherin House Quidditch team by having his father buy the whole team brand-new Nimbus 2001 broomsticks, Harry gets a new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher named Gilderory Lockhart, who is very good-looking and famous because of all the books he wrote on what magical things he's accomplished when really, he never did any of the things he wrote in his books and is just self-centered and stuck up. Also, a secret hidden chamber in Hogwarts is mysteriously opened up again and something creepy that lives inside the chamber is starting to turn Hogwarts students to stone! Even worse when Harry himself becomes a suspect!This book has more action than the first one, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", along with more of JK Rowling's witty humor. I can't wait to see the film version, since I loved the first one. There's also more Quidditch, too, and these Quidditch matches are faster and more violent. Oh, and by the way, Malfoy is a HORRIBLE Seeker...and he becomes more nasty to Harry and his friends, especially Hermione, whom Malfoy and his Slytherin friends start calling \\"Mudblood\\". If you loved the first Harry Potter novel, then why WOULDN'T you read this one? The rest of them are really great, too...and I REALLY cannot wait for the fifth novel, titled \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\". Another job well-done, JK Rowling!Final Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry PotterHarry Potter mixes magic with every day life.

The book gets a bit darker, a bit scarier, and begins to reveal more about the darker side of the wizarding world.I think it's pretty obvious that if you've read the first one you should go ahead and read all of them.

I'm here to let you know that this book and the others in the series will have you wondering, \\"Is it possible?\\" Rowling (Pronounced \\"Rolling\\") writes so well, so convincingly, so truly, that you wonder if maybe there is some kid, perhaps with his name changed to protect his privacy, who has magic in him, goes into another world, and is the predestined hero of the whole world.

Bravo, JK and Harry! Wow, Harry puts up with so much from the Dursleys; it was a great, funny getaway. I laughed also when Harry's first trip by floo powder results in him coughing, and winding up in the Dark Arts section of Diagon Alley, totally embarrassed. Boy, I could see that Harry was soo scared when he sees Lucius Malfoy, who's even worse than that awful Draco Malfoy. It was kind of funny that Harry hid in a closet, too afraid to let them see him, esp. since Harry was a mess and his glasses were broken. Malfoy gets worse in this book and torments poor Harry even more, esp. during their first Quidditch game when Harry's trying to avoid a bludger. I was soo glad when Malfoy missed the snitch and caused Slytherin to lose because he was too busy taunting Harry and wound up getting blasted big-time by the Slytherin Captain! Malfoy deserved that one; he's a rotten snob. Dobby is funny and cute and it's sweet that Harry frees him from the Malfoy's control even though Dobby causes a lot of trouble for Harry. I could tell poor Dobby was miserable with the Malfoys and I get the feeling that the Malfoys treated him like dirt. I also laughed and my heart kind of went out to Harry when Colin Creavey is gushing over him and taking pictures of him and basically annoys Harry. Harry tries hard to be patient with Colin, but it isn't easy. Ginny finally works her way into this plot, but she's still a rather marginal character. Hopefully, she'll be more into the future books and movies. It's great that she and Hermione become friends. It's also great that female characters stay strong here and there's a new female professor, Sprout, who teaches Herbology. I'm now reading the third book and hope to get to book 4 soon, but I'm glad I've read the first two; they're a great read! I'm also looking forward to the release of the second movie!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's not excellent. It's delirious. This second volume of Harry Potter's adventures is full of twists and unforeseen, unforeseeable new elements that pop up all the time, around every corner and page of the dark corridors of this bewitched castle and of this book. We are following a line that no one can in any way know before they reach the very point where they are and, even there, they cannot know the next point, the next surprise, the next fright, the next epiphany. Harry Potter disregards every rule you can imagine, and that is a real pleasure because the story is thus a jungle of at times breathtaking new steps in a long pilgrimage through a world that is nothing but a big basket of magical events.But this book is also a severe criticism of a certain adult world, either the real world of humans, or this world of human relations transposed into the world of wizardry and witchcraft. The bad ones are not outside in the human world, but inside in the magic world. Some have ambition and have to crush the others to realize them and they don't hesitate in front of any crime, lie or misdeed to achieve their goals. Better get the worst and evilest monsters out of their locked chambers than fail in reaching the targets those ambitious people have set to themselves in order to cover up their evilness and their blackmailing domination.What's refreshing in this book is that salvation comes from some twelve year old kids, because kids are the future of the world, with the discreet support of some adults that are slightly more intelligent than others and have more courage than others, the courage to look for good and to push back evil forces. This makes this book very optimistic about humanity. The real magic is then no longer witchcraft but just human values like love, friendship, truthfulness, faithfulness, intelligence, imagination, visionary insight. This is a book that any adult should be required to have read, studied and analyzed to the very point of understanding it and accepting its moral teachings. Our world would be so much the better if it were so.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Chamber is a outstanding work of good vs. evil.

In fact, the poor boy was made a PRISONER in his very own room on his twelfth birthday!Fortunately, his best friend, Ron Weasley helps Harry make a daring escape in the very dead of night and thus he gets to live with Ron's wizard family! There is one problem, however. Dobby, the slave elf has suddenly appeared to stop Harry from going off to the Hogwarts boarding school, but our clever young heroes somehow makes it - only to GET IN MORE TROUBLE THAN EVER BEFORE! And the dark castle corridors are far more dangerous than ever before, especially with a very narcissistic new teacher, a celebrity stalker, and...something DEADLY on Harry Potter's very tail. What's more...many victims - even a ghost included, are getting frozen right on their very spots! But the answer itself lies somewhere in the very latrine where a young girl mysteriously died fifty years ago as well as an ancient diary that suddenly turns up there. So Harry Potter must find it quickly before some evil Heir of Slytherin finally turns up TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE HOGWARTS SCHOOL!Cleverly crafted, well-paced, and marvelously timed! In fact, there's even a few times when I thought J.K. Rowling was slipping a bit when suddenly, she leaps up TO GIVE ME THE BIG SLIP! Whew...I'm now getting JEALOUS of her rich imagination and her truly IMMENSE writing talents that WILL snare even the most disgruntled fantasy fans NO MATTER HOW OLD HE OR SHE IS!

Suddenly, the little complexities I expected to be there WERE there!

Personally though, I will admit to having a desire to go to Kingscross Station and seeing how many children try to get to Platform 9 3/4's...

It ended with terror, mayhem, and the near closure of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry starts back at Hogwarts, the worst he has to worry about is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher - the charming Professor Lockhart, a first year who considers Harry to be godlike, Draco Malfoy's bullying, and of course, quidditch. When the caretakers cat, Mrs. Norris, is found haging, as though dead, nobody but Filch is particularly sorry. But soon it is students who are being attacked, and the castle is haunted by the fear of the unseen monster that prowls within. As the attacks intensify, more and more clues point towards our hero, Harry, as the perpetrator of the evil. Harry struggles to clear his name, and to find the real culprit. Everyone seems to be against him, and time is running out... The second Harry Potter adventure, this book will leave you dying to read the third!

It has to be one of the better books that J.K. Rowling has written.Harry has come back for his second year at Hogwarts. As the year goes on, weird stuff starts to happen. Harry is getting blamed for it because he is always at the wrong place at the wrong time. As the year goes on, the students start top think that Harry is becoming a bad wizard.But are the students at Hogwarts right or are they wrong."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsBy: J.K. RowlingReviewed by: K. HuynhPeriod: 1Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is about a twelve-year-old boy named Harry Potter. He reluctantly finds out that he was a wizard and is recommended that he should go to Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. He's already been at Hogwarts for a year and is now getting ready for his second year. A strange creature named Dobby told Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts, he will be in \\"moral danger.\\" When Harry went to Hogwarts, there were many new and strange surprises such as a new professor named Gilderoy Lockhart, a spirit named moaning myrtle that haunts the girls' bathroom, and a new student attending Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister. But, the real trouble begins when Hogwarts students starts turning to stone while Harry is determined to find out who really is behind all the trouble.What I like about the book is that it is exciting to read, especially when Harry starts school in Hogwarts. After reading a dramatic chapter, you feel that you should keep on reading to find out what will happen next. Also, when Harry was living with his parents, it was very humorous with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley. They are all scared of wizards and witches because they do not believe in magic. They yell at Harry all summer, mostly because they were scared that he might use some of his magic. One time, Harry said, \\"You've forgotten the magic word,\\" and right after saying that Uncle Vernon yelled, \\"What have I told you, about saying the \\"m\\" word in our house.\\" People who do not have any magical blood are called muggles, and finally Harry one day was able to escape from the Dursleys and go to Hogwarts.Another reason why I like about the book is because there are many different characters. Voldemort is the evil character in the book, Hermione and Ron, Harry's best friends, Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival, and Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts school. In each book, there is usually a new defense against the dark arts teacher and all of them a little strange and suspicious. There are also many events that happen in the book such as when Harry goes to Diagon Alley without the help of Hagrid, when Harry visits Sir Nicholas's deathday party, or when Harry was competing against the Slytherins in the Qudditch game. One time, both Malfoy and Harry were dueling with each other with Professor Snape's help. \\"A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.\\" All the events lead finally lead up to who made the students turn into stone.My favorite part of the book is when Harry finds a secret diary written by Tom Riddle. When Harry opens the book, there were blank pages only. Harry starts writing in it, and somehow the diary replies to Harry. He keeps asking questions until the diary, which was actually Tom Riddle, takes Harry to the scene where the headmaster finds out who opened \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\" Harry was shock to find out who it was and wanted to talk to that person if it was really true that he got expelled. But, if you want to see what happens next, or why Dobby told Harry not to go to Hogwarts, or who opened the \\"Chamber of Secrets,\\" then you must read this book to find out. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the second book better then the first. It's a lot more funnier and scarier. I feel like I know the characters better now and I had more fun. I hope they write more books about the chamber of secrets. I'd like to know what happened more when they first opened it. Also read Playtrain. I loved this book! I've read all the Harry Potter's, dragonlances, summerland, Artemis Fowls and Series of unfortunate events, and golden compass. This book is just as good if not better then some of those. Except Harry Potter cause they are my favorites! It's got a cool website! I love when the train comes flying in! I like that the bully is the hero and not the nerd this time. And I like how even when the adventure ends they still have to get back before the play ends in school. I want everyone to read this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After taking awhile to swallow my pride to enjoy the first book, I naturally picked up the second one. As I then expected I proceeded to read the second one faster than I did the first one. Again, this was emaculately written and I was again enthralled with my 2nd year at Hogwarts. It is a quality read for anyone and age is not a factor. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone even slightly interested in reading period."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I can't take it anymore. I can't take it that most people think that anything with \\"Harry Potter\\" in the title of the book means its the bes thing ever written. Granted, the books aren't bad. But they are NOT what everyone makes them out to be. The movies aren't bad either, but still not what all the sheep say it is. To me, the who Harry Potter series is just a bunch of kids who have never read anything in their lives, and picked up something semi-interesting and made it their God. And I can't take it when I go onto the internet, see that \\"Harry Potter and The Order Of THe Pheonox\\" is #1 on the bestselling list, and it's not even released yet. Passed Obsession? I don't think so, because then I saw this: I went onto the page for the UNRELEASED book and see that some kids have already written reviews, saying such things as: \\"I haven't read the book yet, but I know its going to be good.\\" OK, now THATS passed obsession. The whole thing is overrated and over done. And I know that most people are going to critisize me about this statement. And if they do, those who aren't ignorant, will see that these people are immature obsessive people who needs to read some REAL genius works of fiction."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"And of course, in our society, if you can't read, you're screwed. My nephew has long had problems reading, but, with some better education he has taken to these books, and LOVES them! I mean, for an almost-teen to tackle a 400 page book for a book report instead of something much smaller speaks well of this writer's ability to capture attention and write a compelling, meaningful, book. And I as an adult (an engineer and a minister) have loved all four books! This is genius writing at it's best. Reminds me a lot of the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, or the Warner Brothers Cartoons, or Shakespeare - for the simpler minds, there's a wealth of entertainment and easy readability, and for the adults/more advanced minds, there's another level of humor and literary wonderfulness.Although choosing a &quot;favorite&quot; from the four books now in print is very difficult (they are all easily 5 stars), I would have to say that this was my second favorite, losing out to Book 4. But that's kind of like saying I prefer the filet mignon with 1.5 pound lobster over the prime rib with french onion soup and chocolate cheese cake for dessert. See what I mean?Do you have a child? Do you have a child within you? THEN READ THIS BOOK! I have read hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of childrens books and teen novels, and I think the Harry Potter books have everything a child wants - a hero who's &quot;not mainstream&quot;, who has some secret powers he didn't know he had, who faces danger bravely but with fear, and who wins - but who wins not by destroying an enemy, but by overcoming a situation.And for you bizarro fundamentalist Christians who think these books are evil - please read your Bibles, stop listening to your ministers, find a church with intelligent people who actually understand the Gospel, and leave J.K. Rowling alone. These books exemplify the Christian life in a way that puts them in a category above most children's writing. I mean, please - if you want to teach moral, ethical behavior, these are wonderful books for it. And remember - I'm a minister, trained in this stuff, so I know what I'm talking about. These books are not evil, they do not promote evil, they do not affirm evil, they do not glorfy evil. On the contrary, they glorify self-sacrifice, dedication and honesty to friends, honesty in the face of evil, courage in the face of evil, and most importantly, these books show our children (and us adults) how to face our fears with bravery, even while our knees are knocking and we wish drastically we didn't have to face it. We can learn a lot from little Harry Potter, and I find it a shame that so-called Christians have decided to wage some kind of bizarre illiterate crusade against these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm not sure why I'm not as enamored of these books as it seems 99% of the rest of the world is. Maybe it's because I've read lots and lots of children's books which I considered much better written and that I enjoyed so much more.I was ready to love Harry Potter, and did make it through the first book with a bit of affection for the kids. But I kept comparing it to Diana Wynne Jones' books and found it sadly lacking. Halfway through this second book, I've given up.

J.K.Rowling did let her imagination run wild and i must say she created a world filled with mystery, excitement, education and fun. While Harry goes through each year at Hogwarts he is confronted with challenges of all kinds. Among the greatest lesson to be learned from these books is tolerence and respect for your fellow man. Even though Harry is blessed with a remarkable resolve for doing the right thing he is surrounded by idividuals who are constantly testing his prowess as a human being and friend. He exhibits true loyalty for his friends. As the story continues you can see the characters develop a litte more with each book.

People are not turning into maniacs over Harry Potter for nothing. I won't be the first to say that the stories are good, fun, and intriguing reads for people of all ages. And if you can forget that nearly everyone seems to be white except for the token &quot;black boy&quot; mentioned in the first book and a girl whose name sounds slightly Indian, it's a great book for people of all colors and cultural (and mythological) backgrounds too.The highlights in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets were, to me, the thought-provoking events and creatures that remind informed readers of the Medusa from Greek mythology and the resemblance, intended by J.K. Rowling or not, of the &quot;very secret diary&quot; and the consequences of using it to Internet chat rooms.Ancient legends and modern-day worries, including car trouble, come together beautifully once again in this second novel. The elements of mystery and the amazing ways they fit together with unsuspecting pieces of the first book sets the stage for the rest of the series to be a work of true literary craftsmanship. You keep wondering, &quot;Did she plan that or think of it later? It's so smart!&quot;Nonetheless, the chronology could have used a little kick of creativity to keep it from matching, practically exactly, the sequence of events from the first book.I'm looking forward to more, but also dreading Harry's graduation. After that, will we ever hear from him again?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This series lies to us...its not for kids.

Snape is just as mean and nasty as before, and of course there's Dumbledore right in the middle of things.

While he is staying at Howarts this year he sees that there is mysterious attacks going on, he is being haunted by a secret voice. He later finds out that the Chamber of Secrets has been open. One of his classmates Draco Malfoy has been out to get him the whole year and Harry doesn't know what to do. Harry and his friends Hermoine and Ron use all of their powers to try and find out the 50-year-old mystery of Howarts.What I liked about this book was all of the suspense and good detail scenes. This book has to go down as one of my favorite books because it was so easy to understand to me. This book had all the good details to an award-winning book it had excitement, thrill, and heart pacing at some points of the book. I recommend this book to someone who has a good imaginary and one who like to read a lot. I read this book because I saw that it was a top seller and I saw the movie.

I must applaud J.K. Rowling on another amazing book. This tale of magic, mystery, adventure, and a group of fears will have you guessing on what happens next.This really was an awsome book. This book definatly was an adventurous book, and one that I could not wait to find out what would happen next. In this book Harry is rescued by Ron from his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's house during the summer. He then stays at Ron's house until school at Hogwart's school of wichcraft and wisordry resumes in sessions. While at Ron's house he goes to Diagon Alley using flew powder to get there. He doesn't end up there at first but does in the end. Then him and Ron miss the train to Hogwarts so they take Ron's dad's flying car and smash it into a whomping willow where there almost killed. There is also a new teacher of the defenses against the dark arts, Gildery Locheart, who is really arogeant and annoying. When Harry breaks his arm in a quiddich match Locheart dissolves the bone instead of fixing it and causes more trouble throughout the book. The big thing is that the heir of Slytherin has opened the Chamber of Secrets and is petrifing students. The last time the Chamber was open a student was killed, a mixed blood(half muggle, half wizord). Now Harry believes Hermoine is the target of this death. Now its a race against time to find out how to close it, who's the heir, and how to keep Hermoine from being killed and all the petrifings of students to end. To find out how it ends you will have to read the book. This was an awsome book and I really loved reading this. This is a really exciting, adventurous, and mischivious book. I really liked reading this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although this book is very well written and interesting to me it is a bit disappointing. In my opinion it is not played out as well as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I believe that this mistery has a great deal of suspense and action but does not cut it for me. This story plays with the past too much and as there are only supposed to be seven books to Harry Potter I would like to see more of the present. Although some aspects of te past interest me, for instance, Harry's parents. What they did to fight against Voldemort and their school days. But none of this is present in this novel and the past that it does play with does not go in depth too much. It leaves you with basic information that could be summed up in a paragraph but is fluffed to about five-ten pages. Not much of this information will play a major role in the future of this book series or at least I think so. This book features some interesting things though. It gets more in depth with Harry's ability to talk to snakes, adds a past of Hogwarts, the quidditch season always to be looked forward to, a duelling club, and a monster who is as deadly as they come. I will still recomend this ook to many because it is good, but is not close to the best of the series by far."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fascintating book. It was hard to put it down when it was time to stop reading. In Harry's second year at HogwartsHe discovers more about himself and his enemies, has many more adventures, makes new friends, and gets in more trouble. This book from page one was grat. It had a very good starting, which lasted throughout the book. Quidditch matches in this book were fantastic. The fast pace game was an added bonus to the plot and story line of this book. J.K. Rowling has done it again. It is better than the first. In the first they had to set everything up, which took a lot of reading time, and then finally go to Hogwarts. In thie Second one They got to Hogwarts earlier in the book, so there was a lot of good things from Hogwarts. This book is intended for everyone who has read the first. In the first it explains a lot about Harry and the school. Even if you havent read the first, it explains a little of it at the first of the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In J.K.

This book is definitely worth reading if you read the first one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter the Chamber of Secrets by J. K.

Judging from the other reviews I've read, the book is wildly popular with its &quot;target audience&quot; (i.e. kids aged 9-12). But don't let that fool you. I'm 32 years old, and I loved the books too (both Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets). If you're looking for a page turner full of great characters, exciting storylines and a wonderful sense of imagination, look no further -- no matter how old you are. Kudos to J.K. Rowling for reminding me we're never too old for a &quot;children's&quot; book. P.S. -- If you like these stories, try C.S.

He has 2 very close friends named Ron and Hermion. They are involved with the mystrey too. Harry goes to a wizard and witchcraft school called Hogwarts. This is a very adventures story. My class has read the first one and we will start the second one soon. Harry is the Spotter in a game called Qudich. If you read this book you will love it too. J.K.

Soon, though, the prospect of returning to Hogwarts School brings him the promise of more adventure and, of course, mortal danger.With this book, J.K. Rowling showed that the first book wasn't a fluke, that she knows how to craft an involving children's fantasy that doubles as complicated, twisted and dread-filled mystery. She also shows that she's creating a universe for her readers full of endearing, believable characters and plot cornerstones.It's no mistake that each book follows roughly the same course, starting in pretty much the same place each time. The things Rowling is able to do within the plot structure and pattern that she sets up in HARRY POTTER is nothing short of remarkable.These are great books, and, though CHAMBER OF SECRETS isn't my favorite or the most complicated and satisfying, the ending, which you won't see coming at all ... unless you've seen the movie, is startlingly inventive."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the Harry Potter series: The Chamber of Secrets, is a facinating book with more excitement and adventure than the first book.To begin with, Harry has to first excape the prison of his Aunt and Uncle's house on Private Drive and this is just the beginning of all the trouble and adventure Harry has in his second year at Hogwarts. The mystery of who opened the Chamber of Secrets is confussing for Harry and his friends, which just motivates them to reveal who the culprit is even more. Harry meets a lot of new and old friends along the way and they all in some way help to discover the truth. The ending is definately a surprise to all readers young and old.You'll find yourself not wanting to put this book down, and there is still the source of excitement and mystery with reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started reading The Chamber Of Secrets as soon as I finished Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I found the book to be funny, scary, thrilling, engrossing, and above all, enchanting! It made me a believer in magic, and that there is actually a Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft. The plot is actually a bit darker than the first book, but just as interesting. Harry is superb, and so are his friends. But, there is a slight defect. At times, Rowling makes the plot too obvious, and abrupt, but that is just like the sunspots on the sun, and hardly noticeable. Overall, this book is magnificent! Run and buy a copy now! Or go to the library and issue a copy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book twice. Because this is the most interesting to me, at least. Of course, I read all 'Herry Porter' series. When I read it, I smiled unconsciously. Also, I feel the child's mind and pureness. It was that I lost before. Especially, Herry's words and action are honest any other boys although it was not always. A big fascination of Herry is bravery. Because of this, I am unable to take my eyes off this book. Another charm is a writer's literary style. It seems to drink in my heart. Hereat this is my favorite book. If you will read this, you should meet with above impressions like me.

I thought they may be too mature for her (plus some strong magic themes), due to the fact she would be reading them by herself. I read all of them first to prescreen them and thought \\"well, what is all the fuss about?\\" If your child can understand fantasy, and make-believe there is no reason not to buy this book right now. This book is fun, and filled with creativity. The Harry Potter series is in my opinion the most clever children's series ever written. My daughter and I have had many discussions about the book, and she is quick to point out what is 'silly make-believe'. Of course secretly she is hoping there are flying cars! These books are wonderful for opening your childs mind to endless possibilities. The stories are rich, and the characters are so real you think they will pop out of the page. I hope more books keep coming out in this series. I should state I am a christian parent. I am probably a little more liberal than some others. If you are concerned with your children being exposed to magic and creativity these books are not for you. Although, there are no pagan rituals, Harry does cast spells. The important lesson is he always defeats the evil, which can be another great tool when talking to your kids about God and religion.

It is richly filled with action, suspense, horror, and humor. The characters give strong performances and the words are very detailed. It is also filled with strange and horrific creatures, sorcery, magic, and it brings out the best of the Harry Potter series. Author J.K. Rowling certainly contributed a lot of hard work into this story and was very descriptive of every single detail that happens in the book. I give this book 5 stars because when I read it, I most assuredly enjoyed it. When I read it, I felt as if I was right in the middle of all the action. I will get a chance to read the rest of the Harry Potter books, but I think the Chamber of Secrets will always be my favorite."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm going to proceed to be one of roughly 3 million people to review this book. \\"Why bother?\\" you ask. Good question. My only reply would be that I might as well lend my voice to the many that have already proclaimed this book as a good one. This book is indeed a good one.The two adjectives that I find most appropriate here are light and fun. This book is light and it's fun. It's also what you expect. I recently did a review of the second book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. A sentiment I expressed was that if you read the first one, you were more than likely going to read the second one. Same goes for this series. If you read (and liked) the first, there's no reason at all not to continue with the series.I'm not going to be specific in describing much about this book and the story within it. There's a boy who's going to wizard school. Need we say more? If you read the first one you know the story. Something bad happens. The boy and his friends try to solve the mystery, breaking just about every school rule along the way. Naturally, an interesting adventure ensures. It's all part of the same general story line that guided the first one.Even though I trivialize the specifics of the narrative, it really is fun to read. One doesn't pick this book up with the idea that Harry Potter is going to lose, do we? Of course not. We all know the hero is going to win, especially when we're reading the second book of a (currently) 4 book series. In order for there to be books 3 and 4 (and presumably 5, 6, and 7 some day), Harry and his cohorts need to succeed.What I find most enjoyable about this series is the simple nature of the text that creates this fun. Rowling does a great job keeping things moving along without bogging down much at all, and for that it really is easy to read. If you don't like silly children's adventures, don't bother. But I doubt you're reading this review if you don't like silly adventures.So this book is not what I would call 5 stars, though I'm sure many people will say it is. To each his own, I believe. For what it tries to do, the book certainly is successful. And you could undoubtedly spend your money in worse ways. It's a fun, light read that you could easily knock out on a weekend afternoon. Well worth the effort in continuing with the Harry Potter series.Certainly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the other three (the first, the third, and the fourth) but I have to say, I found this second book to be a disappointment. The plot seemed contrived and fairly drawn-out, which is odd considering that it's the shortest book of the series; and the characters were aimless. Hermione's character particularly seems not only oddly absent, but she makes a series of very un-Hermione-like decisions that would have been better left to Ron or Harry. Guilderoy Lockheart, unlike Kenneth Branagh's excellent characterization in the movie, is downright irritating and useless, and not just to other characters in the book, but also to the reader.All in all, it seemed like a very limp addition to the series after the first book; not terrible, but not exactly up to my expectations. I realize this often happens in the second installment of any series, and am really thankful to say that &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; makes up for any shortcomings in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsBy J.K RowlingThis book is about a wizard boy named Harry Potter who goes to a school called Hogwarts that teaches witchcraft and wizardry.

In this case the legend about the chamber of secrets is no legend. Th wizards and witches say that the chamber lies a monster and anyone that looks directly into the creature's eyes they will be petrified.I loved this book because it's a BIG mystery and that it makes you excpect someone else to be the enemy but really it's always someonethat you least excpect. I would deffinitly recomend this book but not to all ages because it's pretty hard so make recomend this book to 4rth graders ect."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After a long summer with the horrible Dursleys, Harry Potter is all set to get back to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to start his second year in learning how to become a wizard. But the Dursleys are not very cooperative: they want to keep Harry away from all that magical and 'dangerous' stuff. Magic is not for Muggles, and that is all they believe in. So, Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and horrible cousin Dudley Dursley try everything to keep him locked away. But luckily Harry still got friends who will surely try to rescue him. This year at Hogwarts, though, is not going to be a quiet one. Harry is made fully aware of this when he receives a message one night from Dobby, a strange little impish creature. Dobby's warning is plain but clear: \\"Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts!\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to the Philosophers Stone and can still stand upright after a comparison with its predecessor. Immediately following the grand opening sequence it does tend towards some sort of repackaging of scenes already seen in the first book, but this is only a minor defect. When the real story starts to unfold it becomes clear that Rowling has not yet lost her touch of weaving a complex mystery. Again she succeeds in slowly connecting all seemingly unrelated plot elements into one superb finale that can only leave the hooked reader completely amazed.The new character Gilderoy Lockhart tends to be a bit over the top, but this is easily compensated for by introducing poor Dobby, the house elf. I will love to see Dobby getting a bigger role in the next episode. Personally I find it a pity that my favourite Professor Dumbledore became a rather serious character, where in the previous book he had a more absent-minded nature and as a consequence was just more fun.Minor flows set aside this book is a worthy follow-up that will keep you hooked until the end. If, that is, the child in yourself is still alive and kicking..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When you here the \\"toot toot\\" of the Hogwarts Express, you know that another exciting year at Hogwarts School for Wizards is about to begin for Harry, Ron and Hermoine.

Consequently, Harry and his friend Ron decide to go to Hogwarts in Ron's Dad's flying car.They finally get to Hogwarts, but they crash into a tree that attacks them! Arriving in the Great Hall, the boys are nearly expelled because a \\"muggle\\" (non-magical person) has seen them flying through the air in the flying car. The year continues as usual for the young wizard at the world famous wizards academy. A cat becomes petrified into stone, and Harry starts to hear voices in his head (Is it the voice of the evil Lord Voldemord?) Then students start to become petrified and Harry is falsely blamed. Are the answers in the mysterious Chamber of Secrets?The book is excellent because it is suspenseful and is a non-stop thriller. I highly recommend this book but not for younger readers because it has elements that are too complex, for example racism. (The house elves are treated like slaves.) I loved the ending because it was so unpredictable. I felt I was right inside the action, I could not take my eyes away from the book. I am greatly looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, the now 12 year old wizard, had a horrible summer that might have been prevented if a mysterious house-elf named Dobby hadn't appeared in Harry's room with the severe warning not to return to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. Harry ends up locked in his room with no way out. But when Harry's faithful friend Ron and his brothers Fred and George fly a Ford Anglia to his house Harry escapes to the Burrow, the Weasley's home. After a lovely summer with the Weasleys, Harry returns to Hogwarts (With a very rough welcome from a bad tempered Whomping Willow). After the first wonderful school days with Ron and Hermione, an unseen beast from Hogwarts' mysterious past awakens to terrorize, by turning the school's resident muggle borns into petrified statues. Now it's up to Harry, Ron, and Hermione to uncover the Chamber of Secrets, a hidden chamber built by Salazar Slytherin himself. The Chamber is the key to stopping history from repeating itself. But someone-or something-is trying to prevent the discovery of the chamber by trying to take Harry's life. And the residents of the school are not about to help Harry as all the clues hint that he is the prime suspect of the attacks. A cast of wonderful new characters join the old favorites including Gilderoy Lockhart (the self absorbed Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher), Colin Creevy (Harry's biggest, camera carrying, fan) and Lucius Malfoy (Draco Malfoy's trouble making father). \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" is a wonderful follow up to its prequel \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". It reveals more of everyone's past and their envolvment when the chamber was first opened 50 years ago. I loved this book and I hope it will cast its magical spell on you too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What positive values can be derived from JK Rowling's second Harry Potter book besides \\"fun\\"?Well, as compared to the first book, the treatment of Muggles by the magical folks were less stereotypical. Arthur Weasley, father of Ron Weasley, best friend to Harry Potter, offered an alternative perspective. The Muggles, unable to do any spells, came up with non-magical solutions to handle problems in life. An example was the development of lock-picking skills - something which apparently never occurred and a source of facsination to wizards who had become accustomed to using spells to overcome obstacles.The author also showed the prejudice is a prevalent human nature that exists not only by Muggles like Harry Potter's guardian family against the magical folks, and vice versa, but also among magical folks between those whose antecedents were magical and those whose antecedents included Muggles.For those who had read the first Harry Potter book, they might appreciate that JK Rowling added further development to her characters in the second book. The principal characters showed either they learnt from the experiences from the earlier book, or revealed characteristic weaknesses in failure to wise up.Plot-wise, unlike other authors who tried to re-use the formula of an earlier success, JK Rowling took the story through a different plot. In reminiscent of good old traditional mysteries, more clues compared to the first book were scattered through the book on the identity of a mysterious adversary who plagues Hogswart, the school of magic.What is similar to the first book was that the school staff at Hogswart maintaining an official denial to the source of the threat. In the first book, the Philosopher's Stone (renamed the Sorceror's Stone in the movie) was a closely guarded top secret. This time, it was the Chamber of Secrets which was relegated to the classification of myths and legends. Harry Potter and friends must track the mysterious monster released from the horror by a mysterious Heir of Slytherin which threatened to exterminate students whose antecedents included Muggles.New characters along for the ride was the flamboyant new teacher Lockhart who taught Defence Against the Dark Arts, younger sister of Ron Weasley, Ginny, who adored Harry, and Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco Malfoy who antagonised Harry and friends in the first book.Harry and friends had a hard time tracking the elusive culprits, and things never looked more bleak when the greatest defender of Hogswart, Dumblemore, was suspended and sent away from the school. Rowling managed to weave dramatic suspense into the finale.No doubt, impressionable minds (which included more than just children) could be heavily influenced or seduced by lure of the supernatural, as charged by Anti-Harry-Potter activists.Whether Harry Potter is a brilliantly packaged trap to lure the innocent to ungodly witchcraft is probably a question which JK Rowling knows the answer best.However, the ultimate responsibility is on the reader to develop his or her own discernment and this is not likely to happen by banning of books and failure to expose or to prepare the mind to face new challenges."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book I think does not have the suspense from her other Potter stories.Though it is truly brilliant.The book can be enjoyed by all ages from 6 to 60 this has phonomenal structure and even sends chills up your back. From jumping to the Weasleys car to restling the man eating Balisk.If you loved 1 you will love #2 I reccomend you read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book. I loved Harry Potter and the Sorcerors's Stone 2. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was such a great book!!! The action was just as good as in the first one, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and I think that Joanne Rowling is brilliant. She describes her characters very well, and keeps all readers in suspense. The way it works to me is that something happens, then something else really weird, or a key event happens that takes your mind off of the first thing that happens. But by the end of the book, everything links up. As many people seem to think, I love the idea of Quidditch, and only wish that brooms were magical! So what I have to say, basically is that any of the Harry Potter books are THE BEST!! :) So anyone that doesn't think that is no friend of mine."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that the Harry Potter books are terriffic!!! The Chamber of Secrets is just as good as the first one - maybe better. I would suggest this book to anyone!!! J.K. Rowling is an amazing writer and you just can't put her books down!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After finishing HP and the Philosopher's Stone, we couldn't wait to get HP and the Chamber of Secrets, which I'm reading aloud to my twins. But often before I can read the next chapter, my son has already read it to himself. He just can't wait 24 hours for the next chapter! I think Chamber of Secrets is a bit scarier and more violent than Philosopher's Stone and perhaps the youngest children might be afraid of the last couple of chapters. But I also think that there is much to discuss with children about mean people, bullies, nasty relatives, etc. that this book brings to the forefront. I also love that there is a strong female character. Although Harry is male, he can't solve his problems without Hermione, who is gifted and talented, and has quite a head on her shoulders. I also like that although the children have different backgrounds (some born into wizard families, others into muggle families) they all seem to meld together as friends. I'm another mom hoping they don't make this into a movie, but knowing that they will because Harry is a phenomenon that just won't quit. Harry Rocks!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I orderd Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets from England and it blew my mind. Most books get dry after the first book but not this one I'm glad to say J.K. Rowling is still going strong. I loved everything about the book Dobby, the womping willow, the polyjuice potion, the mandrakes. I also liked how Ms. Rowling created Lockhart I love to hate him. I can't wait for the third book or the movies."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was excellent. I had seen it reviewed in TIME magaine and forgot about it after that. However when I received it for my birthday I remembered seeing the title somewhere, and began reading it. I couldn't put it down. Every sentence, every character caught my eyes. I finished it that night. I can't wait for the sequel!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm a 43 year old mother of 3 and found both Harry Potter books great. They were both very exciting and are a wonderful read not only for children but for adults as well. I can,t wait until the third book comes out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Even though I enjoy J.K. Rowling's inventiveness and her wonderful characters, she cannot claim to have invented the idea of a boy going away to boarding school for wizards, because Ursula K. LeGuin already did that in A Wizard of Earthsea. Her main character, Ged, leaves home at age 12 and after a brief apprenticeship to a wizard, he goes to the island of Roke to attend the School for Wizards...a boarding school replete with Professors of the different areas of magic, a best friend, and of course, a bad guy rival."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is just as good as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. After Harry has ruined Uncle Vernon's chances of getting a big drill order from the Masons, he puts bars on Harry's window and bolts his door. But luckily for him, his friends, the Weasly's, get him out in time to go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. But during his, Ron's and Hermione's second year at Hogwarts, the Chamber of Secrets, a secret chamber that only the heir of Salazar Slytherin can open, has been opened and a monster has been lurking around Petrifying people. Not only that, but Harry hears a strange, bodiless voice and he discovers he is a Parselmouth, a person who can speak to snakes. This is very rare, but Salazar Slytherin could do it and his heir probably could too. Soon, people in the school think that Harry's Slytherin's heir, and he's Petrifying everyone. Then Hermione gets Petrified and nobody's quite so sure any more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets is great. I got my version in England sighned by the author. I can't wait till the 3rd book comes out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Funny, thrilling and just a good read....this is a great second book. No, it does not have the depth of some other young reader novels, but the story simply sweeps you away, if you let it. It is very much the type of book that I remember vaguely from my preteen years---a very warm and cozy book for a cold, rainy afternoon....one filled with such vivid imagery that you feel like you are right there in the middle of a Quiddich game or suffering through breakfast with the Dursleys....one that made me feel like I wish I had been born a wizard to Muggle parents...."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love this book because it has so many semi plots.Not only one thing is happening at a time. There is always some kind of adventure going on starting in the beginning. I also like how visual the book seems to be, The author describes everything very well and I can always picture the scenes. I also love how not only good things happen. In reality things don't always turn out right and in this book bad things happen to some of the star charecters. Overall this is a wonderful book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter was great but I haven't been able to get the second one. Full of surprises and magic, different from any other fantasy it was realistic and detailed beyond belief!! Another book I treasure but not quite as good as this one was &quot;The Moore Child&quot;. I wish luck to J.K Rowling!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book was better than the first one, though, in keeping with good sequel tradition, it reprised a number of themes. Not having to introduce characters again, she spent more time elaborating on the plot, which was more complex than the first book. There were not as many inventions, perhaps as in the first one, but more action. Some questions raised in the first book were answered, but a new one was raised: Why doesn't Harry, with all his money, help out the family of friends that feed him and keep him for the last month of Summer vacation?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Although not quite as good as the first Harry Potter book it was still hard to put down. I am waiting for the 3rd in the series in July. I was a little disappointed in the villain, but happy with the characters winning the day and their Quidditch match."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think the second Harry Potter book is not quite as good as the first book, probably because J.K.Rowling did not have as much enthusiasiam on the book, and because she had pressure writing it. I still think it's a great book, though. It all starts when Harry ruins the Dursleys' formal Dinner party, and the Dursleys decide his punishment will be to not go to Hogwarts. Luckily, with some help from Ron and his brothers George and Fred Weasley, he escapes and moves in with the Weasleys. He then gets in a lot of trouble at Hogwarts,and then he and his friends hear that all the muggles will be sent from Hogwarts! When Hermione is attacked,Harry oathes to find out what happened. Read this book and find out more!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished reading Harry Potter and The Chamber Of Secrets and I think it was the best book I have ever read in my life (exept for the first Harry Potter book).

The librarian at my school has the second book and everyone's fighting to get it! It was a really good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was thrilled by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

I liked It so Much that I couldnt Put It Down. Animorphs doesn't compare with it because Harry Potter is much more interesting. Harry gets these notes from someone that he dosent know and then he figures out that he is a wizard. It is such a relief to sleap in a bed at Hogwartes (the wizard school) because he used to sleep in a cabinet under a untidy stair case. At Hogwarts Harry meets 3 amazing frends and one witch he hates. Harry is very popular in Hogwarts because Harry was the first to survive the mean things that the bad witch did. He got a big scar on his head. So If You Like Magic THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter books are the best in the world!

If you're a child, an adult, a wizard, or anyone with a good imagination, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is for you.The story is about a twelve-year-old boy named Harry Potter who goes off to his second year of wizard school and finds strange and mysterious happenings involving a chamber.This book also has good humor, and an outrageously stuck-up professor, Gilderoy Lockhart.

Harry Potter has returned to Hogwart's Academy, ready for new adventures with his pals. However, Harry has no idea what his second year at the academy has in store.

Five stars is an understatement."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book.

I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway.Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic!

While this book took a bit of a back seat with the action you will not be sorry you read it. It was as exciting as the first. I especially loved the new addition to the Hogwarts staff in this book. This book is amazingly written by J.K. and I have no doubt the you will love it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I didn't get around to reading the series until after I saw the movie. I regret stalling.The second book is chronologically similar to the first. You pick up in the summer with the *ugh* Dursleys. The rest of the book progresses through Harry's second year.You're missing out if you don't keep reading the series. The characters gain a couple more facets. The magic becomes a little more complex. The mystery behind the Chamber is much more in depth.Adults, this isn't just a kids book, and you'll be able to pick up on a little Latin and Greek from the spell words that they use."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is a wonderful read!It will satisfy everybody!If you get the chance to read it, I'm sure that you'll be happy that you did- you would realise on how it would transfer you to Harry's world effectively- so effectivly, you'll feel like you're standing right next to Harry and his friends.So, if you're stuck on finding a good book, I suggest that you read this book- and, the other books in the Harry Potter series. It would make you laugh, cry, cheer and many other things."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Unlike Dobby, I've stopped berating myself for spending four years resisting the charms of Rowling's books. Instead of continuing to practice the dark arts, I've found Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Hermoine, and the gang. I loved the first book, but The Chamber of Secrets is indeed richer. The characters retain their goodness--but they grow. Professor Lockhart is inspired. Malfoy is even worse. The story is even more engrossing--and scary. My love for Potter and friends contiunes to grow. I hope you'll excuse me now...Year 3 is calling my name."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In J.K. Rowling's sequel to _The Sorcerer's Stone_ we learn more of the magical world of Harry Potter. It is simply delightful to return to Harry's second year at Hogwarts, meeting new characters like the Herbology professor, Ms Sprout, or the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockheart, and the Whomping Willow, and to learn more about Hermione and the Weasleys. The imagination of Ms. Rowling allows adults (such as myself) to again feel the magic of youth.In _The Chamber of Secrets_, the plot centers around Hogwarts students who are being turned to stone, and a possible plot to once again harm our intrepid hero, Harry. Rowling's prowess at writing a mystery is just as adept as her writing of fiction. It is simply a delighful read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"JK Rowling expands upon the magical universe she created in the first book of this series, a world of secrets and enchantment that exists right alongside our own, albeit hidden from our Muggle eyes. Harry and his friends, in their second year at Hogwarts, are once again embroiled in mystery. Something is transforming students into stone and a mysterious voice that only Harry can hear whispers that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Intriguing new characters include a self-aggrandizing celebrity Charms professor, Draco Malfoy's unpleasant father, and Ron's younger sister Ginny. Recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Very much recommend this one. Book two continues the saga of Harry Potter and is as well done, if not better, than the first book in the series. Actually, this is some of the best writing in this particular genre in quite a few years. It goes quiet beyond juvinal fiction, although I suspect this series will turn out to be one of those that crosses age lines quite nicely. Being as successful as they have been, they are quite open to cheap shot (goodness, there are a bunch of them here), but I would strongly suggest they be read before stones are cast. Not only do we have a good story ling going here, stong character developement, but the author has also given us some very valuable lessions which are rather timeless. Strongly recommend this one. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second entry in the Harry Potter book series is a well-deservedly praised follow-up to the 1998 \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" in almost every way. It is every bit as entertaining and fun as the first but this takes what was great about the first book and builds on it to create an even greater scope for Harry's turbulent life at both his family home and at Hogwarts.In this case, his first year at Hogwarts ends leaving him incredibly exhausted and shaken after learning a bit about the deaths of his parents when he was a year old. Now back at his awful Dursley relatives' home, his life after his first year at Hogwarts is every bit as hellish and unpleasant as it's always been. He now has his own bedroom albeit a small slight seedy bedroom. However a strange event occurs when shortly before the start of the school year, a House Elf named Dobby makes a surprise visit to Harry's home warning him now to return to Hogwarts this year. Harry Potter however rebukes Dobby's warnings and after escaping the Dursley's unpleasant household, he returns to Hogwarts for his second year and reunites with his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger.However his second year at Hogwarts is no less dangerous than his first year was. In fact the dangers at Hogwarts are even greater than the last time. Harry hears a dangerous whispering voice that echoes throughout the hallways of Hogwarts which no one else can and the voice that Harry hears utters the words \\"Kill\\" which alarms him. Even worse is that several students at Hogwarts start turning up \`petrified', as in put into a state of being alive but unable to move and are as solid as rock although not actually turned into stone but in a frozen animated state. The confusion from all of this causes a series of confusion among Harry, Hermione, and Ron as they learn more about the History of Hogwarts. During that time they learn about what is believed to be a secret underground lair called the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" which was built by one of the four founders Salazar Slytherin. The chamber according to legend can only be opened by the person who is actually the \\"Heir of Slytherin\\". Now they have to find out who exactly the \\"Heir of Slytherin\\" really is before he/she starts to not only petrify students but also killing muggleborns and half-bloods (Both to one pureblood and one muggleborn or muggle parent) and prevent him/her from taking over Hogwarts.I found this book to be an even greater successor to the \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" book in many ways. \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" is a lot darker and more mature than the first one and builds on the greatness of the first. The overall tone has a much spookier tone and some elements may be a little too much for younger readers and those who have a fear of spiders and snakes because there are a lot of them here.The movie adaptation of this book released in 2002 was very well done but even as great it was, there were some plot elements that were never filmed in the movie and that I was upset over. One was the confrontation between the benevolent Arthur Weasley and his main enemy, the malevolent Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry's school antagonist Draco Malfoy. In the movie it was just a short verbal confrontation which ended without any serious incident. In the book, it turned into a very ugly physical fight between the two enemies.I also enjoy reading this book is like the first one, it tells the story through a very different light then the movie counterpart. Not knocking on the film, the characters that I imagined when reading the books looked significantly different from the movie versions especially Severus Snape. Also just the general imaginations that the books evoke can be very different from that movie version as well. The movie is awesome but the book is a totally different dimension all on it's own. In other ways this novel also showcases how some seemingly malevolent individuals may actually be either just a brat or actually on the good side and that they are not what they may come out to be. Even people with similaries to let's say previous evil beings may turn out to be totally different after all through the right circumstances.Go and get this novel when you can. The movie is good but for the most part, novels are almost always more imaginative and more compelling than the movie adaptations can ever be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowlings book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was not only very well written, but quite entertaining. An audience of any age or background can enjoy this book. The way Rowling uses the characterization of Harry is quite impressive. She has developed a well-rounded character who brings life to an otherwise ordinary boy. The way she uses so many well-developed characters helps keep the story going. Ron and Hermoine, although playing the sidekicks, are very developed and play such a great role in Harry's adventures. Also her static characters add so much intrigue and at times comic relief. The pace of the plot is very quick so you never loose interest in the story line. She uses such great twists in the plot that it is almost impossible to lose interest in this book. Although at times a little juvenile, the writing style holds your attention with her use of imagery. This use of imagery painted graphic pictures at every moment in the book. This is one of the most entertaining books I have read. As a person not interested in magic or any type of science fiction, the magical influence was most intriguing. She must have one of the most interesting imaginations of most of the authors in this genre. I would give this book a 9.5 out of 10 because of its superb writing and its entertainment value. The only aspect of the book I did not like was the way the book focused on the Polyjuice Potion but it did not really affect the plot all that much."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling did not disappoint on her second Harry Potter adventure. This time Harry and company are faced with students being turned into living statues, a monster running amuck and rumors of the Heir of Slytherin returning to claim what resides in the Chamber of Secrets.I really thought Harry would have a better time in this book, after all the confidence and friends he gained in the first book. But it turns out Harry's life is even worse Book Two. His aunt and uncle (who were no gems in the first book) are utterly abomidable here. Right off the bat Harry is in trouble with the faculty and his fellow students think he has something to do with all the strange happenings. Harry still has some of the awkwardness of the first book, but when the situation calls for it, he is able to put his fears aside and do what needs to be done.Excellent job with the characters. The new teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, is an egomaniacl blowhard who believes too much of his own good press. Really annoying guy, especially to Harry. Rowling also presented us with more of the Weasley family, and what life is like for your &quot;typical&quot; wizard family just trying to get by. Lots of plot twists and no slow parts. Look forward to Book Three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As I began the second book in the good ol' Harry Potter series, I was worried as to whether or not I would enjoy it quite as much as the first. I was not disappointed!After becoming involved in a more intricate plot, I enjoyed the further character development of all of the characters. Each successive Harry Potter book seems to grow up, one step more than the first, just like Harry, himself.While Harry may not be the most brilliant wizard in Hogwart's [Hermione takes that award], he has the most heart. This second installation in the series shows just how much heart Harry has! More secrets about Harry's past are unearthed in breathtaking magical episodes.This second book will leave you guessing, much more than the first. It has more questions, answers, and fun!Harry Potter is a remarkable gift to the literary world, both children's and adult's. I was a sceptic before I actually picked up JK Rowling's magnificent books, but now, I, too, am a huge Harry Potter fan.If you enjoy reading, are looking for summer reading, or are just curious as to what all the hype is about, read Harry Potter. Harry will bring out the kid in the adults, and activate the imaginations in children. This book is the perfect summer reading, when it is too difficult to concentrate on anything but fun.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"With all of the hype surrounding Harry Potter, I would bet that many people will pass over these books as nothing more than a fad. That would be unfortunate. I was one of the people who bought them on a whim. I was taking a friend of mine to the Atlanta airport, when I noticed &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; on the shelf at a bookstore. Knowing that they would fly off the shelves if I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that evening), I bought a copy. Not only that, but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who, in the heat of the moment, believes that if I don't get one now, I'll never be able to!)I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece for Christmas. Now, I heard the stories about how &quot;evil&quot; the books were supposed to be, so I decided to read the first one - just to see. I was HOOKED.I read all the books the week I bought them. I gave my niece a card and $20.00 for Christmas.Sure, these books may be the epitome of mass market publication. And you might get sick of seeing Harry Potter everywhere. But when it comes down to it, the books are good. Ignore the trinkets, the bookends, posters, glasses, stuffed animals and all the hype. Buy the books. take it from this 30+ year old kid - they are every bit as enjoyable as they are made out to be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is possibly my favorite of the series. This I loved the ending with a preticular magical creature(I'm not alowed to give out spoilers). I also enjoyed finding out about Voldermort's and Hagird's pasts and I thought that the Mandrake plants were an incredibly funny plot twist. It was also nice to see a bit of the magical world out-side of hogwarts and to get to know the weaslys a bit better. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of one problem with this series, the prevelent sexisim (the fact that even though the weaslys are poor Ms.Weasly dosn't work. Ginny is given the role of simpering little damzle in distress. Professor McGonagall nearly faints, for no reason, when Harry and his friends return from their adventure.) I hope books five through seven are much less sexsist. If they are then I will be able to enjoy them a hole lot better. I would also like to mention the amazing writing talent and imaganation of the book's Writer J.K.Rowling who's language and style take you into these books. When I finnished reading the first book I looked up and was nearly shocked that I was in my living room and not waiting in Kings Cross Train Station, I also got the same feeling from this book the first time I read it, when I had finished the first three books of this series, I decided to read them to my brother(who was nine at the time but has a learning disability and has trouble reading)who showed veary little interest in them until I started to read them to him, by the forth chapter of the first book, when we had finished the first book(with surprize ending which he hadn't gussed) he was that much more exsited to read the second book and the tables turned (while reading the first book I had to ask him to make time for reading, but durring the second and later the third book he was the one bugging me to read day and night). Sorry I sometime rant on and on and on...... Any how my other brother who has probaly never read an entire book in his life read through the Harry Potter series in just over a week, and convinced my mom that miricles really do happen. Probaly my favorite thing about the series and one of the things that make me want more and more is the surprise endings which convinced me that these books weren't talking down to teenagers, the plots are as thick and filling as any adult book I'v read and they deal with caracters that are my age instead of twenty and thirty and forty year olds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a VERY GOOD BOOK! I enjoy reading a great deal, and being 16, I have am a very picky reader. I like many adult novels, but there is an occasional children's novels that strike my eye, and Harry Potter has not only cought my eye, but all of my friends' too. (Imagine a group of five 16-year-old girls discussing Harry Potter at lunch!) We absolutely love it! Harry Potter is well written, and even though it is fantasy, J.K. Rowling makes it seem as though magic is completely possible. I would recommend this book for anyone, any age, who likes reading!

I would recommend this book to anyone. The reason I liked this book so much is it kept my attention and I couldn't put it down. The content was wonderful and it made me laugh along the way.

RowlingDo you know what wizards study? Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secret is about a boy wizard. This book's author is J.K Rowing, and it's about fantasy at the wizard's school. Harry Potter is the boy who is the main character in the story. Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets is the second episode of the Harry Potter series. It's about the second term of Hogwarts school. In this story, he drove the flying car with his friend Ron, and he met a big problem about the Chamber Of Secrets that was connected to Voldemort. Then Harry needed fight to Voldemort again. Also within the story, it showed about the giant spider, Aragog, and the scary terrible snake, Basilisk. I think it is more interesting than the first episode, and you should read this book.I'll explain the three important characters in the story. First, the main character, Harry Potter, is a dynamic character, and he is the protagonist. Harry is courageous, and sometimes he is so curious. He is thin and wears glasses. He has scar of Voldemort's attack, also he can talk to snakes (that is an important part of the chamber of secrets). Next is Harry's best friend, Ron Weasly. I don't think he is an important character, but he almost helped Harry. He is a static character, and he is a secondary character. Ron has red hair, blue eyes, and he looks absurd. Because he is impulsive, he does very ridiculous things, but he is very helpful to Harry. At last is Tom Marvolo Riddle. He really is Volemort. He is a dynamic character too, and he is the antagonist. He killed Harry's parents and he abhors Dombledore. But now Voldemort is dead, though he still has magic and his memory lives in the diary. He is so mean and he can give orders to Basilisk.I like this book, because it is about fantasy and wizards, and it shows very interesting and serious problems in each episode. That makes it a more interesting book. This book has very serious and terrible events happening to Harry because of Voldemort. But the main character, Harry Potter, conquers each problem. The interesting things are within the plot of the story. When I read Harry Potter, I think it is the most interesting fantasy novel in my book list. Then I want say to you, \\"Read Harry Potter. You can learn the world of wizards.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsBook Review - ***** (out of *****)To say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an improvement on the first book isn't quite doing its role justice. Harry Potter is, at the same time, a running story and a series of episodes. Chamber of Secrets confirms that, being at the same time an individual adventure focusing on loyalty, and expanding on all of the ideas hinted at in the first book. These ideas include the blood prejudices, the history behind the war with Voldemort and the history of Hogwarts.If you thought that the Sorcerer's Stone was a great depiction of a fantasy world, you haven't read anything yet. This is a wonderful series in that Rowling has saved certain details and revelations for certain books to which they are relevant. As we read along, we discover things about Harry's world that are entirely new even six books into the series. The most exciting details given in Chamber are about the history of Hogwarts and the characters and culture of the Wizarding world. We learn for the first time (although it was hinted at in the first book) that some wizards believe that they are better than others due to their pure bloodline. This discovery is really the heart and soul of the series, because everything that happens from here on out (and before) is a result of this mentality.This is probably the shortest review of a movie or book I've ever written, but the truth is that most of this book should be experienced for oneself. It is too great an adventure to turn up."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that this book was better than the first one. The setting takes place again at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. The plot again Harry defeating Lord Voldemort. Harry learns that he can speak to snakes and ends up beating Lord Voldamort's snake in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry also has some new friends and a new professor. Dobby the house elf, helps protect him, but also gets him into trouble. Moaning Myrtle, a ghost that haunts the girl's bathroom and is one of Lord Voldamorts first victims. Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, the new professor of the Dark Arts, who is very into himself and loves attention. Ginny Weasly, Ron's younger sister, who has a crush on Harry.I liked this book a lot and cannot wait for the other books and movies to continue."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started to read this book and was immediately hooked by the imagination and creativity that was put into Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. There was great mystery, suspense, and exitement that kept the reader hooked and begging for more.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. It is the story of a boy who is unusual due to the fact that he is a wizard, but also to the fact that he vanquished the evil Lord Voldemort as a baby, and no one seems to understand why. The book starts off with Harry spending the summer at his Aunt and Uncle Dursley's house when he is visited by a house elf that came to warn him not to go back to Hogwarts, Harry's wizarding school. Once Harry finally gets to school, after many delays, strange things start to happen. Muggle borns are attacked and everyone seems to think that Harry is the culprit! Then he must find the Chamber of Secrets and what is attacking his fellow students and destroy it forever.This book was rated five stars for a very good reason. It includes morals like trust and friendship that make this book much more than just a fantasy. If you thought that the first one was good, you'll think that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a true masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"did not get off to the best of starts. He and his best friend missed the train and instead of waiting for help to arrive stole a car to get to school. It wasn't as though Harry had not been warned after all, a house elf had told him that he should not return to school, but Harry had all he could take of the Muggle relatives he lived with. Not returning to Hogwarts was just unthinkable!Unfortunately things did not improve as the year progressed. It seemed as though someone was stalking the residents of Hogwarts, casting terrible spells and causing all sorts of trouble and the clues all seemed to point to Harry. Just who was the 'heir to Slytherin'? What was in the Chamber of Secrets and where was it? Who or what was stalking the students? What was that voice that only Harry could hear?This is the second book in the Harry Potter series. It could be read and enjoyed by itself but I would recommend reading the books in order for the full experience. As with the first book the world of Hogwarts is enchanting (no pun intended), the characters are engaging and the mysteries will keep the reader guessing until the last page."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, is full of that...secrets. The story continues and, to use an old clich&eacute;, the plot thickens...I won't tell you what this is about...that would ruin it for you. But I'll say that you won't be disappointed. This book was great and highly enjoyable. Not as good as the books that follow in this series, but good.J.K. Rowlings \\"Harry Potter\\" books are books that one can understand what is happening even if you haven't read the rest of the series, though I would recommend that...reading the previous.J.K.

This book is probably one of the weaker one's in the series, though. The only thing I don't get is how this book got 5 stars and so many other great books that tower over and of the Harry Potter books got 4 and a half of 4 stars. It's probably because anyone could read Harry Potter and enjoy it, as their isn't much thought involved."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Filled with mystery, surprises, suspense, wonderful characters and imaginative detail, the Harry Potter books, created by J. K. Rowling, make for excellent reading. \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is no exception and is one of my very favorites in this addictive series.From the very beginning of the book I was enchanted. Summer vacation is almost over and Harry can't wait for school to start, nor can he wait to get away from his miserable relatives, Muggles Aunt and Uncle Dursley and their spoiled rotten, pig-like son, Dudley. Harry has suffered enough of their insults and longs to go back to The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his real home. His parents were killed by the evil Voldemort, and the Dursleys, his only living family, took him in to raise. On Harry's birthday, right before school begins, his uncle banishes him to his bedroom while the family entertains visitors. Dobby, a house elf sneaks up to Harry's room to warn him not to return to Hogwarts. Danger awaits! From the moment of Dobby's warning, the mystery begins.And terrible danger arises very soon after Harry and Ron make their entrance at Hogwarts, reunite with Hermione, and other old friends, and meet-up with Draco Malfoy, Harry's malicious arch rival. Malfoy is after Harry again, Big Time! Of course the beloved giant Hagrid is at school to welcome the students, along with Professor Dumbledore, who is at his best, quoting such wisdom as, \\"It is not abilities that show us who we really are, it is our choices.\\" Professors Snape, McGonagall, and herbology teacher Sprout are all back this year. They are joined by new professor, Gilderoy Lockhart, a narcissistic charlatan, who is very ineffective in his specialty, Defense Against the Dark Arts. And all look forward to the first Quidditch game of the season, which proves to be extremely dangerous!The horror begins when Harry starts hearing sibilant voices, that are not heard by anyone else, and ominous words appear on the walls, written in blood - \\"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.\\" Mysterious events begin to reoccur, each one creepier than the next. The school may have to close for the safety of the students. And almost everyone suspects that Harry is involved. There is an intense battle which takes place in the Chamber of Secrets that had me on the edge of my seat. Seriously scary here, so take care when reading aloud to little ones.Ms. Rowling's characters are fabulous, as is her humor! Some of the many funny beings who populate the novel include: medicinal Mandrake plants, used for special potions, whose roots scream when pulled, a Whomping Willow Tree, peculiar pixies, giant spiders, Professor Dumbledore's pet phoenix who occasionally burns and rises from his ashes, Mopy, Moaning Myrtle, a ghost who lives in the bathroom, etc.. Oh yes, there is a magic flying car that Harry and Ron Weasley drive back to school when they miss the train - and what a drive!This book is a pure delight! I highly recommend it to anyone who is a child at heart, and loves adventure, and imaginative writing. I think it is a good idea to read Book 1, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" before this one, but it is not necessary. Enough background information is given here that \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" can be read alone. Bravo, J.K. Rowling ! You've done it again!JANA"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is about a famous wizard named harry potter who triumphed over the wicked Lord Voldemort .

Two new characters are introduced - a house elf named Dobby who wants to save Harry's life, and the new DADA teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, a pompous braggart. This year, a secret room in the castle has been opened; it contains a monster which has attacked some students. As Harry and his pals try to learn who is controlling the monster, they find a fifty-year old blank diary, which belonged to a boy named Tom Riddle. There is a very exciting climax involving Harry, Tom, and the monster. As always, the friendship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione is the key ingredient that makes the HP books so heartwarming and memorable.Jim Dale does not merely read the book, he performs it. Each of the many characters has a very distinct voice and personality. Hermoine is girlish, Lockhart is comically vain, and Dumbledore is frail, yet powerful. I happily recommend the audio version thanks to Jim Dale's entertaining performance.Kona"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second book in the Harry Potter series is just as action packed and fun to read as the first.

In the book HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, Harry returns to Hogwarts, school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and meets an all new challenge. Harry returns to the Quiditch field for practices and games, he meets up with his old friends and his big buddy Hagrid, and even get into a few duels with his nemesis, Draco Malfroy. After strange occurences started happening around campus, Harry is determined to find the culprit who is putting very serious spells on the rest of his classmates and risks his life to help all those around him. It is exciting to read about Harry as he discovers secrets about himself and his past. There is so much comedy in the book between Harry and his two best friends, Ron and Hermine, but it will also keep you on the edge of your seat itching to find out what happenes next. I would recomend this book to anyone no matter their age. J.K. Rowling has broken the barrier of children book and adult reading and has entertained many of all ages.

Chamber is a novel with appeal to all ages, much outside the 9-12 market in the book description. For young adults, Chamber will be a challenging and exciting read (and reread). For adults, Chamber is fun. It'll take you back to your youth. One thing I find striking about J.K. Rowling is her extraordinary knack of being able to capture the essence of young adulthood. Harry, for all his wizardness, is special and unique in the way all 12 year olds are. His friends are great and his adventures are entertaining. A fun read all around."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book of the Harry Potter series does an excellent job of living up to the expectations set by the first book. The story in which the 12-year-old wizard, Harry Potter, faces trials and tribulations testing his supernatural abilities will undoubtedly keep you on the edge of your seat and always wondering what will happen next.The novel begins at the Dursley's house where Harry lives with his \\"muggle\\" (non magic) aunt and uncle. Due to the differences between the two types, Harry is treated horribly by his family and looked upon with disgust. Things begin to spiral further downward when a creature named Doby shows up to warn Harry that he should not attend Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardy this year because \\"bad things are supposed to happen\\". However, Harry insists on going since it is the only excuse he has to leave the Dursley's home. Doby then decides to mingle with things in order to prevent Harry from going and in turn gets him into quite a bit of trouble. A few weeks later while at school, terrible accidents begin to happen to the mudbloods, the witches and wizards that come from non-wizard families. Then, a disturbing message appears on the wall stating that the chamber has been opened once again. This message provokes Harry and his two closest friends Ron and Hermione to investigate the confusing situation, providing for an interesting mystery full of twists and turns.The theme of this book teaches a moral by denouncing the act of discriminating a group of people. By targeting the mudbloods, Rowling is showing how wrong it is to treat someone differently for an unavoidable reason. ... I think that she is teaching us all a lesson through her writing, and we should take the time to listen to the message she wishes to convey.I loved this book for the simple fact that I felt able to escape from my world and enter the magical and enchanting Hogwarts school. While reading J.K. Rowling's novel, my imagination is given the option to run wild and I feel once again like a little child. I sincerely recommend that everyone read this book if given the opportunity. I believe that people of all ages would thoroughly enjoy reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read!

Harry Potter is uniquely written novel and the story is different from any other books. No matter how old you are, Harry Potter can always bring you back to the world of imagination you have always dreamed of when you were young.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts out in the second year at Hogwarts. Harry and his friends were doing well until there were mysterious attacks which involved them. It was believed that the Chamber of Secret had been reopened by the heir of Slytherin. Because the attacks were unsolved, Hogwarts was at risk of being closed, so Harry and his friends had to do something to prevent it.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the most interesting novels. It has every element that makes a story so addictive. It makes you laugh, yet it makes you cry. It is adventurous, yet it is fantasy. It has comedy, yet it is exciting. Every word of every line of every page brings you to the world of dreams where magic is no longer just a tale; it brings you to the world where flying broomstick is common and transfiguration is just an ordinary thing.Harry Potter is suitable for all ages, every gender, every race, and every kind of person, though the younger ones might enjoy it a little bit more. Harry Potter can make any kind of reader completely fall in love with it because of its easy-to-read style which allows the readers to relax and enjoy. The younger ones, however, might understand more details and be more imaginative because Harry Potter's age is closer to their own so there may be some details where the younger generation will understand more.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will not disappoint you, as it is one of the best-selling novels in the world.

I am a Harry Potter junkie. I am compulsively obsessed with Harry Potter. Need I go on?What a fabulous, wonderful follow-up to the fantastic first installment. Harry had me going places this time, for sure! And what adventures we went on...sneaking off into the Forbidden Forest following a trail of spiders, hanging out in the girls' bathroom with Moaning Myrtle, zooming through the air in a flying Ford Anglia. It is never enough to be a normal student for Harry, NO WAY! He HAS to solve the mystery of the Heir of Slytherin (and get himself into lots of trouble along the way).Harry fans, you will not be disappointed with Year #2. Does not let you down after the attention-grabbing goodness of the first one. And the better news? There's 5 more to go in the series..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm 32 years old and originally bought these books for my infant son, thinking (with all the hype going on) this might be cute to read to him at night. We started with one chapter a night, but after the first two nights I couldn't wait any longer and read it all the way through. Then I got my husband to read them. We loved it and were hooked! J.K. Rowling has a wonderful writing style that both children and adults can enjoy. The children characters are easy to relate with at any age. A great book for parents and children to enjoy TOGETHER!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was a little surprised by how much I liked this Harry Potter sequal. I thought the first book was great, but I'd have to say this one was even more entertaining.J.K. Rowling does a great job not only keeping the twists and turns of plot flying fast and furious but also making you feel that the characters are old friends you're getting the chance to catch up with. When you join Harry, Ron, and Hermione for another year back at Hogwarts, you really feel like you're part of the gang. This is a great book for kids, but also offers much to adult readers. I think Harry Potter is great, not only because it has gotten so many kids truly interested in picking up a book, but also because it gives parents something they can share with their children. I think any sharing of enthusiams is a good thing.On a side note, I found it interesting that a certain similarity of plot with that of the Star Wars films is continued in this sequal. In the first book, Young Harry, who doesn't realize that he has been born with a great purpose, leaves his uncle and aunt's hum-drum home to go on a journey and learn the ways of the magic arts. He must battle a dark nemesis who was once a good magician, but was seduced by the dark side. In this sequal, as in the first Star Wars sequal, one of the main characters is even frozen solid towards the end of the story. If you enjoy Star Wars, give this series a shot; it has much the same spirit to it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Herein we learn more about how the intertwining relationships formed at Hogwarts in the past affect attitudes and loyalties in the present. Harry also struggles with his true nature and destiny, questioning if he is taking the path for which he is appointed. Aww, to heck with all that, this book is as riveting as the first, and nobody should miss it. End of story!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was slightly disappointing. The writing is much the same, but the story takes a turn for the worse. The storyline is predictable, and the new characters are unoriginal and uninspiring. Still, the diehards will love it, and the rest of us will read it so we don't miss out on anything. This is definitely the weakest book in the series, but fortunately it is also the shortest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book I found was very very good , once you pick it up you will find it very hard to put down. Why I found it interesting: I found this book interesting because she makes it look like the obvious is going to happen but then something totally bizarre happens so you just have to keep on reading to find out what will happen next. You know Harry will survive because if he dies the series cant continue but you just can't help thinking that he will die or someone will die. Hermione and Ron are very faithful friends but when someone turns on Harry you feel like you want to say something to them but you then remember that they are not alive.If you are worried about the age limits I would reccomend it for 7-14 yr olds but if you are a parent you will enjoy reading it to your children if they cant read yet. This is a great book for adults and children so don't have any doubts about buying it.This will be a classic for sure!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second Harry Potter novel by the gifted J.K. Rowling is the weakest in the series. The magic of the first book is still there, just not in as great an amount. We still meet colorful characters that enchant us. However, the plot is weak and the adventure isn't as exciting as it was in the first book. Still a great book though, for all ages. Pick up this book today!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;--I'm way behind my son, who's on the fourth book--and enjoyed this story even more than the first book. Now that the main characters have been introduced, there is more time for all the antics that take place at Hogwarts. Harry starts to wonder about his true origins, he makes discoveries that explain many things in his life, all those things that your typical 12 year old does, in a not-too-typical setting!J. K. Rowling must have had a great deal of fun with her Fabio-type instructor character, Gilderoy Lockhart. I'm sure he's there for us grown-ups, as we have all encountered ineffectual people who are all style and no substance, as he is. She also has fun with the mandrakes and the signs they are ready to pick--but I don't want to spoil that for you! Read this book and start some enjoyable inter-generational book discussions with the kid around the block. I guarantee that kid will enjoy sharing reations to Harry and his adventures with you."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well i would like to say that my name is Nabil. I loved this book. And when I say I couldn't put it down I mean it. First I finished Book I THE SORCER'S STONE AT 2:00 AM THEN I STARTED CHAMBER OF SECRETS AT 2:30. I read 72 pages went to bed at 3:30 AM. Then during the day read another 32 pages. Then at around 11:00 PM. I read and read and read and read and... well you get the idea. In the end I stayed up all night. I read 239 pages so in short in 28 hours I had completed the entire book. My only regret is that I do not yet have the third book and fourth.

Rowling's books. His intrepretations of the characters are entertaining. I encourage you to read the book, and after you have completed the book, I encourage you go back and listen to the audio books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"While I loved it when I first read it, I find that \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" only hints at J.K. Rowling's potential as a writer. It is \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" that realizes that potential.In his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, young Harry finds himself suddenly in the midst of a conspiracy. The legendary Chamber of Secrets has resurfaced and bad things are happening. Sides are being taken and discrimination and hate are becoming apparent. Harry, as he seems to consistently find himself, ends up caught in the middle of all of it.This book begins the real meat of the story of Harry Potter. Many seeds of future books are planted deep within this one. The characters, though only a year older, find themselves forced to confront allegorical variants of discrimination and the hurt it can cause. And the evils of discrimination are painted as a path towards darkness. Does it get preachy? Not really, remarkably Rowling manages to put forth her message in such a subtle manner that it sinks in without really being overtly stated. No one ever turns to the audience and tells you what you should think about something. Instead, through example you're shown this. I would suspect the author would hope that through this young readers could see that discrimination and slurs apply not only in the wizarding world.The book itself, like the rest of the series, is brisk and well paced, keeping readers glued to pages and reading well later into the night then they should be. The story develops at a great pace and the storytelling is nothing short of brilliant. In it's way, this is the best entry in the series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book. I have read it three different times, and am now reading it to my younger sister too. I recommend it to anyone of any age, and I can guarantee them that they will love it. Don't hesitate, read it now!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You know a series is simply trememdous when the second book is far better than the first. Such is the case here. There are darker elements at play, and a bit more intrigue as well. CHAMBER a lot more depth than the first, and takes on some pretty intense action. The mystery of Lord Voldemort just keep on growing...and it's got me hooked."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a really good book, that made you feel as if you were at hogwarts, standing right next to Harry the whole time. My favorite characters in this book were Hagrid and Dumbledore. Hagrid is a very nice, caring man, who is very trust worthy to Harry and his friends, Hermoine and Ron. You can tell this by the way that they view him, and the way that they open up to him and tell them thing. Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, is a very nice man, who really believes that Harry will do wonderful things with his magic.I really liked the way that this book opened up your imagionation to an unknown world. It was like while you read this book, you were a part of that magical world too. The author did a good job in keeping you in Harry's shoes, knowing at all times what he is thinking and feeling about what is going on around him.The movie does a really good job of telling the story, but not as good as the book. Also, there are scenes in the book that arent in the movie. For example, in the movie, Harry come across the cat after he is done serving his detention. In the book, Harry, Hermoine, and Ron were all walking together back from Sir Nick's DeadDay party, which was never even mentioned in the movie.This book is a really good fast ready, and i would encourage anyone of any age to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter, is a twelve year old wizard who will go back to Hogwarts for his 2nd year, a school for witches and wizards. But when he is warned of a terror that will take place soon, and he doesn't listen and goes to Hogwarts anyway, horror is awakened. Now Harry must clear his name and defeat the evil lurking in the depths of the castle, in the rumored Chamber Of Secrets, before it is too late.This book is very good indeed, and also shows many times where Harry discovers some secrets about himself that are very suprising. I advise reading the book and then seeing the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is about a kid named Harry Potter, he is 12 years old, and he is a wizard.

What does it want or whom does it want? And why is he doing this?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"On a scale of 1-5, I would rate this book as a 5. I would rate this book as a 5 because of the use of humor and imagination. Occurrences of the imagination and humor of this book occurred when Harry's uncle told him to go to his room and remain quiet while he and his wife entertained their comapny. Dobby, a loud elf-like looking creature appears in Harry's room and tells him not to return to Hogwarts because danger awaits him and everyone else. While mentioning all of this to Harry, Dobby is not quiet and is keeping a lot of noise. Harry tries to keep him quiet, but does not succeed, due to the fact that his uncle comes into his room. The imagination part kicks in when goes to school. Not like humans, Harry does not take a bus or drive to school, Harry has to attend school on the subway platform. Yes, that sems normal, but when Harry misses the subway, he has to take a flying car to school.J.K.Rowling's use of humor and imagination make this book one of a kind.

This book has everything in it. No matter what kind of books you like i guarantee that this book will intrigue you. This book has mystery,drama,suspense, and a little of comedy. There are many imaginary creatures such as a three-headed dog and an overgrown giant as a teacher.

Well in this book, Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets, by J.K Rowling, a boy named Harry Potter goes to Witchcraft and Wizardry School, which is called Hogwarts. Harry enjoys his school a lot because he thinks it's his home. He flies on a broomstick and does magic. Every year something happens. His friends Ron and Herminie always help him out.Half way through the school year Harry and his friends start to get suspicious about the chamber and what's down there. Herminie figured out what was down there, it's the chamber of a basilic. A basilic is a snake and Harry can talk to snakes. The snake starts to petrify people. It even took Ron's little sister Ginny down in the chamber.I really liked this book more than the others, not because it's shorter, but it's more interesting. If you haven't read any of them, at least read this one. I would recommend this book for ages 7 and up and for people who like mysteries and fantasy."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Upon reading the second installment of the Harry Potter series, I am still entranced into the world that Rowling has created. I'm not going to go into the plot of the book for the sheer reason that everyone other review is pretty much doing that for me.I liked the Sorceror's Stone book better than this one and found that one more addictive than this one, still, I loved this book also. The flying car and the self-absorbed Gilderoy Lockhart were just two of my favorite aspects of this particular book. Plus, the dueling club incident was excellent.Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoyed this installment of the series, but I found the first one more enjoyable. Still, check it out. Rowling has created a world which I have become so enchanted with and almost wish truly did resist. How she does it - I don't know. Still, I'm a proud devoted Potter geek."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the Potter series is as good as the first book. Nothing amazingly spectacular, but a good read for people of all ages. It is a little simple at times, but on the whole, almost believable, though you'd think that the wizards in training would have a little more respect for their elders. But self-sufficiency is important. Let me put it this way, I wouldn't not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wizard MadnessHarry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets J.

All the times I've gone to the train station I haven't seen or found platform 9 . Have you ever wondered if a human could turn into an animal? At least that is what I wondered, after reading about 3 odd looking supernatural beings that call themselves witches and wizards. By Diagon Alley they were talking about a famous man named Gilderoy Lockhart who later in the story will be writing about amingus. Has any of that stuff made you curious? If it has you'll might want to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.I found this particular book very entertaining. One of the reasons I thought it was entertaining was because it made me seem like I was in the story during the adventures. For example when a cat jumped off of the professor's desk and turned into professor McGonagall I felt like I was there . There's another reason that the book seems so alive: for example when Ron and Harry play wizards' chess and the pieces act like they are in a real battle field by taking their weapons and hitting the other players."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I fell in love with Harry Potter a couple weeks ago, and have since read the first and second books, seen the vastly inferior first and second movies, and am well into (more than half way) through the third. The second movie and second book were better than the first ones. But the books outpace the movies much more so than any other adaptation I've ever viewed, which I did not think was necessary. But on to the book.This second book proves that Rowling was destined to be a story writer! Her plot twists and story line development are bleeding brilliant. Her character development wonderful to witness. I love her descriptions of things, so vivid and easily imagined!Poor Harry seems to have just the worst fate with his family. Rowling makes it very easy to just despise the Dursleys and empathise immensely with our hero, Harry.What's worse is that Harry seems to just have bad luck with being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and when he tries to explain things, it gets him into more trouble.That Dobby character who does not help poor Harry as much as he'd like to believe he is, though he improves at the end, irritated the socks off me (and Harry) when first we meet him, and the subsequent times we meet him, but I must attribute this with wickedly clever writing skills. His origin seems to be something like a mix of Gollum and Yoda, dressed in a pillow case. Oddly, we do feel, if reluctantly, for the little fella's plight (3 guesses as to which family HE serves!)Fabulous all around! Yay!These are my kind of books! Where were these books when I was in 6th grade??

In this sense, I was disappointed. Maybe the bar was set too high with the first book? It felt like almost the exact same format as the Sorcerer's Stone, only different red herrings. Reading the book began to remind me of watching a bootlegged rerun.I hate to say it, but towards the second half, I just couldn't wait for the Chamber of Secrets to end.

I must be the only one in America."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am re-reading the HP books after finishing Book 7 recently, and have just completed re-reading Chamber of Secrets. It is very well-written, and makes for an engaging read. The story once again follows the exploits of young wizard in training, Harry Potter, who this time finds himself and his two best friends, Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger embroiled in unearthing the dark secret of the chamber of secrets at Hogwarts.There are many amazing things to look forward to for those who are just beginning to get interested in the Harry Potter series. In this book, there is a house elf called Dobby, whose motives seem unclear until the latter part of the book, we have a flying enchanted car [in which Harry and company have some fun in], and a new teacher for the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, Gilderoy Lockhart whose seemingly glorious credentials belies a vain and feeble personality. There is also a new character called Tom Riddle who is very mysterious and whose motives are questionable.There is also of course the chamber of secrets, and our trio of Harry, Ron & Hermione go about uncovering the mystery behind it -is it real or is it just a myth? There are some amazing creatures in this one - screaming mandrakes, a giant spider, and a venomous Basilisk. As to their role in the book, that is for the reader to uncover!Overall, this sequel makes for a fun, and thrilling read, and will surely delight fans of the genre!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book the minute it came out. It is so amazing. I loved how Riddle's journal came into play, and how it was a horcrux. There is never a sentence or word that is out of place, and every bit of this series is connected to each other. I can't wait for the 7th book which I already have pre-ordered off of Amazon.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"But still not gripping me. I just don't see what all the fuss is about, and why people queue up to buy it, especially when there's so many different prices around in the shops. In a few years (or even now) this book will considered a classic, while JK burns her money as she has so much of it. I'll admit I found it a lot easier to read than the first book, I still think that if I'd read the first book when it originally came out, it would not have made me want to carry on. I'm not as easily distracted as I was, and finished the second book in no time (and brought the third into work with me so I could start on that during lunch), but there's something not quite right about it. I am finding the books so far really too similar to each other. JK has the ideas all mapped out, but it feels like there's too little spread over all soon-to-be-7 books. I did NOT get the character of Dobby in this book, he was pointless, and not worth the hassle writing about. What was with the \\"mandrakes\\" too? They made no sense to me whatever. They're used to 'help' in the ending, but there was really no mention of them, or how they helped.I'm actually starting to get more curious about the movies now, but they're not cheap enough for me to even consider buying them yet. It's a bit strange, cos I don't really like the look of the actors in the films. They're not how I would have imagined them if I'd read the books originally, before the films had come out.I'm still persevering with the books, although they're starting to get longer now, which is a bit worrying, as it generally means more padding, and not a lot of story. And since I'm a big chick lit/romance fan, I'm always looking for the slightest hint of romance in the books. It's obvious who JK wants to get together, but she leaves that for the later books. I seriously don't think the youngsters will understand that!There's fairly substantial hints in this book about what the next, Prisoner Of Askaban, is about, and we get a bit more depth to the character of Hagrid. (Who I think would be the only good thing about the films, played by the wonderful Robbie Coltrane.)I'll definitely keep reading & reviewing them, but they're gonna need to get a lot better, before I start giving them a higher rating. They're not worthy of five stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After such a strong start with 'Philosopher's Stone' I was rather disappointed with this very weak entry. I've never read another book with such a straight-foward and plain mystery. I hope the rest of the series isn't going to be this way.A mystery novel should set up the clues in contradiction of each other. The pieces here go together so easily that it ruins any intrigue there could have been. And now that we know our way around Hogwarts and know all the characters and teachers their should be a lot more room for more mystery and new ideas. But that doesn't happen.It's rather weird that 'Chamber of Secrets' is longer than the first yet contains less mystery, imagination and invention. Even the final showdown is very basic and totally without spark. But if you liked the first then give it a shot."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this second book in the Harry Potter Saga, we find Harry back at the Dursleys for summer vacation. The Durleys are no longer afaird of Harry, thanks to an elf. The Ministry of Magic sent Harry a warning, and reminded him that under age wizards are not allowed to perform magic outside school, and the Dursleys are happy with that. Harry's uncle locks him in his room and doesn't let him out.Harry is saved by Ron, Fred and Geogre in Mr. Weasley's flying car. Harry gets to de-gnome the garden, a chore for the three weasley boys.Soon, Harry gets to meet his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart. Gilderoy Lockhart is popular with all the girls in the book (because of his GOOD looks). Gilderoy is not popular with Harry and Ron. Gilderoy seems to like Harry, and gives him \\"advice\\"Gilderoy is a poor teacher, always talking about his books and himself.Soon, the attacks start to happen, and the whole school finds out Harry can talk to snakes. Talking to snakes is a sign of a dark wizard.Just as good as the first book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Would you ever go into a dark, creepy chamber with a snake that could kill you? In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets with a snake that can kill him!This book is so good because you would wonder what would happen next! I liked when Harry went into the Chamber of Secrets. The moral is, if you're friend is in danger, help them.Harry can't find Ginny, Ron's little sister. Can Harry find Ginny before it's too late? Find out in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In the 2nd book of 7 books a new professer took over professer qurril's job. I could never think of writing a fantastic books like this.I have all the books(sourcer's stone/chamber of secrets/prisoner of azkaban and the goblet of fire. Also in the 2nd book a dangrous creature turnes students into stone and the chamber was opened.The only hints for the future is t. riddle and the prisoner of azkaban."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"First I must admit I did enjoy reading the book and that I do not dislike it, but I just couldn't help feeling a little disappointed when I finished it. Some things just don't make sense here. For one thing, if Howgarts can hire a teacher like Lockhart, you can't help but wonder if Dumbledore is really that wise when he can allow such an idiot in the faculty. In this book Dumbledore doesn't live up to his image in the previous book. I think if Rowling had let Dumbledore give us an explanation at the end like she always has, as to why he hired Lockhart in the first place, it'd have definitely made Dumbledore look more worthy of Harry's trust. The Chamber of Secrets is certainly a thrilling book, but not as brilliant as the first."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsThis book is about a boy named Harry Potter. Last year he got some very surprising news. The news was that he was a wizard. This news was of course very shocking to an eleven year old (who had just celibrated his birthday). He also found out the truth of how his parents had died. His mean aunt and uncle had told him that they died in a car crash but they were really murdered by a dark lord. Harry Potter has to go to a special school for young wizards. The school is Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry. Before he returns to Hogwarts an unexpected visitor arrives in Harry's bedroom. It was a house elf named Dobby. Who warns Harry not to return to School, but Dobby makes it almost impossible for him to return. I recommend this book because it is funny, exciting, and full of adventures.In this book Harry goes through many difficult challenges. Some of them are nerve wrecking like when Harry falls off his broom during a Qudditch match. Sometimes they are creepy like hearing a voice no one else a\\\\can hear. Sometimes they are cool too like being able to speak a language that no one else can speak. There are many more so keep your eyes peeled.There are three main characters. The smartest of all is Hermione Granger she is the little miss know it all. The one in the middle is Harry potter he is very smart but some times his mind goes blank. The not as smart as the others is Ronald Wesley he is not the brightest of them all. Those are the basic characters but there are a lot more than three characters in this story.This book takes place in many places but there are three main ones. Harry starts off in London with his aunt and uncle. Then he goes off to Diagon Alley to get his supplies for school. The last place he goes to is Hogwarts School for young wizards. Hogwarts is where he spends most of his time. He has to go to Hogwarts for seven years. This includes summer vacation.Over all I recommend this book to anyone who loves magic and surprises. In the end there are things that happen that I did not expect. This book taught me to expect the unexpected. So I think that anyone who is reading this right now to run out and buy this book. If you're not a book person than run and get the movie. But remember the book is better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" by J.K. Rowling was just an okay book. The book is about Harry and his friends at their school of magic \\"Hogwarts\\". In this story someone is threatening the students by attacking students and then writing that the legendary \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" had been open. So Harry and his friends try to find out who did it. This book would be good to read if you are into stories about magic and adventure. It has also been made into a movie so if you read the book and liked it or didn't want to read it you might like the movie."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets is mainly about a boy named Harry Potter who has been sent to his aunt and uncle the Dursleys. Harry Potter had been a wizard so the Dursleys have locked his in a cupboard and his stuff is locked under the stairs. A boy named Ron Weasley and his brothers have come to help Harry break out.Well in the end a friend of Harry's has been taken in to the Chamber of Secrets and Harry kills a gigantic snake and saves his friend. The part I liked best is when Harry killed the snake. Well I think It's a good book and I hope you read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you've got an imagination, these CDs are better than the movies. You can listen to them to and from work. Makes commuting a lot less stressful and a lot more interesting. The Harry Potter series itself is absolutely awesome. Struggling through good and evil, Harry Potter enchants the imagination and leaves you wondering at the mystery. When the book is done, you'll be looking forward to the next. I personally look forward to the opportunities I have to sit down and listen. All of the story CDs are read by the same narrator and he does voices for the different charectors. The CDs are done very well. Definitely worth the extra money to get them in this format. Even if I'd read all the books, I'd say this format is a worth while purchase."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I got this and the other 5 books for my mother for the holidays because she is a huge HP fan and loves audio books. I have never seen her so happy. She was just like a kid: sitting there lining up the boxes and rearranging and admiring them (they are packaged attractively and thematically). Getting the whole set was expensive but damn is it worth it! The performances, by Jim Dale, are spectacular. He does unique voices for each and every character - some aren't what i imagine they would be but are all rather well done and rarely annoying, if ever. If you're a Harry Potter fan this is a must have!!!Good luck getting these suckers on your computer so you can play them in your ipod or mp3 player; the books are on between 7 and 23 CDs each. It took me 3 days to load them all on my computer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another good book for Potter fans. For in Harry's 2nd year he will again face challeneges, and danger, and risks to do what is right. It is the basic story of good vs. evil but it is still a wonderful book.As the title suggests this book revolves around the mysterious legend of the Chamber of Secrets. When the students learn the contents of the myth (which of course in a school full of teens happens rapidlly) they're all calculating their own ideas of who is behind it and what they are doing.In this book you will encounter new things like petrified people, a dueling club, an insane pompous new professor and a tree who hits back!But it's in the midst of the trouble, when names begin to spring up about who is behind it. Could it be Draco Malfoy Harry's enemy who is full of evil? Could it be Hagrid who everyone knows has a liking for big scary monsters? Or could it possibly, who everyone in the school suspects - Harry, himself?In a desperate race against time, Harry, Ron and Hermione are back, the three of them working as detectives once more. The book is a fast-moving page-turner, expertly written. The story hits its climax with such a wonderful mixture of, friendship, loyalty, danger, and magic.Who will be behind the plot?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well it starts out that Harry is staying at his aunt and uncle's house the Dursleys.And their treating him like trash.This book is awsome.Oh!I love the magic and action.Well this is my review.You'll have to read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of J.K.

I also like to know what they are reading. Thus I picked up their book of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets after reading the first. I must say these books are very well written and are so visually discriptive I can actually picture what the surroundings look like based by J.K. Rowlings words. Yes I have seen the movie and I am very proud of how well they kept to the book, mostly. I am now reading the fourth and plan on reading the whole series with my children."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Except to echo everyone else who loved this book almost as much as the original. By the way, my kid is 16. I admit it. I READ IT and loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As I write this, Amazon lists 1777 reviews already written for &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;...I sincerely doubt I have anything new to add to what has already been written...but Just in case:&quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; like its predecessor, is one heck of a story. I sincerely admire Mrs. Rowling's talent as a writer. She is a master of both suspense and humor. More than that, I find the morality of her protagonists most refreshing. Life is neither cut and dried or black and white. Her heroes are complex...just like real people. They have their faults, yet their hearts are in the right place.I found the development of the characters to be one of the strengths of this book. We get to see whole new sides of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Draco, Haggrid, and he who must not be named...My favorite facet of the Potter books is the importance placed on friendship. As Proverbs 17:17 says: &quot;A friend loves at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.&quot; This is demonstrated nobly by the relationship between Ron, Hermione, and Harry.I give this book my heartfelt recommendation. Reading it is truly magical."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Once you read the first Harry Potter book, you're hooked! This book was just as wonderful as the first and, if not, better. You can definitely tell how J.K. Rowling flourishes and blossoms in her writer's craft as the books become more and more in-depth and lengthy - which is great because when you read the books, you never want them to end!The adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione go on, get more unpredictable and suspensful - which undoubtly gets them in more trouble!! And what's great is your right beside them, really! You feel as though you're right in the room, invisible, observing them!J.K. Rowling is a wonderful and amazing writer. The books move very quickly and could keep the attention span of anyone! I can't recommend this book enough! No matter what your age or path in life, there's no way you wouldn't like the Harry Potter series! :o)*Highly* recommended."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Most People think that this book is the least good out of the series. Well just to let you know it is not. People misjudged this book because it had a weird plot or a more complicated story to understand. I thought the same up until i read it again. And now i have completely changed my mind about this book. I figured out that you have to look at every part of the story and connect every part. I am not going to give anything away. This book connects great with book 4- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Please give this book another chance it is very good."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was awsome. If you like adventure books read this one.

I read the English version (being English) and found myself laughing out loud several times. I think that the storyline was really gripping and I could hardly put the book down. I love the way J.K.

The book started out great and a little tiny bit scary ,but not enough for you to even make a sound and after that you'll probobly never want to put down the book because your eyes will pop out and never come off the book. The book will also make you laugh a little bit. I've read all the harry potter books and they're all great, but this is my favorite and I like it so much that I've read it twice. One of the reasons I like this book is that its got secret and hidden chambers and I think thats what every kid wants to have, they're own little secret room that only they can go into. This book was also great because of all the stuff that sounds real, but no one has heard of and that makes kids want to learn more about so thats why they turn to the next page. so thats what I think of harry Potter And The Chamber of secerets.By the way did I menion that this book was great"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you are a Harry Potter fan, you should really read this book!

But it has... and some...While I refuse to pick favorites in a series as enchanting as this one, I will promise that NO ONE who read Year 1 will be disappointed. I finished the whole book in two nights. I would have loved to &quot;savor the flavor,&quot; but it was too good not to inhale as quickly as possible. Do yourself, and any reader in your family, a favor and buy this book.My marraige proposal to Ms. Rowling still stands."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't read. I hate reading and it's all I can do to get through the day without the book in hand reading it. I think you have to have the same wants and desires as Harry. You have to wish to be a Wizard or Witch. Your imagination runs wild and you feel yourself rooting for him with every page. I'm 28 years old and I bought the first book for my daughter who has problems with reading and I couldn't stop reading it. I had to go immediately and buy this book. Now I'm nearly finished with it and I'm on here today to buy the next two so I won't have to go a day without knowing what's happened. I think I'll be rereading Harry Potter for a long time.

Feeding my spirit."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"EDIT: Some people mark audio reviews as \\"unhelpful\\", which I found strange, until I realized what Amazon does.-- They pool audio and text reviews and place all of those reviews on each of the products' pages, regardless of form the material is taking. You wouldn't expect a book review on the DVD's page. In this case, every word is the same, but a book review tells you only about the story, not the quality of the audio product.-- But any regular audiobook listener has experienced a great book poorly read, or hammed up, or a voice that grated on your nerves, or found a book you loved to listen to, but couldn't find the time to sit and read (Lord of the Rings for me).-- A review of the author's work tells you NOTHING about the audio, and yet, if you try and find what you're getting into, you have to sift through MANY book reviews before finding out the quality of the voice work, as most people have reviewed the author and the book, rather than the audiobook.-- So, here's a small review of the audiobook, if you're interested in purchasing that. If you're looking for a review of the author, I am not being unhelpful, but Amazon is. I will request that they change their policy and display the reviews separately.... Jim Dale is one of the best voice actors I've ever listened to and he brought the books to life an a way that reading could never do. I liked reading the books, but it's really incredible to have someone put a different voice to every character, displaying the emotions and tone of the interactions.... They are a really phenomenal experience, and I've listened to them over again and again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the second book of the Harry Potter series and I liked it a lot. The thing that I really enjoy is that JKR has made it so that the kids who started reading these books were about the same age as Harry. As time has gone on, it's almost like JKR has made the books older growing with not only Harry but with the kids reading them.This book is full of excitement, adventure, and childrens mischief. At parts it's like a comedy, others it's like a murder mystery, and still others it's like an action/adventure. JKR has added just enough of everything to keep her readers interested."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the book for myself - it was nice to listen to the way Jim Dale read the book.

At this school there is a chamber built by one of the four main wizards who started the school called the Chamber of Secrets. It is said that the heir of the person would be the only one who could open the chamber. From here, Harry and his friends embark on alot of adventures.I would not say I loved this this book b ut I did like it. I liked it because it was not slow . it got into the story very fast. And there is hardly a dull moment.One character who stands out in my mind is Harry Potter's nemesis, Draco Malfoy, because he is described in the book looking like an innocent little boy but as soon ashe opens his mouth, that all changes.When I chose this book, I thought, \\"hey the movie was pretty good, so I'll give it a shot.\\" When i finished it I was surprised at how good it was. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an imagination and for all of the reluctant readers who are looking for a book to spark their interest."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't know how J.K.Rowling thinks of all of these adventures but I'm sure glad she does. I loved the new characters. And the flying car was great but I kept thinking that Rons' father was going to get into trouble with his superiors.

Did you ever want to have a magic wand? Well then read this book! Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets. By J.K. Rowling. The book starts off with Harry, and the meanest family in the world. The Dursleys. The Dursleys were a mean family. They made Harry sleep under the stairs. But one day, a brisk fall day, a letter came for Harry Potter. He was in the cupboard under the stairs, like always, when an owl came. (The owls are the mailmen near Harry's house. The owl dropped a letter in the mail. Soon, Mr. Dursley went out to get the mail. Then he went back inside again. \\"What's this\\"? He shouted as he sat down for breakfast. The letter was addressed to Harry Potter. Quickly, Mr. Dursley threw the letter into the fire. The next day, a few more owls came delivering the same letter. Mr. Dursley threw those into the fire as well. The next day, more than a thousand letters of the same came. Very, very, quickly Harry snatched a letter, went into the cupboard and locked it. He read the letter. This letter was about to change his life. After his death, he still has his magic wand in the book. That's all I can tell you. I like that book because it's a good book for anyone to read age 6 and up. And, in the movie it has the best pictures.I think the author shared this book because she wanted to make kids very happy and like reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Would you ever ride a broomstick?Well Harry Potter does and Harry Potter And The Chamber Of SecretsIs a GREAT book!Harry Potter has had a miserable Summer with the Dursley's.

Although \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" does stand on its own and contains all the basic info in case you didnt read \\"Sorceror's Stone\\", the first book does such a wonderful job of setting up the exposition and world of Hogwarts so that you are already excited as Harry is to see Ron again when they reunite in this story.Although \\"Sorceror's Stone\\" does capture all the wonder and discovery, I did find this book to have a bit more excitement and mystery which was needed to progress the adventure in this fun series. The first few chapters each end with great \\"cliff-hanging\\" page-turning suspense and the wild excitement happens even before Harry reaches Hogwarts for his second year.There is a few new characters introduced such as ego-maniac Prof.Gilderoy (the new defense against the dark arts instructor), and Ginny (Ron's younger sister), along with a few new ghosts roaming the halls (or stalls) and monsters of the forbidden forest. There's also a few new tricks and magical discoveries without negating what we've already learned during our Freshman year.I do worry that parts of this story may be too intense for younger readers. Some of the final scenes involve abstract psychosis and even death. By the end, most of the hero's are restored, but some parents might find it still disturbing and use caution.(just read it yourself beforehand and use your judgement. It might even lend to good discussion with your child)I did find the plot twists and final confrontation exciting and caught myself off-guard with surprises (\\"I can't believe I didnt pay much attention when that happened in the bookshop!\\"), especially because the reader is usually caught in the daily life, humor, and mischief of life at Hogwarts School.As an adult, I have the guilty pleasure of finding great fun and escapism in these books. I think J.K.Rowling has done another wonderful job capturing the anxieties and friendships of a childhood and presenting them in the magical way we wished we had them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Since I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone after seeing the movie, I was very excited to read this book as it would be the first time I would get to read J.K. Rowling's wonderful story about the most famous wizard since Merlin without knowing what was going to happen next. That fact alone kept me turning pages even faster than the first book, but when I finished, I didn't feel that same sense of greatness that the first book posessed.Back is Rowling's masterful storytelling and ingenious plot stucturing. So too are her marvelous characters and witty dialogue. Gone is the long set up as we already know who Harry Potter is and his place in the story, but in it's place is a bit frustrating introduction to the most annoying character in all her books, a pathetic creature -- the house elf, Dobby. The kids have all been to Hogwarts the previous year, so some of the splendid detailing and discovery of the school seems missing. Fortunately that leaves room for more focus on the action of the story.In the first book, I was amazed at how skillfully Rowling was able to conceal the true nature of the plot while keeping the characters and the readers right in the middle of it. In the end, everything fits together. After seeing how she crafted her mystery and the way she used red herrings, I was confident that I would not be so fooled the second time around. This time I knew what to expect, but like a good magician, Rowling doesn't show you the same illusion twice. Again, everything fits in the end, but what you thought might be happening wasn't even close.Rowling introduces several new supporting characters as well as continuing to develop the returning characters. Some of these characters are there only to add flavor to this book, while others actually have important rolls in the overall saga (as discovered in later books). Their existence helps to keep the book fresh and new.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a worthy continuation of the saga of Harry Potter that has everything the reader has come to expect after reading the first book. It doesn't feel complete, however. Where the first books was the story of an unlikely boy turned hero, complete and of it's own, this book feels more like the first chapter of a bigger story. Indeed, this feeling is confirmed by the time you have read book four.Even though I didn't rate this book five stars, to the Harry Potter fan, this will likely be just as enjoyable as any five star book out there."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets and it is a good book. I can not put it down at all. Harry Potter is not demonic like those church phsycos think. I would recomend this book to anyone no matter what your age. A child has a right to imagine and this book is the perfect example."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The initial book in the series to me will always be the breathtaking introduction to the world of Harry Potter. With tempered expectations, knowing that matching that initial excellence would be hard, I delved into this second installment.The nature of the Chamber of Secrets was in itself a gripping and nightmarish dilemma; I took great joy in observing the solution.Herein began one theme of the books that I saw later on, one that was established here initially.This theme was a return to the past. Years before any of the child heroes Harry, Ron and Hermione even came into the world, events and incidents were shaping their future. Significant mysteries are unfolded, such as the background of the stalwart gamekeeper Hagrid, the childhood manifestation of the Dark Lord Voldemort and the initial stewardship of the young good wizard Dumbledore.Rowling maintains her absolutely brilliant imagination. She repeatedly introduces more wonders of the magical world, and presents more substance to the common elements that run through it. This kind of creative expression is important, for it helps me imagine and appreciate her work even more.Of course as new characters and experiences enter the world of the children, they grow and mature a little more. This process is wonderful to see, because Rowling guides it gently and carefully. She is in no rush at all, and such a pace is more natural and preferable.The book did fall a little short for me though, in the sense that the initial heady rush of the first book slowed a little here. The story seemed a little hesitant to reveal itself and charge forward, but it was satisfying in the end. I am glad to note that thus far (of four books) this is the only one in the series I would give less that five stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry is now 12 years old and the book starts with him at the durselys house with all his hogwarts supplies taken from him and locked away.Untill his friend Ron and his brothers fred and george come to pick up Harry in a flying car and rescue harry and take him away to their house.Year 2 for harry is a very dangerous year for him.A house elf named Dobby warned harry not to go back to hogwarts as dobby said harry was in danger.As the school year progresses students are being scared to death.Frozen and unconscious and something is doing this to the students.Some Students start to suspect that Harry is the one who is doing this to the students as rumours are spreading that he is related to the evil lord voldemort.Harry Experiences in this book-His growing feud with Draco Malfoy-A suspicious Journal-A adventure into the chamber of secrets-a battle with a giant snake-His classmates being left in a frozen state.-His encounter with a giant spider named aragog-A celebrity dart arts teacher who bothers harry-his near death at quidditch.-A look in the past of Lord VoldemortHarry potter and the chamber of secrets(book 2) is a must read and i hope you buy it if you haven't already.5 stars!The Opinionated one has spoken"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I was told about the Harry Potter series this was the year that i saw on the shelf and I tried to understand it but no go.but when I had read it after i had read year 1 it was really an excellent adventure and I think Harry really faced some challenges that are bigger than him and i really have to give the author a standing ovation.

In the beginning of the book Harry is at the Dursleys' house. He is sitting in his room when an elf named Dobby comes and tells him a warning. The warning is to not go back to Hogwarts because something bad would happen. That night when Harry is asleep Ron (Harry's friend from Hogwarts) shows up in a flying car to take him to his house and then to Hogwarts.In the middle of the book when they are at Hogwarts there are a lot of weird things happening. One weird thing that happens is Argus Filch's cat Mrs. Norris is hanging a wall in a hallway petrified. There is writing on the wall talking about \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\" Argus immediately thinks that Harry did this to his cat. Professor Snape, who Harry thought would also blame him for the cat, said \\"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\" This shocked Harry and since there was no proof of Harry doing this to Mrs. Norris, he doesn't get in trouble.There are many more things that happen in the middle of the book too. One thing is Harry loses his bone in his arm and has to stay with the nurse to grow it back. Harry, Ron, and Hermione find a spirit in the girl's bathroom named Myrtle. She is always crying. A lot of the middle of the book is Harry and his friends finding information out about the chamber of secrets. They are also trying to find out where the chamber of secrets is.At the end of the story a lot of cool things happen. They find out where the chamber of secrets is. Harry, Ron, and a professor (to not give it away) go in and find a bunch of tunnels. Ron and the professor get separated from Harry by rocks but Harry goes ahead. Later while they're still in the chamber, Harry has to fight a huge monster, if you want to find out how it ends you can read it yourself.The main characters in this book are, Harry Potter, he is a brave young boy who the book is about. There is also Ron Weasley, he is a little brave and a little bit of a coward, and he is a true friend of Harry's. Hagrid is a big hairy man who is a friend of Harry's. Hermione is a friend of Harry's, she is also very smart. One more main character is Dobby, he is an elf who is always afraid, and he is also a slave to the Malfoy's.This story takes place in the Dursleys' house, Hogwarts, and in the chamber of secrets. This story is also a modern day story. The book is not just one genre, it is a couple. One thing it is is an action book. The book also has some drama in it.The author of the Harry Potter series is J.K. Rowling. She has put in some really good things in the Harry Potter books. One thing she does is she uses humor a lot. Another thing she does is makes her books realistic. J.K. Rowling also makes the reader always want to know more with the way she ends her books.There is not just one problem in this book, there is a couple. One thing is people keep getting petrified because of something they see but nobody knows what it is. Another problem in the book is Harry can't find the chamber of secrets. He spends a lot of the book trying to find it. These are the two biggest problems in the book.If you like action books then you would probably like this book. I would also recommend this book to people who like mysteries. People who like action and mystery would like this book because there are a lot of action packed things in this book that you have to think about to understand. People who like drama might like this book too because there are some sad things that happen that make you want to keep reading to see how they get resolved. So if you like action, mystery, or drama then this book is for you.I thought this was a good book. I like the fact that it grabs your mind and makes you want to keep reading. I usually don't like to read that often unless I'm reading a magazine but this was a good book to read. I thought that this book was fun to read mostly because I read the first book and I wanted to know what happened next. That is what I thought of the book.In conclusion this book was great. It really gets you hooked and makes you want to read. I really liked this book because there is a lot of action I also liked this book because it is a mystery and it is fun to try and figure out what will happen next before the book actually tells you. That is what I think of the book \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts. While he is at the Dursley's house for the summer, a little elf named Dobby comes to see him. Dobby tells Harry he should not go to Hogwarts this year because something bad will happen. The Dursley's lock Harry in his room because they think he used his magic to interrupt their dinner with some friends. He escapes with Ron and the Weasley twins and stays with their family for the rest of the summer.

I think this book is wonderful and I give it five stars. This book is about a twelve-year-old wizard that has to live with his horrible aunt and uncle and their mean child, Dunsley. Harry is at his second year of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the chamber of secrets has been opened. I'd recommend this book to others if they like stories about magic. Other books by J.K. Rowling include, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.Emerson, NJ Fifth Grader"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry lives with his Aunt and Uncle Dursley. A house elf named Dobby visits him in his room. Ron Weasley and his brothers come rescue Harry and take him to their house. At Ron's house they use Floo Powder to go to Diagon Alley to buy school supplies. When Harry and Ron try to get on the Hogwarts Express, the barrier is closed. Then they get Ron's dad's flying car and fly it to Hogwarts. They get in trouble for flying the car but all of the kids think it was cool. When Harry is in detention he hears a voice that says \\"Kill, Kill.\\" No one else hears the voice though. After Nearless Headless Nick's Deathday Party, they see writing on the wall that says, \\"The chamber of secrets has been opened.\\" At the Quidditch match, Harry breaks him arm and has to go to the hospital wing. Then Harry and Ron drink a potion that makes them look like Draco Malfoy;s best friends. They want to find out what Draco knows about the chamber. In the bathroom, Harry finds a diary. He writes in it and his writing disappears and some else's writing appears. Harry time travels through the diary back to when the chamber of secrets was first opened. It appeared that Hagrid had opened the chamber and the monster inside was his giant spider named Aragog. Harry and Ron go into the Forbidden Forest to find Aragog. When they find him, he controls a lot more spiders to attack Harry and Ron. They make it back to the school safely. When they get back, they figure out that the entrance into the Chamber of Secrets is in the girls bathroom. Professor McGonagall tells them that Ginny Weasley, Ron's sister, is inside the chamber.

Character development of the three primary characters is well done. The plot also develops the surrounding cast, introduces new characters, and extends out knowledge of the Hogwarts Castle. The end of the book races to its conclusion, really moving you on a quick journey. Despite this speed, the ending is very well done and extremely well thought out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was the worst Harry Potter book JK ROWLINGS has written and since I gave it four stars that should tell you about my opinion of the series. It was full of adventure and excitement but the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts (the school where our hero is trained to be a wizard)named Gilderoy Lockhart scared me. He was so narcissistic. As our hero enters his second out of seven years he learns after being stalked by the house elf Dobby that an unknown area of the school called The Chamber of Secrets has been opened by someone who like Harry can talk to snakes. And not only has the beast that the villain opening the chamber has seen fit to lock away is attacking helpless and yet armed students.

It has some things that were not in the moive like the death day party for sir. Nicholas. It was best seller in 1999."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Like so many adults, I shifted myself away from reading the Harry Potter series simply because it had been placed in the 'Childrens' category. I certainly missed out on plenty. The only GOOD thing about waiting so long before attempting to read the series is that unlike many who began reading about Harry's exploits several years ago, I was fortunate that 5 of the novels are already written and I get to breeze through as fast as I can read them.In every way year 2 at Hogwarts is better than the first, which is saying a lot since I found the first book to be wonderful. Harry as usual cannot wait to be rid of the Muggle world in which he has been trapped in for most of his life, and especially when he has to deal with the Dursley's on a day-to-day basis. Before we know it, Harry is visited by Dobby the House Elf, for reasons unknown. Dobby refuses to reveal this information -- however he does slip certain details which forces him to punish himself, and in so doing, setting Harry up to be punished by Uncle Vernon. After a narrow escape in the Weasley's flying Ford, Harry settles in for the remaining time before school begins with Ron's family living the ultimate Wizard lifestyle -- at least to Harry. Before much else can transpire, it's back to the Hogwarts Express at track Nine and Three-Quarters...only Ron and Harry discover the passageway blocked for some odd reason. Not thinking things through enough, they use the flying Ford to catch up with the train, and it all ends in the Whomping Willow, to which Ron & Harry narrowly escape, and Ron's wand is broken...a detail which factors into the storyline later on.Odd things are happening at Hogwarts this year. The new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher is none other than one of the most famous Wizards alive, Gilderoy Lockhart. He is basically nothing more than a glorified know-it-all with an insatiable appetite for publicity, who despite having published many works on his incredible encounters with danger, knows virtually nothing about the Dark Arts, nor it would seem on how to be an ordinary Wizard at all. Draco Malfoy is up to his usual bag of annoying tricks, no surprise there. But before we catch our breath, the writing on the wall becomes apparent...literally. Someone is getting ready to open the fabled Chamber of Secrets. All of the teachers, from Dumbledore on down attempt to calm the students by assuring them the Chamber, if its real, poses no threat to anyone...but before long, people begin having terrible accidents.To make a long story short, I found the rich detail about how the Chamber came into being, the Secret Diary of Tom Riddle and the creature locked within the bowels of Hogwarts to be quite satisfying. If you found the movie entertaining, do yourself a HUGE favor and check out the book because like virtually any novel turned into a movie, so much is left out that the journey along the way is sometimes spoiled. Plus, according to Ms. Rowling herself, Harry's 2nd Year at Hogwarts is so very connected to events which will happen later that if you do NOT read it, you are truly cheating yourself. Can you pick up on the clues she left behind? To be honest, I'm still searching for them, but I'm sure they will become more and more obvious as the series progresses. Kudos to Ms. Rowling and a series which has turned out to be not just a big deal, but an incredible phenomenon which will no doubt last through the generations. Storytelling as it SHOULD be."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter looks forward to his second year at Hogwarts.

Ron's little sister has a crush on him, and the new professor is a publicity hound who seems to want to use Harry for more attention.

I loved the first one, but the second book was better because, to me, it was more adventurous and suspenseful. I can't wait for Prisoner of Azkaban(October 1999 in US) to come out. From what Iv'e heard, (I'm not positive) there are going to be seven books in the series, one for each year spent at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.

I enjoyed the first one more, because the ideas were so orignal and fresh; the ideas don't have quite the same impact"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that this is a good book because it is so intriquing and i couldn't put it down. Harry Potter has ambitions, bravery, couriousity in him and i love that about him."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was a thrilling and exciting sequel to &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and definitly better.

I can't wait for the next one. I have always loved reading, I have hundreds of books. When I heard about HP from a boy I baby-sit.I thought I was too old to read them, I mean The Last of The Mohicahs is my type of book. They aren't just for little kids. Moaning Murtle was hysterical, Ginny was such a sweet little girl and Dumbledore was, as always endearing. Harry is such an unlikely hero you just want to cheer him on. Rowlings is an incredible writer, it seems like you're really there!!!!! *****"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Wow! I bought the first two Harry Potter books to see what all the hype was about, and I tore through them both within two days. I wish I had also bought the third one! &quot;Chamber&quot; is a wonderful, spectacular piece of kids' literature - great characters and details, wonderful side plots. I would have gone crazy for Harry when I was 10 - now I'm hooked at age 28. I'm already upset that there will only be 7 of these fabulous books!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is &quot;Everyman's Man&quot;. There was not a chapter of this book that did not have a lesson to be learned by children and adults alike. I can't wait to see the movie version's of these delightful and enchanting books. It is good to see that people like J.K. Rowlings still have vivid imaginations that are put on paper. I can't wait to read about the next four years at Hogwart's."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What fun!! I read the books and couldn't put them down. Hooray for Harry and all his friends. Wonderful reading for kids and adults. I am collecting the series in hardcover for my 4 month old grandson to read together as he gets older. He will learn that you don't have to be the handsomest or smartest to be a hero. Thanks J.K Rowling - You go girl!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is exicting from the start when a flying car hits a tree----one that can fight back!!! The main characters BARELY escape that incident, but more mishap is waiting for them at Hogwarts, especially when someone or somebody starts turning students into stone. The mystery gets solved when Harry Potter comes face to face with an old enemy ( I won't tell you because HE-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED!!!) Before the mystery is solved, however, a lot of humorous things happen--Moaning Myrtle gets angry and floods the girls bathroom and one of the main characters' wands backfires ALL the time. If you really like fantasy,and/or magic (like I do), you would really enjoy this book!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was really scary, and the best of all three books. I think it is a good book for anybody to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My Aunt and Uncle purchased me this book only a year ago. As soon as I picked the book up I was surprised at not only how good it was, but also how I couldn't put it down. Even days afterI finished it I couldn't stop thinking about how he had managed to defeat the greastest wizard of all time again. I have read this book over 20 times, and I still love to read it. If you are a person who wants to believe in a little bit of magic and loves to read.....READ IT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes, you are about to hear another glowing review from an extremely happy reader. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was, I thought, even better than the first book. J.K. Rowlings is a *GREAT* writer! She keeps you guessing, and at least for me, in the end I'm usually wrong. You have got to try these books! They keep getting better and better. I've already read &quot;Harry Potter &amp; The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; 3 times, and finished &quot;Harry Potter &amp; The Chamber of Secrets&quot; for the second time today. I'm dying to get the third book, but I can't afford it right now and it's driving me crazy! I especially recommend this book for middle school students, and college students. It seems like they are the people that appreciate and enjoy it the most. Read Harry Potter- you can't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I enjoyed this book more than the first Harry Potter book. J.K Rowling kept this book much the same with all the magical elements and many of the same characters, but at the same time she expanded this magical world by adding new characters, classes and teachers and made a new plot that is almost nothing like the first book. She even makes the Dursleys better by making them worse. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys sci-fi books and books with a magical plot and the use of magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is a fantasy book about a boy named Harry Potter who is a wizard.When I first read this book I thought it would be just like the first one(even thougth I liked the first one!).As I read I realized I was wrong.It keeps you on the edge of your seat.It was also mysterious and thrilling.I could not put it down.I would definitely recomend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a delightful, enchanting book. This book encouraged me to read more. J.K. Rowling wrote a wonderful sequal to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Some of the reading is hard, but it is a wonderful, enchanting book. After reading this book, I think it is challenging book. If you can't read very well or don't like to read a lot I wouldn't recomend read it. It might be challenging but it is vewry exiting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was one of the best fantasy/sci-fi books I have ever read! Interesting characters, fascinating plot,and to top it off, it keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time! This book gives me a thrill every time I read it! I recommend this book to all readers from grade 5 and up!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Fantasies of Witches and Warlocks come to life in the pages of The Sorcerers Stone. J.K. Rowling re-awakened the part of my mind that &quot;pretended&quot; when I was younger. Harry Potter is a wonderful character from the beginning where he is introduced as kind of a meak, picked on young fella who turns into our hero throughout the book. A very fun to read book for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secerets is an exciting story filled with suprises. Harry meets the House-elf named Dobby who tries to keep a Harry from going to Hogwarts, his Wizard School. Soon, Dobby gets Harry into more trouble, and Harry is kept like an animal in his room. Soon, his friend Ron, (With Fred and George) save Harry in a flying car. Harry stays with the Weaslys, and when Harry tries to go to Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters, someone closes the gate on him and Ron. This story is positive to keep you busy on Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I would reccomend this book to people who wish to fly (We know, we know), love magic, like snakes, and are crazy for adventure."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well i love all of the Harry Potter books! I think they are very intriguing with lots of excitement and magic! I think the whole setting of this perticular one is rich with detail. This story is filled with lots of magic. Any person who enjoys a good mystical fantasy would love this book. The only character i don't like is Malfoy he's a bully, but I'll let you decide for yourself. I highly recomend this book for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This series is awesome! I'm 30 and cannot wait for my young children to be old enough to understand, so that I can read it to them. The illustrations both on the jacket and at the start of each chapter are great and really help the mental image of the story! They give wonderful hints as to the content of each chapter. Just Awesome!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the second in the Harry Potter series. The author (J.K. Rowling) does a great job of making you picture yourself in Harry's situations. In the book Harry starts his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then while walking down a corridor, Harry spots the caretaker's cat hanging on a torch. However she wasn't dead just petrified. Next alot of other people were attacked. Then one of the brightest second year students, Hermione Granger, asked the History of Magic teacher about something called the Chember of Secrets. The Chamber of Secrets was a Chamber built underground by one of the school's founders, Salazar Slytherin. The Chamber was said to have been the home of a monster and only Slitherin's true are could control it. In the end Harry and his best friend, Ron Weasley find the chamber. They destroy the monster, which turned outn to be a huge basilisk snake, and banished Slytherin's Heir from Hogwarts once and for all!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he encounters many more adventures then his first year. It opens as the previous installment did, at the Dursleys. In this opening, we are introduced to a very interesting character by the name Dolby, who will come into more use later in the series. The descriptions of this house-elf are remarkable. Dolby warns Harry not to return to school because all of the students will be in extreme danger. He then causes a large dessert to fall onto someone's head as a threat to not go back. In this scene we get the first glimpse into the Ministry of Magic, because Harry receives a warning for using underage magic.Consequently, Harry finds himself grounded in his room locked from the outside living on cold soup. Then one night he hears a rumbling sound outside his room and who is there but his school friend Ron and his group of of zany brothers in a flying car. Harry is then whisked away to the Wesley's known as the Burrow, out of his aunts and uncles grips for the remainder of the summer.School appears to be starting as normal but just as Harry and Ron are about to enter the barrier at Kings Cross it appears to have been sealed. There only option to get to Hogwarts is to take the flying car. When they arrive at school they encounter the Womping Willow, a not so peaceful tree.Lessons begin the following day introducing yet again another Defense Against the Darks Arts professor. He is an eccentric at times flaky person, who is so wrapped up in his stardom.In this second year, Harry encounters a crazy house elf, flying cars, polyjuice potion, as well as a monster in the depths of the school. Read this amazing book filled with adventure. This book will prove to be very important if you are considering continuing on in the book. Pay attention to small details, this will come in handy in the future."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.\\" That was very thrilling! It's not easy for a kid like Harry to face problems especially if his enemy is You-Know-Who. Here, J.K. Rowling expressed her devotion on writing fantacy books that is very intersting and captivating! Kids are very delighted in publishing such book!The most exciting part for me on this book is when Voldemort faced Harry as Tom Riddle. Also when most of the students thought that Harry is heir of Slytherin for he can speak parsel tongue.I salute J.K. Rowling for her wide imagination!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J. K. Rowling proves to us that the success of the first book was no fluke by giving HP fans another dose of adventure. There's a new mystery this time, new characters and a new attempt by Voldemort to return.We see more revelation in this book about the different characters of the four houses at Hogwart's School, most notably the contrast between Gryffindor and Slytherin. The motives and conflicts of the founders are explained as being behind the present day struggles. The \\"pure-blood\\" prejudice becomes more of a major theme and becomes a defining issue between good and bad wizards.Getting to see more of the Weasley family is a special treat in Book II. Arthur's love of muggles and fascination with \\"muggle artifacts\\" is humorous and provides insights into a humble attitude toward magical gifts which characterizes the good wizards. The growing relationship between Ron and Hermione continues to spawn great dialogue. Mrs. Weasley continues to endear herself as the good mother who is a bit over-bearing at times and the twins continue to be dedicated to the type of mayhem which is all in good fun."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Basilisk is a creature that, if you take one look at it, it would kill you. Harry Potter makes contact with this Basilisk, even though most people might find it surprising that it is actually based on a Polish legend: 'Basiliksie'The Basiliksie is pretty much the same creature, some versions tell that one look will kill you; others say that one look would turn you into stone. It is the same snakelike monster. Except in the legend, the hero killed it by holding a mirror in front of it so it killed itself by looking at itself. Turns out Harry didn't need a sword after all. :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book had a very good ending but it was a slow start I almost stoped reading the book. Filled with suspence and action this book has a good plot but this book was very \\"thin\\" in my opinion, so this book was ok because the ending more than picked up the slack. In all in all the book was very good if your patient but if you don't you'll never get through this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book held my attention from the moment I picked it up. I am in my forties, and have never been an avid reader. But after reading the first book, I immediately bought the other titles. The part of the flying car...and the gripping suspense in the chamber was awesome. I really admire the relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. True friendship. I especially enjoy, how out of nowhere, the hilarious events and phrases. It is lovely. I have the paperback, but I will buy the hardbacks for my granddaughter o read when she is older.I bought a couple of volumes for my nephews, and after pushing them to read them...they enjoyed them tremendously. I can't wait to complete the other readings. A must for children, and even us adults."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yes, I really like the Harry Potter books. But this one needed more exitment to it. It was a good story but not great."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first book I knew I had to read the next three. You really can't go wrong with any of these Harry Potter series. This book covers the life of Harry Potter in his second year at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry. It makes you love the characters more than before and the plot is simply beautiful and creative. I don't want to ruin it for you, but I guarantee if you liked the first, you will really love this one. Make sure you read the first book before you read this one.This book is a great escape from the stresses of life. I would recommend to everyone. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I didn't think this was as good as the first book. It takes longer to pick up the pace, and much of the first few chapters is wreathed in review, to inform the readers who might not have read the first book. I think that was a mistake, because the first few chapters just don't seem to be very well written. Once the book gets going, it does regain that &quot;can't put it down&quot; feel of the first book, but Rowling seems to be inconsistent - Harry and friends oscillate between telling all of their discoveries out of excitement, and telling nothing out of fear of being caught... The problem with that? Well, they hide information from their family and proven friends (weasleys, dumbledore, mcdougall, hagrid) while &quot;spilling the beans&quot; to characters they wouldn't likely tell (lockhart, ernie, riddle, etc.) I'm all for suspending reality for awhile, and I don't look for this stuff, it just seemed a little thick in spots.While seemingly written with a mature child or young teen in mind, the series is quite creative and captivates adult readers as well. This book was a little disappointing, but I'm hoping the next two regain the charm of the first one. It could be that I'm looking for stuff that is a little more adult and sophisticated, but I didn't find any faults with the first one, so I don't know.It doesn't have the breadth, beauty, or sophistication of Tolkien, but it's got a simple but still clever thing going on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK (ALONG WITH THE OTHERS) IN THE WORLD! I LOVE THIS AUTHOR! SHE IS LITERALLY THE BEST IN THE WORLD, AND I ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS BOOK OR ANY OTHER IN THE SERIES EMIDIATELY!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book series is the best ever. I finished Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone VERY quickly. I read about 100 pages a school day of this book(that means during school, switching periods). This book is this best ever! It gets you hooked with an interesting plot, and keeps suprises coming, and describes things you couldn't even dream of. I can't wait for the next ones!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Not since reading &quot;The Hobbit&quot; have I enjoyed a book of this sort so much. Almost through with the first book and have ordered the second so that I can start immediately with no interruption. Those that label this book &quot;evil&quot; are missing the point. It is just fun &quot;fiction&quot;, folks. Kids are smart enough to know it is not real.It is meant to stir the imagination which the young generation has been sorely missing since the invention of television, video games and the computer. Instead of criticizing it, us older people should be praising it for spurring reading amoung the young, who might otherwise never discover the joy of reading books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't get all of the hype about it. It is of course a good book but only 3 stars. I reserve 5 stars for books like the hobbit, narnia series, and a few others. 4 stars are verry good and I one day will be clasics. Books like the redwall seriex or the wheel of time. I think it is good but by no means is it the best book i have ever read. The plots of the first two are basicly the same. He must defeat the unexpected person. The same person. It may be a good book but better than the hobbit or narnia, etc. I hate to be the person to spoil the fun ( since almost every review is 5 stars but there must be some people out there that understand why I feel this way. It is just another good book. If you gave this 5 stars than read the hobbit and you will need another couple of stars. I can understand why people like it but not 5 stars. The best book you ever read. If it is then you need to read more. Don't think that i am just trying to make people mad but I don't understand why. What is the big suspense. I don't even think it has the one of the things all good books usally have. Strong Love or Death of someone you love. It is a pale imitation of Rohld Dohl."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved these books and think they really have a positive affect on kids.They teach friendship and bravery.The idea that they teach whitchcraft is silly.The use of &quot;magic&quot; for evil is greatly put down throughout these books.And plus can you really picture a headline reading&quot;Middle school student tries to harm class mates with witch craft.Parents say he was encouraged by Harry Potter risking his life to save friends&quot;?

Imagination is at an all time high in these books. I am waiting for the 4th book to come out so I can enjoy it as much as the other three. Not very often does a series of this caliber come along and everyone should grab this chance and enjoy these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book is great, although not as good as the first one. There are a lot of chapters that are boring, but most of them do stay with the story line. I give J.K. Rolwings A LOT of credit though, usally the sequals are'nt as good as the first book, this one almost was. In this book you learn a lot of &quot;wizard slang&quot; and a lot more about Hogwarts (the wizarding school, for those of you who haven't read it)which is basicllay what I think this book was about, it's more of an intermisson between the 1st and 3rd one and to give an idea of what wizarding life is all about, although not as intresting as the first and third one,you definetly need to buy it-or rent it- to understand some things in the third book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was outstanding any it is great for any age!

Its humor, vivid characterization and exciting plot are sure to grasp any readers' attention. Unlike many fantasy books, this one has characters with the same traits as our friends... or enemys! This makes the book easier to relate to and much more enjoyable to read. The way the story flows, and the twists and turns that it takes makes this the perfect book for a plot-lover, or mystery fan. The problems that Harry faces makes this book much more realistic than other fantasy books, and it has the one thing that most great fantasy authors left out, HUMOR. All of these ingredients combined make for a strong story. The best thing though, is that there is a little Harry Potter in all of us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A wonderful, exiting seqel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or philosipher's) stone.

Although I liked the first Harry Potter book a bit more, this one lived up to my expectations about 98%. A definate must~read for Harry Potter fans and those alike! Much love to J.K Rowling for such a GOOD series! I hope she plans on keepin up on Harry's years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as well as (hopefully) hsi years beyond the school. This book, like the first, force you into it. It is almost as if you could look around and totally envision Peeves, the school poltergeist, or Ron Weasly, Harry's red-headed best friend. It totally submearses the reader into its world of magic and wizardry. An absolute Must Read for children, teenagers, young adults, and afults alike! 4 1/2 stars!

Once you read this book, read all the others!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved all three Harry Potter Books, but this was my favorite!I THINK ALL PEOPLE WHO THINK THIS PROMOTES WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDY ARE JUST A BUNCH OF NON-READING BUMS WITH BAD TASTE! So, I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter does it again, this time vanquishing a real nasty snake and its sidekick(or is is the other way around? Read and find out!) in this second novel in the Harry Potter series. The book will keep you turning pages and cheering for the wonderful friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermoine. It is a great read and lots of fun! The author seems to have an endless supply of creative, fresh ideas that make Harry's world believable and very appealing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I could not put this down. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to no what was going to happen next. Now nothing is interesting to read anymore, so I can't wait till J.K.ROWLING writs more Harry Potter books. I give this 1,0000000 stars.I wanted to read faster. Everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I recently bought the 1st 3 Harry Potter books for my children. I began reading the first one to my youngest daughter and could not put them down. We finished all 3 books in 5 days and can't wait for the next. These books are a must if you have children or even if you are a child at heart. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My daughter learned what reading for pleasure is, with Harry she reads &quot;just because&quot;. This make me very happy!!!! I highly recomend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hi. I have read the 3 books and I fell in love with them by the end of the first chapter. and now I am rereading the books. I can't explain it but I love them. I have never read a magic book i liked until I read these books. I think that J.K.Rowlings is the best auther in the world.p.s. I have all ways wanted to be a witch. Thank you j.k. for helping me to dare to dream it.I love you!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"OK...I admit, I was a skeptic. As a 25 year old, with a degree in English Lit, I didn't think there were any books left out there that could delight me anymore...but there is...this series does it!I won't bore you with pages of raving for this EXCELLENT and well written book (it just SUCKS you right in! I was finished in 2 hours, while waiting for the roast to cook!!!), but I will say that it has the charm and innocence that is becoming more and more rare in this day and age.Naturally, there are critics that find the subject matter (magic) disturbing, but it is on the same level as the Little Mermaid or Aladdin. Sure there is magic, but Harry Potter is not evil, rather, he uses all his resources to save his friends...I know, those who have already made up their minds won't have it changed by just my words, but if you're trying to decide whether or not you should get this, ignore the critics and remember back to when you were 5 and still believed in magic and delight and wonder...this will bring it all back..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Superb, one of the funnest books I have read of late. Easy reading, impossible to put down. Fantasy at its best. Let the magic live on."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was truly enchanting. I am currently in High school, and have had a love for fantasy stories my whole life, and I must say, that I wish I had this Book, and its predecessor when I was a child. Its not Tolkien, but it is a good lead towards such fantasy masterpieces."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My mom got me the chamber of secrets because she thought I had asked for it, and I hadn't, so me reading the book was totaly by mistake. I thought it would be utterly boring, but I absoutely could not put it down. I read it in 2, count em, 2 days. I have read the other two books in the same amount of time because they are so good, and now Im letting my english teacher read them, which I regret because I want to read them again! and I want my mom to read them! and my freinds to read them! THEY ARE SOOOO INCREDIBLY CREATIVE AND WONDERFUL! I DONT CARE WHAT PARENTS SAY! BUY THEM FOR THE KID AND THEN LET THEM READ THEM WHEN THEY ARE OLDER! I SAY THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CRITISIZE THE BOOKS ARE JEALOUS, AND THAT THEY SHOULD REALLY TAKE ANOTHER LOOK! Im sorry, but my veiw is that they are too creative not to read. I cant believe anyone would think of them as boring! No imagination. If you havent read them read them. I full heartedly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is cool. My teacher is reading it to us, but she isn't done yet. I heard some people say anyone over 10 who read this book should be ashamed. I've read the first book, and mind you, I'm in 6th grade! I'm liking the second one too. My sister has read the first one too. I think she likes it, because she's reading it in the morning, and at dinnertime. She is in 8th grade. Also, lots of her friends read them, Harry Potter is a talked bout guy! .....there is nothing to be ashamed of!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the perfect book for readers of all ages. I have all three books in the Harry Potter series, and I must have read each about 20 times! Seriously! You can't help thinking about the books whenever you try to read anything! I believe everyone literate should read them!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I LOVE how there are sooooo many leads that Harry is the heir of Slytherin, but in the end he isn't. He can speak parseltounge, which is AWESOME. That would be soooo cool to be able to talk to snakes. I could go to zoos and sit there having a conversation with a boa constrictor! (Hehe...just kidding!) It's also interesting that the Chamber of Secrets is in the bathroom sink where Moaning Myrtle died. For the readers currently reading this book, I won't say anymore but I just want to you to know that this book is TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"All of the Harry Potters are the best books i have ever read! I stay up to 1 am every nigh tjust to fing out if Harry is going to live through another one of his adventures. I cant wait untill the 4th!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought Harry Potter was awesome! I don't see how she could write any better books further along in her series. I can't wait to get out and buy her third book! THANKS!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is even better than the first! The one thing I didn't like about it is that Hermione was not in it very much. But the rest of the book more than satisfies the thirst for more you get from finishing HP and the Sorcerer's stone. IN #1, I thought that the beginning was a little slow. Not so in this one! In the first or second chapter, a house-elf named Dobby puts Harry in the doghouse with the Dursleys. Harry was locked up in his room, denied the privilege of going back to Hogwarts when Ron and his brothers make a dramatic rescue that results in Harry spending the rest of his vacation at Ron's house, The Burrow. Then, Harry can't get on the Hogwarts Express. He and Ron go to school another way and almost get expelled. Things don't improve when they meet the new Dark Arts teacher, Gideroy Lockhart, the most stuck-up teacher to grace (or not grace) the corridors of Hogwarts. Then, when Harry starts hearing a voice no one else can hear, things get really spooky..... a MUST READ for everyone from 4 years on up!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Picture this: Mom, Dad and 5 year old son swinging in a hammock while enjoying a story on a balmy summer evening. The story? Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Harry's back and the adventure continues. This sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone is equally exciting. My son is entranced (and so is Mom!) as his Dad reads this action packed tale before bedtime. It's a great fairy tale comparible to those of Ronald Dahl(Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.) We all loved it and can't wait for the next installment of what we hope will be a very long series of Harry's adventures as a evil-fighting wizard (the action figure can't be far behind!) Until then I'm sure we'll be reading it over and over again just as we've been doing with the original story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My son (age 10)and I read this delightful fantasy together and we were both entranced!He has always enjoyed reading but this was the first book that he couldn't put down! Finally, the book that captured him in that secret place of total immersion in the written word. Thank you J. K. Rowling for letting we Muggles enter the land of the wizards!We are forever grateful!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter anxiuosly awaits the opening of Hogwarts as the summer vacation progresses. His vacation with his aunt and uncle is anything but pleasant. However,when it is time to return to school, Dobby, an unlikely ally, tries to keep Harry from doing so because he knows that Harry's life will be in danger. Harry, however, disregards the warnings and soon finds himself enmeshed in the mysterious events occuring at Hogwarts. Harry carries us along with his magic through doors of imagination that only J.K. Rowling could devise. In the process Harry discovers the Chamber of Secrets and unravels the mystery surrounding the recent events. This story revives the child in all of us and helps us escape the world of dark characters when we put our faith in Harry. The only saddness comes when the last page is turned and we are brought back to reality. I look forward to Harry's next year at Hogwarts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I used to read many Roal Dahl books when I was younger, and although they are meant for the young adults age group, i find that they are still very enjoyable to the older age group since the writing is timeless and breaks all age barriers.Finally I have found an author that emulates, and actually improves on the late Roald Dahl, and I plan on reading all of the Harry Potter books I can get my hands on.The writing is simple enough for middle schoolers to understand, yet the agelessness of the plot and compelling creation of the characters can hook even the oldest of readers.I top pick for any age group, a must read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book waas just as imaginative as the last one!!!!! It is full of magic, humor, and mystery. I loved it!!!!! Read it for yourself and find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was truly engaging. A delightful story for children and adults of all ages"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"ever scence the first Harry Potter I have been obsesed with Harry potter. My friends and I started the Harry potter fan club. Now I carry a wand around (what an idoit) and I can't wait to get the third book. As some of my friends say all I talk about is harry potter. HARRY POTTER RULES!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book in one day, and only took a break once, (I had to eat dinner). It was GREAT!!! I've read this book twice, and now that I know what happens in the end, it almost is more fun to read the second time because of all the fun clues to the crime in it. Everytime you read it, you feel like your in Hogwarts, watching it all happen. I could just see fat Dudley and self-absorbed Gilderoy Lockhart. Lockhart made me SO MAD! You have to read this book, and after that you have to read it again, it never gets old! :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets was fun to read. My family and I really enjoyed it. JK Rowling is a great author. It was very exciting and there were many funny parts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I like this book a whole lot. I wish I could be in the story watching and going with Harry and his friends to Hogwarts and all kinds of places.I think you should read this book because its funny and amazing.You'll like it a lot.I can't wait to get the other book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a mother of 3 (ages 5,6, and 10). Our favorite pastime is to read chapter books before bedtime. This book was finished in less than a day! I kept getting asked &quot;Just one more chapter, PLEASE!!!&quot;. This book is fast past, full of imagery, you can just see the action as the story unfolds. Having read Harry Potter and the Scorcerer's Stone, we were thrilled when this book came out. Enjoy them both!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was exciting and suspenseful. It was very different from the first Harry Potter book, because all the characters did different things. There were new characters. It was a little bit scary, but not in the way that makes you afraid at night. I can't wait until the next one!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I watched an interview with JK Rowling on the Today Show and decided to read this book based on what I had heard. I know this is marketed as a children's book, but I am 25 and couldn't put it down. It grabbed me from the first paragraph and moved me through all of it's ups and downs. JK Rowling is a brilliant writer and I look forward to the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling's series is just so wonderful, I can't begin to offer enough praise. Sorceror's Stone is a fantastic read, and the sequel is just as good, if not better. It has more mystery and suspense than the first. I'm a children's librarian and the response we get from our patrons for these books is just remarkable. The kids and I have wonderful discussions about Harry. I cannot wait until the third one. Ms. Rowlings is such a gifted writer."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book! However, I don't think it was as good as the first and it's a bit more confusing. Yet, the book still makes me roar for the sequal."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This must be the best book in all history of man kind. The only book that can even come close is the first Harry Potter! This is a wounderful book by it self, but even better with Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone. If you only read one series in your entire life, make it Harry. This book is well put togther, way out there but besides that the writting is beliveable. It makes you wounder if there really is a hogwarts and a whole nother world we don't know about. It is the most wounderful work of fiction I have ever read and I hope every person in the entire world gets a chance to read this book more than ont time! I have read it 13 times myself!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone was very good I liked it alot but the the second book is way better! ron and harmine are back in the second book along with rons little sister.If you liked the first book you will like the second."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was the best Harry Potter book made!! (I thought so.) I have read this book twice already and Im reading it again! The best part about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was when Harry and Ron went through the pipe in the girls restroom!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great story. I feel like a kid again. I only wish it never had to end. JK is a master"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is a fascinating book. Read it. It's very intriguing and you can imagine it all. Makes you wish magic was real."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the Harry Potter series and I often find myself pulled directly into the story when I'm reading. re-reading the Prisoner of Azkaban next!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was the best most interesting book I've ever read I would recommend this book to everyone it's the best book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book deserves 5 stars because, it feeds your imagination and the mystery was so cleverly written that you did not know what was going to happen."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm glad to read this book. There as more details as usual compared to the movie. Very much enjoyed!!!!BRILLIANT!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Where do I begin with the most incredible, astonishing, totally original and unique series ever?! Harry Potter has literally touched millions of people by its strong themes of love and friendship, by its unique narrative that is without comparison and written in a style that readers BOTH young and old can enjoy. The characters are so distinctive and lovable and \`real' that you are really able to connect with them and empathize with their inner feelings which are expressed so vividly. I did not think after reading JK Rowling's \`Harry Potter & the Philosophers stone' that it could get any better nor surpass it, but this certainly is a book that I devoured and which I have re-read so many times that the cover is falling apart it is so worn. No one I believe can replicate her imaginative power, nor such emotional intensity and entrancing complexity of such a strong story. The tale of Harry Potter is so intricately woven that it is akin to an Onion with many layers, which every time you re-read this story you, will reveal and unveil more hidden information and insights that lie deep within. Rowling's series has become a phenomenon and which is universally loved and cherished by so many, which is such a triumphant success and one that is so deserved! Fresh and magical even if you are someone who is not \`into' fantasy you will be blown away by this, I guarantee. As a child I loved the story and now as an adult I can appreciate even more the depths of each book within the series, and the fantastic & totally remarkable writing. JK Rowling has put herself into her books; her feelings and such strong inner emotions that is such a brave and courageous thing to do and which brings her work to life hence touching our inmost soul.Harry in his second year has so many thrilling and exciting adventures...he meets Dobby the adorable and yet mischievous but loveable house elf (who is a very special character as you will come to find out later on in the series and who embodies the goodness in all of our hearts), then there is the ridiculous relatives at the Dursleys whom poor Harry sadly upsets! (but it was not his fault, honestly!!). As for Hogwarts well...there is the flying car, the mystery surrounding the spiders, the grinning Cheshire cat that is Gilderoy Lockhart (Order of Merlin first class and biggest smile award!!), Neville Longbottom and Cornish Pixies, Mudbloods and learning about Parsletongue and of course there is Tom Riddle's diary...phew! It is jam packed with suspense and exciting adventures that always seem to lead Harry into perilous danger...after all a Diary can be very dangerous, especially in the hands of a silly little girl. Then there is the conflict at Quidditch practice as it seems that Draco Malfoy and his wealthy father is determined to outdo Harry! Full of thrills & spills and lots of creepy crawlies, giants and Womping Willows and Moaning Myrtles this is truly the most outstanding story EVER!!!I have not found a single child who isn't mesmerized by Hogwarts and the art of Quidditch, nor who doesn't want an invisibility cloak for Christmas and a snowy owl (which of course they will not surprisingly want to name Hedwig). As a young child I was captivated by Harry Potter and longed for the letter to swish through my letterbox everyday, so that I could board the Hogwarts express from platform 9 and visit a most magical, fantastical world where even Potions is astounding! The miraculous creativity and original imagery is second to none and which makes many writers of children's literature shake their heads in disbelief for what JK Rowling has achieved."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this in less than a week. Soooo good! And now I have to get the third book and continue the series"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read all seven books and there are reasons to pick any of them as your favorite. However what draws me to this one is the mix of mystery along with everything else. Especially interesting is the glimpse you get of Lord Voldemort's earlier life and the ideas that became an obsession with him. This book is not as intense as the later ones were, but it is one of the best, along with The Order of the Phoenix."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Have been a fan of the movies and stories of Hogwarts. JK Rowling is a genius with her ability to craft her tales and characters. I wanted to have the books as part of my collection even though I read them all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I want to start out by saying the only reason I am giving this four stars and not five is simply that I liked the other three books more. I still loved this book, and was mesmorized by the life of a little kid picked on kid, torchered by his step parents living in the world of magic. I read that the average reading age is between 9 and 12. Adults, forget about that, my parents loved this book, and I loved this book. It may be targeted for young children, but anyone can read it and enjoy it. If you loved books such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; then this book is just for you. I loved it and so has most of America"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Ms. Rowling really outdid herself with this book, the sequel to the much-celebrated &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot; This book has more plot twists, suprizes, laughter, tears, and screams than you could imagine. It's also a heart wrenching tale that goes deeper into the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Potter.Harry is warned not to go back to Hogwarts, but he doesn't listen. Even though he knows he could face great danger at Hogwarts, Harry knows he can not stay at his aunt and uncle's on Privet Drive. Despite many obstacles, Harry soon find's himself back at his beloved school, surrounded by his friends. That friendship is soon tested however, when mysterious attacks start happening to students at Hogwarts, and all fingers point towards Harry.Do yourself a favor and read this book, and all the others in the series. You won't be disapointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Another terrific read in the ubiquitous Harry Potter series. This 30 year-old reader was hooked from page one, truly unputdownable. This second book delves deeper into the dark origins of Lord Voldemort and the climax is truly frightening. A mystery that keeps you guessing, characters that really live and breathe off of the page, and action sequences that make you want to race ahead to see how it all turns out - Ms. Rowling is a master at the art of good old-fashioned storytelling. Her stories are to be read and cherished by anyone who cares about good writing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was a little disappointed in the second one. It didn't hold my interest as much. I found myself almost wanting to skip over some sections as I found myself growing ansy.But, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy reading it. Overall, it's a very good book, and definitely worth a read, particularly if you are a fan of the Harry Potter trilogy. After all, it'd be silly not to read all of them, right?Having said that, I don't think that it was as good as the first one. I didn't have that same &quot;Wow!&quot; reaction as I did with the first book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Dear Reader,My book is great.It's Harry Potter the Chamber of Secrets. I've read every Harry Potter book. I like this one because of Dobby. I like it because he would just about kill himself when he let something slip to Harry.Well I don't want to ruin the book.Enjoy,Little C"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first Harry Potter book and enjoying it, I was excited to begin the second, and it was even better than the first! Once again, with great characters and an original story, this is a book you just can't put down. It's almost a kind of a mystery, throughout the whole book, you wonder, who did it? Who do I believe? And the ending...wow! If you have read the first book, don't stop now, it can only get better!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Filled with lots of fun and plenty of thrills, Harry Potter goes through yet another excitement filled year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. From the dormitories to the Forbidden Forest, Harry and his friends search for answers to their latest mystery that has them baffled. People turning into stone and strange voices keep them on their toes, while the professors make their lives harder to live by the day. You'll get all the adventure that you need in this excellent sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone&quot;. Read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first book of this series, I had to read the second. The books let you get into the fantasy world of Harry Potter and you can leave your own behind. The book starts with Harry at the Dursley's home and he is eager to leave for school. While he is packing his bags, a strange creature comes to the house and tells him that if he is to go back to Hogwarts, disaster will strike. Despite what the creature told Harry, he returned to Hogwarts anyway. After a few months, people at Hogwarts begin to become petrified. Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron figure out this is happening because the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Just like in the first book, Harry and his friends get into a lot of mischif trying to figure out who has opened the Chamber. They have to find out who it is before it is too late."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets was a very interesting book that made me think a lot. The way his aunt and uncle treated Harry was very crul and mean. When you read the book, the suspects are usualy not even people involved in the problem, which surprises me.The book was so good that it was hard for me to put it down. I recamend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second Harry Potter book is very interesting and I am sure this review will make kids want to read it. Every page of this book has something new to it, something magical. This book is nothing but fun. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I recommend taking a trip with Harry Potter back to Hogwarts into the chamber of secrets. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I seriously think every child must read this book or any other Harry Potter book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read this book numerous times and I still find it as amazing as the first time I opened it!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Even better than the first!

J.K.Rowling is a great author and everyone should read this series if they haven't already trust me it's amazing!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life and then some Harry potter is awesome"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Book 2 of 7. Who among people who would buy this at all, don't like it?Book 2 is my least favorite, but even at that it is among the best books I've ever read in my 59 year career."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I first read this book about ten years ago, and I recently listened to it on audio. Much like Harry's first novel, \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" has withstood the test of time, and it still holds its own as a fantastic story. The early part of Harry's series is when I enjoyed it the most- when things were relatively simple, there was an enormous emphasis on the fun of childhood (which is where the REAL magic occurs), and before the books began to become bloated and overdramatic.Another impressive aspect of Rowling's second book is that, much like her first, it has tremendous merit as a middle grade mystery novel. Throughout the story, important clues are cleverly inserted, things that are not immediately obvious, but which all prove to be of significane when the mystery is finally solved. Careful readers will be rewarded on multiple levels while enjoying \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\".I was delighted to revisit this world of wizards, warlocks, and witches, spending time with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, as well as lovable Hagrid and Dumbledore. The inclusion of new characters, such as Myrtle and the goofy new instructor of Defense Against the Dark Arts were also welcome. Rowling continues to demonstrate a knack for inventive fiction and scenarios that appeal to children (and the children that still live inside of adults). I'm looking forward to listening to Book Three!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was a book full of problems that made me curios. I would highly recommend.

Dobby is a little house elf who has to work for his master. He was supposedly sent by Lucius Malfoy to stop Harry from going to Hogwarts. He didn't succeed, however. Harry is rescued from him muggle house and is whisked away to the Weasly's. Dobby closes the barrier that leads to the train to go to Hogwarts, so Ron and Harry are stuck going to hogwarts in the Weasly's flying car, which Ron's dad bewitched. They crash into the Whomping Willow, a tree that punches. The car flys away. They get to school and a self centered author, claiming he fought off dangerous creatures, uses Harry as his center of attention. Soon, Mr Filch's cat, Mrs Norris, showed up, petrified. Then Two more people. When Hermione figures it out, she runs to the library. Ron and Harry soon find out that she was petrified too. Who is doing this? Could Voldemort still be alive? Read it to find out!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets is an excellent book - fun characters (they're all brought back from the first book), an exciting plot, interesting sub-plots, and just a whole lot of fun. J.K. Rowling is a great author - she seems to know exactly what kids want to read, and she's great at what she does. I love Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"You don't have to be a kid to get into the Harry Potter craze. After reading the first two of the series, I'm likely to read the rest. Rowling captures the concerns of children and adults everywhere-the desire to be wanted and accepted, to feel safe, to be appreciated, have good friends, to learn and have adventures. The characters are distinct, memorable, and charming in original ways. I love the all-flavor beans, the Quidditch matches, Dobby's self-punishing behavior, and polyjuice potion. Very entertaining. A nice change from what I usually read. ~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE and DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is pretty simple: If you liked the first Harry Potter book, you will probably like this even more.If you didn't particularly like the first book because it was either too fluffy, too light, or had too flat of characters, then this installment won't be any better for you.However, if you didn't like the first one because the &quot;twist&quot; at the end was either too easy to see beforehand, then you might like this better, as the ending _may_ be a little harder to see coming."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is probably the greatest seres of books ever!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"He is a nice boy, even if he is a wizard. The stories about his growing up, of which this is the second part are wonderful for both children and adults! This book, like the others is more about Harry Potter as a boy growing up, but spiced up with the problems that only a wizard in training could have."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in the Harry Potter saga, and is better than the first! This time, the story starts as Harry commits a crime in the Dursleys' house bad enough that they bar his windows, lock the door, throw the key away, install a flap on the floor so Aunt Petunia can give Harry &quot;meals&quot;, and bathroom breaks only once in the morning and evening. Where's child welfare! Thankfully, his friend Ron rescues him, and invites him over to his house. Then starts another glorious, Dursley-free year at Hogwarts.The story obviously revolves around a Chamber of Secrets, which was built by Salazar Slytherin, in which contains horrors that will be unlocked by his heir. Who is that heir, and those it connect with the recent attacks on Hogwarts students?Since the previous Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher is gone, the overly conceited, (overly is an understatement) thick-as-a-rock, celebrity teacher Gilderoy Lockhart comes. He's a hilarious teacher who's completely wrapped up within himself. Chamber of Secrets is a fantastic book, and somehow manages to surpass the original. Go read it, NOW!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Jim Dale's reading of &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; is a pleasure to listen to. More than that, Dale's reading turns my normally fighting/whining/yelling boys into models of good behavior when in the car. Dale's voice is not the most beautiful in the world, and sometimes the way he lengthens words (as when, say, Ron or Hermione begins a sentence &quot;Harry&quot;) gets to be too much for me, but his timing and phrasing are excellent. If anything, they add excitement to the book, something that I, until now only impatiently a listener, would have believed impossible. Although I hate to say it, the effect is downright magical. If you have to drive often with children in the car, you could scarcely go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Phenomenal writing once again from J.K Rowling. Harry Potter's adventures never cease to create fantastic novels. I will definitely be continuing with the series"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"this book is a fun mystery that takes place at the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. if you've read the first book, sorcerers (philosophers) stone, read this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Y f2f hgfh hhdvhgt rd dd gfrx c.f. ghjjjn B-) c.f. fffffhjnjh hbgh h h f .

You really get to know all of the characters more in depth and really feel like you know them in reality.I don't think I have anything bad to say about this one.
