I'm glad I did, though, as I loved the story. We hear all the time about the dirty 30's and all the hard times (like walking 3 miles to school uphill in a raging blizzard) but this really makes a person appreciate what these people must have gone through. The story tended to move slowly, but that let the reader get to know the Joad family well, especially young Tom Joad. They managed to make do with very little in the way of money or food and yet wouldn't hesitate to share what they had with someone else. It makes a person feel kind of ashamed to think we look into a full refrigerator and still think there's nothing to eat. I was hoping the story would end with a happy Joad family finding a home and work, but that was left up to the reader's imagination. I don't know if John Steinbeck just got tired of writing or what, but the ending left a little to be desired. I was sure they would meet up with their son again, but that probably wasn't a realistic look at how it most likely was then. The book will definitely make me think differently about migrant workers that come into our area. Things may not be quite as bad now as back then, but they probably face many of the same circumstances."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I bought this book on a whim, drawn by the attractive binding and it's reputation as a classic. My friends thought that I was crazy to read it on my own will, and, to tell the truth, I was somewhat hesistant myself to begin such a daunting book. Going in, I was expecting it to be boring.However, as I started to read I found that it was hard to stop. It's not that the story is compelling, but I truly loved the style of writing. Sure, the story is not fast, but from the start I felt as though I was a member of the central family, suffering in their misfortune and rejoicing in their joys. The abundant dialog allowed me to truly discover the character of everyone in the story.I admit that if I were forced to read this for classes, as well as having to contend with 4 other subjects, I would become frustrated at the slow pace.

Steinbeck is truly one of the great American novelists. The characters come to life. The descriptions of the land, the journey and the people far exceeds anything ever written about this time in American History. The story holds true even today. This is a must read for everyone. I read it years ago, the the reread was even better!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I don't know about other reviewers but I found this book really hard to get started. Its grim tone hits you hard in the face and it's no surprise that Steinbeck said of the book that \\"I've done my damndest to rip a reader's nerves to rags\\". But once you can adapt to the bleak tone of the book (and the narrator) it becomes deeply compelling, to the point where you will want your car journey to work to last just that little bit longer so you can listen to that little bit more.Anyhow, to let you know what the audio version of the book is like, it is first rate. Many audio books pick readers who have little to no versatility in conveying their charactors and read the book as if reading the football results. John Chancer is different as he really conveys well the 12 charactors of the family, so much so that you could swear that you've actually met the family and heard their voices!One limitation of the package is that it is a box with 16 CD's in 16 in fiddly thin sleeves. The CD case has a tendency to fall on the floor and chuck its contents all over the car, which is highly annoying when you are endeavouring to concentrate.But, aside from that, the story is excellent and the narrator creates a rich cast of voices to fit the landscape of the book.Incidentally, anyone who's a fan of the comedian Bill Hicks may be interested to know that this book was said to be his favourite. Hicks loved the book so much that he even based his 'famous last words' on Tom Joad's final speech \\"I left in love, in laughter, and in truth, and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.\\"Although Tom Joad's final speech is actually different, the spirit is the same and it's easy to see why he picked that part as it is easily the most profound part of a deeply moving novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this thing once every couple of years.

On his way to his former home he finds a turtle that he keeps as a pet present for his little brother Noah. The turtle may stand as a metaphor for the slow but secure progress of the narrative. Tome also meets a \\"reformed\\" preacher who likes to question the goodness of baptism, and a former neighbour, Muley Graves, who has decided to stay in the land in Oklahoma contrary to the general westward pull: \\"Place where folks live is them folks.\\"As he meets them, the Joads are getting ready to sell all their belongings and move to California. But how will their sense of identity be affected by the migration? The author seems worried about the conflict between the land and the machine. Something worse than the devil seems to have got hold of hte country and thousands of people are moving West, looking for something brighter than what they have got. Is it possible to relinquish your home and survive it whole? On their way to California they learn the value of sharing and helping one another after they meet the Wilsons. One thing is sure, and these mass migrations are the proof that men can still be moved by a concept, a palpitating notion, a dream (even if such dream is reduced to the image of a white house by an orange groove).One is to fear the day when man will refuse to move about, search, project. Even if this search is to lead to tragedy and loss. The will to live and to die and to survive for a concept makes of man a distinctive being in the universe: \\"Need is the stimulus to concept, concept to action.\\" But can Paine and Jefferson exist alongside Marx and Lenin? From the point of view of the American dispossessed this seems dubious.Economic racism (\\"them Okies\\") and the ills of American capitalism work into the spirit and capacity of endurance of the worn-out families of migrant agricultural workers. These families have ironically held a belief on the myth of the American dream: a place can be found where an honest man can work steadily his way to respectability. Nevertheless the Joads only find their own progressive breaking-up in the motion. Theey learn of the prejudice and fear of the authorities and citizens of California, and of the untold speculative crimes of the big and medium farmers. The wrath of The Grapes of Wrath is the sign of hunger and frustration at the way things are made to work: unused land and crops laid to waste.The novel is a chant to family values and communal living, even if from the wrong side of the road. Tom Joad learns the importance of forming part of a larger group, even if he eventually gets separated from the people he loves because of his crimes. What is it that makes people survive under the most terrible conditions?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read maybe two books a year, and it's sometimes hard to keep up with this characters and details of a book as a result.

Heartbreaking, full and exceptionally beautiful in its scope, it is a singular American classic that is equal parts literature and lesson."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a book set during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. It tells the story of one family, the Joads, but shows the roughness and impact this time had on all people. The family leaves their farm in Oklahoma and travels to California to find work. Half of the characters die or desert the family by the end of the novel.I felt that the book was genius when it came to themes and exploring human characteristics, but the actual book length was much longer than needed to put the points across. Steinbeck has a wonderful ability of taking on a character and revealing common human weaknesses and the affects these personality traits can have on other people.The structure used in this book is unlike any I have ever seen. It reminds me of the ties on a railroad. One chapter will speak very broadly about the whole movement west, and then the next will discuss the Joad family's own problem concerning this matter. But really they are all connected to each other and continue in this repeating pattern. I feel that the most important theme in the book is mans inhumanity to man. Steinbeck wants to prove that almost all of the hardships that this certain family endures are a direct result of another person's action rather than the weather or some other inanimate object. He does do this extremely well and I highly commend him for this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is a Classic tale about the Joad Family who are on the road to California in search of a better life. The characters in this book are real and this story was based on fact as the farming fields of Oaklahoma turned into giant dustbowls. The Joad family encounter many obstacles on the their journey but their optimism reigns Supreme. This is a wonderful tale about the Resilience and Triumph Of The Human Spirit in the Face of Severe Adversity.According to his biographer John Steinbeck was once photographed with a Whiskey bottle on his workdesk which gave the impression that he was another alcoholic writer like Hemingway. The reality was and is that Mr. Steinbeck was a moderate social drinker whose only vice was cigarettes.This can be attested to in his journey across America in his most excellent book \\"Travels With Charley\\". It is also a great pleasure for me to discover a Literary Genius who do not use his writing ability as an excuse to indulge in excessive drinking , cavorting with prostitutes and ingesting illicit substances.Thankfully there are some writers who led a decent, honest and hardworking life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"By Nicole FasolaI thought The Grapes of Wrath was a very well adapted movie, from the original novel by John Steinbeck.The movie (and book) was about Tom Joad, a man (played by Henry Fonda), whose Oklahoma based family is forced to move out after the Great Depression. Their only chance to find work was to pack up and move to California where 800 workers were supposedly needed. They then go on a long journey to California to find out that workers weren't really as needed as they thought.One of the things that really differentiate the movie from the book was that a majority of time in the book was spent actually looking for work once the Joad's were in California. In the movie, it seemed like they were in the car the whole time. I think that one of the problems with adapting such a long book like The Grapes of Wrath into a movie is choosing what to include. The screenwriter's chose to go into more detail about how difficult it was to get to California, and all that they faced going there, instead of when they actually got to California and had to search for jobs.Some other things about the movie that were different from the book were how minor characters in the books didn't have as big of roles in the movie. For example, in the book, there was a couple called the Wilson's, that actually traveled with the Joad's for a while. There were not included in the movie at all. Some other characters that weren't included were minor characters who would go to work with the Joad's, or eat with them.I thought that the cast of The Grapes of Wrath was very good. I especially thought that \\"Ma Joad\\" was very much the same in the book and movie. She had the same toughness in both installments, and also had an emotional side. I thought the transition from book to movie for Tom Joad wasn't as good. In the book, he seems more like a tough, scary kind of guy, while in the movie, he seems more sensitive, and emotional. He didn't seem like he could have actually killed a guy.The last thing that they could've added into the movie would've been the last part of the book! The movie ends when Tom leaves the family and the family packs up and moves somewhere else. They never even got to the part where Rose of Sharon has her baby. That part of the book isn't essential for the story, but it does help conclude things nicely.Even though there are many thinks that I think they should have done differently, I still thought that it was very well made. It really showed how difficult it was to get to California, how the family was breaking apart, and how difficult it was finding work. The book and movie are both worth investing time in."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This last week I finished reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you have not found your way to this book yet, you need too. Spawning from the Great Depression era, this intriguing piece follows the downfall of the Joad family on their cross country trip to California. The age of industry and of the machine forces the Joad's off their farm, and having few options, they pile into their broken down truck towards California in hopes of big jobs and big dreams. The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful historical piece of fiction that is a must read for every American. It brings to life every American issue; the American Dream, family, capitalism, religion, and sexuality, as well as numerous others. I recommend reading this book in the Spring or Summer as it is very dark, but it has to be. It is a long book, with a controversial ending that still has people talking."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, portray a migrating family that is in search of a better future after they were brutally kicked off their own land by the \\"bank.\\" The Joads encountered several problems, not only with the conditions of the vehicles and food, but with the people of other regions. In every region people viewed outsiders as a major threat, and treated them as criminals.Steinbeck took one family and related their circumstances with many. The journey of pursuing a better future with everything at stake adds a sense of suspense to the overall theme of the novel.He was able to capture the despair of not being able to feed their children or to provide a stable household. The novel keeps the reader intrigued with what is going to happen next, a true classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This moving novel captures the heartbreak of people driven into poverty by events beyond their control. Author John Steinbeck (1902-1968) examines the hardships faced by \\"Okies,\\" displaced farmers of the 1930's who headed for California and tried to scrape by as migrant workers.The story centers on the Joads, a family of destitute Oklahoma farmers that head for California in hopes of finding work as fruit pickers. Death and misery accompany their journey, and things aren't much better once they arrive. The people (and law) in California fear and mistreat newcomers, and what little work is available invariably involves long hours and poverty-level wages. The only time the Joads get respect is when they lodge at a modest U.S. Government camp for transients - the author once toured such camps with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. The book's ending is powerfully inconclusive, reflecting the sturdy will of people to endure hardship as the Great Depression drags on.This book captured the 1939 Pulitzer Prize. It was also turned into the classic 1940 movie starring Henry Fonda - a movie that was often filmed in secret due to lingering resentment against \\"Okies.\\" I gave the book just four stars because in places it lags a bit, but it remains a powerful statement for caring government and help for the dispossessed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I've never understood why Grapes of Wrath is so highly acclaimed among the Steinbeck works. I was forced to read it the first time in a high school English course. I believed, then, that I hated the writing of John Steinbeck. Later, after I'd come to know his other works I went back for a re-read, thinking I'd been jaundiced by an HS English teacher presentation. I still didn't care for it. Of the Steinbeck works it's the only one I've never read repeatedly as I aged."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book demonstrated the cruelty that we, as human beings, can demonstrate on one another.

And although that put s me at a somewhat biased opinion I am still entitled to it and it is a valid one regardless of what some of the older generations who like to lable all teenagers as having ADD. The book has many flaws but one saving grace. It's important in the sense that it gives a great insight to a period in history that many prefer to ignore or forget. But that's it. The story line is as dull, unengaging, and and long as you could possibly imagine. And if anybody has a problem with my opinion, tough. Like I said before, it's mine and I'm entitled to it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Although Steinbeck did a great job getting the reader into the sensation of the Depression, I really did not like this book because it was too depressing. I found the plot to boring and slow as well, to me, it was just one depressing event after another. However, the repetition and drowning effect that Steinbeck created was good in the sense that it made me feel as if I was traveling West to California in terribly difficult circumstances. Yet, I prefer reading books that are a bit lighter more optimistic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As I read these reviews, I came upon two that disregarded the finest book of all time as &quot;boring&quot;, and &quot;without a point&quot;. I was saddened to realize that the crucial message so eloquently produced by John Steinbecks' fine pen, was lost on so-called &quot;AP&quot; students. (For starters, &quot;real&quot; AP students would have developed more profound literacy arguments than those stated.) I was first exposed to this jewel of literature as a freshman AP student in high school. As a senior in college now, the depth of this story only grows with each reading. Perhaps most disheartening in the disdain of these readers, is the ignorance to the storys' ending, the very crux of Steinbecks' message.Despite the grevious hardships endured at the hands of her fellow human beings and the stunning death of her infant, Rose of Sharon offers her breast to a dying man without hesitation. This clarifies Steinbecks' hope; not just for the dying man or the Joad family, but for humanity itself. A poignant symbol such as this is obviously lost on a few young reviewers, but valued by others. My suggestion for the young readers who so obviously do not understand or appreciate this moving piece of literature is to start out with something more at their pace; Hardy Boys perhaps?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck wrote some good novels, some that are even almost great (East of Eden comes to mind); this, however, is not one of them. The Grapes of Wrath is little more than bad communist propaganda.It isn't that the kinds of things he describes didn't happen, but the way he presents them---without looking for the deeper cause (rather than pulling out the tired old scarecrow of \\"greed\\", an abused and vague term anyway) or offering a real solution but rather simply pushing for a (dubious at best) political program---is not only unrealistic, it isn't artistic either. About the only time it approaches the level of genuine literary expression is when Casy goes on about how his idea of holy is for every man to be harnessed, not even to every other man, but to Mankind as a whole. That's a horrible thought, but at least it's a somewhat deeper one.Even Tom Joad's famous \\"Whenever you seen a cop beatin' a guy...\\" speech is all about the insignificance of the individual, and as if to prove his point, Steinbeck continues the story for quite a while after that but Tom (despite having been the main character up to that point) does not reappear.And stylistically, this is one of Steinbeck's worst...it could be described as faux-Hemingway---lots of awkward sentences, unnecessary repetitions of words rather than using pronouns, etc. But it actually reads more like Socialist realism than anything else. It has a lot in common with some stuff put out by the Union of Soviet Writers under Stalin around that time. East of Eden is much better written, though Steinbeck is still using some techniques he seems to have learned from writers like Kataev.I did a bit of research after finishing this, and it looks like Steinbeck actually joined and had further involvement with the League of American Writers, which was set up by the Communist Party USA in 1935 in sympathy with the Union of Soviet Writers putting its policy of controlling and censoring the output of authors into effect the year before. Anyway, enough was known here about what was going on under the Soviet system by the time he wrote The Grapes of Wrath that he couldn't have had any honest excuse for glorifying it like that.I suspect that the only reason The Grapes of Wrath is considered such a great classic is that it was heavily pushed by the press which was highly sympathetic to communism in this country at the time of its release, and because of the movie version with Henry Fonda. People like to pretend that Steinbeck wrote books like this for \\"the common man\\", but the truth is it's incredibly patronizing and condescending; he really wrote it for wealthy intellectuals like himself to feel better about themselves. As someone who's in the working class himself (but doesn't intend to stay there his whole life), I think if I ever met Steinbeck I would have slapped his face, because The Grapes of Wrath is basically a slap in mine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I ordered this beautiful book, and received a blue hard cover from Reader's Digest.

I bought one, asked for a change and good the same quality. Finally, resigned and read it like that."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It has been a long time since I have read Steinbeck, but boy have I been missing something great! I grew up in Oklahoma, so this story hits home. I couldn't really call myself an Okie without the knowledge of our history and just what that name means to those few souls who are still alive that remember the hard times and forced migration of many of our people.Mr. Steinbeck illustrated just what happened when large corporations came in and took over the farms of the \\"little man\\". My heart really identified with small time farmers being attached at the soul level with their land, something large corporations could never do.I wonder how things could be a rough and poor as the dust bowl days, I try to imagine the people of American enduring. We have really become very soft, with even the poor having such extras that couldn't have been imaginable by the migrant workers described by Steinbeck.Never before have I been graced with the prose that describes the haves and have-nots in such a dark and colorful way. The main characters, the Joad Family, learn what it means to be feared and hated by anyone who \\"had\\" something. The people of California that owned land or stores knew the face of desperation, because they had experience the lengths humankind will go to in order to feed their loved ones.Being a liberal and a supporter of labor unions I felt incredible compassion for the Joad family and all the workers just looking for a fair days wage, but I also saw how the establishment could put a sterile (it is not my fault) corporate face to the practices of the farmers who would exploit the plight of the migrant workers.Reading the book one probably find it hard to think this was done to our own people. Even though it is not right, it is easier to stomach such actions being levied upon outsiders who come and take our jobs, but can one imagine the same feelings towards truly desperate Americans willing to undercut each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families. We have moved several generations from the likes of this type of desperation, which would tear apart the fabric of the crowded, interconnected and interdependent nation that we live in now.Finally, I thought it was amazing how the police and union busters used tactics of counterinsurgency. I'm a military officer and found the subject very timely and see how well Steinbeck understood the strategies and how powerful the hearts and minds of the locals are to strategic success.The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending. The final few pages were a huge downer, but maybe that was the point. I couldn't grab onto any light or happiness to lift my spirits, but maybe that is just the point Mr. Steinbeck was looking for in the tale."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If you want to get started by reading the sample, don't waste your time downloading it. The sample consists of the introduction, written within the last 10 years. It is not the beginning of the book. Disappointing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a tremendous story, set in the depression of the 1930's. Whilst a great book, it is not an easy read by any means. The dialogue of the characters is embedded in local accented English, where words are shortened and abbreviated with apostrophes.The Joad family's struggles as they are cast out from their home and search for a better future in California is heartbreaking, as they are just a small, insignificant dot amongst the hundreds of thousands of other souls trying to do the same thing. Be prepared to suffer with them, as you are drawn inexorably into their world.If I have one complaint about the book, is that it is never fully resolved. Then again, it never can be, as to do so would take many books. So, as a result, the book concludes at the end of an episode in their lives, so it is left, in my opinion, incomplete."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I recently finished this book in an attempt to fill in the gaps of my \\"classics\\" of literature. A lot of people read this book in High School or early in College, but for some reason my HS skipped it, probably because it is a little longer than most of the other books we read. That said, I'm very glad I took the time to read it, and also find a certain amount of serendipity in the fact that I read it as the effects of the 2008 financial meltdown are still reeking havoc on careers of so many people. The book in of its self is great, but the timing of when I read seems to give it a little extra kick.Grapes of Wrath is often labeled as a work of socialist fiction. Personally, I didn't really get that from my reading of it. There are workers that are treated unfairly, they are often harassed or oppressed by their employers, they theorize that if they stand together they could demand more, and they find that they are often better off when they are left to fend for themselves. If you look at these, you will find that there isn't much in the way of propaganda here. Workplace bullying by those with any level of authority is a fairly well-known and well accounted fact of life. Your boss is a jerk and the company will do anything it can to suck every bit of effort out of you for the lowest price possible; maybe this was not well known in the 30's or people were more ashamed of it then, but now it is what it is. Which leads to the next point about workers sticking together. I don't think it is particularly socialist to realize the practical fact that there is strength in numbers, which can be leveraged against businesses that go to far. I know what Marxism is, and that isn't it. Finally, the characters often remark that they are better off taking care of themselves or enforcing their own laws. That sounds like a small government libertarian's dream to me.The pleasant surprises I found in the book involved the well developed characters, accept for Noah (pointless), Connie (plot point but nearly pointless) and Uncle John (broken record.) I was able to create a solid visual image of this tight knit family that shared so much together. You had a real sense of each person's place in the Joad family, that could be alternately openly loving or mechanically efficient. I also found Steinbeck's use of different literary tools interesting, with him moving (although not very smoothly) from immersive local color, to disjointed stream-of-conscious, to poetic prose. He uses these tools to help bring more texture to the parts they are used in without being too heavy handed, although his jumping from different perspectives or suddenly going head first in the mile a minute mind of a used car salesman, can be jarring.Some readers complained that this book is slow. That is true; it is a little slow, but I believe it is probably supposed to be. This isn't an action packed thriller or romantic drama, its a yarn about simple people trying to live their lives in a world that is far from simple. If the story didn't take the time to set up the atmosphere, to really set the scene, I don't think the book would be half as good.Finally, given the ago of book, there has been a lot of time for people to over analyze its historical accuracy. This is a work of fiction set against a series of events that happened in history; so looking further than that is merely an academic exercise. Its in the Literature section of the book store not the History or Non-Fiction section, so you would have to be a fool to put too much stock in the writer's interpretation of events.Pros:1.) Steinbeck does a wonderful job of capturing the mindset of a farming family. He waxes poetic about the cultivation of land in a way that I wouldn't have thought possible, which in turn gave me a real sense of how much love farmers can have for their life's work.2.) The fictional Joad family lets a 21st Century urbanite like me look into a world that I have little connection to and no experience with. A good writer engages the reader in a way that makes them feel like they are sharing the story with the characters, and Steinbeck does exactly that. I really wanted to know what happens to the characters after the all too open end (see con below.)3.) Some may disagree with Steinbeck's personal reasoning behind writing Grapes of Wrath, but it's hard to argue with his economics, especially since we are seeing a model of it in action now. As the demands for jobs go up, workers are willing to work for increasingly less out of fear and desperation. Just as Steinbeck's farm owners pit workers against each other to lower wages and work conditions, so do the managers and presidents of business today. Don't want to work overtime? There is a line of applicants that will. Want $50k a year? I have 10 resumes from people that will do it for $40k a year. You've got a retirement plan and pension? I should get rid of you because you cost too much and hire a college grad for the half the money and don't have to offer them any kind of benefits because they will be happy just to be working. This is real and I see it happening every day.Cons:1.) Like most good books, Grapes of Wrath isn't for the casual reader. It's long, slow and thoroughly depressing; as well has needing a little bit of historical context. I think it was worth it, but I know not everyone will get a lot out of it.2.) If I was looking to edit the book down to make it easier to read, I would tie up some of the dead ends or eliminate them altogether. What was the point of Noah? Do so many animals need to get hit by cars? Why did Casey play such an important role, just to vanish for a quarter of the book and then meet an inauspicious end suddenly.3.) The book ends very abruptly. There is a complete lack of finality that makes you wonder if the author really knew what was going to happen to his characters when he started writing. To just end the story in the middle of a sort of hairy moment, after suffering so much with the Joads, it almost seems like a waste. Steinbeck closed on a pretty, albeit odd in a modern context, visual, but I think it was a very unsatisfying ending.Conclusion:A great book about the American experience for some in the 1930's that is a little long, but for me should have been a little longer if only to give the reader a sense of what the future would have in store for the Joads."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Seeking a masterful work for our \\"One Book, One Community Reading\\" project, and deeming the economy the significant issue of the day, we selected John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath for our focal read. Steinbeck's novel, which depicts the plight of migrants during the Dust Bowl era, elucidates topics as current as this morning's newspaper-- bank foreclosures, hunger, poverty, immigration, collective voice. Steinbeck's book earned a Pulitzer Prize when it was written. It remains the most shocking book I\\"ve ever read. Read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I'm fifty years old, I've read literally thousands of books, and I'm not aware that I've ever read a novel written by John Steinbeck. Recognizing this deficiency, I ordered a Steinbeck collection, seven of his most celebrated works including The Grapes of Wrath. I vaguely recall seeing the film starring Henry Fonda, and am well aware of the plot and the historical backdrop, but nothing can take the place of reading the work itself.As most know, the book details the westward migration of the Joad family, as they are uprooted from their Oklahoma homestead by the evils of the Great Depression, the Oklahoma dust bowl and the advent of mechanized farming. The family harbors visions of milk and honey awaiting their arrival in California, or so they are assured by the numerous handbills promising plentiful work and bountiful riches. What await them instead are rapacious labor recruiters, unfriendly natives and slow but sure starvation.Steinbeck certainly succeeds in painting a vivid and stark picture of the hopelessness faced by the migrants. His chapters alternate between \\"big picture\\" overviews and the particular heartbreaks and hazards faced by the Joads in particular. The story is an education in economics, labor relations, politics and human nature. In this day and age, it is difficult to conceive of children literally starving to death in the shadow of the most productive agricultural land in the country, much of it lying fallow and off limits to those that were capable of growing the food to nourish their own families.This is a very powerful novel, both with regard to the emotions that it taps and the beliefs and conceptions that one holds. It provides a sharp contrast between a period when so many were desperate to work for as little as something to eat, to one in which so many demand so much without having to lift a finger. There must be a happy medium."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This was a great book, I enjoyed reading this very much, and believe that every high school student should read this for their history class. It makes me think of what my decision would be at that time, to leave and hope for the best, or stay and wait it out. I have always wondered what your decision would have been."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I firstly started this novel as a schoolwork, but when I finished it, I knew that I was living with the Joad family with my heart. The Grapes of Wrath by Steinback depicts the life of Joad family as a microcosm of the immigrant workers during the Depression era, and Steinback ingeniously describes the workers' plights and ensuing 'wraths'. The novel was so impressive toward the end; Steinback imbues great metaphors such as the baby, rising rain, vineyard, and so forth, and he powerfully portrays the scenes, especially the final one. I, as a student fond of reading, have to say that the novel was one of the few living novels that I have read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Beautifully written, but very depressing account of one family's struggle through the depression. Clearly shows both the bad decisions of farmers who lost their land during this time as well as the injustices thrust upon them as they traveled to California, the land of milk and honey, that turned out to be anything but. Steinbeck alternates chapters of atmospheric description with the tale of the Joad family who face death, starvation, police harassment and their own ignorance, struggling to stay alive with limited resources. Not a light read, but worth the time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read a lot of fantasy and non-fiction. I've been averse to classics since I hated lord of the rings, faulkner, and most of hemmingway. However Steinback stands in a class of his own. The sheer ease of reading alone should be enough to keep eyes fixed, let alone the sure-and-steady plot, textured characters, and every other chapter that emanates emotion, experience, plot, and thick smell of the times.I'd recommend this to anyone mature enough to enjoy something not written by James Patterson or Nora Roberts."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book isn't for everyone. People I know who haven't liked it say that it was too slow, or \\"What's the deal with the turtle?\\" and didn't get past the first couple chapters. Some say it's just too sad.For me, this book meant everything. \\"To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth.\\" When I read this first line, I remember feeling like it was a line that I would always remember. I had the sense that I wasn't reading a story that some guy named Steinbeck came up with. I felt like the true feelings and experiences of a very real group of people were simply being funneled to me via Steinbeck's pen.The story felt very relevant to early 21st century America in that Fear seemed to be at the root of all evil. The Grapes of Wrath showed how Fear could be used to control and exploit people on a huge scale. It also depicted the human experience as profoundly intertwined with the earth. The characters' lives were turned upside down by nature, first by drought and later by flood. The very last scene showed how all of us are on this earth, in this life, together, like it or not and I found comfort in that.I had goosebumps and a pounding heart. All this for a book where the main characters speak in dialect about the \\"Fambly\\". Somehow John Steinbeck managed to fit what, to me, is essentially the meaning of life into a short novel about sharecroppers in the 30s.An amazing book. Please read it (all of it)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If you have not read this timeless classic yet in your lifetime, you have missed out on beatiful literature and amazing adventures.

Yikes!I'm never going to read Grapes of Wrath again, and won't be recommending it to anyone.If you don't like profanity, be careful."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I had John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath sitting on my bookshelf for several years and always wanted to read it. I started it one summer, but only got about twenty pages or so into it before I gave up. I didn't get back to The Grapes of Wrath until my freshman year of college when I had to read it for a Geography class. I wasn't sure why the book was assigned for Geography, but was glad that I finally had an excuse to read through the book. It was assigned at the begining of the semester, and I think that I finished it about a month before we even started talking about it.This book deserves every bit of praise that it has recieved. It tells the story of the Joad family, \\"Okies\\" who are journeying to California after their farm has been destroyed by both the effects of \\"The Dust Bowl\\" and the attempts of the United States government to control crop prices. At first, they believe that the \\"Golden state\\" is abundant with oppertunaties; Grampa is so excited that he says he wants to smash grapes all over his face when he gets to California. Yet soon all their hopes turn sour. Their trip exposes the rural farm family to the hardships of literally surviving during a time of economic downfall. The Joads experience loss of several family members and blique hopes for steady employment when they finally reach California; yet by the novel's end Steinbeck ensures that the Joads--and all the migrant farm workers in general--will continue to endure. Steinbeck inspired the characters in The Graphes of Wrath with heartfelt emotion, and by reading it you will truely experience their difficulties.A unique characteristic of the novel is that it contains \\"interlude\\" chapters after every narrative chapter or two. These chapters describe the the overall effects of others during The Dust Bowl and weave their way into the events of the Joads themselves. The first interlude chapter about the turtle is quite interesting and serves as a symbol of the story overall.This book is a must read for anyone and can be interpreted on quite a few different levels, including an allegory of the journey to the promised land. There are even a few funny jokes that I underlined in my text to remember. Although the novel may not imediately seem all that interesting, stick with it because it is worth finishing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I used to be dubious of the fame that some books have achieved, and wondered if the popularity was often earned. This is one of those famous books we all hear about. I was delighted to find that, not only was the writing beautiful and profound, but the characters seemed life-like, and the story well developed. When reading the story of the Joad's struggle, the only thing that you cannot feel is apathy. I found myself enraged by the atrocities committed against these migrant people.I honestly believe that 95% of everyone who reads this book will be impressed and, to some degree at least, transformed. Out of my favorite books, this one is probably in my top five."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Overall, this book was fantastic. It was interesting with lots of backround information, and showed how people struggle in life, and even though I am only eleven, I know struggling is something even our modern generation can relate to. My only complaint is that for the first one or two hundred pages it was very slow, and practically nothing happened. I put the book down for nearly a month before I felt like reading it again. Although when I did finish reading it it was very good, even if the ending was abrupt (that always makes me so annoyed!)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this tragic story with a constant smile on my face. The characters are so completely enjoyable. The situations heart rending yet so vividly described that it is entertaining/amusing.The story is not so much amusing because it is humorous. The smile is pure amazement over Steinbeck's ability to create this work where I could be a first hand witness to the characters and events. Some situations are laugh-out-loud funny although serious. Even the tragic events bring a smile and a lump to your throat at the same time. Every page pulled at my heart, my mind, and my face. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.It is also a real eye opener to the industrial revolution, big finance, and the depression era.As another reviewer wrote 'This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man.'"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I can't say enough about Dylan Baker's reading of this extraordinary book.

Needless to say, I think it's a great book and thoroughly deserve it's classic status. Granted, Mr. Steinbeck wasn't the best in prose like an Anderson or Fitzgerald but I think the most important part of a story is the story itself and Steinbeck is a great story teller. I've never felt more anger than when the Joad's were called &quot;Okkies&quot; or more sickened when they were cheated by the farm owners. The style of alternating the chapters was quite clever and I think it just sort of builds up the suspense. The ending to me is just right although a bit melodramatic, it captures the essence of hopelessness that prevails throughout the book. I thoroughly recommend this book and Steinbeck will make a cynic out of you yet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"After losing their family farm in the red country of Oklahoma, the Joads must move to California to find their dreams and a better way of living. Together, they give support as well as life to their fellow neighbors who are experiencing the same difficulties of traveling to the west for a more satisfactory life.I thought this book was very well written by John Steinbeck because he brought out each character very distinctly. None of the characters were EXACTLY the same as another. I could almost imagine myself working together with the Joads, scraping around for food and water, trying to survive just for a better life. Steinbeck captured all the touching moments as well as the tough times that the Joads went through, and brought them altogether in the end.Another reason why I enjoy Steinbeck's books: Stated in the Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 1962 - &quot;The ancient commission of the writer has not changed. He is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement.&quot;Our imperfections that we often try to hide from the world is brought straight out to us in Steinbeck's books. He is not afraid to state the facts. But, even with those flaws we are working towards growth and development in our lives.I relate The Grapes of Wrath to Of Mice and Men because just like the Joads who are moving to improve their lifestyle, George and Lennie are doing the same on a smaller scale. They are all in search for their dreams and goals that they set for themselves. Furthermore, I do recommend The Grapes of Wrath if you want to experience the captivating characters and the hardships one family goes through to find happiness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is quite possibly the best book I've ever read. It is a story of the Joad family; a poor share-cropping family in oklahoma during the dust bowl. Having fallen on hard times thanks to bad crops and an uncaring system, they are forced to go west. Their journey exposes the very worst of class distinction. The Joads are forced to live in unspeakable conditions, and like the other migrant families are constantly harrassed and exploited by the powers that be. This is a vivid tale of the human condition and a message to all of us. Steinbeck does a masterful job of telling the story. He pulls no punches and makes no excuses for the barbaric treatment of the migrants. He tells a story that the world might have otherwise forgotten, and makes us consider the fairness of it all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a 9th grader I am a great fan of Steinbecks work. Of Mice and Men, The Pearl, and East of Eden are but a few of my favorite books. John Steinbeck has a way of digging into every reader of his books. His books help his readers learn about past events and even about themselves. The Grapes of Wrath is one of his greatest books, second only to &quot;The Winter of Our Disscontent&quot;. Grapes of Wrath is full of tragedy, love and suspense, yet remains to be a very intelligent and insightfull book on the human soul. Im not saying this book is for everyone though. Its 619 pages long and most of that is dialoge. Every odd chapter tells the setting of the chapter to come. This can become tedious but truly gives a vivid picture of exactly the Joad family and the country are going through. I do recommend this book, but I believe the reader needs to have a lot of patience and a lot of time on their hands."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I put this book down, and I had no idea what to say. It was such a terrific book. I am glad that I picked this book up on my own, rather than being forced to read it in a class. I was able to enjoy it so much more and read it at my own pace. I felt myself seething with anger at times, laughing at others, and at other times just sitting spellbound by the excellent use of imagery. With so many books, a reader can find it hard to see in his mind what the author wishes a reader to see. With Mr. Steinbeck, I encountered no such problems. Another technique that I enjoyed (that other reviewers seemed confused by) was Steinbeck alternating between the story of the Joad family, and a sort of social commentary, every other chapter. I would rather Mr. Steinbeck DIDNT use quotations in these chapters. If he did, it may feel he was confining the situations presented in the &quot;odd&quot; chapters, to a single character. But by removing the quotations, I felt myself imagining that he was speaking for all the dispossesed, not just a single person.

I would recommend this book for any american reader!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The first book on my summer AP English reading list came highly recommended, and I was excited about reading it. However, as I read more and more, I grew tired of fate's relentless assault on the Joad family.The book contains oodles of sex imagery, to the point I worry about Steinbeck's sanity while he wrote the book. An example of imagery run wild is given in chapter 5, where tractors and farm equipment are described as &quot;raping the ground methodically&quot; and many other sexual references. It's a TRACTOR for God's sake!!!! Continually Steinbeck dwells on sex whenever he can draw a metaphor.Another problem I have with the book is the constant bad luck of the Joad family. Murphy's law is proved countless times as every possiblility of good fortune is systematically destroyed. I believe if the book were three chapters longer, there would be no surviving Joads to write about.In short, while I agree the plot is rather solid, the book is a depressing saga of a family's misfortune in a time when countless other families were experiencing hardships. I recognize the historical importance and the statement this novel makes, but if I had had the choice I would not have read this book. It took me a week to get over the depression and disgust of the human race that The Grapes Of Wrath instilled in me."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The historical part of this book is very disturbing. Things like the bulldozer going across the open plains plowing everything under was very difficult to understand from the point of view of the individual families, but from the banks view it was the only way to turn a profit or break even in the hard financial times of the Great Depression. The author also puts in the small things that add a sense of verisimilitude to the story, examples like the prices of the fruit and cotton, and the wages the pickers got for their work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I thought that the most significant thing in this book was when Tom was telling his mother about what Casy had said to him.

Having it be a &quot;required&quot; read was also not encouraging. However, about 100 pages into the story, I became captivated by the Joad family---particularly Tom, a man of great moral integrity, and the strong-willed but loving Ma Joad who provides the family's source of strength and courage in the face of overwhelming adversity. While some parts may make you flinch in horror, others will make you sad to realize these events really happened in the land of plenty.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is an engrossing tale of one Oklahoma family seeking not their fame and fortune, but just the hope of putting a few scraps of food on the table. Join them in their clunker of a truck as all 12 of them pile in to make the long and arduous drive west to California in the hopes of finding work picking fruit. They lose family members along the way, some by death and some by choice, but they learn a lot about friendship and taking care of not only their loved ones but also the strangers who find themselves in the same dire straits as the Joads are in. Steinbeck's descriptions of the hunger, the hardship, the futile search for work, the disappointments, the hostile environment the migrants faced in California, all make for an eye-opening read. This is a great source of information on how it was for one group of people during the Depression.It may not be one of the great novels of the twentieth century, its characters are often overly-sentimental, and its theme is relatively simple, but it is a landmark of literature for the way it portrays the Depression in the western United States. This book has been proven to be an accurate portrayal of the victims of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.Steinbeck alternates plot-driven chapters that feature the story of the Joads with chapters that focus on the large-scale problems of the economic history of California and the psychology of groups of migrants and of the landowners. These large-scale chapters provide background information and a broad world view that gives weight to the Joads' struggle, while the story of the Joads gives the large-scale chapters a sympathetic human face.Whether you love or hate the book, you will probably never forget this story of one family's valiant fight to survive while the world around them collapses and disintegrates.The novel was made into an excellent film in 1940 which starred a very young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Hello!I'm Betti from hungary, I need for a help.

This book definetley has an interesting background plot, and the writing style is very good, but like another reviewer commented, it seems half-finished.

It was a pretty good story, but it just didn't have that deeper kick to pull me in."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A towering masterpiece. Realistic and poetic at the same time, angry and compassionate, and still amazingly relevant after two-thirds of a century. This brings the Depression more real than anything I have read, and yet it is far from being a depressing book. One of Steinbeck's themes is how when people are cast out and cast down, their basic humanity draws them together into a big family governed by the laws of simple goodness and compassion. Perhaps this is a sentimental view, but it is attained one agonizing step at a time. Against this he sets the impersonal forces of big business, a pitiless economy, besieged communities hiding behind a corrupt police force, and the indifferent hand of nature, portrayed in short interleaved chapters that can be lyrical or bitter, passionate or cynically understated.These short anonymous sections are absolutely necessary to the scale of the book, but some of them have a set-piece quality that at times seems somewhat dated. Not so Steinbeck's treatment of the main narrative, especially his portrayal of individuals: Tom Joad, prison-hardened and wiser than his years, Casy the preacher who loses his faith to arrive at stronger truths, and Ma Joad who holds the family together. These are people totally of their time and place, and yet timeless, a testament to the almost unquenchable power of the human spirit. And nothing is more moving than the way the novel ends: with a simple act of kindness by one broken human being to another, that in Steinbeck's hands becomes a sacrament of grace, bringing tears to the eyes and hope to the soul.[PS. I first tried to read THE GRAPES OF WRATH four decades ago, in England in my mid-twenties, but gave up. I found it impossible to follow the dialect, I utterly lacked the knowledge of American history in the Depression era, and I dare say I lacked the life experience to appreciate the book's moral strength. For the second and third of these reasons, at least, I thus find it strange that the novel is so often assigned at the high-school level. After living in the USA now for 35 years, it means so much more to me. This is not because of history or language, but because the issues which made the book relevant in 1939 are still present in American life today, in its politics, its corporate culture, some aspects of its religion... but also in the enduring human spirit which Steinbeck so powerfully celebrates.]"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As much a political manifesto as the simple story of a family forced to leave their family farm and seek a new life in California, the Grapes of Wrath is a masterpiece of American literature. Set in the American West at the start of the mass migration to the West Coast, the story follows the Joad family from the foreclosure of their farm through the long road trip along Route 66 and finally to their lives as migrant workers in a land overflowing with workers. Their lives and hardships are vividly painted in Steinbeck's outstanding prose.Steinbeck alternates styles each chapter. Every other chapter details the story of the Joads. In the remaining chapters Steinbeck uses a repetitive, haphazard, ungrammatical, absolutely brilliant style to sketch a scene from the life of a migrant family, ostensibly the Joads. In these chapters, he conveys scenes such as the high-paced action of a used car lot, the bitterness of a family receiving foreclosure notice, or the back breaking work of cotton picking with such clarity and color that the words of the book seem to fall away leaving the reader with a tangible world in which voices are shouting or the breeze is tossing the cotton tufts into the air. In my own reading, I've seen many authors try to mimic this unstructured, repetitive style, but never done as well as this.The story is rich with symbolism and emotion. While there are some spots where Steinbeck seems to be working too hard, the book as a whole is a wonderful read. You will come away a little more educated about that era in America's history, a little more sympathetic to the plight of migrant workers, and maybe even a little more left-leaning in your political views. Regardless of what you intend to get out of it, the Grapes of Wrath is absolutely recommended for anyone of the maturity to understand the deep themes that run through the story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Although I have reviewed dozens of books, this is the first time I have felt speechless. It is not because I do not have anything to say, rather, it is because the book is so deep and complex and evokes so many feelings that I do not even know where to begin. I guess I'll begin by saying Steinbeck's ability to illustrate a book with just words is phenomenal. The imagery in The Grapes of Wrath is so enjoyable. Steinbeck describes every detail perfectly. You will actually be able to feel the hunger pangs, sense the heat of the desert sun on the back of your neck, and feel the hurt of death and loss. It is truly incredible.I really enjoyed all of the characters. I felt they were all well developed and had distinct personalities. Ma was tough, but always on the brink of being broken. She was like a teeter-totter - the slightest weight would send her to a breakdown. Tom was sensible and always under control. The two little ones, Ruthie and Winfield, were cute. I liked how they always repeated what they heard the adults say --- even if it didn't make sense! My favorite character though, was Casey the preacher. He really had a lot of insight to life. I liked they way he was always \\"thinking\\".For me, the only downfall of the book was trying to understand and endure the sandwiched descriptive chapters where no one in particular was speaking. These are the chapters in which other reviewers complain that Steinbeck should have used quotation marks. I really struggled with these. I know they were there for a purpose and housed a lot of symbolism; I guess that's why I was so frustrated. I wanted to experience those chapters the way Steinbeck had intended, but I found it very difficult. The good thing is that these odd chapters are very short (only a few pages) and they fall every other one. The \\"meat\\" of the book, (the long chapters) is where you'll get your enjoyment. Because of this, I am only going to give the book 4 stars; however, this is even a struggle for me, because in a way, I really feel the book deserves 5."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this book in high school and did not pick it up again until I was 50. What a difference a few years makes! This book is about hope while facing incredible challenges. If there is hope, there is life. When the voices of the suffering come together, they simmer, begin to boil and rise up (hence, the wrath of the migrant workers). It is about finding strength in different sources (a mother surfacing as the leader of her family). It is about families circling the wagons and holding onto to each other because often that was all they had. This story has been told many times in the course of history of laborers and is the backbone of the unions. Chapter 29 says it all. Very moving. A must read over and over again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Highly recommended. Steinbeck's prose is used to superb effect in detailing the upheaval of the Joads and their search for a better life in California.To anyone that dismisses it owing to the fact that they read it in high school - re-read it. There is so much going on that a high schooler probably could neither grasp nor appreciate.As well as focusing on the Joads, Steinbeck also take time out in various chapters to provide a social commentary of the times in which the book is set. Farmers taking loans on their lands, the depression/dustbowl, banks/landowners questing for profits, car dealers and suchlike taking every advantage of others misfortune, destruction of crops to maintain profit margins rather than feeding the starving.Through this nightmare world the Joads and countless others have to find their way: death, family fracture and shattered dreams become commonplace. The ending is simply superb."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is one of the great books of this century, if not the greatest. Within its pages, it plumbs the depths of both hope and despair, hostility and love, family ties and soulless corporations.Probably most people are aware of the basic story line: the Joad family, forced off their land by the confluence of the great drought of the late twenties, the beginnings of mechanization of farming, and banks that care only about their bottom line, travel to California in search of work as harvesters. But once arriving, instead of the paradise they were led to expect, find little work, a hostile local population, and living conditions far worse than those in prisons.But this bare-bones description of the story doesn't begin to indicate the power of this book. Steinbeck's characterization of the Joad family, Ma, Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the tag-along former preacher Casey are extraordinary. Tom is the nominal protagonist, the decisive one who does his best to plan and get things done, but I think most people identify more with Ma, the rock around which all the vicissitudes of life thunder and break till they must retreat, defeated. Her main priority is just to keep the family together, keep on going, while still maintaining the dignity and honor that being human implies.But perhaps the real protagonist is America itself as it existed during this time period. The portrait of America is painted in alternate chapters from those dealing with the Joad family, mainly told from an omniscient viewpoint, and much of it reads like a prose poem. Here we find the description of the weather and farming practices that led to the Dust Bowl, a turtle determined to continue on his course, a truck stop vignette that just might break your heart, the soulless actions of the banks and land owners, the desperation and determination of those forced off lands they had farmed for generations, the used car dealers out to make a profit regardless of the pain their junk jalopies will cause the buyers, the vast river of migration that occurred in those same jalopies, and the communities that formed each night during their arduous journey to the magic land of California. These images have remarkable staying power - I don't think I'll ever forget that turtle or the dust-laden house knocked askew by the tractor. Much of Steinbeck's message and theme is presented in these chapters - one of the evils of unbridled capitalism and the virtues of socialism.This is a portrait of America in transition, from a mainly agrarian society to an urban mechanized one, and like all great changes the \`little' people suffer the most. Here we find workers willing to work for less than starvation wages, just to try and put one more meal on the table, before their children die in front of their eyes. And the owners can offer such wages, because they know there are always enough people who are desperate enough to take those wages, and that unionization and working towards a common purpose will not work as long as there are such desperate people. Steinbeck does indicate that there might be another solution to this dilemma, namely that the people in such straits must learn some other trade (car mechanic, radio repairman), but also shows that the great majority of people will never actually make such a change in their trade.After each of these chapters we return to the Joad family - and see the general portrait painted in living detail, forcing the reader to see more than the abstract, to see the pain and suffering, to hope against good common sense that there is some better ending ahead. But there is no paradise, no Pollyanna future, only a slide into more and more desperate conditions. When you reach the final pages, you will find what despair truly is, right alongside the indomitable will to keep going, just keep going.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a complex story of a migrant family from Oklahoma traveling across America to get to California, or \\"The Promised Land.\\" Once in California, they find it not so promisising. John Steinbeck thoroughly describes the hardships experienced in the travel to California. The reader travels looking through the eyes of both parties; the poor migrants and the wealthy Californians. Steinbeck perceives an authentic and contemporary description of the Great Depression. The Joads are a tightly-knit group, led by two main leaders, Tom and Ma, who are both amazing characters. Tom, the middle son, is the stronghold of the family. A smart and precocious young man, Tom leads the family through times of hardship and difficulties. Ma Joad is the female binding of the family. She is the mother, the strong yet caring fastening that keeps the falling-apart family together in their journeys. John Steinbeck shows himself as an advocate of female rights in this novel, displaying perhaps one of the strongest female characters. Between these two characters, the loss of the family is a minimal. Tom and Ma create a captivating and gripping story.John Steinbeck really makes the story, however, with his unique style of writing. He smoothly alternates between large chapters that focus on the story of the Joads, and smaller chapters that construe lifestyles, troubles, and ways of the poor migrants who have traveled to California in search of a better life, a new home, or at least a scrap to put on their table. Steinbeck is thrillingly descriptive, sometimes to the point of repulsion. For a work of fiction, the characters in The Grapes of Wrath are very authentic and practically existent. The book differs in many ways from my usual reading material, and stands out in my mind as an admirable representation of the Great Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of wrath is John Steinbecks masterpiece. That he never again wrote an opus of this caliber is of little matter. few others have,either before of since. Steinbeck tells the tale of America during the Depression,by making one family come to life,the Joads. Now a part of the american Lexicon due to the movie of the same name[and a later bruce Sprinsteen album,the ghost of tom joad},the Joads are once proud Oklahoma famers devastated by the dust bowl droughts of the 1930's[which Steinbeck describes brilliantly.} They gather together, tie up their meager belongings, and head out furthe west to California, the land of opportunity. Needless to say, their plight mirrors that of literally millions during that decade, and theier reception in California is less than welcoming. They fight with crooked cops,abusive migrant bosses and &quot;instigators&quot; in camps,until they finally find a labor camp that treats them, and others as human beings. The Joads,in their utter despair and poverty,retain, even ennoble the human condition, by growth and compassion and kindness. There are tow ways people react to adversity, to lash out or reach out. the Joads become, then, paradoxically,with their poverty and rough edges, the quintessential Americans:tough, undogmatic,principled,compassionate,not looking to take advantage even when the opportunity presents itself. The final scenes, with Tom forced to go on the run again,the final conversation between Tom and his Ma are astonishing, and Sharona {the roseofsahrona, as she is referred to] nursing a dying man with her breat milk intended for her stillborn baby, is as unforgettable as exists in all Literature. If Moby Dick is not the great american novel, then this is. One of the very very few pieces of literature as relevant as when it was written. as Masterpiece, a galaxy full of stars would not suffice, never mind 5 stars. MAGNIFICENT,UFORGETTABLE.A MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"That's what we learn from reading this Steinbeck masterpiece. The irrepressible Joad family takes an unforgettable journey west to the promised land of California from their bank-confiscated farm in desolate Oklahoma. Steinbeck utilizes the setting of the Great Depression to the fullest through his vivid imagery of the colors of grey and red, his naturalism, which makes the land a character in its own right, his transcendentalism and symbolism, both which bring ulterior meaning to many seemingly mundane goings-on throughout The Grapes of Wrath.Steinbeck brings to life characters that I empathize for and felt after 200 pages as if I were a member of their family rooting them on after all they had persevered through. The struggle of the Joads to put food on their plates at the end of the night after picking cotton or peaches all day long for next to nothing makes me extremely thankful to have food and shelter -things most of us take for granted. The Joads struggle for their place in society and for their identity, which was unconscionably taken away from them and thousands of other &quot;Okies&quot;. The Joad family undergoes a stark transformation from naive idealists to destitute pessimists and finally back to optimistic and hopeful for the future. Te Grapes of Wrath proves to be the definitive novel of the Great Depression and one that every American should read in order to fully understand the most apocalyptic time in American history and fully appreciate our lives today and the many luxuries that we all take for granted. Undoubtedly one of the top 5 American novels of all time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is incredibly boring. This review is coming from a teens point-of-view. It is based in the 1930's during the Great Depression. The story flips from the Joads-a family that is moving from Oklahoma in search of work in California-to little social commentary chapters that discuss the whole situation in general. I found this to be sort of like a modern day bible for it has the Joads made up of 12 people like the 12 deciples who are being pushed out of their homes like the jews. There is a character who plays the Jesus Christ role, another who symbolizes Judas, and an unborn baby who represents Moses. Don't get me wrong this book definately makes you think, but i found my self getting annoyed with this family because of their ignorance. I don't want to reveal to much in case you want to read it but personally i advise you to give spark notes a visit. This book is also very slow so if you have a short attention span then i suggest not reading it. If you enjoy Steinbeck novels then go for it, otherwise, just buy the cliff notes.

Unless you're a high school teacher who is hell-bent on warping young minds into America-haters, this book is not worth the time, money, or energy to read. Did Steinbeck think that a sleezy political opportunist like himself (remember, he was a big proponent of the Vietnam War when it was being run by Democrats) can actually produce work of quality? Come ON.Think about the values of this book--irresponsibility is rewarded (who asked the idiot Okie farmers to borrow from the banks in the first place?), immorality is scoffed at, at the same time religion is put down (&quot;I was 14, randy as a billy goat&quot;), and capitalism gets the blame for an economic system that was anything but capitalistic (why else have oranges and potatoes thrown into rivers other than to prop up prices pursuant to a command economic policy?). Gradually this book i! s coming to be seen as nothing more than a product of the proto-&quot;Hate American First&quot; crowd, which is why it will continue to be popular among high school teachers."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Steinbeck will use a thousand words to paint a picture. He goes overboard with the detail, making it boring by modern standards, encouraging the reader to skip over entire paragraphs. It does, however, paint a very detailed picture of what life must have been like during the depression. His research was quite good. I can just see him wandering around Oklahoma and California with notebook in hand, jotting down endless details to give the book a realistic flavor. One time he used two full pages, and entire Chapter in this case, to describe a turtle crossing the road! The result is an often dull, but educational experience, if that's what you read it for. Most people buy novels for the suspense, because they are page turners. That's modern fiction, geared to readers that spend too much time watching car chases on TV. This book, however, is literary.One big problem I have with this book is the profanity. Over and over, several times a page at times, Steinbeck take's the Lord's name in vain. I read Christian fiction most of the time so that was a real turnoff. Still, I gave it three stars because it was educational and it gave me a deep appreciation for the blessings God has given me, compared to the plight of the Joad family and so many like them. Maybe if they didn't take God's name in vain so much they would have had an easier time!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Simply put: I didn't like this book.

This is the book to read"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"There have been many negative reviews for this book, but unfortunately most of them have been less than eloquent. Some of you who enjoyed this book seem to have noticed that. Well, I'm going to start this review off more than eloquently.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an utterly pointless, sneering exercise in self-importance. It seems as though Steinbeck wrote this thinking, \\"This is the single greatest piece of literature ever created by man, and I am the most amazing human being to ever put pen to paper! All will bow to me!\\" I'm so sorry to point out how wrong you are, Mr. Steinbeck.This is a story about the Joads. Fair enough. The Joads go to California in search of work because the big bad capitalists blew their house down. Fair enough. There's a great deal of not-so-subtle Christ imagery with Reverend Casy. Not entirely necessary, but fair enough. The point to all of this is, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" isn't so much a novel as a published mishmash of themes.The book has no plot at all. It simply follows this family as they migrate across the country while Steinbeck tells us how fantastic Communism is, and we should all do it. The author stands high on his pedestal and preaches to his readers, while failing to actually tell an engaging story.The characterization in the book is horrid. For some reason, critics find it a fabulous idea for Steinbeck to have created a group of one dimensional characters. I don't know where they studied, but to me, that's bad writing. Most of these cookie-cutter characters are hardly paid any mind during the book, and a good deal of them depart from the family by some means. The handful of characters Steinbeck does choose to focus on are in desperate need of deeper personalities. As it stands, I found it very difficult to actually care about what happened to any of them, and so I lost interest. This loss of interest makes it very difficult to read this book, because the reader must trudge through, at a snail's pace, hundreds of pages about characters he could care less about.I have a thought that the term \\"anti-climactic\\" was somehow spawned by this book. As if to prove to us that the novel does, indeed, go absolutely nowhere plotwise, Steinbeck ends the novel with Rose of Sharon offering her breastmilk to a starving full grown man. Oooh, racy, John Steinbeck, you must be a good author now! ...Well, no. After devoting several hours of my life to this monster of a book, I expected to fell a trifle more satisfied by the conclusion. Hell, \\"rah-rah communism\\" is a better ending than what is currently there.So, I really can't find a reason to like this book, and a lot of that stems from the fact that I can't bring myself to like or respect Steinbeck. Get off your high horse, already. Most people have stopped caring."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this book for a report and found it really dull.

Steinbeck very movingly depicts the plight and the steadfastness of the displaced. Man versus Nature and Man's inhumanity to Man have never been better discussed. Extremely well-written, I enjoyed every word of the book even though this is the third time I've read it. Ma Joad becomes the de facto head of the &quot;fambly&quot; and her spirit is indomitable. The cruelty of &quot;the haves&quot; to &quot;the have-nots&quot; stabs one in the heart. Reading this work will leave one a better and more humble person. It will also remind one of hard times and the distinct possibilty such times could come again. Will our will to survive be as great as the &quot;Okies?&quot; I doubt it.This edition has fairly large print which makes it very easy on the eyes.I heartily recommend this towering work of Steinbeck's to young and old alike.

We, the people, are the heros in both these novels, and my life has been enriched by having heard these stories.

It is a powerful moving story that will make you wonder if things will get better or worse. The Grapes Of Wrath is considered to be a social protest by other reviews and I believe this is true for Steinbeck portrays the conditions that a migrant family workers had to go through. There were chapters in the book that were not about the migrant family and Steinbeck might have meant to do that so that readers will see the background of the story behind what's happening to the characters in the story and this also gives readers an idea about the history behind the novel that happened more than 60 years ago."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It is difficult to overstate the impact that this book had on the 16-year-old struggling with his identity that I was when I first read it in 1970. More so than Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, this masterpiece did so very much to awaken the social consciousness and activism in me. As a native Californian, I had actually been called an &quot;Okie&quot; as a small child but had no context to define the word.The other reviews I read praised the book's portrayal of the Joads to maintain human dignity despite disposession and prejudice that is very tangible. But I love the book for its spirituality as well. The continual references to God are unmistakable! The injustice is easily recognizable because God put His notion of justice in us. The Preacher, the real hero of the story, is sacrificed to the injustice.Sheer poetry, the book is a towering work that loses none of its impact with the passage of years."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book gave me an excellent portrayal of life during the Great Depression.

I love this book for its form and style, its language, its simplicity, its symbolism, its characters, plot and dialogue and its meaning layered on meaning that never disappoints; each new reading reveals something new and profound about you, the reader; we, both as a formed society and as human beings as a timeless whole, and the forces outside of ourselves that compel us to either make choices or just hang on until the ride is over. My last reading gave me the impression that &quot;Grapes&quot; illustrates that, at bottom, human beings are both the best and worst of all creations, and that the choice is always ours which of those characteristics we will put forth in any given instant in our lives; whether or not life favors me today, I can still choose to give my best to others and myself. Our free will cannot be quashed. In this fatalistic world, I appreciate Steinbeck's demonstration of this through the Joad family, who, when the indifferent world asked them to die and get it over with, refused, and went gallantly on. This is life-affirming art at its best, a classic that fits the definition: it rewards reinspection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.

Definitely read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"That kind of review is to be expected from someone who can't even spell &quot;description&quot; correctly. Yes, to illiterate people, this book might not be so interesting, but to everyone else, it is a story about a huge part of America's history. The reason there is so much description is because Steinbeck wants to take the audience to this point in time, and show us how the family dealt with this tragedy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be too cumbersome for some readers who demand more action and suspense, but if carefully read, you can't help soaking in the concatinations of themes. Steinbeck exploits the journey and growth themes to their full potential in the story of the Joads' trip to the promised land and the tribulations they face. Life and Death have never been painted so blatantly and thoroughly in modern literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have not read the book, but the play was captivating.

This book was flawless, It opens your eyes to the immense desperation of the time. If a book can change you life, this one will. It makes you realize what you have, and take for granted. Even something as simple as a toilet, a place to stay and food to eat. The themes that are portryed in this novel are strong and clear, I recomend this book to anyone who has an open mind and a love for literature. But to truly understand it, you need to read between the lines and analyze it every step of the way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a long book about the 1930's. It involves the main character of the story, Tom Joad, leaving prison and going back home to his family's house in Oklahoma, when he finds out they've left because of the dust bowl. When he catches up with them, they're packing up to go to California. A lot of the book is about them going to California, and them trying to settle down. Some of the chapters in the book are symbolic, and represent Steinbeck's leftist ideals. A lot of the people here seem to give the book a 1 star review because they can't appreciate the symbolic meaning of the turtle, and of other things.If you're intelligent enough to grasp the concept of symbols, you will definitely like this book.And yes, there is a lot of cussing in here. And know what? They're just words. Calm down.One last thing. The ending of the book is really, really shocking. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"So you're probably wondering, why such a downer title, and yet he gave it four stars? Well, if you're willing to be your own editor, you can turn this into a terrific novel or into a moving essay. But, Steinbeck has combined both, and in today's time, this pairing drives down the pace of both. Steinbeck's writing pattern is immediatly apparent: He alternates between an essay dealing in generalities of the situation with the tale of the Joad family specifically living the conditions he has laid out in the essay. Of course he did that, because he was trying to educate the bulk of America to the condition the migrant workers were facing in California. If he just told Joad's story, readers might think it is a situation peculiar to only one family. But, by pairing the Joad episodes with the broader essays, he shows that their desperate situation is shared by thousands of other families. Each of the essay/story telling sections are easy to dissect, so I suggest the reader who is interested in the compelling story of the Joads skip the essay segments. I read both in order, and found myself impatient with the essays and wanting to get back to the Joads. However, the essays are beautifully and powerfully written and important in their time before Caesar Chavez, so the next time I pick up this book, I believe I will just read the essay sections, then read the Joad sections. I also highly recommend the movie version of this book which starred Henry Fonda. The book and movie are quite similar in their plots with some exceptions that are interesting to think about. There are a number of minor characters and situations in the book that didn't make the movie. One of Steinbeck's themes from the book that didn't see light of the silver screen is that the head of the family was changing from a male to female as the adversities became harder to overcome. The movie ends on somewhat of a positive note with Henry Fonda's \\"I'll be there\\" speech. On the other hand, the book ends with a hell-bent-for-leather finale, none of which made the movie, including the haunting climax. And unlike the movie, the book shows no promise of a brighter future."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The book relates the tragic destiny of one family after the great depression in 1929, when million of American workers became unemployed. this family had been abased, and went to the california to get a life better.

I can't agree completely with that. Grapes of Wrath is an important expose of the way simple people were affected by the Great Depression and industrial changes to the agricultural sector. Overly sentimental and melodramatic at times, it is true that Steinbeck exploits the sad nature of his lowly characters to elicit pity. Still, I found his style clear and the plot interesting enough to overlook these deficiencies. The narrator documents the trip down Route 66 of an Oklahoma dust farm family. They are headed toward California dreams and encounter much adversity along the way. I think the book should be read as a relevant period piece and enjoyed as an American family saga."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Thats what it is a good book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have to disagree with most of the reviews on this page. The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it. I doubt very much theres an American highschool student who hasn't read this book&gt;"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is an important book because it fictionalized an important historical movement. However, it is quite dull and dismal.The story revolves around the Joad family, a group who has been uprooted from their home and decides to move to California where there are oranges and opportunities. They endure hardships including death, poverty and prejudice. The scenes are filled with dirt and barren landscapes. It is hard to like the family because they're absolutely pathetic and it is hard not to like them either for the same reason. One just rolls along the story with them not caring much what happens or what doesn't happen.The book is full of symbols that are presented for the reader to interpret any way they'd like. Steinbeck used these symbols to put forth his points about humanity in a subtle way so that one is not overwhelmed. One symbol is the dust that creates a haze over the world. It foreshadows the discomfort and irritation of a new life and obliterates view of the past. The wind that blew the dust pushed the family toward California in hopes of a better life. The highway symbolizes the journey taken by the families toward California. It is the progression of life, the never-ending struggle that all must endure. The grapes from the title of the book were referenced in a scene in which they were crushed to starve the Okies. The juice from these grapes symbolizes the blood that was shed while fighting injustice. In Christianity, grape juice and wine are used in communion as the blood of Christ. The wealthy squeezed the grapes to expel the juices into the streets so that the common people had no access to it, preventing religion and good from the migrants.Overall, this book employs tools of great writers and is certainly historically important. However, it is difficult for one to want to read this sort of book if it is not entertaining. This void is the book's major weakness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I remember reading this last year in high school, and everyone felt it was so boring that they couldn't even continue reading, but this was one of the few books I could actually stomach and continue to read on with. I have a natural interest with American history, and my main interest is in the early 20th century during the 20s-40s. This book does a wonderful job at portraying that time period, as well as realizing what life was like for your average working man during our countries worst economic decade. People were fired and lost their land, people traveled across the country to find minimum wage jobs to support their families, people dies and lost family memebers on the way, people broke the law and commited suicide to cope, and people were miserable on top of all this. The characters aren't too boring, and go through some of the depressions worst moments. This book also shows the brutality of the government and how they would force people out of nice camps and jail them just for voicing their opinions. In the end, nothing changes, and everyone is as bad off as when they started off, if not worse. They are without a home, job, or decent meals, and this is all shown very clearly throughout the novel, as well as how Americans worked together to support each other with humane acts to hopefully make it out of the depression and regain their homes and jobs."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is an astonishing book, a spellbinder like today's mysteries, but with a social conscience.

Steinbeck is one of the greats and needs to be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Perhaps no scene in literature is more haunting and powerful than the conclusion of the Grapes of Wrath. I finished the audio book, narrated by Dylan Baker, some 2 weeks ago, and its sad irony and humanity still resonate with me.However, this scene is just one of dozens evoking the depths of human hope and sorrow. If you haven't read the Grapes of Wrath, it's a journey like no other; not just into the human spirit, but into our nation's history, including vivid portrayals of farm foreclosure, migrant labor, and economics and social events that gave rise to organized labor.In addition to delivering highly memorable characters and scenes, Steinbeck offers an unusual but very effective structural device - narrative passages about primary characters are interspersed with passages from third-party perspectives, often resembling discrete short-stories, for example,- a property manager evicting a disbelieving farmer from his land- a salesman selling a used car to a desperate family heading West- family farms collapsing in the wake of farm-automation and vertically-integrated farm-canneries- a stolid turtle trudging along an Oklahoma dust bowl roadAll-in-all, The Grapes of Wrath is a feast for the mind and imagination, as much a must-read as say, the Catcher in the Rye.Dylan Baker's audio CD narration is outstanding. Like a great narrator, he's equally effective voicing male and female characters, conveying emotional depth without becoming maudlin, and maintain a good pace. His narration compares with some of the best efforts from the generally incomparable George Guidall."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Over the years I have attempted to read this classic several times and failed because the first 100 pages are slow and daunting. FINALLY - I was determined to plow (no pun intended) through this amazing book.

They are enticed as so many others were to the land of promise and opportunity - California. Unfortunately they are met with hardship, contempt, injustice, corruption, greed, prejudice and hunger to name a few.

An extremely sad journey through it's pages, you just want the journey to end and the book to be over. This book is beatifully written as I knew it would be. The opening chapter is awesomely written and the tragic Joad family are of course wonderful. Despite the critical introduction I never felt preached to and never felt that dialogue from the Joad family was over and above what you'll get from semi-literate, poverty stricken folk.I don't understand why the publishers allowed such a snobby guy to give the introduction which, before I knew it, told me the ending. How stupid can you get? I'd advise you to read the book BEFORE the intro and make your own mind up BEFORE the intro. This book is one of the reasons I love books. It opened up a little world in my mind that I never knew existed in 1930's America. And I keep talking about it to people and comparing it to the world today. Hope you get it.The book is about farm labourers, small-time plot holders who's livelihoods have been taken away by the coming of the tractors and 1930's Depression. These people have been born and brought up to live off the land, ploughing, sewing etc and NOTHING ELSE. So,skill-less,homeless, hungry, desperate and financially broke they migrate West under promises of work in the West and streets lined with Orange trees. Unfortunately, there's half a million people migrating and not nearly enough work. When the family leave Oaklahoma, Buisnessmen use their desperation to bargain down the worth of their lifes belongings and, when they travel they are told early that buisnessmen use the huge numbers of people, and their hunger and desperation, to lower wages. This book made me hate certain aspects of human nature-competition, survival of the fittest, progress etc. But you will love and admire the Joad family.In all, an intense beautifully written story that had me hungry for every word."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this classic. This book was a brilliant analysis of social society and it really makes me feel sorry for the immigrants. I especially liked how Steinbeck made the novel as gloomy as possible to prove his point. The vivid images of this great book showed a farming family forced to move out for a better chance at life, and then fail at the end. It makes you feel as if you are really there. The Great Depression was a cruel, foolish discriminating event on the innocent Americans. It was also very difficult to see proud Americans being significantly reduced to nothing at all. It leaves you hanging, lets you decide what will happen. It is really a wonderful book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath. This is a book written for mature, adults, and it is obvious from reading the numerous negative reviews left by teens that they are not mature, adult readers. How can anyone expect a teenager from today's hurry up, rush rush, society to enjoy a book that develops as slowly as The Grapes of Wrath. And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages. Teachers would be doing all of the mature readers who can appreciate a book as great as this a favor by not forcing their students to read it, and thus sparing us from their immature, ridiculous reviews.

But they find out a lot more than what they thought about the promised land called California when they finally get there. they get treated with disrespect by the people who live there, calling them and many other outsiders from Oklahoma 'Okies' and being pushed around by the deputies. They started out as a big family, then lost members throughout the novel. the book also has some 'interchapters' by the author to show us what happened during the depression.To me, Steinbeck's novel was both good and boring.Good, because it was a good story, with perfect detail and well-crafted characters. It was also structured really well, with the dialect the author used for the characters to make them realistic. I think Steinbeck did a great job with this work, different from Of Mice and Men and The Pearl.This novel was also boring because of the interchapters. one, they have nothing to do with the actual story. And two, they have paragraphs that just puts me to sleep. I know they're there just to show us what's going on during the story, but still, it just loses my interest.Overall, The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinback at his finest.

It does not fail to leaves its mark on a reader. This serious master-piece has its setting during the \\"Great Depression\\" and gives a general view of the 1930's. John Steinbeck who may be the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm wrote this THE GRAPES OF WRATH which is about the struggles of the poor during this time. In the story, the Joad family endures many struggles on their way to find work in California and their lives are a microcosm of struggles of the poor during this time. Like thousands of other families, they encounter hunger, violence, betrayals, setbacks and despair. Yet the Joads maintained dignity, courage, and hope to recover. America was fortunate in that the poor did maintain these virtues which kept their hopes alive and made them not to rebel and throw the nation into anarchy. The nation was also lucky with the ascension to power of Roosevelt. THE GRAPES OF WRATH shows how a people with hope and a leadership committed to its people can overcome disaster to become strong again.Itrreads in so many ways like Disciples of Fortune and the writing flows in an effortless manne"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a classic and a must-have must-read for everyone with an interest in good books.

She actually remembered being born when some of the events took place! She enjoyed the book very much although the language was a little strong for her in some places."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a novel that generated many varying reactions from me, and although I enjoyed reading it, I have mixed emotions about it.The book is undeniably well written, with Steinbeck alternating a chapter of narrative that focuses on the Joad family with a short chapter about the migrant movement of the thirties as a whole. The chapters about the migrant movement are almost poetry. Although some leave something to be desired others simply soar with excellence. At first I was annoyed by this organization, as I was drawn into the story of the Joad family and hated being taken from it, but then as the novel progressed I got used to the alternating chapter focus and I began to like it. After finishing the text I can't imagine the novel without it.The novel's strongest point is the characterization of the Joad family. Mr. Steinbeck has a wonderful gift of creating stark full characters with an economical use of prose. He \\"shows\\" us these people, he does not tell us about them. It is almost like you are peeping into their minds and lives, and accordingly there are many moments where much is left unstated. But Steinbeck has created such textured characters you know what has been left unsaid and have already filled in the blanks.I loved the character of Ma Joad and her simple philosophy of life. She swings from the heights of authority to the shadows of self doubt with such fluidity and simplicity that she reeks of reality, and personally I found Steinbeck's first description of her (on page 74 in the centennial edition) to be some of the finest character writing I have come across in a novel.Many readers are irritated by Steinbeck's overt socialism in the text, and I admit it is obnoxious at times, but I was not so bothered by it that I had to stop reading. I am not even sure that Steinbeck is extolling socialism as much as he is preaching the \\"golden rule\\". Rather, what I was more bothered by was his lazy characterization of people with money. If you are a banker, or a corporate farmer, or someone with money you are bad, period and nothing further need be said. Contrasted with the rich characterization he did with other characters (specifically the Joad family) I was annoyed by this lazy attempt at one dimensional characterization. It takes away from the humanity of all people, which I think is counter to one of the book's prevalent themes.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an astounding text, and one that I found to be gripping and human. Despite some flaws it's themes of the resiliency of the human spirit and the strength to be found in family is needed and relevant. I was so wrapped up the in the last 150 pages of the text that I had to keep reading. What I was reading was wonderful and terrifying at the same time, and this epic (almost Biblical) tale merits your attention."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath for my AP English class, and it was a struggle to start, but at the end even I was swayed by its mastery.It's very depressing, cruel and harshly realistic about the Dust Bowl and Okalahoman farmers moving to California. California, to look for a new beginning, is their destination. And along the way, it's all about the struggles as humans they go through, their self sacrifices, soul searching and willingness to band together just to get through it alive.If nothing, Grapes of Wrath is moving, and heartbreaking but tedious with description and choke full of lengthy descriptions. I don't recommend this if you absolutely hate historical fiction, as it takes a certain preference of historical fiction to enjoy this novel. I liked it in the end. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for historical fiction, maybe it's because I was forced to read it, but I enjoyed it. I don't think I could've grasped the symbolic Christian references - and I think it would be much more appreciated by a more worldly, older generation than mine.Regardless, try it. It's a classic anyway, there must be a reason for that.

This is a novel I had been told to read for years. I heard from everyone how much I would love it. So I tried several times and just could not get into it. It didn't grab me right from the start as some stories do. Then, one day, I decided to give it one last try. For whatever reason I was finally ready and wow, did I love it! The plight of the Joad family evoked such a combination of despair and hope that I felt as though my heart would burst. I had read Steinbeck before, (\\"East of Eden\\" is one of my favorites), but \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is so relevant to the present economic situation in this country that it really struck a chord with me. I imagine there are many American families living a modern-day version of this story. Steinbeck was a master and his vision extends into a future we can only imagine. I don't think you can rate this novel on the same scale as other works sold on Amazon. If I could I would give it ten stars, at least."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I recently read John Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\", which I also highly recommend. Though I've seen the movie, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\", many times I decided to read the book. It is exquisite literature and the kind of writing we do not see enough of these days with formulated novels that are, in fact, screen plays waiting to happen. I encourage anyone who has reverence for words, to read this stunning novel for every word, line, and paragraph yields a poetic depth, understanding, and insight into an important part of our country's history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I had always thought of myself as lucky for avoiding authors like Steinbeck and Fitzgerald in both high school and college, but after reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", I realize now I did myself a service. Being below the age of 18 in high school, and still being financially supported by my parents in college, I would have probably knocked the book. I think the themes in the book are so complex and so adult that there is definitely a maturity level that needs to be reached to appreciate the book.Steinbeck does an excellent job of relating to the Joad's struggles, painting a picture of the depression, and truly captures the pain and reality of the travels to the west in 1939. Just from reading the book made the depression so much more alive where I could feel the Joad's heartbreak. I was just sick reading about the treatment of the people, but relieved to see the acts of kindness done throughout the novel. My favorite character was by far Ma. She set an example of how to keep a family together and the true definition of a humanitarian. Though I wouldn't have begged to read this book in high school, or college, I am truly appreciative that I waited to read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"Bobby, I'm tellin' ya, if'n ya read'at book it'll only make ya mad,\\" Pa said, one eyebrow raised higher than the other.\\"But, Pa, it's 'bout us and our fambly, ain't it?\\" Bobby asked, rubbing his ear.\\"It ain't 'bout our fambly in name, but it is 'bout people from Oklahoma, people like us.

It is excellent through and through. I know this is a book that is commonly read in high school. Since I did not read when I was young I deprived my self of some great reading. The begining I thought was slow, until the story hits the road, then I start to really feel their plight. My father had worked in real life in a apple cannery in California for a short time, he always said the \\"Okies\\" were some of the nicest most generous people you would ever want to meet. It is certainly ironic to read a book about oppression and discrimination by white people and to see that it is the same race of people who treat them as animals. That tells me that racism is much deeper than the color of your skin. If everybody read this, perhaps people would be more tolerent and compasionate, I know this is how the book made me feel. The end is tragic but so were the lives of many of these real Americans who were displaced by the Dustbowl."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The story unfolded with a vivid depiction of the state of Oklahoma land. Weather was scorchingly hot and dry, land was parched and harvests were unsatisfactory. To the Joad family, their livelihood, well-being, families, and happiness - in short, their everything - all hinge on the cultivation of that piece of land. However, they were forced to move west in search of money and food when their land was taken over by the bank, symbolized by the tractor. The early chapters of the book hence gave a poignant portrayal of the encroachment of capitalism on a largely agrarian society and the resulting clash between workers and owners of the land. As the families moved westwards they encountered various problems, such as lack of food, low wages, floods, torrential rains and unreasonable policeman. Yet they did not give up.John Steinbeck ended the story with finesse (I shan't elaborate on this here, lest it spoils your reading experience), further reaffirming the central message of the book - the triumph of human dignity, determination and perseverance. The story did not end with the Joad family making big money, transforming themselves from rags to riches. The writer chose to end it in a more subtle way, leaving room for readers to imagine. \`Grapes of Wrath' also paid tribute to motherhood, as Tom Joad's mother rose to become the figure of authority in the family, giving support and charting the direction forward for the family in the later part of the book.I like the way John Steinbeck incorporated detached, short and sweet third person narratives into the story, giving it a fuller and more complete touch. I also fancy the dialogues, and the interplay between the imagery of the environment/weather and the development of the storyline. In all, I enjoyed reading \`grapes of wrath'. A very apt metaphoric title indeed, for anger was brewing in the hearts and minds of the migrant family who helped pick the grapes that were in abundance in the orchards, but yet did not get to eat them.P/s: Frankly, if not for the American names, dialogues, and locations, I would have thought that the story could have also happened in Communist China in the early 1900s. Is the writer trying to mock at capitalism gone wrong? Do segments of the story not sound like a reversal of the American ideals of freedom, liberty and equality? A reflection of the state of American society after the great depression??"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"Wow, This book is boring\\"--Thats what I was like after reading this book for 1 hour (I only got 17 pages read). The beginning of this book isn't that great, but trust me, it becomes more interesting and you start to get pulled into the book. Steinbeck does a good job of holding the readers attention after like the first 50 pages of the book. You learn history, and you get a great novel ALL IN ONE! People, I urge you to read this book, do not be afraid of the first 50 pages (they will lead you to the good part).

His books are part o my collection and very good biblical author. He I a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Sacred Records: Perspectives on the Records That Have Shaped Sports History","review":"This is a neat concept for a book about sports records--instead of a stat-heavy treatment or a lightweight picture book, this book covers 12 of the most famous sports records of all time and solicits two essays on each, usually from different points of view.So, for example, in the chapter on UCLA's record 88-game basketball winning streak, there are essays from Bill Walton (a major part of that streak as a player) and &quot;The Heir's View&quot; from Kent Benson, who played on the 32-0 Indiana team of 1976 (the last men's team to go unbeaten). For the chapter on Byron Nelson's 11 consecutive PGA tour victories, there are essays by Tom Watson (who knew Nelson) and a PGA contemporary of Nelson's. Nolan Ryan's career strikeouts record is reflected on by a broadcaster and by Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller. Mark McGwire writes (dictates?) one on his own 1998 home run record...and on and on.The reason why I downgrade it to 3 stars is that not everybody is a good writer or very articulate. Some are ridiculous, as with umpire Steve Palermo, who was particularly useless in commenting on Cal Ripken's streak. Palermo tries to claim that, when you think about it, the umpires are tougher than Ripken (&quot;Umpires are out there all nine innings...players only played four-and-a-half innings.&quot; Sure, pal.) But overall, a neat concept, relatively well pulled off."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Peart here finally proves he can write prose as well as he can lyricsfor his band. I am only surprised he didn't try his hand at it a long timeago.Ironically though, for fans of Rush, there is nothing in this book thatwill have any obvious appeal to them at all. Peart stays clearof the subject of music throughout the entire book, probably deliberately,insofar as the whole adventure was of course partly a means of escapinghis high profile musical career and exploring another side of life.In fact I almost felt sorry for him in the one case where he didhave to face the ubiquitous problem of people fawningover him for his fame. I can see where the appeal of bike ridingcomes in -- it is a chance for him to escape the pressures oflife as a famous musician.But one ofthe questions I was left with after reading this book was why anyonewould wish upon himself such a harrowing experience, in a country ofsuch unfriendly geographical and social environs. When I picturean ideal bicycle-riding trip I envision something along the lines of theSwissAlps, or some place where one can at leastenjoy the scenery, culture and food, in case the biking isn't stellar.Well apparently that isn't the point. The hellish challenges Peartput himself through were exhausting to read. Enough toconvince me of one country I know I will never want tovisit (whether on bicycle or anything): Cameroon. What I found distastefulabout his writingwas Peart's penchant for taking ANY chance, no matterhow irrelevant, to ridicule the Christian (particularly Catholic)faith. His potshots at the Holy Father as well, were self-serving andinsulting to a believer.

Lawrence's &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot;. Peart writes with the same kind of fearless honesty. This book is NOT politically correct. Then author faces issues between men and women, old and young, primitive and cultured. He meets them head on without prejudice or apology. He examines himself as ruthlessly as he does everything else and when he tires, settles down to study Aristotle or Vincent Van Gogh. Some of us march to the beat of a different drummer, Peart beats his own drum. Like his lyrics this book will leave you wanting more."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart brings West Africa to life. At times I felt as if I was along for the ride. I expected more pictures but quickly realized that with Peart's writing skills and the amazing detail in which he wrote, there was no reason to have pictures. His descriptions of some of the villages they visited, the conditions in which they slept, the roads (if you could call them that) on which they travelled, the food they ate, the people they encountered and the hardships they endured, were brutally honest and made me feel as if I was experiencing them myself. Some of Peart's descriptions of his bike accidents brought laughter from me as well. As a rider myself, I could relate to some of the problems he experienced (although I have never ridden anywhere that would compare to his trip). Peart laid everything out, from his frustrations with the other riders in the group (and their frustrations with him) to the dysentery he experienced. It is obvious that he has great respect for the people and places they visited. It amazed me that someone as successful and wealthy as he is, world take such a journey. It only added to my respect for him as a lyricist.I would definitely recommend it for a fan of Rush, a cyclist or anyone who enjoys reading about other countries (I wonder if Elsa has read it). Well done, Neil."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Imagine breaking the stereotypes of the image of rock musicians being drug-addicting-sex-crazed who can't see beyond their own stage?

He has a way of describing things and events in a way that makes you feel as if you are there. He is very honest about his feelings which adds a great deal to the book. His story telling abilities approach the expertise of Jeffery Archer and his intellect is surpassed by few. Immense insight is what makes Neil such a prolific Lyricist and writer.

The action centers around a cycling trip Peart and a small band of Westerners took through Cameroon in 1988. We are given all the gritty details as our heroes endure odd (yet consistent) cuisine, spartan accommodations, forgotten roads, and a new but disturbingly familliar sort of racism. Peart's observations range from the droll to the profound as he weaves his way through the heart of Africa at &quot;people speed.&quot; An enlightening read, even for those who have no vested interest in cycling OR Africa."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa is a must read. It is a history lesson, a social commentary, a comedy, drama, and documentary all in one. Neil Peart, drummer and lyricist for Rush, shows that he can truly captivate and charm his reader with prose as well as poetry.We follow Neil on his journey across west Africa, on bicycle, with a group of other cyclists. There are many roadside curiosities, children yelling as he passed, various colorful vehicles, and the drunk guard with a gun. Neil's vivid descriptions of the countryside make you feel as if you were there. I can still visually recall many moments from this book.I enjoyed the Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa.

Peart has such a wonderful outlook on living. I have even underlined passages and marked meaningful pages. What an amazing book."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Though I was born and raised a Rush fan, as an adult I really don't enjoy Neil Peart's lyrics anymore because I find them to be too preachy and didactic. But Neil's prose writing displays a much broader range of the talents of the lyric writer/drummer/amateur philosopher than seen in Rush. This book is as light-hearted as his lyrics aren't- his dry sense of humor can be hilarious (\\"I wouldn't have thought missionaries chose their missions according to climatic comfort, but I did notice that low-lying swampy villages had been deemed less in need of \`saving' than where the pleasant highland locations.\\"). And though this is too much \\"tell\\" vs. \\"show\\" to make this the Great Canadian Novel, there are flashes of brilliance (\\"... you could sometimes say reason is a luxury everywhere in the world. It works fine as long as life is reasonable, but where guns, poverty, and drought start pushing people around, they often retire into faith.\\").Though Peart opens the book claiming that \\"one travels to East Africa for the animals and to West Africa for the people,\\" his glimpse of West African culture is as cursory as his bike tour- he never really stays anywhere long enough to get to know West African people. But this is a tremendously open and honest book, and you feel as if you are traveling on the tour with Peart. At times in the book he can be maddeningly judgmental of his traveling companions, at one point criticizing a 60-year olds' slowness on the bike as being a weakness of character. But then he turns the microscope on himself (\\"at my worst I know I have sometimes been mean-spirited, self-centered, and intolerant\\").Overall, I would strongly recommend this book as a travel guide to Cameroon or as a way to get to know about Peart as the person."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"The book was a complete personal account of the hardships of West African cultures and the interaction of himself and his co-travelers.You'll feel a little better about yourself after reading this book."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I heard Neil say in an interview many years ago that he was going to write a book someday, eight years later I was excited to finally find this book.

If your not a cyclist you might not find this book is for you."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Of course, I am a Rush fan, as is the case with most of this book's readers. However, I have been very careful in determining the source of my enthusiasm for this book. I could easily argue/defend that the book's merit stands on its own. My original concern when I read all of the &quot;rave&quot; reviews, was that Rush fans (including I) would bias our reviews because of Rush loyalty. I can assure you that this is not the case. This is a wonderful book that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes a well written and entertaining book. My wife and I are reading it together. We continue to laugh out loud and enjoy his articulate observations and experiences. By the way, my wife- although she likes Rush, is not the Rush Loyalist that I am. She is an opera singer and an avid reader of the classic genre. I gave it five stars without hesitation."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As a longtime Rush fan, musician, writer, traveler and fledgling cyclist, I was interested in reading Neal Peart's first published novel. The transition from lyricist to prose writer can be difficult, but Peart does an excellent job. Before reading the book, I already had respect for the man, a rock and roll drummer, for going on a cycling tour in eastern Africa. I would respect anyone for undertaking such a trip, and after reading the book, I respect him even more.Peart's language is conversational throughout most of the book, as if he's relating the events over a drink at a pub. Many of his insights probed much deeper when he explored the culture of the people of Africa in general and Cameroon in particular, offering comparisons to a previous journey he had made to west Africa.We see the landscape through the writer's eyes as he cycles up hills and navigates dirt roads, rocks, gun-toting guards at checkpoints and the sometimes rewarding vantage points. Each village or stopping point is described and I felt as if I was part of the journey.In addition to the daily travels, we get Mr. Peart's reactions and thoughts to people that he encountered on his travels. He does not try to gloss over personalities with stereotypes, but tries to present things as they are. Yes, the country and continent has been exploited, but there is a strong victim mentality and Peart points out that Africans themselves participated in the slave trade. All the problems of Africa did not originate from outside the country.Yet there are also great moments of kindness experienced. The woman who says \\"you are welcome,\\" the smiles from young children, or the family sharing its simple food with their guests. I found the visits to the various missions particularly interesting, and the affect upon the writer of the nuns singing vespers is moving.Mr. Peart also writes about his relationships with the other four members of his group. David is their guide from Seattle, struggling to keep a good face while helping the slowest member of the group. Elsa, a sixty-year old woman with facile new age sensibilities and a sour disposition, is the cancer of the group, constantly falling behind and complaining about everything. Leonard is the stalwart Viet Nam veteran who remains an anchor throughout the book. Annie is a twenty-something needy type who has a \\"good heart\\" but is not very thoughtful or considerate.There were several clashes amongst these personalities, and I appreciated Mr. Peart's knowledge of his own shortcomings and self-analysis. I would have liked to have seen a little more reaction of the other's toward him, but that is sometimes hard to capture or catalog unless one has a confidante within a group. The author did not have this, and the book ends with some loose ends among the different riders, or maybe they were just ready to get away from each other.Perhaps the most powerful thing about the book is the strong emotional arc experienced by the author, probably unexpected when he set out on his journey. He begins with idealism intact, but after bouts of dysentary, an encounter with a drunken soldier armed with a gun, and an offical that tries to make off with his (and David's) passport, he truly undergoes some changes. There is a shift in attitude, but also a new appreciation of things taken for granted in developed countries. By the penultimate chapter, I felt just as tired and sweaty, bruised and bloody, bitten and beaten and just plain exhausted as the writer. The final chapter, his arrival in Paris to see his wife and get back to civilization, strikes quite a contract with his previous experience.If I had to make a criticism, it would be that some parts were kind of soap box preachy, although I tended to agree with many of his views.I'm looking forward to reading his next book, \\"Ghost Rider.\\""},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I've never read a travelogue before, and doubt I will again. Nevertheless, I had to buy Neil Peart's book, since it was Neil Peart, after all.What makes this a good read is not the &quot;story&quot; itself; the events are mundane despite being transplanted to Africa. The characters involved are interesting, but not fascinating. Rather, it is Peart's style and his unique perspective that bring the same value to this work that his lyrics bring to Rush's music.I attest that you could take Neil Peart and sit him down in a Barber shop for six hours, tell him to write it up, and you would have a fascinating new book to sell.There are a couple of standout moments, however. I agree with other reviewers that his description of meeting his wife in Paris is moving, and he conveys the emotional weight of the moment (even a priori if you don't know much about his recent tragedies). The whole scene reminds me of John Barth's TKTTTITT (which I won't spoil for you - go read The Tidewater Tales!). The genius in Peart is that he conveys, with a fairly minor story of taking a bike ride in Africa, the deep-seated impact of experience-as-reward, the point-of-the-journey-is-the-journey, and simultaneously validates Victor Hugo's statement &quot;the answer of he who knows everything is the same as the answer of he who knows nothing: because.&quot;The second moment of impact that I will cite is his near-transcendance at the African convent. It saddens me to no end to reflect on this moment and on Peart's ultimate rejection.Overall, a satisfying book from an eloquent and prolific mind. A book with much more depth than you might at first realize."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am almost done with this book, but I'm very anxious to offer my opinion on it. The &quot;Masked Rider&quot; flows much like a long bike ride. Peart's finely crafted narrative has the quality of a personal diary. His honest depiction of the people of Africa and the members of his own small &quot;team&quot; of cyclists is admirable and, at times, humorous. Peart shares his thoughts on religion, philosophy, art, and humanity while pushing his bike up the nastiest of hot, dusty roads across Cameroon and other parts of western Africa. I can't say the book instills a strong desire to attempt such an arduous tour, but it does succeed in offering many memorable descriptions of African landscapes and people. Peart questions himself on a variety of moral issues, and these &quot;inner conversations&quot; make for some very absorbing reading. I'm sure I will revisit this book from time to time when I feel the need to travel down the road less traveled."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Like many other readers of this book, I too am a devoted fan of Rush, and of Neil Peart, whose tremendous skill on drums is matched by no one I've heard of. As the band's lyricist, he has written some of the most incredible, creative, beautiful, and powerful prose I have read. One might apply the term genius. I do not apply that term to Neil Peart, especially after reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to all Rush fans. I was amazed at the accomplishment of cycling through Cameroon and most impressed with his head-first approach. His description of the West African landscape is both beautiful and grotesque, painfully honest at times, and is an excellent travelogue. It is obvious from reading this book that he approaches other aspects of his life with the same intensity, focus, and excellence that he applies to his work with Rush. Ultimately, however, this is a book about Neil Peart, and not about bicycling, West Africa, politics, or philosophy. And it most definitely is not about interpersonal skills. Readers who are quick to apply &quot;genius&quot; to Neil Peart would do well to remember that there are multiple intelligences, among them interpersonal intellegence, and he is sadly lacking in people skills. At first, I thought the others in his tour were very lucky to be travelling with this great man, but after a few miles, I felt sorry for them! It is ironic that he recognizes (and appreciates!) the kind words and support offered by some of the strangers met along the way, but he cannot even conjure simple respect for most of the other tour members. I found that irony distracting. The reader is (understandably) getting a slanted view of Neil Peart's trip through Cameroon, and for that reason I would have a dificult time recommending it to someone who doesn't know who he is."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book is the best &quot;travel book&quot; I have ever read. It is true reading joy to live vicariously through Mr. Peart's adventures while bicycling through Africa. He is a brilliant observer of human behavior, personal interactions and cultural differences. Combine this skill with his obvious mastery of prose and you end up with the unforgettable experience of reading, &quot;The Masked Rider.&quot; Regardless of whether you are a Rush fan you will undoubtedly enjoy this book if you like great writing and the sense of &quot;being there&quot; as the story unfolds. Critics of Rush often point out that Mr. Peart can sometimes be &quot;difficult&quot; or is lacking &quot;people skills.&quot; I have read several passages from Mr. Peart, on various Web pages, that summarize his take on such opinions: he never wanted to become famous, all he wanted was to play the drums the best he could and perfect his craft and style in percussion. He is a free-thinker, intelligent, articulate, creative and exceptionally talented as a drummer/percussionist and a writer. He doesn't try to be everybody's best friend nor does he bend to expected modes of behavior in certain situations. He is his own man. Read this book and you will gain keen insight into a remarkable person. And bicycle through Cameroon along the way!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Excellent. If you like travel-log type books, be sure to pick this up. However, let us not pretend that Neil Peart just &quot;happens&quot; to be the author - he is why 90% of us will read it. But I warn my fellow Peart fans: This is not a book about being a rock star in Africa, nor will you get any juicy inside information on Neil's private life (at least not much). Nowhere in the book does he mention Geddy or Alex (directly). I beleive he mentions &quot;being on tour&quot; maybe once. This book is much more powerful than a gathering of rock-n-roll factoids. If you want to read about Rush, pick up your tour books. If you want to know about Neil's private life... here's all the book has to offer -- He likes chocalate, he likes cars, he likes smoking but doesn't smoke, he likes rice with junk on it, he'll drink warm orange soda if he has to, he enjoys the sight of smiling kids, he likes booze. If you want cheezy Peart trivia, skip this book. If you want to glimpse into Neil's head, buy it."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I picked it up... and was resentful evreytime I had to put it down to work or sleep or eat. I couldn't read it fast enough. Right from the beginning I was caught up in the story of Neil's journey through Cameroon in West Africa. His writing makes the journey come alive. I felt as if I were there with him experiencing personally all the ups and downs, the joys and difficulties of his month-long trek by bicycle.What was more impressive, was the depth of insight I received about my favorite drummer in my favorite band. I can see more clearly where so many of his themes come from. I was deeply touched by his feelings for his wife and daughter whom he recently lost under such sad circumstances.It has always been hard as a fan to feel &quot;close&quot; to any members of the band. I certainly respect their rights to privacy and I dont' feel they owe me anything. I am grateful for the joy that their work brings me. At the same time, to read this book made me feel closer to Neil Peart, the guy. Yeah, he's the drummer for Rush. But he's a guy that likes to have a few drinks, who loves his family, who likes to travel and meet people. He has come more alive to me through his writing.I was very impressed by the journey, the detail, and the passion that Neil puts into his work. Reading this book now gives me new and greater insight to the vast collection of lyrics. I will read them and listen to the songs with a new eye and ear. I happily recommend this book to all Rush fans as a wonderful reading experience and a way to feel closer to the heart of the greatest drummer of the greatest band ever, Neil Peart of Rush!."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Being a rush fan and having pondered over every line of each song he writes, I was so tuned to the way neil thinks that reading his book was almost like reading a piece of my own writing. And as a book in itself : the choice of words are beautiful and a very plesant read for those who don't know the way Neil thinks. You can feel that neil has enjoyed the liberty to express his thoughts in more words than he can usually allow himself, and words that don't essentially have to rhyme or fit into to a song. Coming at a time when he has changed over from his hectic drumming style to a more comfortable and easy style, this book in a way brings out to the reader the change in his perception. Instead of the prototypical neil's choice of few fitting words this book is a beautiful contuinity of thoughts. I know there are many a bunch of restless youngsters who were motivated by Neil's words to think rational, work harder and stay focussed. To all of those this book is the best possible gift. Get naked and party !"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I stumbled onto this book and had no idea about Peart's books or other job/personla history. Immediately I noticed that he has a great writing stlye, very much like the way any cyclinst ponders life as they slug away on the cranks weherever their travels find them.I was a bit surprised at the focus of the personalities of the group, I expected more on Africa itself, but I can't say it was a totally unpleasant turn.Great book, definately didn't convince me to pack up my roadbike and spend a month in africa though, but reading the book was a good trip.The presentation and layout was really impressive, the book was a pleasure to go through, hard to put down really. Peart's style is pretty great, I'll check out another one some time I bet.So if you dig on cycling trips, and stories check it out, or if you're a super nuts Rush fan, you might dig it."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Yes, I bought 'The Masked Rider' primarily because I'm a huge Rush fan, and truthfully, no, I wouldn't have bought it had I not heard of Rush nor known what a great lyricist and writer Neil is. For me, though, my love of Rush as well as biking made my interest in this book two-fold, and thus it proved to be one of the best journal-style works I've ever read. Neil's frankness, honesty, and yes, even humour, exposed a new facet of him that I had yet to see. The books flows quite well, as it's his recorded journal of his voyage thru west and central Africa. I was fascinated by some of the mental images he was able to paint of the African landscape, and his interest in the land its people peaked my own. If you get this book and like it, and you have yet to buy a Rush CD, don't hesitate to do so. His writing style shines in both his prose and lyrics, and I have no doubt you'll get hooked on it just like I have. Oh yeah, and his drumming is the best you'll ever hear, hands down, in case you haven't heard!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book, masterfully written, lets you see inside Neil's mind. For me, it gave me real understanding of just how intensely he feels things and how intelligent he really is. Clearly he is well-read as well as observant and insightful. Now I see how he is able to write such brilliant song lyrics. I must admit, though, that at the point when he mentioned how he looked forward to seeing his then-ten-year-old daughter Selena, I had tears in my eyes (knowing that both she and her mother have passed away). This is a great read even if you aren't familiar with or particularly fond of Rush, but if you are, it will mean even more to you."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart has shone in his ability to tactfully describe his experiences of his 1988 bike tour in Cameroon. It took me about 4 times (to read) to catch all the nuances he described; from fear to anger to disgust and self-description. That and the synergistic perspectives he also had on the other riders Leonard, Annie, Elsa and leader David. So descriptive, one can feel as if they were on the tour with him!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Up until about 6 months ago, I never really read many books. But I have always been a big Rush fan. This is easily the best book I have ever read; even if you aren't a big Rush fan."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Rare is it when I read a book and feel as though I was on the journey with the author. Peart is able to pull you out of your daily routine and take you across the world on a fascinating bike ride through Africa. He was able to explain the trip in great detail and shares his feelings and thoughts in a way that you think you are his companion, not just an outsider reading a tale of a trip. I was hesitant to first read it, as other books look at the journey as a trip from point A to point B, however Peart is able to give great insight on the people he encounters and the trials of a bike ride through an unfamiliar land. I found his story uplifting and unique, making me wish I had the time to take a &quot;vacation&quot; from myself, or the masks I wear, by bicycling in a far away place. He also makes a reference to the book &quot;Dear Theo&quot;, which is another great read on the life of Vincent VanGough. This is a book I'm looking forward to reading again, or anytime I need an escape from the grind of life."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart's work shows us that a person's journey shouldn't be marked by how many airports you went to or how many souveniers you purchased. Rather, the mark of a true journey is what you gained as an individual. Peart shows us that a truly great journey will allow an individual to learn as much about himself as the new places he encounters. If you traditionally love to explore but suddenly feel lost within, please read this book. Please."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As a person who has been to a few countries in Africa, including some mentioned in this book, I found it to be hard-to-put-down-the-book reading. This book is one man's view of a bicycle tour, non-fiction, with no other opinions of events being discussed. But it does not pretend to be anything else. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in world bicycle, or non motorized travel in general. My jealousy was intensified when I realized my world travel has been so restricted by airports, highways, etc. that I haven't really been to these countries, or most of the 37 countries that I have been to in my 29 years. Although my interest was initially sparked by the fact that I am a fan of the band Rush and Mr. Peart's lyrics, I soon forgot that and was immersed in the book. Great reading."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have had the distinct pleasure and pain of taking the same bicycle tour as Neil. I read his book after I completed my tour for no reason other than to observe someone else's interpretation of the events. I was amazed to find his experiences almost identical to mine in every aspect from the makeup of the group to the gut-wrenching pain of the night. I was even more amazed by Neil's ability to recall and so eloquently illustrate the details of his journey. My journals lack by comparison. While reading this book, I felt as though I were a member of his tour group. I think anyone with imagination can.....that is the mark of a brilliant author."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This is a well written book that details the sights, sounds, smells, and attitudes of a contradictory modern and primative West African state. The striking contrasts between the &quot;hellish&quot; introduction to the journey and &quot;heavenly&quot; ending resound throughout the book in both the people he meets and the places he sees. It sounds like a ride I would like to take literally, and in reading this book I believe it is symbolic of a journey we all make. Read it. A recommended academic read for African Studies or literature in the same vein as Hemmingway."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil relates with character each encounter with the people and places in Africa. The people are alive, the food is awful, and each sweltering day during his tour can be felt in the pages."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart is intelligent, perceptive, and his story is at once with much insight into human nature (especially Elsa &amp; Annie), particularly if you don't mind taking on a few roadblocks and unexpected detours along the way. A startling portrait of West Africa and the nature of it's people. My mouth got sore from smiling.However, this story is from 1988 and Neil is passing through a somewhat confused period today. Within the pages of the masked rider specifically, pages #183 and #280 Neil demonstrated that a man could realize the highest good of which human life is capable: Love. Love for Jackie, and Selena!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Suffice it to say that a fan of an author tends to be prejudice, but coming from a person who rarely enjoys reading books about documentaries, I find this book quite fascinating and at times humorous. To be truly honest with the potential reader of said book, regardless if you are or are not a fan of Rush, this book transcends the barriers of your typical image of a rock musician and delves into the mind of the lyricist Neil Peart. His booksimplistic and at the same time complexweaves the the struggles of riding under the sun's fury as his fellow riders share the pains of men with guns, sickly starving people, eating a morsel that may not agree with you to the brisk freedom of riding the rugged as well as challenging roads of Africa. It also showsthough in wordsthat Africa is not a vast plains of nothingness like the Sahara Desert or monkeys swing through trees like a Tarzan movie, but well diverse race of people who to my stereotypes are French-speaking-soda-drinking-folks of a rich culture. Peart's story allows you to see him ride the roads of West Africa and feel the sweat, pain, stomach-churning,fear, excitement, pleasures, happiness, as well as an insight of his beliefs on religion thus eliminating the ever-so-popular quote &quot;I-thought-I-knew-Neil-because-I-am-his-number-one-fan.&quot; This book the masked Rider is a lesson of humility; realizing there is more to the man as well as the band than I thought. Also, check out the band's music. If there is a prerequisite to this book, buy their C.D. Why you may ask? To understand what Peart is saying in his book, the C.D. is the best source of this man's insight"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil writes this book with the same passion for motion as the feel of a great Rush song. The book is a quick read and the reader's only disappointment is when it's over. Even people who don't listen to Rush will be very pleased. His style is his own but, you can sense all of the literary greats he has absorbed and is mirroring now ie; Rand, Hemingway, Tolkien, etc. I can't ever wait for a new Rush album and I feel the same about the next Peart book. His next book is about touring with Rush. Looking forward to it Neil."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Great travel writing imitates the journey described. Neil Peart's prose follows his legs as they pedal up or coast along in the humid country he experiences. Its pacing is the narrative analogue of perfect pitch, crafting the illusion of being along for the ride. Once seated in this priveleged position, the reader begins feel the winds of the author's creative process: singing phrases putting kilometres behind him, deconstructing the background pulse of West Aftrican music, hoping to experience the transcendental.This book is peer to Redmond O'Hanlon's &quot;Into the Heart of Borneo&quot; or Heinrich Harrer's &quot;Seven Years in Tibet.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As is denoted by the title, masks play a central theme through this work. Seeing through a mask can be as difficult as seeing behind one, as Peart says, and this refreshing admittance of his personal bias is just one of the delightful and thoughtful themes. Treating Africa and it's inhabitants with respect, the volume does not sugar-coat the tribulations experienced, but rather lays them bare, sometimes brutal, sometimes uproariously funny, sometimes touching, even bizarre. And with Aristotle and Van Gogh along for the ride, the reader is presented with a depth of experience rarely enjoyed in travel writing. Well done, Neil! Now, we gotta do something about Elsa..."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart's first official published work is on par with his demonstrated writing talent with the Canadian rock band Rush. I had high expectations of this book, in fact, I bought the book at a Rush concert on their Test For Echo tour. I read the first chapter or two while waiting for the band to come on stage. I couldn't wait to get home to finish the book! Peart takes his readers along for the ride as he vividly details his African biking experience. You experience Africa just as if you were a passive observer on a bike of your own! I felt exhausted at times even though I had not broken a sweat. His command of language and story telling far exceeds many authors I have read in the past. Though I enjoyed this book cover to cover, I must say that I was disappointed in the end. I felt betrayed becuase so many story lines were left unresolved. Did members of the tour simply part ways without emotion or repentance for their actions during the more difficult parts of the tour? I realize Neil's departure at the airport was one of desperation and necessity, but I still felt as if something was missing. However, I did like the way he discovered a new found appreciation for our culture and civilization, when in Paris he claimed he bought things, anything, just because he could. He was glad to once again lead a meaningful existence. If you are a fan of Neil Peart or Rush and their music, then this book is perfect. Otherwise non-Rush fans may labor through the book without a psuedo-emotional attachment to its narrator. I am looking forward to Neil's next book as well as the next Rush release."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"The Book &quot;The Masked Rider,&quot; by NeilPeart was the best book that I have everread. Neil was the drummer for Rush,one of the best bands ever, and he wasalso the lyrisist. He once again impressesme with his awesome concepts and useof words. I recomend it to anyone who islooking for a good book, if you respect atrue artist. Erin Maloney"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"From cover to cover, Neil Peart takes the reader, not only through the West African land, but to its people as well. Throughout the book, I felt as if I was along for the ride with him as he observes and explains his feelings and attitudes on the people he meets as well as the ones who are traveling with him. As a Rush fan, I knew Neil was a great lyricist and was confident that his first book would be enjoyable. He did not dissapoint!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I simply could not put this book down. I recommended this book to anyone. I for one am very familar with RUSH and Niel's ingenious works on drums and very well knew, it was about it. After reading this great book i felt like i was with Neil the whole way. I give it an obvious 10 and wish you'd all read this book . One day soon Neil should write a book about his life with RUSH. P.S. I hope that Neil can have the strengh and to try to move on peacefully after the tragedy of his dughter who I deeply fell sorry for."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart makes you feel like you are with him on the trip. His expertise use of the English language makes the reading more like a real experience that has happened to you."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"And Neil is an excellent author! This travel log of his bicycle trip in west Africa is hard to put down. Don't look for talk of the band, Rush (he mentions Rush once),fellow band members Geddy Lee or Alex Lifeson, or drumming (well, just a little bit). Instead, if you are interested in Africa, long distance bicycle trips or well written travel logs, then you can't go wrong with this one. This man is a genius (as his musical work shows) so his perspectives during this trip are very thought provoking. And, if you are *just* a fan of Rush, get the book anyway to learn more about how &quot;Pratt&quot; thinks. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Being a Rush fan, there is always an interest in anything related to Rush.Being a drummer, there's always an interest in Neil Peart.The book is essentially a travel book. Neil narrates his experiences from a month long cycling trip he tookin Western Africa in 1988. Neil does a great job describing his journeys and the difficulties one endures cycling in the hot African sun. From the dynamics of his relationships with his fellow cyclists, to the discovery and harsh realities of African culture. Neil paints a real nice picture of what it's like to cycle through Africa. It's definitely worth reading, and I highly recommend it. Not only do you learn about Africa, you learn a lot about Neil."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Fun read even for non-followers of RUSH. It takes a lot of courage to go biking in West Africa. So this is a good read on an adventure that only a small fraction of Westerners would ever do."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"i could not put the book down once i started reading! neil is a fantastic and intelligent writer. the book is very detailed and makes you feel as if you are actually in africa with him. so much so that i will never travel to africa for a vacation. a must for any rush fan."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book is just amazing ! From the very beginning, Neil Peart takes you into a fantastic journey through the marvelous yet hot and dusty scenarios of West Africa. Besides, the book helps you to see Neil as a plain, simple human being, tortured by the heat and thirsty as anyone of us, tormented by the pains of dysentery and clouds of mosquitoes. Although all the above, plus the sometimes-not-so-friendly encounters with Cameroonian military forces, Neil gathers all his passion about bicycling and love for Africa to pedal ahead and finish his journey happily in one piece. Being myself a Rush fan, drummer and bicycle enthusiast, I couldn't resist to buy this book, and I found out not only that Neil and I have lots on things in common, but also, that he turned out to be a great writer. This one certainly worths the money. My advice: if you like Rush and cycling, buy this book. There's a lot in it to enjoy, and it will also help you to understand the mind and thoughts of one of the greatest rock music's drummers of our time."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Like so many of the people who have reviewed this book, I was also every impressed. I found the book to be thought provoking, entertaining and honest. From the very beginning I found myself caught-up in the journey and had difficulty setting the book down. The book reads as a journal of Neil's private thoughts and also provides history about the various places in West Africa. I found his writing style to be direct, logical, easy to follow and very descriptive.Finally, I would like to add that after I read this book, I was inspired to buy a bike of my own. This book really got me interested in cycling and I've really gotten into the sport. I feel this book is a must read for any serious cyclist."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"When I first read the book I noticed how well written it is, and how entertaining, I have to admit that at times I felt like sweating too or feeling the bumpy road beneath my feet. But lets face it Africa is not a safe a place and much less to make a bike trip either in jungle or desert. That only happens in Hollywood, I think Mr peart had a 4x4 truck and the bike was on top of it and sometimes when safe brought the bike down, rode a little bit and took the pics."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"One need not be a Rush fan to find this to be a wonderful work. Anyone with an intrest in cycling, travel, Africa, or merely thinking, will enjoy reading of our group of five travelling through Africa. The writing is clear, and immense with detail, as the detail serves to lend to the story of a very difficult journey. The book is capativiating and difficult to put down. A must read for any modern day thinker or adventurer."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Once again, Neil gives us a gift through words. Through his senses, you are taken to ecstatic high's and cavernous low's as he makes his journey over the terrain of Cameroon. Catch a glimpse of the genius that is Neil. For those of you who are Rush fans, listen to Presto after reading the book. You will be listening to the lyrics in a whole new light."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"What can one say? The complexity and depth to this man is as intricate and immeasurable as the Quantum Theorem itself. The book may explore Africa sur velo but the read itself explores a far more elaborate world, Peart's mind. The Masked Rider is a fantastic read, layered with adventure, philosophy, history, music and literature. As a long time Rush fan and a Peart fanatic, I found this book to be a delightful read. Who but Peart can conjure up the following quote:&quot;I can worship Nature, and that fulfills my need for miracles and beauty. Art gives a spiritual depth to existence - I can find worlds bigger and deeper than my own in music, paintings, and books. From my friends and family I receive the highest benediction, emotional contact and personal affirmations. I can bow before the works of Man, from buildings to babies, and that fulfills my need for wonder. I can believe in the sanctity of Life, and that becomes the Revealed Word, to live my life as I believe it should be, not as Iam told to by self-appointed guides........For this is the only system which permits the ONE instinctive first cause: your own existence.&quot; (Masked Rider, p.108)To Neil Peart &quot;Who brought me up to know better...&quot;"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am on my second reading of &quot;The Masked Rider&quot; since my first in 1997, after purchasing the book at a RUSH concert. Certainly influenced by my love for the band he is drummer and lyricist for, I find this journey of his (and the others mentioned) to be so simple, yet so seemingly perfect. Easy to follow, yet adventurous and entertaining and soulfully warm and enlightening. I admire his courage to survive the &quot;hell hole.&quot; It's also wonderful to get to know a little about the &quot;man&quot; who is Neil Peart, rock band legend aside. He is an inspiration to write my own books which I have and continue to do. I love his work and look forward to more. Sincerely, John Haug (aka Anonymous, 2112)."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil's book was a pleasurable ride through and impossible lasndscape. His narrative nature certainly comes through with great detail around every corner. His humanist views are razors that slash into the current defeatest mentality so very present and I found them inspiring and motivating. The portions along the trail tend either to be gripping and poignant or later, tired and redundant as Neil wraps up the journey in Chad. Otherwise a delightful romp that I have passed on several times already!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Not only is Neil Peart a gifted drummer and lyricst, but a very well-read writer as well. From cover to cover, I could not put this book down. His attention to detail is remarkable but not cumbersome. It is a gripping adventure that will give you some insight into the percussional genius that has given Rush their unique and virtuosic sound that has influcenced so many bands."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil has the penchant for writing thoughtful,graceful, and with great depth and humor as he treks through the rugged terrain of West Africa. Between the heat, steep hills, natures indelicate calls, and rice with junk in it- he takes us there. Get on your bikes and read."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I first read The Masked Rider on the plane that took me to South Korea, where I was going to live, working as a university professor. Neil's book warned me about Eastern-style toilets, locals staring, and children shouting -- though instead of \\"white man\\" it was \\"American\\".Now, after re-reading it 8 years later, I find that The Masked Rider is just as fun the second time around. Neil is starkly honest in his observations -- about his fellow riders, his experience with the locals (and their prejudices and politics), and himself. His descriptions wander from day-to-day grind to vivid scenic descriptions that create a picture in the mind's eye. His style is conversational, and his \\"voice\\" as a writer comes through loud and clear.I highly recommend this book to those who have wandered the world and enjoy getting another's take on travels, or those who are interested in taking a glimpse into West Africa... seasoned with philosophical musings of the Professor."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart's first book, The Masked Rider, gives life to the full reality of travelling on two wheels. These pages relate the immediacy and intimacy of a rider exposed to the elements and the open country. The country here is Cameroon, which offers a challenging and different landcape for the Canadian author, who writes that he returned to the continent of Africa a second time for the people. This is his story of that cross-country, cross-cultural, exchange.Peart is objective in his writing. The description of the landscape and of his feeling(s) for the people he encounters is clear and compelling. Sometimes the experience is not pleasant, and Peart is not afraid, for example, to address the racism, reversed, he feels as a displaced western caucasian. His honest interest and empathy for Africa is vividly apparent, however. He has placed a spotlight on one corner of the dark continent and made it shine. When Peart, reunited with his wife in Paris, France, leaves the reader, one feels the physical and emotional effort was well worth the time."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"When ever the question was asked wich &quot;celebrity&quot; would you want to meet the answer came down to 4 people, Freddy Mercury, Peter Sellers, Frans Lanting (nature photographer) and Neil Peart. Two out of four will have to wait untill the next life.Reading Neil's book was as close as you can get to meeting a person in real life. Besides wanting to thank you for sharing your lyrics with the world and so inspiring me personally I would also like to thank you for sharing your inner thoughts during trying times. There was a lot of recognition in the mind travel you had to go through .People who are interested in reading about the power of the mind or just simply read about how one person managed to learn to live with tragedy without forgetting should read this book. I know this sounds like a &quot;heavy&quot; book but from page one Neil amazed me with the positive way of telling his tale."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I first thought that I may be biased, as I revere Neil as a God (the best drummer and musician that ever lived), but it turns out that his book is truly excellent!! I recommend this book to all non-Rush fans, and I guarantee that after they read it and learn what a complex, intelligent, and talented man Neil is, they will become Rush fans. And for all Rush fans that have yet to read it, what is wrong with you? True Rush fans will have already read it by now, so get your acts together!! :-)"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Forget Neil Peart the drummer - this is Neil the traveller and writer, and he's just as adept. This book isn't really about bicycling at all, though riders should enjoy that facet of the book. It really seems to be more about observing human thought and behavior and how perspective changes the way we see what it is we experience. This is one of the best books I've read in several years."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"It gives us a personal look into the life of Neil Peart and his views. I could not put it down. It has great detail on his journey and struggles. Gives us compassion for this far away land and respect for their lifestyles. I am going to get his other books. Great reading."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Even if you don't like the band Rush (who doesn't) it is very insightful of a man's bicycle journey both physical and mental. Extremely well written and easy to invision yourself in his worn out shoes. From airport to airport and all the warm soda you can drink, a real page turner."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This memoir of taking a month-long bicycle tour through Cameroon is as close as I'm ever likely to come to Cameroon or to taking a bike tour. But that doesn't mean I'm not interested in Cameroon: I just don't want to endure the hardships that the 5 riders endured. Namely I don't want to bunk down in the back of noisy bars, be bitten all night by mosquitoes, encounter drunken soldiers at military checkpoints, or subsist on sugary sodas and \\"rice with some kind of junk on it\\". Some aspects of his trip were also pleasant and fascinating, but you have to put up with the downside to get the upside. I'd rather read about it. His writing is sharp, observant, and never tedious. The description of the interpersonal dynamics between the 5 riders is clearly depicted too. It's the first book I've read by Neil Peart, and I've ordered another."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Such a talented man!I love that his writing style is like a journal recording his adventures and his unique and humorous viewpoints, comments, and opinions.He is such a private person it surprises me that he is so willing to expose his &#34;inner self&#34; to the general public. It provides us with an intimate window into the interior workings of his usually closely-guarded self and work--spaces that have generally been off-limits to those &#34;beyond the lighted stage.&#34;I enjoy everything he writes, this early effort is entertaining and amusing and leaves one certain that Africa is not the place to go for a vacation!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have never been out of the state's and have grown up neglecting so much, this I realize after reading this book. Ienjoyed the humorous situations and also the nervousness of each checkpoint. I felt I was the 6th person of this 5person bike tour. Excellent read and well written, I enjoyed this book very much. I have read far and away, ghost rider and now the masked rider, all excellent. Thanks Mr. Pratt for taking me on your journeys with you, your writing style made me feel as if I was right there with you. Where you going white man? Well, to their next Rush concert of course!!!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As a cyclist and a Rush fan, I absolutely love this adventure. This is well written book from the authors perspective. Great job!!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have read all the other Peart books, so decided to read his first book last. It gave it a different perspective, but I did enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This is a TERRIBLE travelogue -- it does nothing to illuminate the country he travels through (virtually no history, insight, or context) and he clearly (through repeated/endless passages) describes how he disliked his travelling companions and the trip itself. What possessed him to write about an experience he clearly didn't enjoy and gained no wisdom or perspective from? It was simply a water-bottle full of bile.I'm most thankful I've never had as unpleasant a travelling companion as the author and secondly thankful to be done with his book."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil's talent as a wordsmith shines clearly in this amazing account of a grueling trek through Cameroon, advertised as Bicycle Africa's toughest cycling tour. As I read this page-turner I found myself completely immersed in the journey. It seemed as though I could feel the grit of West African dust on my skin, the heat of sweltering nights in mosquito-infested hotel rooms, and the flavor of \\"rice with junk on it\\".His traveling companions are brought vividly to life, as well as the people he encounters along the road. I completely enjoyed every minute of it.More, please!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"One of the best books I have read in a very long time! If you love to travel, and/or to learn about other countries and people, this travelogue is both informative and entertaining. Neil Peart is an excellent writer, and you will feel like you were right there on the trip with him, for both the good and the bad! I am giving it as a gift to many people for their birthdays this year."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book is about Neil Peart's cycling adventure through Cameroon. While I think it will appeal to a wide variety of readers, those who've ever been to West Africa will certainly get a kick out of it. I found myself laughing and shaking my head while I remembered some of my own travels. Peart is a very descriptive writer so the sights and sounds of Cameroon really come to life. An excellent read - I was actually upset when I reached the last page."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart is not only one of the greatest drummer/percussionist/lyricist ever to exist but is also a great author. I couldn't put this book down until I finished the whole book..."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I bought this book way back on the Test For Echo tour. I openly admit I bought it first and foremost because it was a book that Neil wrote. He could have written a book about standing on a street corner whistling dixie tunes in the rain and I would have bought it, mainly because I am a fan of Rush and of Neil's lyric sense.However, I was only about 30 pages in when I realized that this is a very good piece of work from a man who can do more than simply turn a phrase with song lyrics.This book is more about Africa and it's culture differences than it is about the in's and out's of cycling. The way the book is presented, you actually feel like your riding along there with him, feeling the same joy when they find fresh water (or the many orange sodas they drink) as well as the horror of some of the living conditions of some of the places they pass through on what has been called the hardest bike tour Africa has to offer.I myself like to mountain bike ride, be it on trails or on paved roads. It's something I like to do. This book made me think I might want to try some sort of bike tour if I had the means. It also made me realize that if I did, it would not be in Africa on this same or similar tour. It had it's fair share of up's and down's.The human element is also quite interesting. From David (the tour guide) who is a lot like Peart in many ways that they sometimes clash a little, to Annie, who is good hearted but also thoughless at times without knowing it, to Leonard, who Neil seems to warm up to the most, and to Elsa, who if she didn't complain about something, she wouldn't know what to do with herself.I found the entire book to be quite a page turner. I especially liked the heated debate the 5 travellers get into at dinner at one of the towns they stopped in. Neil describes being &quot;shell shocked&quot; at some of the comments from the group who are clearly commenting without full reserch on the subjects they are commenting on. It does show that Neil does know a lot about world events and other cultures. His comment later in the book about a &quot;Bad Mood&quot; and how it is not to be shared (and why) was very interesting...and I believe totally true.Other reviewers have commented on how abrubtly the book ends, with no total resolution to the various events(among the group of 5) that preceeded it. I disagree, as Neil points out near the end that unlike other bike tours he has done, no one from this group was someone he considered a friend. Not that there was no respect there, but that it was over and let's all go our seperate ways. It seemed to me that there was no other way to end it other than the way it happened. Anything else might have seemed forced.The mention of wife Jackie and daughter Selena a few times seems bittersweet now, knowing the tragedy that has come to pass, but this is still a good read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I thought this book was absolutely wonderful! Although there is little mention of Neil's musical career,it is a wonderful look into the life and mind of Neil Peart. He reveals alot about himself,including some of his belief system (which I found especially fascinating)as well as some of his life experiences.Rush fans and non Rush fans alike could enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have long been a fan of Rush, following them closely since the early 1980's. The bands' complex arrangements and the incredibile drum work of Neil Peart are ever inspiring. But what has really made me a fan of the Canadian power trio, is their lyrics. Neil's lyrics, to be more precise; which is why I chose to read &quot;The Masked Rider.&quot; Written in the same descriptive style as their songs, Neil takes us along on a journey through some of the hottest, dangerous (and uphill) sections of western Africa. From his struggles with dysentary, to run-down &quot;hotels&quot; with no water, electricity or A.C., to dealing with unruly guards at border stops; Neil's undying optimism and positive outlook was refreshing. Some people hated cycling up 3 mile hills, but Neil didn't mind. For as he put it, &quot;When you get to the top, there's a view.&quot; - and then an adrenaline-filled descent down the other side! Don't look for much mention of &quot;Rush&quot; in this book. I think the fact he's a professional musician only surfaced 2 or three times. But it was not dwelled on, which was actually nice and somehow made this read all the more interesting. Neil seems to be very humble, and as the best drummer in the world, this still amazes me. Although I'm not an avid cyclist, I enjoyed this read because it wasn't only about &quot;cycling&quot;. It was about travel, both physically and spiritually; with Neil's self-effacing humor creeping through before it ever became pretentious. After reading &quot;Rider&quot;, I now feel I have a slightly better understanding of the African culture, cycling, and of a great human being, Neil Peart. Buy &quot;The Masked Rider.&quot; Whether a Rush fan, cyclist or one who enjoys good writing, you'll find this book to be a truly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book painted a picture in my head while reading in color! The author did a great job on this one. I could feel his agony at times during the book as well as his excitement. I recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"The narrative is highly polished and thoughtful.The Masked Rider details an enlightening spiritual retreat from the author's perspective. &quot;Westerners&quot; would surely appreciate this work enough to draw their own assertions about themselves and their surroundings.Neil has released several travel articles to friends and family prior to his African journeys. Hopefully we'll see more."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil Peart has often been regarded as being just as good a lyricist as he is a drummer. He's always touched on complex themes like innocence vs. experience, ambition vs. delusion, and the ever popular question - 'Why are we here?' with more eloquence than what is usually found among \\"rock stars.\\" Naturally, I jumped all over The Masked Rider when it came out.This is simply a good book - nothing more or less! Chances are it's going to make you feel like you're riding along side Neil on your own bicycle in west Africa (Cameroon to be exact).He cleverly parallels the bicycle journey with his own life's journey by giving colorful details of the trip along with whatever reflections of his own life the journey gives him.He ends up exploring issues like adolescence, politics, environmentalism, and religion - all from a bicycle (and the frequently uncomfortable sleeping conditions he's forced to endure).I give it four stars instead of five only because the book seems to end in a hurry - as if he ran behind some schedule and needed to write a quick ending devoid of much detail. Still, it's a good book that I've read twice...so far!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Lets face it - I've been a Rush fan all my life and curiosity is the only reason I bought this book. But its not the reason I read it twice. And three times...Neil Peart is a good writer, intelligent and thoughtful. He is a thinker and passionate about communication. This is one of the reasons I am a Rush fan. The is one of the reasons I like this book.But the other reason is that I am a cyclist.And lets not forget this is primarily a book about cycling. There is almost nothing about the band and his musical career. Its all about his cycling adventure in Africa. If you are looking for gossip and trivia about Rush then don't read it, you will be disappointed. Its purely about the struggle of cycling, the mechanics, the exhaustion, the thrill and the zen. Its a great read if you have been through it yourself. If you are thinking about throwing yourself into your own trip - then read this book. If don't like cycling but wonder why anyone would put themselves through it - then read this book.Consider this - I liked the book so much I took it with me on my last cycling trip across New Brunswick. I never take books with me when I cycle because they weigh too much and I am often too tired to read them. But I took this one. I carried it over a thousand kilometers, up and down hills, through scorching heat, fog and driving rain. It was worth the weight."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This is a wonderful book about a bike trip through Africa. My husband brought this book home after a Rush concert and not being a Rush fan I didn't want to read it. Imagine my surprise when I picked it up to glance through it and couldn't put it down. It wasn't anything like I was expecting."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Though I read this book over a year ago, the images that are conjured up when recalling excerpts from &quot;The Masked Rider,&quot; a writing of Neil Peart's travel through West Africa with a group of bicycle enthusiasts leads me to think, &quot;I'm not sure if I'd want to subject myself to what he and his fellow riders did.&quot; His writing is (as usual) eloquent and very thought provoking and really helped to place my fanny on the seat of my own bike riding along side him on the dusty trails of a primitive land. He details so many great stories of encounters with African tribal leaders and their people, good (and not so good!) meals, sicknesses, danger, laughter, home sickness, and the ever present oven-like heat that I'm not sure if I ever could summon up the courage to take a trip such as his on my own bicycle. Intruiging thought though I think I'll stick with the annual 42-mile Bike NY ride and call it an accomplishment. :-) &quot;The Masked Rider&quot; is definitely worth a second read. Neil Peart has traveled all over the planet and I hope he writes more on his journeys as they would likely be lessons in geography, social studies, personal endeavors, and triumphs."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am extremely pleased with Neil Peart's writing abilities. He has always impressed me with his drums and the lyrics he writes, but I had no idea his talent went beyond that! I feel like I know a lot about Africa now, and everything I assumed about it before was completely wrong. Neil's writing style leaves nothing to be desired; he is thorough, descriptive, and humorous at times. In addition to knowing more about Africa, I feel that I know a little more about Neil. After reading this book I have a new respect for him. I had no idea he was so well-educated and has such great insight that everyone can use!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Recently I picked up all four books by Neil Peart on Amazon.com and plan on reviewing them in the near future. This is the first one.I spoke with a co-worker who is from West Africa and he concurred with Mr. Peart's portrayal of the harsh living conditions there. The friend tells me, \\"That is why I am here\\" [United States].Peart's book has an excellent quality that I don't see in memoirs today. I love the way he captured his fellow riders' habits, spirit and most importantly, their irritations. In a world that is consumed with finding common ground, often our differences are overlooked. This talented writer illustrates this difficult topic of how we all wear masks and how easily they can fall off in a group dynamic under stress.As stated above, it gives the reader a clear understanding of life in West Africa. Reading this will take you through villages of the region and you will be captured right in the moment. Whether it is a tribal leader or drunken soldiers, the author takes you on his journey and you will be joining this bicycling tour. Me? I don't plan on going anytime soon - but I love to read about other areas of the world and the subject.There are other gems in the book - the conversations between the cyclists, loosing passports, having a gun pointed at the author, among others. But, you have to read it yourself to enjoy them.Lastly, I was impressed with Peart's humbleness. At times, I thought he would dive into his drumming prespective when he encountered African musicians and drums, but rather he simply chooses to report the facts. I appreciated that.I thought it was a great first effort and I highly recommend the book to fellow travelers, lovers of bicycling, and of course, Rush fans."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I decided to revisit this book after reading \\"Travelling Music.\\" Even if you are not a Rush fan this book has many layers; from the writer being one of a five person group, where the squeaky wheel is also the least competent, to the daily adventures of cycling through Africa and dealing with its inhabitants and (sometimes)hostile enviroment. Peart attempts a level of objectivity, trying to win the reader over with views he considers clear, but is he guilty of sharing the same level of nearsightedness as those he criticizes (only he's on the other end of the scale)? I really enjoyed reading this book since it covers more than, \\"next stop, so-n-so, average 'rice with junk in it.'\\" Peart lets you borrow his senses and mindset for a voluntary cyclist bootcamp. Is it the beat or the time between the beats that matter? You really need both for things to work."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book is required reading for Rush fans. This is a must read for anyone with a desire to understand other cultures from the uniqe perspective of a cyclist. Don't mistake this book for Neil Peart's version of \\"Rich Guy Visits Poor People\\" that is so common these days. Neil explains that he cycles regularly and that all are equal when on a bike. It's this perspective that he approches this book and part of the reason it is so good.Also, the other book Ghost Rider is available on the Rush website so I am not sure why Amazon lists it as unavailable. If you see them in concert, you can pick it up at the concert also."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book was so wonderfully written, I could not put it down. It escaped the quality of drudgery that I can't handle in literature and addressed a unique and fascinating topic. It also gives any Rush fan a great insight into Peart's personality and philisophical nature- I believe I understand more of his lyrics now after reading the book. It is truly a must- read!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I've enjoyed Rush's music since 1978's &quot;Hemispheres,&quot; when I was 14 and my friends chastised me for listening to them because they weren't cute enough. As for the &quot;cute&quot; musicians, where are they now?Probably not cycling West Africa and writing books about the experience!Although I haven't cared for their more recent sound, I loved this book! I enjoy well-written travelogues anyway, and the descriptions were so rich and descriptive, you could almost smell and taste this foreign environment. I don't agree with the reviewer who said he criticized Catholicism; his views were unexpectedly reverent, although he is (was?) not a believer himself.This book should be reissued through a major U.S. publishing house; then maybe it will get the attention it deserves. Maybe it will even be mentioned when the finally get a &quot;Behind The Music&quot; episode (which will be a 12-hanky thanks to his enormous personal losses)."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"There's no doubt that many readers of the masked Rider are Rush fans (as am i) so the first aproach to this book is usualy a quest for Rush tips. But when you read it you discover a lot more than tou are expecting: a diary, the dynamics of living for a short period of time with people you don't know, an insigth of people behavior on extreme situations, as Neil always says &quot;the point of the journey its not to arrive&quot;. a truly a good choice. Thanks again Neil. enjoy the ride"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"For those who know and love Neil Peart through Rush, you will certainly enjoy this book. If I wasnt a fan and read this book, I would have found the colorful text just as enlightening. I recommed The Masked Rider to everyone with a philosophical and adventuresome spirit. We now get a glimpse behind the mask of Neil.... and Rush."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"The Masked Rider, by Neil Peart is an honest insight to a travellers journey to Africa. Peart details a bicycle tour thru western Africa, and in the process manages a wide-ranging commentary on a variety of topics. Very expressive, and thoughtful in his approach as a writer."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Neil was not cycling in West Africa as the book is titled and as he repeatedly stated throughout the book. Cameroon is not part of West Africa. It is part of Central Africa. Cameroon is a member of the Economic Community of Central African States, not the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).Also on pg. 189, upon arrival in the northern city of Garoua, he believes that he has entered the Sahel region of Africa. The Sahel does not extend that far south into Cameroon. There are more errors I could point out.These points may seem minor, but due to Neil's condescending attitude toward his travel partners and the people of Cameroon, it was hard for me not to pick apart the book. His econ-politico discussions and observations were less than well informed as well.One particular discussion that stands out is the argument about cigarette smoking in China (pg.83). I guess I will just give Neil the benefit of the doubt that, in 1988, he did not know about tobacco corporations systematically targeting developing nations (or maybe it was his fascination with the myth of Objectionism?)that led to his position in the debate. As governments in the First World (to use a '88 Cold War term) enacted stiffer legislation against tobacco companies, these companies poured much of their marketing efforts toward the Third World. I guess for Neil , the rise in smoking in the developing world was due solely to the Ayn Rand(ian) individualistic notion that people just \\"happen to enjoy it\\".A much more interesting book would be Neil's travel partners' take on him. Just judging the man by his own words, my impression is that his attitude and personality has much to be desired.Like most readers, I got this book because I'm huge Rush fan. First album ever purchased - Moving Pictures. First concert ever attended - Signals tour. I'm also a huge fan of travel writing as well. His prose does not come close to his drumming. If you are interested in Africa and/or great travel writing, pick up Ryszard Kapuscinski's The Shadow of the Sun. Neil brought nothing to table with this effort other than to confirm his reputation as a dour man. Still a huge Rush fan though."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I felt like I rode with mr Peart,all of the ups and downs of West Africa without having to get blisters or dysentery"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"You will feel like you're there, with Neil and his companions. You will feel the heat, the smells, the vibe and beat of the people he knew along this awesome trip.Neil Peart is great with words. When leaving his own experiences he has the gift to share all of them with us. And we become a little less distant from the \\"legend\\" we praise."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book was great reading for me not as a Rush fan, but as a fan of travel books and intricate stories entailed therein."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"If you're looking for tour notes, stories from the road, or even a chapter about his bandmates. This isn't for you.This book is about americans cycling in africa. It is very descriptive, the people, the places, sights, sounds, smells. The small taste of what Neil is thinking, and going through. You feel like you're there with them. I have read the other three Neil Peart books, and this one last. (out of order I know). Not what I expected, but pleasantly surprised. This is where the travel writer came out and honed his craft. Makes me want some rice with junk on it."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"...but really it's written by just a guy who rode his bike for a month through Western Africa. I think this is Peart's best literary work (I've read Ghost Rider and Travelling Music so far). The descriptions were so clear that I could envision what he was seeing from the saddle of his bike.He tells the reader what he saw, he describes the people along the way and his travelling companions as well. He holds nothing back and is honest about his observations--which might put some readers off.This book will also appeal to the non-Rush fans as well, because it's about the trip. He barely mentions Rush in the book, so those who aren't already fans from his other life (the drumming life) can easily pick this up and follow along."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I love Neil's writing...both his lyrics and his books. I thought this was a fun little tale about his bike journey in Africa. I recommend it if you're a Neil Peart fan.."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"\\"The Masked Rider\\" by Neil Peart is the author's first book, published in 1996. The book describes his month-long bicycle tour in Cameroon. Peart describes in detail the challenging riding conditions and \\"rustic\\" accommodations, in addition to his relationship with his travel companuions and talks about the people he encounters. The book was an interesting, easy read. It is however the first time that I read a travel memoir that doesn't make me want to take the journey. It was difficult and uncomfortable and at times just nasty.Although this is his first book, it's the third one of the four that he's written that I have read. Having already read his second book \\"Ghost Rider\\" - where he describes his cross-US motorcycle trip after his wife and 19 year-old daughter had died unexpectedly within a year of each other (accident and cancer respectively) - this was somewhat bittersweet. In this book he tells of how he can't wait for the end of the journey when he meets his wife in Paris to enjoy a vacation with her. At another point as he tells of the poverty he encountered and how the some of the children were underfed and sick, he says that he can't imagine the pain a parent must feel upon losing a child - little could he have known he would know that pain all too well the following year whne he would lose his daughter.It's also interesting to compare traveling conditions in that part of the world prior to 9/11. He complains about the inconveniences they had to endure at security checkpoints and when flying - it's nothing comapred to what goes on now.I'd recommend it to Neil Peart fans and to people who enjoy travel memoirs."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"My purpose in picking up this book was simple. I recently renewed my lifelong love affair of that wonderfully efficient and simlplistic machine, the bike, and wanted a book to get some info on a good bike to buy and techie tips/advice from a 'name I can trust' (given that I'd read a few of Neil Peart's books and enjoyed the music of the band he plays for.)What I found was an unassuming gem. To give a brief background, I found some of Peart's other books (Ghost Rider & Roadshow) 'tough' reads. That is to say, they were informative, and certainly engrossing, but they chronicalled arduous times and tasks. Ghost Rider was painful at a similarly bad time for me and no matter how much I enjoyed being the reader and riding 'shotgun' the experience did not alleviate my own pain vicariously. At the risk of sounding like a self help guru, I think everyone has to experience and learn to heal in their own way. Or as Forrest Gump said, \\"that's all I have to say about that ...\\"Roadshow is a tough read as a Rush fan. It is one of those delightfully entertaining books that i want to read in a single day, but with that reading comes the price of knowing the other side of the velvet rope, and a casualty of that knowledge is the innocence of a lifelong fan. It is also an education that makes a true fan of a casual one, and an appreciative one at that. Perhaps it is not so much an appreciation, as it is an acknowledgement of all of the 'other stuff' that comes along with the exhibition of an art form. Aw heck, lets forget acknowledgement, and call it an acceptance. Peart discloses his intimate feelings as a visceral reaction to the most unnatural act of shuttling from one locale to another while trying to discern the handful of extremist worshippers amid the seas of respectful fans. The breakneck pace of the tour made this a hard read as a fan, who if he had it his way would invite the guys to 'his' little corner of the world, show the guys around 'his' hometown, and make sure they had a homecooked meal and sit on the porch and listen to crickets. Yeah right .. that would make an exciting book entry - huh! It was funny to see Peart caught up in the coatails of the whirlwind of a tour and scurring from one national park to another as a diversionary quest on the tour - sometimes only stopping long enough to get an admission stamp at the ranger's office and high tail it out. I felt bad for the guy, really! But the journey's the thing here. So in that light it was tiring as a reader, but a good kind of tired. I feel for ya, buddy!So much for a short background, but that's history for you. There's always more behind you than you think. Or at least I'd like to think there's more ahead than behind. But unlike this review, life is short so let me get to the point, eh?As I said a lifetime ago, I picked up Masked Rider with the intent to hopefully glean some equipment, riding and otherwise technical tips from a respected writer and musician. Sort of like going to your plumber to get tips on your car or something, but to me its about people, I trusted Peart as a writer. As it turns out there was little if any of what I had hoped for in the book, but on the bright side there was a whole lot of 'other stuff' that I really liked. Which brings us to the here and now.Where are we? Oh yeah...I loved this book. The 'mask' is a metaphor that Peart used to describe the roles or facades that we use to find our comfort zones, hide behind or avoid conflict. Those masks obfuscate, inveigle and deceive and often the wearer is the bearer of those consequences. Like the old twilight zone episode, the people become the masks and vice versa.This book is really interesting in that the setting is a country of what one perceives to be differing norms, beliefs, customs, languages, infrastructure, commerce and countless other nuances that can make or break one's illusion of a good day. Of course, humility, patience, endurance amid diareah, thirst,conflict & corruption make for a good read especially from the comfort of home.The traditional use of tribal masks among African cultures is certainly well documented in the western world, but here we find 5 North American travelers on the other side of the world wearing their own masks.The beauty of the country , the people - especially the kids or the people saying welcome, or the old timer taking a nap in the woodsmade me feel like the world is my home. Africa was always my dream destination as a kid. I will remember these images.This book was a handbook on group dynamics, human behaviour, cultural sensitivity, communication, tolerance and compassion among others. The really interesting thing is that I am talking about the interractions of five North Americans among themselves - not with Africans. Peart delves into what makes people tick (including himself) and it is thoroughly enjoyable. It is also informative and offers practical lessons going forward. (People are all nuts!) Having been there, I found myself laughing out loud when Peart was still pissed off at the others and unable to sleep after discovering basic fundamental differences in beliefs and rationales during a conversation with the group. Still we try ....Peart seems to make the observation as he makes his journey that, people - can't live with them and can't live without em. As I like to say\\"Your damned if you do and damned if you don't - I'll be damned.\\"In other words, I'd rather be damned without regrets so If I am really waivering on a decision I'll usually err on the side of the affirmative and learn if nothing else. I am glad I read this book.&lt;-(gratuitous affirmation)...Thank you.PS. The book didn't have any gear tips, but it was good to read at night on the early days of getting back into riding (with sore legs). Lots of empathy. Now I ride whenever I get the chance and I remember that Peart described one of the best things about cycling is that is done at \\"people speed\\"."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"What a rush! Ok...sorry for the pun. Mr. Peart surprised me with his eloquent writing style and description of his journey. I could almost taste the grit and feel every bump he encountered along the way. Mr. Peart was able to convey adroitly the incredible poverty these people in Cameroon live with on a daily basis. I liked his insight into the young people there when he said something to the effect of how they wanted things 'given' to them rather than to 'earn them'. His expereinces with local govenrment officials and soldiers were quite interesting. He seemed to handle it all with a good sense of humor and an appropriate amount of respect for the customs and values of the country he was a guest of. It is refreshing to read a book by a well known musician without them tooting their own horn regarding their profession or politics. Mr. Peart comes across as some one you could sit down and have a nice cold one with and never know what he did for a living."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I read The Masked Rider after Ghost Rider. That was one of the reasons why I read this one as he caught my interest by the great details of every point on his trip. Masked Rider was the same. He must have kept a great journal to be able to detail every point and feeling on his ride. A lot of the book was soul searching for him as well as trying to figure out his ride companions. It was a book that couldn't be put down as I ride bikes too and could envision everything he was talking about. I would give the book 5 stars if it was not for my next point.As we all know Rush have been around for 30 years now and have sold millions of albums. I too, am one of their biggest fans. However, I could not get over the fact of how cheap Peart is!! From the fact that he turned his back on the woman on the train who was robbed, to standing back and watching vendors at the market so he could see what a fair price for merchandise was going for, or taking advantage of a kid to get his bike washed for $1.00, to living in the poorest conditions at hotels so the tour guide Dave wouldn't stretch his budget. I realize the tour was paid for in advance by each member, but could he not kick in a few bucks to make this an enjoyable ride, even if they were going to experience the whole thing, hardships and all? Also I don't think he ever let anyone in his group know who he \\"was\\". And did they pick up his book years later only to find it was them he was tearing apart? I'm sorry, but I found the same thing running in Ghost Rider. This did not keep me from reading an otherwise excellent book. Maybe the next trip he goes on he should not only dig down deep to soul search, but maybe dig down deeper in his pockets too!!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have been a Rush fan for many years, and as a drummer, a Neil Peart fan for many years. For those who actually READ Neil's lyrics, you know that he is an intelligent, philosophical, and insightful writer. I was curious, however, how that style of writing would translate into a book about an African bicycle adventure. I had visions of long winded diatribes about the state of government affairs in West Africa...To my surprise, it was a most enjoyable, light-hearted, read that emphasized not only the African culture he encountered, but the most engaging dynamic between he and his riding companions. I found myself drawn into that interplay as much as, if not more than, the scenery and culture that he so eloquently descibes. Rush fan or not, this is an excellent book, that comes highly recommended from this reader!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am extremely pleased with Neil Peart's writing abilities. He has always impressed me with his drums and the lyrics he writes, but I had no idea his talent went beyond that! I feel like I know a lot about Africa now, and everything I assumed about it before was completely wrong. Neil's writing style leaves nothing to be desired; he is thorough, descriptive, and humorous at times. In addition to knowing more about Africa, I feel that I know a little more about Neil. After reading this book I have a new respect for him. I had no idea he was so well-educated and has such great insight that everyone can use!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I have finally finished reading The Masked Rider, by Rush drummer Neil Peart. It was both wonderful and disappointing.Wonderful, because of the story that he tells, of the journey that he took across some of the hardest, as well as most beautiful, land on earth. For reasons that were apparently not even clear to himself, he biked across Cameroon with a handful of other North Americans, staying in all manner of hovels and hotels, meeting peasants and chieftains, and enduring difficult (and non-existent) roads and roadblocks. But, wow, what an experience.Disappointing because in so many places Peart's contempt for the portion of humanity not himself, comes through loudly. Much of the book was a tirade against his fellow travelers, or with the people around him, or with the pointlessness of West African inefficiencies. One wonders why someone would choose to bike across Cameroon if one wasn't expecting abject poverty, terrible road conditions, and long stretches between running water. I'd love to see the marketing brochure.Strangely, for his grim painting of the experience, I came away from it wishing that I could do it myself. Always a junkie for an experience, I would *love* to see the things that he describes, even at the expense of the physical difficulty it took to get to it. And in many of his disgusted tellings of interpersonal turmoil, I found myself siding with the person he was berating. He is *so* completely goal-oriented, that even when describing the beauty around him, he seemed to miss out on the experience he was complaining about - a bit of a paradox, I suppose.Peart remains my favorite lyricist, writing song lyrics that actually mean something. But I have, so far, found his books frustrating - a wealthy traveler expecting the world to be a place of luxury when he arrives at his destination, and not get in his way getting there. I, on the other hand, love the journey more than the destination. For me, the experience is the thing, and actually arriving is less interesting.Or, to quote my favorite lyricist:From the point of ignitionTo the final driveThe point of a journeyIs not to arriveAnything can happen..."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am always interested in good real life adventures. This story is about Neil's perspective on his adventure through a remote part of Africa that most westerns would never have the courage to try. I am personally a person that has traveled most places of the world, including Africa, but exposing myself to the elements the way Neil and his other five cycling buddies did is something I wouldn't dream of doing..... or at least until I had read this book... which makes me now believe I have been missing an entire part of my traveling adventure.Pick this book up! You will enjoy it! I enjoy Neil's honesty about his traveling companions and the people he interacts with during the trip. A great story about a great adventure."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I came upon Neil Peart's writing after watching a video my drummer had lent me (\\"A Work In Progress\\"). I had been so impressed with Neil's clarity, vision, and humility in the video, that I looked him up on the web to see what else I might find. On his web site I found some essays that he has written and was further impressed with his writing style. It was honest, open, intelligent, and conversational. I also noticed that he has written four books, three of them featuring bicycling or motorcycling. As a bicyclist, motorcyclist, musician, and writer myself, I had to dig in. I began with his first book, and was not disappointed.I loved the style AND content of this book (not an everyday occurrence for me). Neil uses the writer's \\"show, don't tell\\" adage well, painting a picture of his bike tour that helps you to feel the heat, taste the dust, hear the blaring late-night music, and smell the sweat and sewage. In the midst of this, he relates his observations and thoughts clearly and honestly -- he doesn't sugar-coat his prose, rather he reveals what he experiences in all its warted glory.There are two things I might change with this book to make it near-perfect: 1. More photos. There is much discussion in the book of the perils of photo-taking in Cameroon, and the fact that Neil was willing to take risks for the sake of some of these photos adds a sort of value to them for the reader. 2. I felt the book ended abruptly. I would love to have had more of a summary of his thoughts after the ride, a sort of Campbellian return of the hero and teaching of the lessons learned.Perhaps a good implicit summary of my opinion on the book is the fact that I am already reading his next book, plan to read his others, and hope that he keeps on writing."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As a Rush fan of the last quarter century, I looked forward to this just to enjoy Neil's writing. Have read his other two travel books, Ghost Rider and Traveling Music, I found this one to be the most untainted by his profession. GR told of his multi-month healing process via motorcyle after his life was rocked by tragedy, and TM his 5-day road trip by car across the US Southwest while talking about the music he enjoyed, both books relaying numerous personal as well as RUSH anecdotes. The Masked Rider however, could have been written by anyone, that is, not necessarily a successful rock musician. His intelligence, dry sense of humor, and genuine love for history and nature make this an enjoyable read. It goes without saying that this book is probably mostly going to be purchased and read by Rush fans, which is a shame as this book has the most potential universal appeal of his three books. But his descriptions and storytelling make it a most engulfing \\"adventure\\" document. I highly recommend it. And you don't even have to like Rush's music, but I recommend that highly as well."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"as an avid fan of Rush and of Neil Peart's drumming especially, I of course wanted to read this book of his bicycle adventure through West Africa. it documents a lot of trials and tribulations within and outside his traveling group, the troubles they encounter and poverty they face is documented, and Peart's intelligent and insightful thoughts are given to us also. I enjoyed this book, but I liked Ghost Rider and Traveling Music a lot more. This is, however, an excellent start on Neil's travel and autobiographical writing. His books are highly enjoyable and contain many insights and interesting stories. The best thing about this book was in its insights into the culture of the Cameroon, and how the poverty has caused most people there to look for a way out of the place and into fame, as Neil was targeted by some people there who wanted him to get them money and fame! this book is a good read."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"a superbly written account of an insightful man's journey through Africa. For such an astounding musician to also be an adept writer is almost mind-boggling (and jealousy-inducing!). Some have argued that the author comes across as arrogant or condescending. I felt that any movements in that direction were nicely tempered by insightful self-reflections and assessments. That being said, I would certainly hate to be &quot;Elsa&quot; who comes across as old, lazy and whining - which perhaps she was - but the author sees fit to mention this at almost every turn. Maybe he's just being honest, but at times I did feel that this brilliant Canadian was dabbling in a tad too much hubris (directed at Americans and Africans).Any complaints about this marvelous work are easily offset by an engaging, highly intelligent, but readable account, of exploring Africa by bike. Not to mention a keen sense of humor, informed by a breadth of knowledge way beyond most &quot;rockers.&quot; We all knew that Peart could write great rock songs; but in this work he really pushes the envelope and succeeds at a literary travelogue that can hold its own against any other.I would have liked to have seen him participating in drum rituals or sessions with African drummers. That would have added so much to the text, but perhaps he wanted to avoid that and simply write as any other journeyer. Despite his marked cynicism, which one would expect from such a great mind, a real sense of humanity shines through. He gives life to those he encounters with all their frailties, but also strengths and charms.All-in-all this is a lively, vivid and enriching journey that is worth every drop of ink on the pages.Very, very entertaining."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This book is amazing! Neil takes you on a firsthand journey through the experience of cycling through Africa. I felt the curiousity and enjoyment of the trip through his very well written book. I would recommend it to anybody interested in both the people and geography of western Africa. Highly enjoyable!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I've enjoyed Rush's music since 1978's &quot;Hemispheres,&quot; when I was 14 and my friends chastised me for listening to them because they weren't cute enough. As for the &quot;cute&quot; musicians, where are they now?Probably not cycling West Africa and writing books about the experience!Although I haven't cared for their more recent sound, I loved this book! I enjoy well-written travelogues anyway, and the descriptions were so rich and descriptive, you could almost smell and taste this foreign environment. I don't agree with the reviewer who said he criticized Catholicism; his views were unexpectedly reverent, although he is (was?) not a believer himself.This book should be reissued through a major U.S. publishing house; then maybe it will get the attention it deserves. Maybe it will even be mentioned when the finally get a &quot;Behind The Music&quot; episode (which will be a 12-hanky thanks to his enormous personal losses)."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"As the drummer and lyricist of the Rock band Rush, Neil has made himself known the last 25 years. As a human being and writer, he transcends rock music. Neil makes no apologies for himself, nor does he have the big head of a rock star. Neil offers himself (probably unintentionally) as a powerful example of an intelligent and self made individual. Others would do well to give their world as much consideration as Neil has given his.Very inspiring writing...."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Being a Rush fan (a BIG one), I am guinea-pigged into having to own EVERYTHING about them, which even included this book (which I bought at one of their concerts).I don't play drums, or guitar, or bass, but I do understand where the power of writing comes from. Neil's book is top notch reading material for people who like to read about other people's adventures in foreign lands (whether or not you're a Rush fan or even a rock-n-roll fan for that matter). Neil writes about some of the unusualnesses and about the culture of the West African country of Cameroon (A country I never even heard of until I read this book), and either makes you laugh, cry, shudder, etc. (i.e. He talks about cultural guilt that some westerners get when it comes to food after a peace corps volunteer makes his bicycle group hamburgers and french fries)There's more to this book, but you must buy it to learn more. If it was released by a major American publishing company, it would surely be a best seller."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I am also a survivor of three Bicycle Africa tours. Neil has been on five tours, the book is based on his experiences in Cameroon. I have travelled through Mali, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. The book is a journal filled in with comments on all sorts of subjects including life discoveries and philosophy. I enjoyed the book as a story, with all of the characters and their interaction. I also found myself transported back to my own trip through Mali and was amazed at how accurately my own experiences were documented. Instead of spending hours telling people what cycling in Africa is like, I will lend out the book."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I'm a Rush fan so it's hard for me to be perfectly objective. However, Neil Peart is a man of insight. This insight shows in Rush lyrics and in this book. Aside from an interesting account of his travels in Africa, the book is an account of insights and thoughts along the way. He doesn't offer any solutions. Instead, he celebrates the diversity of life and how everything we do can contribute to improving our ability to live it."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Breathtaking. Artful. Thoughtful. Funny. Sad. Shocking.Neil's craft with theme and prose is as precise and thrilling as his drumming. I enjoyed The Masked Rider more than all of this other books, and I enjoyed them a lot. Neil muses how masks in Africa, and in all societies and people (himself included) reveal as much as they conceal.As usual, his insights into his own character and those of his companions are humorous and without self-indulgent narcissism. The ending is cathartic, and his concluding thoughts after the trip aren't what one would expect. Written before the crippling losses of his wife and daughter, I relished the innocence of the \`old Neil', with his boundless hope and shaking-his-fist-at-the-sky verve. You will remember a sweet little girl that changes a bad day he had with two words, and the way he greets his wife when the journey is over.Ashea, Neil, Ashea."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I loved this book. It was one of those books that I eagerly picked up and read at every opportunity. I look forward to reading it again sometime soon. I have been a fan of \\"the Boys\\" since I first listened to them while in high school back in '76. I have grown up with their music and vision, and their songs have become the soundtrack to my life.That being said, I do not instantly swoon and yip like a lapdog at everything they do, say, play or produce. The true benefit I have gained by listening to their music is that I've learned to maintain a healthy critical skepticism to pretty much everything that is thrown in front of me by modern culture and touted as \\"IT\\". These guys are no fools. They live life with a thirst and hunger for knowledge, a curiosity for how and why, an awe and wonder at the incredible beauty and complexity of this universe we live in, and they do it with a healthy dose of skepticism and humanity (it's a shame that more people don't understand this about Rush).This book is a good reflection of that attitude on the part of Neil. It is truly a very heart warming and cerebral tale of an adventurous man's journey through a primitive country/continent that has an incredible history. I enjoyed reading his story about his adventures through Cameroon. I felt like I was right there with him, panting and puffing across dusty savannas (sp?) and rocky trails, thirsting for water or grapefruit sodas and starving for a decent meal and only getting \\"rice with junk on it\\". I also could feel Neil's pain at being bit to death at night by mosquitos while trying to sleep in some backyard shed, or experiencing dysentary all night in a crusty bathroom with buckets for toliets. As a father, I also felt his joy when he was finally able to talk to his (then 9 year old) daughter on the phone after several weeks, realizing how much he loved and missed his family and how important they were in his life. This is especially touching when you had the knowledge of his wife and daughter passing a decade later, further underscoring the importance of loving yor kids and family as if it may be your last days together. This was the most important personal meaning I took away from Neil's book.This book was truly a great read that I will share with others, and as I said above, I will NEVER bicycle anywhere in Africa....EVER! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"Just finished this book. Very insightful and interesting. Neil is a very good, colorful writer. While reading, easy to imagine what they all went through. I had good clear vision of all the people and their trip. I like the idea of the bike trip, I don't actually want to work that hard for it though. I'm thinking I will start out with that weekend biking trip. Of course, seeing Rush in concert tonight.My favorite part was the Denbo trip. Am absolutely amazed at the remoteness of the areas and the people and their attitudes and surprise of others. Definitely a book to read and understand civilization around you."},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"There is not much that hasn't been said about this book in it's dozens of reviews. However, I found it very enjoyable and have always admired Neils's lyrics and philosophy. I, like most people expected to read a lot about \\"behind the scenes\\" Rush. Needless to say, I was sorely dissapointed. Perhaps Neil purposely neglected to talk about what was beyond the scope of the book. What we are left with is the true story about a cranky and obnoxious man who travels, sees, smells, eats and thinks and has no qualms about being real to his experience. What it means to him as a person, not just as a \\"white man\\", but as a concrete human being. Even when wearing a mask, he stays real to that. Throughout the trip, Neil bumps heads with virtually everyone, at times being downright rude. Anyone who does not know him or Rush may have a hard time relating to this pretentious and politically incorrect narrator. But it is that utter sincerity which permeates these pages and make it such a pleasure to read. A worthy book in the Objectivist tradition. If you know the recent losses in Neil's life, The Masked Rider is even more sad and uplifting to read. This book explores issues from a (very) self-centered point of view, but never losing track of the relativity of it all. Materialism and spirituality need not be opposing poles. So get naked and party!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I just finished this book, after having demonstrated physically to others that I could not put it down. What I fear people lose sight of is Neil's wondrous descriptions of the people he met during this journey.I am as huge a Rush fan as you can find, but part of the reason for that is absorbing Neil's humanistic (if not always kind) takes on his fellow mankind. Most of the reviews I read on this site emphasize him as an individual, which is fine. However, he spotlights so many other great individuals in the book, for instance Leonard, that you have to believe the reason he wrote the book was because of his interactions with all those other folks. In other words, this book offers us a tool Neil didn't have along his journey: a mirror. He reminds us it is okay to have an ego, so long as we use it wisely. By helping ourselves we help others, and by helping others we help ourselves. Great read!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"I was 12 in 1975 when &quot;Caress of Steele&quot; was released (3rd Album of Rush) and I was instantly hooked on Rush. I immediately bought a 5 piece Stewart drum kit and haven't looked back. So I could say that my appetite for Peart paraphernalia has never stopped. I feel like taking a bike trip to Africa myself after reading this incredible novel for the &quot;second time&quot;! Neil makes you want to be there, to feel what he has and to experience all that he does. He pulls no punches and tells it like it is, there's and honesty and realism about the way Neil writes that makes this book very real and truthful. I passed the book around the office and all that read it where very surprised that a &quot;rock&quot; drummer could have such an incredible writing style, they should hear him drum! I give this book two thumbs up for an enjoyable and down to earth experience you just cannot miss in West Africa! Please write more Neil!"},{"Title":"THE MASKED RIDER Cycling in West Africa","review":"This is THE best nonfiction book I have ever read. Neil Peart's writing style is as simple yet elegant as his lyrics.I could not tear myself away from Mr. Peart's book. It was a powerful firsthand account of cycling in Africa--the politics, the landscape, the dysentary. Mr. Peart's reflections upon life and philosophy (I was proud to say I'd read all of the books he'd mentioned and discoursed upon) provide another, deeper level of understanding of this complex man.I must say that certain parts of the book, those concerning his wife and daughter, were very sad when looked back upon now. I will admit I got a lump in my throat when Mr. Peart wrote about finally meeting Jackie in Paris after being separated for so long. There was also one section where Mr. Peart talked about how losing a child must be the worst thing a parent has to go through...it was heartbreaking.This book is definately worth the wait from the publisher. It took me three months to get my mitts on this book, and I'm so happy I did. The book is fun, sad, scary, and an excellent read.RUSH RULES!"},{"Title":"The Rebel of the Family (Broadview Literary Texts)","review":"Perdita Winstanley's widowed mother was \\"born to the velvet,\\" but is now destitute. She is desperate to hide her poverty from the world and find rich husbands for her two beautiful, conventional daughters, Thomasina and Eva. The third daughter, Perdita -- \\"the rebel of the family\\" -- plain, outspoken, emotional, and (worst of all!) \\"democratic,\\" cannot fit in with the schemes of her mother and sisters, whose highest object in life is the pursuit and preservation of money and rank. Seeking the love, approval, and life-purpose which she does not find at home, Perdita takes a job as a clerk in a bank, flirts with the extremist views of a man-hating Women's Emancipation movement (and is nearly drawn in by its vulgar, hypocritical lesbian leader), turns down an offer of marriage from a wealthy man she does not love, and eventually finds happiness with a chemist/druggist, who, though beneath her in birth, is \\"the noblest man on earth, the wisest and the most generous!\\""},{"Title":"The Rebel of the Family (Broadview Literary Texts)","review":"This novel was written in the late 1800's, so I was somewhat leery of its readability, but I found it quite readable, and a highly enjoyable story.Having been written in the era in which it was set,1880, I felt made it more realistic.The story centers around a widow, Mrs. Winstanley, and her 3 daughters. They have the lineage to be \\"ladies\\" but not the financial means.In 1880 England, the \\"new woman\\" was just emerging--women who wanted other options than marrying for security.Mrs. Winstanley and two of her daughters, Thomasina and Eva, however, are bent on finding security the old customary way--by marriage to \\"suitable\\" gentlemen, foregoing love on the part of the young women.Perdita, however, is the rebel of the family, she wants to have something useful to do in the way of an occupation until true love appears. Perdita's clumsy honesty threatens her mother, Mrs. Winstanley's carefully laid plans and leds to considerable dissension between this middle daughter, her mother & her two sisters.The oddest thing about the book, to me, was the fact that Deborah T. Meem, who edited and I assume had a great deal to do with bringing it back into print--severely critiques the author, Eliza Lynn Linton. Ms. Meem claims Ms. Linton did not understand herself. Perhaps Linton didn't understand herself, but I don't think Ms. Meem understood Linton either.The opinion I garnered was that Eliza Lynn Linton was not necessarily the hypocrite and foe of women's rights Ms. Meem accuses her of being, but rather that Ms. Linton did not approve of radicalism, and believed marriage should be based on love."},{"Title":"Wall Of Glass","review":"Bad Word Warning: Yes, this book contains Bad Words. \`Nough said.REVIEW:Unlike too many writers these days, Walter Satterthwait has never confined himself to a single series, a single set of characters. He has written two sets of mysteries around a team of male and female detectives (the Joshua Croft series and what he calls the \\"Phil and Jane\\" series, the titles in this second series all ending in \\"-ade,\\" as inEscapade,Masquerade,Cavalcade (Pinkerton Det. Phil Beaumont &)). But he has also written a number of mysteries that stand on their own, such asMiss Lizzie,Dead Horse,Perfection, and the hilariousWilde West, in which a serial killer seems to be following Oscar Wilde's trip across America and in which Mr. Satterthwait turns his hand to writing a few Wilde-isms himself. This lack of a twenty-six-book series involving a single character or set of characters may explain his lack of blockbuster popularity like any of about twenty authors currently residing on the bestseller lists. Which is really too bad, because Walter Satterthwait is a brilliant, clever, inventive, and deliciously witty writer who has produced a number of books that should be considered classics. \\"Wall of Glass\\" is the first book of his Joshua Croft series (for a complete list, see my listmania list). It's a marvelous story and deserves a wide readership.As the first book in a series, \\"Wall of Glass\\" must not only stand as a mystery in itself, but it must also introduce a whole group of characters, as well as the world they inhabit, in this case generally based around Santa Fe, New Mexico. Here we first meet Joshua Croft, a man of usually few but pithy words, his partner in detecting the beautiful but crippled Rita Mondrag&oacute;n, a reputed-New Mexico crime lord and practicing Buddhist named Norman Montoya, and a number of supporting characters who will wander in and out of this and the subsequent stories in the series. Here, too, Satterthwait introduces the New Mexico territory his characters inhabit, and he does so in brilliant form, opening this book with one of my all-time favorite openings:\\"It was a Friday in mid-April, warm and clean and spectacularly sunny, and a blizzard was due by midnight. Weather like this happens every spring in the New Mexico mountains, and it produces one of our famous annual events, the Death of the Apple Blossoms. Tomorrow all the pink-white petals in the courtyard would be buried beneath a foot of snow. In another few days, the snow would be gone and the petals would be littering the ground in sodden drifts, like fans of debris left behind by a storm tide. And in another few months, when fall rolled around, there would be no apples on the trees. If the Garden of Eden had been planted here, Adam and Eve might still be working things out.\\"Where I live, in the foothills of California's Great Central Valley, we have the Death of All the Fruit Blossoms, not by snow (at least, not usually) but by a return of driving rain and howling winds just after the fruit trees have burst into glorious bloom, lulled into a false sense of complacency by the annual warm spring fake-out, which lasts for just about a week or two. So you can imagine that this passage might strike a chord for me. Actually, it had me cackling maniacally. Nor is it the only passage that did; Satterthwait writes with at least part of tongue planted firmly in cheek, and his thoughtful prose, heavy on the irony, is a delight to read.But as to the story at hand. This story concerns the theft of a $100,000 diamond necklace and its possible reappearance. When Joshua and Rita agree with an insurance company to try to retrieve the necklace, which may or may not have resurfaced, they start down a path with more twists and turns than a New Mexico sidewinder or one of the state's treacherous mountain roads. As they run down each clue, all kinds of villains start crawling out of the woodwork, and they soon realize that, as in all good mysteries, things are not at all what they seem. Suddenly bodies start piling up on the fringes of a supposedly simple case of theft, and they both get a close look at the seamier side of Santa Fe's mad social whirl.Like any good crime writer, Satterthwait uses the genre not only to entertain, but also to cast a slightly warped mirror on our times. And he is very good at what he does, nailing stupidity, pretension, and outright cruelty with an unerring wit. Take, for example, this description of a new character:\\"He wore dusty Western boots, faded jeans, a tight-fitting denim shirt, and a gray Stetson with the sides of its brim curled up. His face was sun-reddened and his eyes had the prairie squint. This being Santa Fe, he could've been exactly what he looked like. A real live cowboy. ...On the other hand, this being Santa Fe, he could've been a stockbroker.\\"Or his description of a doorbell in an expensive house that plays the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth: \\"I don't want \`ding dong,' Sammy, I want class.\\"Or a room in the same house: \\"A stone fireplace, broad and round, sat in the center of the room beneath a cylindrical copper chimney with a wide conical mouth. Pi&ntilde;on logs were burning inside, presumably to counteract the chill put out by the air conditioner.\\"Or, one of the my favorites:\\"'Last week he gave the band a hundred bucks for playing what he wanted to hear.'\`What was that?'\`Silence.'I smiled. \`He's got better taste than I would've thought.' ...'You've heard the band too, huh?'\\"In other words, Mr. Satterthwait can quip along with the best of them. But he has his lyrical side, too, as in his description of the view through a wall of glass:\\"Gray clouds were moving down between the black stands of pine, slowly whirling and swirling, and then as they neared the silver ribbon of river at the valley bottom, slowly unraveling and fraying, wisping away like wood smoke. The view stretched on for miles, until both sides of the dark valley became lost in rolling white mist.\\"He also offers a meticulous description of how to create a lowrider, which he says took about two weeks to research. It was worth it.Actually, my collection of favorite lines from \\"Wall of Glass\\" runs a good three or four pages, but I don't want to spoil your own discovery of favorite Satterthwait lines, so I'll stop now. Okay, just one more: \\"Leighton is one of those people who manages to raise mediocrity to new middles.\\".The point is that Walter Satterthwait is not only a fine mystery writer, but also a first-class stylist. His prose is clean, spare, and unfailingly precise. It's a real pleasure to read a writer with such a fine feel for the language.If you like tough, noir-ish detectives, do yourself a favor and read Wall of Glass. I'm guessing you'll want to read a lot more Satterthwaits. I know I'm hooked."},{"Title":"Wall Of Glass","review":"When Wall of Glass was first published, I happened to read a review of it and bought the book immediately, and from the start I liked reading about private eye Joshua Croft of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and his wheelchair-bound boss, Rita Montdragon. The writing is smooth, the characters interesting, the plot well-constructed.In this particular story Croft is approached by a sleazy sort who asks Croft if he might be interested in helping recover a stolen necklace and get some of the reward. Croft reports this conversation to his boss. The next day, the sleazy sort is murdered. Soon the Montdragon Agency takes on the case of recovering the stolen necklace. The family from whom the necklace was stolen is extremely wealthy and highly dysfunctional. The plot grows to include an art gallery and Indian artifacts, and the first murder is followed by another. Every plot complication is interesting and logical, and Croft and Montdragon are highly sympathetic characters. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Wall Of Glass","review":"Felt that the characters were very one-dimensional.

The accounts that were written in later centuries also provide valuable information. Mr. Axtell explains that, despite their cultural biases, these men were often very perceptive in their observations of peoples whose appearance and cultures were so foreign to them. I believe any serious student Of Native Americans would enjoy reading this book. Look for other books by this author."},{"Title":"Industrial Applications of Combinatorial Optimization (Applied Optimization)","review":"An exceptionally well written book by the foremost authorities in the field of applied combinatorial optimization. This book serves as a bridge between abstract mathematical thinking and real life problem analysis. Most books on combinatorial optimization are heavy in mathematics with miniature real life situations as examples. This book begs to differ. Each of the 15 chapters deals separately with individual companies and their optimization needs. All chapters are relevant to any mid to medium sized corporations. Many organizations are looking towards cost cutting measures and have started looking into optimization and this book will be a great help for any operations manager/researcher. This book can also be used in Graduate level courses in advanced applied optimization. Do not expect this book to be a primer in combinatorial optimization, turn to Combinatorial Optimization: Algorithms and Complexityby Christos H. Papadimitriou and Kenneth Steiglitz for a brush up of fundamentals. All things said this book is worth its weight in gold.A word to the author/publisher, please come down on the price and it's high time for a second edition or part 2."},{"Title":"Keep Watching the Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties, Vol. 1: 1950-1957","review":"And I mean that in a good way because if you're a B-movie science fiction fan, this will be your favorite &quot;class&quot;. Bill Warren's magnus opus, &quot;Keep Watching the Skies&quot; is THE definite reference book on the science fiction movies made in the 1950's and into the early '60s. It is an inexhaustive review of every good, bad, and ugly movie from those two decades. Extensive research is at the heart of the book. This is an author who is seriously in love with this genre'. Warren has gleaned numerous unknown tidbits about the actors, sets, budgets, etc. from these great, but often underappreciated, B-movies.Classic science fiction movie fans will be totally absorbed by the book. Best read in small chunks, it's almost impossible to put down! Warren not only provides an interesting and honest narrative of each of the films, but adds a chonological list of when the films were distributed and gives a separate synopsis of the films' plots, actors, directors, etc., in a different section of the book. A great index is available and can be of tremendous help when you're watching a midnight sci fi movie fest and can't remember that particular actor's name.By all means, buy the 1997 printing of the book because it contains both volumes (1950-57 and 1958-62). It's a steal at any price.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Way of Understanding","review":"Had this as a Girl Scout. It had been given to me by a beloved troop leader.

(Savvy Savings Guide for Home and Business)","review":"The title is misleading. Obviously, there are no secrets in this book. It is just a good introductory summary on small business / self-employed tax savings.If you plan to run a business from your home, this book is a good, basic, simple introduction. However, it does not add much from the several IRS publications. Even some examples are the same encountered in public documents. But the book puts it all together for you. It even lists the relevant IRS publications and tells you how to obtain them.The book brings simple information although it is not always successful in presenting it in a simple way. The book is acceptable and deserves 3 stars, but you should check other books before investing your time on this one.If you want a simple overview, this is the book for you. However, if you want a more detailed book, you may try \\"Working For Yourself: Law & Taxes for Independent Contractors, Freelancers & Consultants\\" by Stephen Fishman. I did not read it, but found its table of contents at Amazon and thought it was much more detailed and well organized. It is 2 or 3 times larger and seemed a more serious book."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"I've just started reading Ngaio Marsh's mysteries, so I don't know if this book is a &quot;typical&quot; Marsh mystery, but I certainly hope so. The characters were well-drawn, and the plot quite brilliant. A man dies while playing darts, because it appears that a dart daubed with cyanide sticks in the back of his hand. Almost everyone has a motive, and the evidence at hand can point to almost any of them. Reading this novel is like threading a conch-shell. You slip in a piece of string and it snakes through various chambers and entries until it finally comes out at the end. I was a big Christie fan, but now I think I'll be moving on to Marsh."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"One of Marsh's most tightly-knit jobs. Victim a famous K.C., poisoned with KNC in the private taproom of a Devon inn while taking part in a demonstration of darts-throwing; plenty of good circumstantial detail leads to supposition of impossible crime. Alleyn, called in both by publican and by local police, does a splendid and fast (24 hours) job of discovering murderer, whose identity is a masterly demonstration in diverting suspicion from the most likely person. Method ingeniously simple, and hence convincing: a very neat job. Virtuoso display of logic at the end, including a delightful false solution propounded by a most amusing Chief Constable."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"Perhaps not one of her more richly written efforts, but buoyed by a marvellous mystery plot, set in a wonderful English pub. Darts and beer, a fatal combination."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"Three friends form London arrive at a remote inn to spend a couple of weeks on holiday. Norman is an artist and wants to spend his time painting; Simon is an actor and is taking a break and his cousin, Luke is a successful barrister. One of them will meet his death in this idyllic spot. Is it a terrible accident or is it murder? The inquest rules it is accident but the publican of The Plume of Feathers wants to clear the name of his hostelry and pays a visit to Roderick Alleyn at Scotland Yard.The local Chief Constable agrees to Alleyn investigating and it soon becomes clear that this is really murder. This is a well plotted novel with some fascinating twists and turns and a really ingenious murderer. Almost all of the suspects have secrets they are hiding from the police and almost all of them appear to be guilty though they seem to have no opportunity to actually do the deed.I totally failed to work out who did it though of course when you look back the clues are there staring you in the face! An excellent crime novel by a master of the genre."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"I am a fan of Ngaio Marsh and I'm trying to read all of her stories, but DEATH AT THE BAR was way below a Marsh standard. There was no mystery, from the moment the characters were introduced the reader knows who will die and who is the killer.The other characters who populate the bar are shallow and repulsive.DEATH AT THE BAR may have been an early manuscript that had been around collecting dust for want of a publisher that should have stayed in the bottom drawer.If you enjoy Ngaio Marsh you should read it, but I can not recommend it.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS."},{"Title":"Death at the Bar","review":"This is one of the longest Marsh novels of the 25 I've read so far (of the 32). She has lots of style. This one includes Inspector Fox but not the others in Alleyn's usual crew. The additional characters are well-drawn & intriguing IMHO, including an actor (Marsh has many stage-oriented novels--cf.Curtain Calls: Three Great Mysteries; Enter A Murderer; Night At the Vulcan; Killer Dolphin), an artist (she also has art-oriented ones such asArtists in Crime& Alleyn's wife Troy is a celebrated artist), a Barrister (the victim), & numerous country folk. The setting in a country inn adds charm to the novel as well. But, the best part is the mystery itself. Lots of motives, of course, & a supposedly impossible crime. The finger points to different suspects in cycles--very clever. I did guess part of it, but not the main part. The only drawback to me was the seeming serendipity of the storm & lights going out--and the rapidity of the culprit's movements. Poetic license I presume. My favorite lines in it are: p. 9: \\"His cousin had a trick of saying things that sounded a little like quotations from an interview with himself\\" & p. 293: \\"as conspicuous as a pitchfork in Paradise.\\" It's a delightful book--I'm torn between giving it 4 or 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cooking with herbs and spices","review":"I learned much of what I know about cooking from this wonderful little cookbook and worn out two paperback copies over 30 years.

He (himself when queried said) he never listens to music,recordings,but the sounds (as we all know now) that are all around us.Marvelous textures./ We simply need the committment to listen,to be committed to unitentionality,purposelessness. It is where divine intwervention/ inspiration or something similar an import which may or may not occur/possibly.This rather large work &quot;I - VI&quot; is the summary/documentation of the prestigious Norton Lectures Series from 1988-89 at Harvard University.

Whether (that is the correct) way is beside the point, for if you are looking for discrete meanings, well you will find it in bleak,cold fragmentariness. There are passages on the very bottom of each page, the question and answer section, where you may learn particular ways of playing Cage's sometimes rather difficult music. You never (improvise in) Cage, actually there is very little performing freedom. Once you understand a performing corridor or process you cannot digress from it.

Vertebrates are proposed as a model for studying evolution, noting that they are a monophyletic group, have sexual reproduction, share a similar body plan, and most importantly have an excellent fossil record.

It uses the Open Gaming License d20 system, which works surprisingly well with this game. Each agent has Action Dice, which can be used to augment rolls when in trouble. This represents the spark of a heroic character. The equipment section is superb. From pistols and sub-machine guns to assault rifles and machine guns, it's got everything (check out the Modern Arms/Equipment guide for more).Overall, I can't stress enough how awesome this book is.

That aspect of the book bothers me though, because it sometimes becomes such a glowing portrait of the company that the story can not be taken at face value... That being said, I think Katz's unprecedented access to Phil Knight and many of Nike's other top executives and athletes allows him to tell the story of Nike's growth and continuous battle for market share from a unique perspective. I have also read Swoosh, cowritten by the wife of a former Nike executive, and it tells a similar tale, but is so biased against Nike that it's analysis is even less believable then Katz'z. I think this is an interesting portrait of a great American company and has an insider perpective you will not find else where, but I only give it three stars because it is a bit of a PR job and is surely not as even handed as I would like."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Just Do It digs under the skin of the Nike corporation and gives a behind-the-scenes look at the company that has grown to be the number one shoe marketer in the U.S. The author details every aspect from Nike's involvement in the Dream Team awards ceremony fiasco in the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona to the sweat shops of Asia where the shoes are actually produced. The author taps into the psyche behind what Nike is about and what makes a typical Nike employee: love of sports combined with a rebellious, headstrong nature to think outside the box. For example, one prospective employee with a PhD and a law degree was dismissed by the selection committee for not knowing who Deion Sanders was. The book opens with the 1993 retirement of Michael Jordan and ends with some &quot;small&quot; layoffs by Nike in September of the same year and the effects that the layoffs have on chairman, Phil Knight. The prose is well-chosen and the reader is shown the business side of superstars such as Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan that you won't find in Sports Illustrated. There are two minor weaknesses to Just Do It. There is definitely an inevitable pro-Phil Knight slant to everthing written. Also, an extraordinary amount of pages are devoted strictly to the quagmire that is the Asian economy. The author may find this topic interesting, but the average reader won't and it strayed from the central theme of Nike's corporate culture."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Just Do It by Donald Katz wasnt the one of the best books I have read, it didnt even make my top ten list. This book is full of uninteresting, and tedious specifics which did not make me want to read the book any more than I had to. On the back of the book U.S News &amp; World Report says &quot;Engrossing....a corporation fueled by the MTV corporation. Engrossing?..it really wasnt. It was grossingly boring by the time i started read the 30th page. The back of the book also says it was a riveting biography. The things are said by popular sources like People Magazine. This book was so boring to the point where I am starting to beleive that the author payed these people to say the things that they said. : &quot;never judge a book by its cover&quot;,I learned my lesson. This book cover looked so nice, attractive, it made me want to pick it up right away. Id have to say the best part of the book was the cover. The frist few pages were okay only because it talked about Michael Jordan, then the book just hit rock bottom. I was reading the book with the same emotion when i have to choke down bitter medicine. If u have insomnia, read this book. I promise it will be ur cure."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Read this book! Unfortunately named 'Just do It' (and sounding like a company shill piece in the process), this is actually a fascinating look at Nike and its founder, Phil Knight. Whenever the subject is Knight, you cannot put the book down. He is a truly remarkable individual.Katz covers all dimensions of the Nike juggernaut: the Knight engima; Nike's rebirth after the rise of the inferior (in Knight's estimation) Reebok aerobic sneaker in the mid-eighties; its association with Michael Jordan; the jocky world of the Ekins; the designs of Tinker Hatfield and other shoe creators; its relationships with Weiden Kennedy (developers of its ad campaigns); and its offshore manufacturing difficulties.To me, the visits into Knight's inner sanctums are worth the price of the book, and make it a truly fascinating read. You get to see the man behind the wrap-around shades, and he turns out to be a fascinating, complex character.. you come away from the book with an understanding of Knight's athletic background, his hatred of Olympic-style 'officialdom,' and his will to win. As much as Bill Gates defines Microsoft's corporate character, Knight does for Nike."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"While I found Just Do It an interesting, well-written book, the book was obviously partial to Nike and Phil Knight. After reading this book, I was unsure if I could take the Nike Company at face value. Katz glosses over the issue of Nike's sweatshops, a topic which I was very interested in, and hoped to learn more about through this book. Nike is known for its powerful advertising, and Just Do It gave me many insights to the great extent that Nike goes to in making the perfect commercial."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Liberally drawing examples from interviews with well-known athletes, Katz paints a picture of Nike as a company that makes great shoes, knows how to negotiate, and created the idea of the athlete as a brand. He shows the power Nike has in creating an image of an athlete, and fitting that image into a Nike ad campaign. The athlete gets more of a newly-identifyable image than Nike. I'm not a big sports fan, and I don't know if I've ever worn Nikes, but I was found this book to be a good read from a business and marketing perspective - as well as to hear about some big-name athletes."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Donald Katz explores the riveting culture of Nike and the founder Phil Knight, CEO. He ventures into the past to examine the development of Phil Knight's perennial powerhouse from the ground up. Just Do It, not only focuses on the structure and culture of Nike but the image that feeds the fire. Katz visits Nike as it began as a two man operation importing shoes and unleashing into a 4 billion dollar empire. Katz takes the opportunity to visit the World Campus in Beaverton, Oregon and go inside the Nike engine. Along the way he visits Knight and observes the relationship he exhibits with his subordinates and management approach. Knight has given employees a sense of pride and loyalty to work for the domestic and international swoosh that appears in markets everywhere. Not only is Nike a perennial powerhouse in the shoe industry but it has brought out the ability to raise the image of athletes into pure dominating creatures. With an increase in money moving in and out of Nike it now has the capabilities to unite athletes with contracts amounting in hundreds of thousands of dollars. Katz has the opportunity to explore the adventures of capturing such contracts and the relationship Knight and Nike both play in making them happen. Phil Knight through the shoe industry has redefined sport. He created mini-Michael Jordans and Andre Agassis' all over the world. Just Do It takes a close look at the marketing strategies that have given birth to Bo Diddley, Air Jordan, Mr. Robinson and many other Nike creations. This book is very captivating as Katz does examine the inside of this organization which is like no other. This is an excellent view of organizational culture and the development of true loyalty."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"Well, what can I say except that I expected to be given more insights into managerial techniques that have driven NIKE to the top and not a eulogy of Phil Knight. I'm sure Knight is a great guy but there is more to Nike than Knight. The author has given a lop sided view of Nike and looks at the entire industry with a distinct bias. Reebok and Adidas are treated as if they are some alien force out to destroy the world. I will not recommend this book to anyone. One thing for sure is that I will think a million times before venturing to buy a book written by Katz again."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"I don't know what Katz' fascination is with Nike. He's not from Portland, not a personal friend of Phil Knight(though you'd wonder after reading this)but really looks at Nike as it is the gold standard of all companies. I read the book before I started working at Nike and I found two completely different worlds. I'm sure at the time the book was written(94) there had only been one layoff(in 15 year history), and employees did follow the company with blind allegiance, but times have changed. With the un-ignorable exploitation of Asian labor and several company layoffs in the past few years to appease wall street, employees are more objective. They can see the inherent flaws of the company...the same as every other large, arrogant, and bureaucratic organization. I now work for another company in the industry, and I can tell almost no differences. Despite what Katz says, employees don't work until 9 every night and think of coming to work as &quot;going to the homecoming Big Ten football game&quot;. This book reads like the employee propaganda they used to distribute to us in quarterly meetings. Maybe Katz is a stockholder..who knows?"},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"This is probably the fairest look at Nike you will find. Far from being a mere tribute to the company, &quot;Just Do It&quot; looks at Nike's triumphs and failures. Excellent insight into the business strategy and the creation and maintenance of &quot;the Nike image&quot;. It's nice to read something unbiased after all the Nike-bashing that has gone on in the media. This book makes a great companion to &quot;Swoosh&quot; which is the actual history of the company. I read them back to back (Swoosh first) and it was great."},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"always intrested in nike as well as big snekaker head although a lil outdated book, still very intresting and many good points"},{"Title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. What I expected was a thrilling and informative history on one of the most iconic brands in recent American history. Instead, I got a choppy story that I felt fell very short of what I expected.To give the benefit of the doubt, it could be that since this book was written 15 years ago, I expected more. While so much has happened at Nike since then and so many more athletes had come onto the scene since Michael Jordan, it could be the what I need is a more recent history and profile in order to be satisfied. Therefore, if anything, I urge the author to write a sequel or follow up book on the events at Nike in the past 15 years.Nevertheless, I still feel that the flow of the book could have been better. Each chapter starts at a certain point in history and then gives flashbacks or observations of the history of the company. I personally do not like that style of writing.Overall, this book is fair at best.

There are plenty, especially the spirit of the place, which one quickly realizes is the heart and soul.Bookcased by Air Jordan's entry and retire, Katz in good prose that flows well style relates how a middle-distance runner and his coach and eventually some Japanese shoes turned into the giant Swoosh Just Do It corporate wonder. For those of us from this time in our history, one distinctly remembers the embodiment of that spirit, Prefontaine.You see the dominant style of the venture comes from the playing fields, and many customers for it shoes can feel it, and so they buy it. Others are caught up in its powerful draft, not understanding at all the athletic side. Knight does, and he and his company relished it and grew it. Amazing. I remember setting right next to a mother and her teenage son, both of us guys trying on cross-training shoes. Me, non-Nike, and this young kid insisted he would only wear Air Jordan. The salesman said they didn't have any in that style in his small foot size, the smallest size 2-3 sizes too big. The salesman said it would be harmful to his feet to wear them, but the kid was incensed to have them on. And mom gave in. Stunned, I was. Then to hear about what kids would do to have these shoes.I relate to all of this as one who never really cared personally for those who stood for the Swoosh ala McEnroe, but respected very much their talent and drive. That's my response to their history and this fascinating chronicle of it: I don't really care personally for what they were about, but have great respect for their drive and talent.

In fact, those steamy scenes are what one look forward to read about in her books. In that aspect, the book did not disappoint.Trixi was quick to succumb to the charm of Pasha and lust of her own, so quick that all claims of her naivety sounded quite hypocritical. Then followed by the sex scenes in the coach on the way from Paris to Calais. There was something naughty and wanton about. Sex is very much on the mind of both characters, until Pasha felt compelled to go off and fight a war in Greece.Really, I found it not very convincing for Pasha to fight a war just to help his friends. He was not a soldier like his dad and he was supposed to be the manager of their family wealth and enterprises. That conveniently set the scene for Trixi to be pursued by her enemy and travelled all the way to Greece to see Pasha, Of course, that set the scene for her to be captured, sexually toyed by her captor and then rescued by Pasha. This erotic scene at the Turk's tent mirrored that of 'Love Storm', though disappointingly brief and tame in comparison.Overall, the sex scenes were exciting enough but not refreshingly imaginative. The story had a flimsy plot and the characters lack depth. So be clear of what you want out of the book to avoid disappointment."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"As a newcomer to Susan Johnson's work, I was delighted to discover her less-than-usual approach to the romance genre. In A Touch of Sin, the heroine is no virgin - sexy and beautiful, Trixi is a willing participant in the book's steamy scenes of sex and love. The hero, Pasha, is one of the best male characters I've ever encountered. He's handsome, sensual, charming and physically appealing. What a combination! I also enjoyed the historical setting and the fact that Johnson included pages of footnotes to give credibility and background to her love story. Overall, a great read - I'm now searching for all the Susan Johnson I can find!"},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"This is the second book I have read by Ms. Johnson(first being 'Love Storm' 2 yrs ago)and I should've known. Nothing has changed. Not that I am knocking her for writing it, writing is a difficult process and I commend her for it, but this wasn't, shall we say, my 'cup of tea'.The hero, Pasha Duras was too callous and sex starved to be believable as a 'romance hero' and Trixi was too dimwitted to be a true 'romance heroine'. The two had sex nonstop throughout the book and it got tiring. It was more like a porno with an elaborate plot. The history is great and very interesting, and I wish Ms. Johnson would try and write more romance into her stories and bring the characters more to life. All the sex, and I mean sex, cause there is pages and pages of just explicit sex here, just seems to cloud the plot. I found the plot interesting, but everytime I was just getting into it more, the sex came back, full force, lol. Don't get me wrong here, I read Beatrice Small and other 'frank' writers, but this was just tedious.~Beatrix Grosvenor, or Trixi as she is known, was caught in a bad postion when she was found locked in a Parisian apartment, nude and horrified while her captor lay dead with an ax through his skull. All the months of being held prisoner by the man was enough to drive her crazy, but when the man was murdered right in front of her, Trixi felt like she had lost her mind!Pasha Duras was also stunned to find the very man he wanted to strangle already dead and a nude woman standing on the bed in shock. Did she kill him? No, she couldn't have, she wasn't covered in blood and the weapon was missing. There was something about her that made him want to shelter and protect her. Soon the notorious rake of Paris found himself accompanying her home to Kent, England and falling in love. But love would come with a price...Trixi was being hunted by someone intent on killing her and her son. Pasha would have to open his heart and mind in order to save her. A hard feat for a rake of his repute...I heartily wish it were a better tale, but the sex got in the way for me and ruined the intricate plot Ms. Johnson wove so well...a shame...Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I'll admit it, I love everything Susan Johnson writes. The heroes are heroic - in bed and out! - and the heroines are never shrinking violets. This book did not disappoint me. I can hardly wait for her next!"},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I am a Susan Johnson fan, or I USED to be a major fan. To me, what makes her books a good read : her wonderful way of weaving the language - it's like reading a marvellously written poetry, the language is sooo elegant, so quaint - in brief, BEAUTIFUL.But this book is a MAJOR disappointment! I even checked the name on the cover several times, to check whether this is REALLY Susan Johnson. I hate the heroine. Trixie (the name itself is an embarrassment in such sophiticated surroundings in the book) is soo...FRAIL of willpower, succumbs so easily to temptation. I prefer the strong, intelligent and independent character of Flora Bonham in Pure Sin. And the hero in this book is a total turnoff too. Oh yeah, he's very good-looking, but he has no depth in character. He has an air of aimlessness, irresponsibility. I prefer Adam Serre of Pure SIn - now THAT is a MAN. Or Kit Braddock in Brazen. Those are good strong men, with brains to match. The hero in this book seems to be an 'airhead'. I guess he is the perfect match for this Trixie character, who, to me, is a bimbo. The storyline is flat, the erotic scenes make up most of the pages of the book, which is disgusting after a while, and I find myself losing interest after the first few pages. What a waste of money.I do not recommend this book to others. If you like to read Johnson's books, I'd suggest Pure Sin, Brazen and even Wicked. You'll find Susan Johnson in her element there, but not in this book.I would rate this book with \\"no Star\\" if that is possible."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I purchased this book hoping that it wouldn't read the same as many of Susan Johnson's other books, but it didn't. The plot is the same - gorgeous man finds woman in distress, takes her into his home, has sex with her. Yes, that's what romances are about, but Johnson keeps using the same scenario - if you've read one of the Kuzan line or one of the Dumas line you've read all of them. You could easily exchange the name of Sasha Kuzan for Pasha Dumas and it really wouldn't make much of a difference. Her 'trademarks' are getting old. She needs a new plot twist besides a war and the capturing of the heroine. She needs a plot that doesn't involve first night sex, the philandering hero who feels the same emotions at the same time, the reconciliation that always occurs in the same fashion with the hero and the heroine feeling the same things as every other hero and heroine, and if I have to read one more time that the hero is so distraught over the pain endured by his true love in childbirth (&quot;He turned pale watching her suffer, wincing at each labor pain, deciding, as the ordeal continued for what seemed endless hours that he would see that she never had another child.&quot;) I may scream. Every hero says it or thinks it! Every book is the same!!! Sure her books are hot. Sure they're sexy. But its the same sex!

I have read &quot;A Touch of Sin&quot; twice because I love Pasha. He is gorgeous, he is spoiled, he is sensual and you can't help but love him. Trixi is also far more easy to like than most romance novel heroines and it is great fun to watch the interaction between the two. I will admit that Susan's characters throughout her books do tend to all sound alike. But if you read as much as I do, then it won't bother you to return to an author you can trust every now and then to read about your favorite leading ladies and gentlemen with new names, in a new lusty adventure."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I agree this is one of her worst books, but I love most of her older books and am looking forward to future books.

Jumping in bed with other men and her continous love making with Pashsa even though she didn't love him then. If you read it, you would understand what i mean. It's a disgusting and not even a romance story. It's more of an erotic story with a big plot. I recommend Catherine Coulter!

Somehow though, it just didn't add up to one of her best novels. For anyone who's read any of Ms. Johnson's other books, this one pales by comparison. It was a bit contrived. I got the feeling that it was written following a successful formula or something - add a sexual fantasy scene here, insert villain at this point, etc. Some of her other books (e.g., &quot;Sinful&quot;, &quot;Taboo&quot;) were &quot;gourmet meal&quot; entertainment. This one was less sustaining by comparison."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I am a big fan of Susan Johnson -- or, should I say, I used to be a big fan. I think BRAZEN and PURE SIN are among the best of all romance novels -- wonderful, fiery love stories. But the last two or three books have really degenerated into emotionless sex-fests and A TOUCH OF SIN is no different.From the moment our hero meets the heroine -- she's stark naked, of course -- the tale is one of sexual excess. This wouldn't be a problem for me, if in return I got any sense of these characters as people. Unfortunately, hero and heroine aren't developed in any depth and therefore their love (and their sex) means nothing.And Johnson's getting lazy, too. Fans, check through the books and see how many times a hero says to the heroine, &quot;I'm going to f--k you to death.&quot; Sometimes it's more than once each book. Another oft-repeated Johnson theme is the sexual dynamo hero utterly amazed by the way the heroine, despite her lack of sexual experience, enchants him in the sack. While this is standard romance novel territory, Johnson repeats this theme in the exact same language in all of her recent books.All in all, a disappointing effort from a writer who can do much better and has in the past. Don't waste your money on this one -- try BRAZEN instead."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I have been a Susan Johnson fan for several years. Her stories of the Lakota Indian family (I forgot the name, but Blaze is the mother) were wonderful. Her stories are always hot and sexy with real relationships between passionate people who are not afraid to express their love for each other. While this book had her trademarks, it seemed very contrived with her trying too hard to put the hero and heroine into situations that you knew were made up just to be made up.I love her still, however, and hope she recaptures the spirit of Blaze's family in her future books.I hate to critique, however, because if I could write I'd be doing it."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"I have read several of Susan Johnson Novels and this has to be the best one yet.

It is the second one that I have read and it most certainly pales in comparison to the first book I read by her &quot;Golden Paradise&quot;. Of all the reviews that I have read, no one seems to have mentioned this particular book, and I wonder why. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of intrigue, passion and love between Stephan and Lisaveta. I recommend that fans of Susan Johnson read &quot;Golden Paradise&quot; instead of this one."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"Wow, what a great read!! I am hooked on Susan Johnson. Her historical references add credibility to her novels. I picked up this book, along with several that were written by other authors, while I was at home on extended sick leave. The cover of the book caught my eye, and I subsequently read it in one day. It was a pleasure to read about the history of Greece; I am of Greek descent and have heard stories of the very battles Ms. Johnson describes in the book. This was truly exceptional."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"Susan Johnson, renowned for her erotic historical romances (see OUTLAW and TABOO), adds luster to her deserved fame with her latest torrid tale, A TOUCH OF SIN. The story line is trademark Johnson, filled with heat, more heat, ultra heat, and laser heat in an exotic locale. The lead characters burn the pages, while the support cast adds the authenticity of the period to the plot. Though winter may still be in the air when this book is released, readers will be able to save on heating oil with this rousing romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"The intriguing mystery of a naked woman and a bloody corpse is brusquely dismissed in the first two chapters as the author quickly precedes to cut and paste a hodgepodge of lust (not love) scenes and plot devises as inexplicable and leaden as her main characters. The hero is like a faint, pale rubbing of the vividly sensual urbanity of Apollo Kuzan from 'Sweet Love, Survive'. So similar were they, that I kept expecting Pasha to refer to Apollo's family and history as his own. The author's attempt to fuse a mindlessly horny blonde bimbo with a victimized, repressed, and yet devoted English mother, only succeeds in leaving the character of Trixi bafflingly inconsistent and unbelievable. My disorientation was increased when I recognized the harem scene in Greece as a Cleft Note version of the one from 'Love Storm' ! She has written better books. All in all, I would characterize this book as a sort of 'Ken and Barbie do Period Porn': plastic, pointless and painfully embarrassing."},{"Title":"A Touch of Sin","review":"Just finished reading A TOUCH OF SIN!!! This is Susan Johnson's most erotic book to date. LOVE STORM and TABOO come close BUT this particular book wins hands down.The Characters are larger than life and the story is better than a 5 night miniseries.There is plenty of lust,greed,destruction,sex,love,passion,more sex, and finally a simple happy ending.However, I should warn the book does contain some rough language and the words used between the hero and the heroine while they make love may not be for the faint of heart.That said I enjoyed it tremendously!!!"},{"Title":"Russian: Elementary course","review":"This is an old school type of text.

Norman Douglas wrote about places he lived, and we are fortunate that his masterpiece, South Wind, shows off his unequalled flair for capturing in prose the Mediterranean vistas, hillsides and small villages of his favorite island, Capri. Thrown in for good measure is a delighful and wickedly urban - one might better say Catholic (or even Roman) in the best sense - view of the foibles of humankind. Douglas spent much of his adult life in exile for sexual behavior, perhaps peccadillos, perhaps worse: his novel certainly does nothing to assuage bourgeois respectability. In it's day, 1917, South Wind was deliberately risque. There is even a murder mystery, though Douglas pays only a very discreet nod to that genre.But it's for the prose depictions of the Mediterranean landscapes, done in glorious and unforgetable language, that we read South Wind. The passages conveying the timelessness of the great grotto are simply magisterial. If you think Durrell captures the Mediterranean better than any other English writer you have not read Douglas. Do not lump Douglas, because of his subject matter in this book, with Firbank: South Wind is emphatically better than the verbal high-jinks of Firbank, whose over-indulgent books never convincingly connect with reality. Douglas, by contrast, can write as telling and visually acute a piece of descriptive prose as Mark Twain.A dated book for most, an unforgettable book for the connoisseur. If you appreciate the prose of South Wind there are several other equally well-written examples of his work in the travel books, especially Siren Land, Fountains in the Sand, and Old Calabria."},{"Title":"The South Wind","review":"Norman Douglas (1868-1952) spent a good part of his life abroad and Capri was the adoptive home of his last years. In 1911, he had already written a travel book on the Island and Sorrentine Peninsula (Siren Land), but in 1917 he issued his first novel \\"South Wind\\", that became one of the most popular reads during WWI (it is stated that many soldiers had it in their backpack).It has been defined as a conversation-novel without a plot, and its characters actually do nothing else than exchange their ideas and opinions (on the flow of existence, moral, comparative theology, aesthetics, fanaticism, medicine, cooking) as typical of Rablesian prose or what could have taken place in a respectable London club. The voices mix and tangle, endlessly and obsessively interrogating themselves with humor and intellectual disenchantment. But \\"South Wind\\" is before all else the discovery of the South, the Mediterranean, the profane art of living, modelled on ancient Greece, that Italy and Capri in particular seemed then to embody.An Anglican Bishop Mr Thomas Heard, on his way back from Africa (imaginary Bampopo) to England, visits for a short stay the Island of Nepenthe (Capri), where his cousin is staying. He will stay only a few days, but long enough to change his northern pruderie in a empathic attitude toward the worlds vices (\\"the frolicsome perversity\\"), starting from a crime he involuntarily peeps upon. The novel is full of characters: Denis, the caste poet worried by the possibility of sinning, the smiling completely pagan Italian priest Don Francesco, the \\"evil\\" Muhlen, the sceptic and artistic count Caloveglia, the \\"extravagant\\" Mr. Keith, \\"owner of one of the most beautiful villa's in Capri\\", the cousin Meadows, Miss Wilberforce an funny alcoholic that undresses in public, the rich van Koppen, the Russian mystic Bazhakulov, halfway between Rasputin and a bolschevic with his tribe of followers, Mrs. Steynlin a still appealing middle age matron that entertains a relation with a young Russian, Mr. Ernst Eames a commentator of the ancient history of Nepenthe written by a seventeenth century Italian historian. All these characters are actually inspired by people Douglas met in Capri during those roaring years as he states later on in his memory books. The Scirocco, the South Wind sweeps the Island, and everyone starts behaving strangely, or exactly like they feel like, which is the reason why the went to Nepenthe in the first place, and Bishop Heard is caught up in a spider web of distinguo and doubts until the wind strips away his moral imperatives in favour of Nepenthe's \\"pantheistic hedonism\\" and makes him \\"swim in the air\\".The roots of this novel can be traced to the concept of \\"Reverse Conversion\\" or the more modern \\"Going Native\\" that was popular in those times and is often used by D.H.Lawrence, James Hilton and others. (D.H.Lawrence used Norman Douglas as the model for his Aaron in \\"Aaron's Rod\\"). Part of the plot is borrowed from Nathaniel Hawthorne's \\"The Marble Faun\\" as has been interestingly pointed out by Edmund Wilson. However, if we want to read it in the historical context it was written in and explain its lasting success to the 1930's, we must take into account that it was intended (Fussell) as \\"a rebuke to the winds of war that were gathering in the North of Europe\\", \\"a plea for youth and tolerance to the nations that were starting a suicidal war\\", but it is also a celebration of the ideas liberally generated and exposed. These ideas were those discussed in that period in the intellectual milieu and are still popular today among young people.Even if this is an \\"antiquarian book\\", I enjoyed it very much. As I said of \\"Siren Land\\", best read on a terrace overlooking \\"The Piazzetta\\"."},{"Title":"The South Wind","review":"I hope that this gem of a book is reprinted soon. For all those who cannot wait, wend to the Strand bookstore on Broadway and 12th in NYC, and check out the Modern Library section; a few copies may still linger. Like its title, the book sweeps over the reader in a sort of halcyon gale of language. Read once, the book must be re-read just so that one can retrace the plot. When not totally high on language I got glimpses of two of the most vivid characters in literature -- Mr. Keith and Count Calovaglia -- and that what it was - a glimpse. Like the South Wind of the title, the book leaves the reader terribly thirsty for more -- more of the island, more of the people, more of the flora, more of the rocks, for crying out loud. It has the sense and immediacy of an impressionist painting. In the 1924 Modern Library copy I possess, Douglas has an introduction in which he enumerates the islands that inspired the locale in the book.

I would guess that I have spotted over a hundred errors. They do not undermine the quality of the story, but do make it harder to read. This book is in the public domain and so is available on the web in HTML format, possibly with fewer errors. That said, I am glad to have a printed version of this book. Reading or printing it from the web would be a cumbersome enterprise.EDIT: 2008, The book description now says that it was published in 2007.

Very little plot and characters that are observed well but with little meaningful or interesting interaction between them. Some people will definitely be amused by some of the eccentric characters but at over 400 pages long this alone is not sufficient to maintain interest. The murder on page 360 was after a long slog. Read it if social history about foreigners living on a small island circa 1900 in the mediterranean (the fictitious island of Nepenthe in the book) is your special interest.

Some of the material was very good, especially the parts on phrase structure rules and syntactic categories. Everything after chapter 5, however, made little sense and was just too thick and murky to wade through. The sections on anaphora, passives, raising, and control were very difficult to understand. Keep in mind that this is coming from a beginner's perspective, and perhaps people with more of a background in syntax will have a much better time with it. However, as an introduction to syntactic theories and concepts it was not a very helpful book."},{"Title":"Album: Cuentos del mundo hispnico, Tercera edicion","review":"I ordered this book for a college Spanish class.

Development of Shakespeare's StyleVIII. Editing ShakespeareA Short Reading List=========================================I don't really know what two- and three-star reviewers expected from this book. Presumably they are seasoned Bardolaters with decades of Shakespearean experience and an intimate knowledge of the complete Shakespeare canon. I wish they would share their wisdom about the big shortcomings of this little book.Now, this uncommonly rewarding for its slimness volume is strictly and exclusively designed for perfect newcomers to Shakespeare. I should have thought this is obvious from the title. So Bardomaniacs should steer clear of it. To neophytes it can't be recommended highly enough.Since it was first published in 1939 and last revised in 1954, of course it's dated. Or is it really? I would venture the highly speculative and outrageously uninformed opinion that just about the most dated part is the dating of the plays; a couple of dates may an year or two off, perhaps one or two dubious collaborations or lost works are omitted. Who cares? The book is just over 50 years old. Shakespeare has been dead for nearly 400.It may in passing be noted that more recent Shakespearean scholarship doesn't necessarily mean \\"any better than the old school\\". Why on earth, I wonder, did Penguin have to commission new introductions (and hideous covers!) to all plays for their current (new?) Penguin Shakespeare edition? With very few exceptions among the most obscure plays, this \\"new\\" edition reprints the texts and the commentaries from the old New Penguin Shakespeare, most of which first appeared during the period 1967-80 and did indeed contain newly edited texts. All volumes also included lengthy introductions by the editors. These are now dispensed with in favour of the \\"most up-to-date critical interpretations\\". Balls! The few examples I have compared so far are as up-to-date as Shakespeare with a laptop.Fans of the Penguin Popular Classics series would be familiar with the name of George Bradshaw Harrison, or simply G. B. Harrison if you're on friendly terms. (Or simply G.B.H., but that's dangerous because it reminds one of G.B.S.) True to their disrespectful nature, Penguin never bother to credit the editor properly: you have to struggle with the eye-killing font on the copyright page to know who supplied these charming essays on Shakespeare, the Elizabethan stage and the play in question, not to mention the invaluable notes and glossary.Truth is, G. B. Harrison is quite a notable Shakespearean scholar. Not only did he edit all of the Bard's plays (also available in one volume as \\"The Complete Works\\"), but he actually wrote a number of books on Shakespeare, his works and his times. When you look inside those garish wonders from the current Penguin Shakespeare, you might be led to believe that Stanley Wells and T. J. B. Spencer, both of their names printed on the very first page, have originated the Penguin version of Shakespearean scholarship more or less singlehandedly. Not quite. Before them, G.B.H. was the boss in Penguin/Pelican/Puffin/Cockatoo/Woodpecker/Sparrow/Nightingale/Swallow/etc.Mr Harrison starts (excluding his short preface) with a chapter on \\"The Legend of Shakespeare\\", in which he shows by extensive quotes of great authorities (Dryden, Pope, Dr Johnson, Coleridge) how during the centuries Shakespeare was transformed into something much like deity. Make no mistake: Will was fabulously successful, popular and rich in his own time. Yet it wasn't until at least half a century after his death that he started to be considered as worthy of immortality, and a whole posthumous century had to pass until his spirit could be sure of it.Then Mr Harrison goes on to relate briefly all \\"Materials for the Life of Shakespeare\\", in other words what we know about him and how we know it. Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Harrison concludes that we know relatively a lot about Will, certainly much more than we know about many of his contemporaries, some of them not quite unknown themselves (e.g. Lizzy I or that naughty boy Walter Raleigh). The author also points out, wisely, that not all types of sources are equally dependable: written documents are one thing, printed plays are another, oral anecdotes yet another.\\"The Modern Approach to Shakespeare\\" is the only obviously dated part of the book. Yet it is by no means useless as a historical glimpse. Mr Harrison's point, in a nutshell, is that the world-wide mass depression after Bradley published his sublime lectures on the four great tragedies in 1904 was - well, it didn't last. Bradley is still read rather widely, but hardly anybody considers him the last word on these mighty tragedies. Funny that once upon a time many did.After that follow chapters on Shakespeare's own company, the Elizabethan playhouse, the Shakespeare canon, the developing of the Bard's style and even the ever-controversial subject of editing his \\"originals\\". All these essays are very short, but I venture to suggest that none is superficial. Each chapter is packed with stupendous amount of fascinating details, often spiced up with Mr Harrison's sharply blunt opinions.One of the things that makes the book a real pleasure to read is the writing. To put it briefly, Mr Harrison writes with beautiful simplicity and delightful sense of humour. Do you often encounter this combination in Shakespearean scholars? If you do, perhaps you would like to recommend some books to me.The author, I'm pleased to say, suffers from no form of goofy adulation. Bardolatry, like any other form of idolatry, is a most harmful self-limitation. Mr Harrison would have no truck with those of his colleagues (Harold Goddard, for one) according to whom Shakespeare could neither do any wrong nor write a single superfluous word.One indeed wonders at such Bardomania. Surely Shakespeare's plays, most if not all of them at any rate, are far from perfect. But in this special case you can worship Will as God and yet excuse every fault you find in his poetry/plots/characters/whatever. Just say it was the filthy editors from the later centuries, or some nasty bloke among his contemporaries sneaked in after midnight and rewrote this or that speech so that it now makes no sense at all. Why this Bardolatry then?Never mind. Mr Harrison would have none of it. He makes no bones that Shakespeare, though a gifted writer from the beginning, took quite a few years and quite a few plays to develop this unique blend of word power, striking imagery and psychological depth that have made him - well, what he is, whatever that is. Many passages in Richard III, Love Labour's Lost and Romeo and Juliet, to name but three examples, are artificial to a fault, reflect Will's childish delight in playing with words for no better reason than mere fun, or simply refer too specifically to topical matters that have long turned into dust.Mr Harrison calls Lady Capulet's famous comparison of Paris with a book that Juliet may behold \\"tediously clever\\". I disagree but I do see his point; and that's a wickedly smart description indeed. Like the old Capulet's comparison of his weeping daughter with a bark at sea, it does look like a contrived self-display of cleverness. It is hardly in character with the rest of the lines given to the Capulets. All the same, I (as a director-producer) wouldn't cut these lines because some prima donna (of either sex) has problems with the pronunciation.Many of Mr Harrison's points are rather subtle and hardly for beginners. Some of them can be found in his editions of the plays in the Penguin Popular Classics. For example, his perceptive discussion about the expressive purpose of different types of speech in Othello comes almost straight from his notes to this play, whereas his speculative staging of Romeo and Juliet based on careful analysis of the stage directions even enjoys a separate essay in the corresponding volume.An even more extreme example of Shakespearean subtlety is Mr Harrison's quoting the famous speech of Antony \\"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears\\" twice - all of it! - the differences being only in the punctuation. He concludes that later editors should be beaten into pulp (or other words to that effect anyway) for meddling with things they don't understand. Whether Shakespeare had anything to do with the punctuation in the Folio is hotly debatable (he most probably didn't), but it's rather irrelevant all the same. The punctuation is dramatic, designed for reading the text aloud; that's why Mr Harrison thinks it should be kept intact, and changed only when really necessary for dramatic reasons (which is not often). He even goes to compare both versions of the speech to the same piece of music played by a professional and by an amateur. Striking comparison!So, where were we? Yes, at the conclusion. So, are you a newly converted Shakespearean maniac cynical enough not to regard the Bard as Godhead who needs a brief but brilliant introduction to the subject by an eminent scholar who happens to a fine writer as well? If yes, then this is the perfect book for you. Don't rush for Bill Bryson; you can read that later. Second-hand copies of Mr Harrison's book are widely available for a pittance. Be sure to get a (post-)1954 edition and enjoy."},{"Title":"Introducing Shakespeare (Pelican books)","review":"The works of Shakespeare collected in a household are symbols of English culture. In Shakespeare's day the stage was not respectable. Dryden deemed Shakespeare naturally learned. In 1709 Shakespeare was established as a classic by Nathanael Rowe. Pope praised him lavishly. Dr. Johnson wrote his famous preface to Shakespeare. To Coleridge Shakespeare was an emanation of the Godhead.The life of Shakespeare is constructed from documents, tradition, literary references, and his work. All writers betray their origin. In 1592, age 28, William Shakespeare emerged as a person in English life. Henslowe's DIARY 1592-1602 gives a pretty good account of theater conditions. From 1594 Shakespeare belonged to the Lord Chamberlain's Company. In 1603 the company became the King's Players. His burial is recorded in 1616.He was regarded as a great writer from the first. Shakespeare studies may be divided into the scholarly, the literary and the dramatic. Studies have been made of the texts, punctuation, words and terms, poetic techniques, and readers' responses, appreciation. Harley Granville Barker 1910-1913 had the plays acted just as they were written.Greene, Kyd and Marlowe had all died by 1594. For a short time Shakespeare was the only dramatist with a reputation. Drama is most imediately affected by material circumstances. The average life of a new play was about 10 performances. The Elizabethan actor was a busy man. The company was a fellowship of players. They worked in a share system.There is a list of the plays with approximate dates and a discussion of the measures taken to establish the Shakespeare canon. In style the best and worst of Shakespeare's immature style appears in ROMEO AND JULIET. THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, two years later, is more advanced. In the first part of HENRY IV he shows he is a master fo the medium. LEAR, 1606, shows concentration of thought in its language. In MACBETH imagery is thickly clotted. ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, 1607, has a sort of resonance. Some see THE TEMPEST as the final and greatest play. In editing the editor's worst difficulties come when there are two or more early texts.The book is simple and enlightening. The author is a great scholar of Shakespeare and provides a nice overview of the field."},{"Title":"Essential Pathology","review":"I have had a chance to review the new edition coming this fall and it is a spectacular book.

It was what I was hoping for."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Like many other parents who have heard about this all famous classic, I've read this book with great eagerness. The disappointment produced by is is not negligible, so I give it two stars out of five.Judged in isolation, perhaps this book deserves three stars. But considering this book is a famous classic, two stars is more appropriate. After finishing reading it, I had the impulse to give it one star only. But considering this book is a famous classic, two stars is more appropriate.The book fails to deliver both in form and in content.First of all, the form. The book consists of ten chapters, one epilogue and three appendices. The core of the book is formed of the ten chapters. Each chapter addresses one major problem, more or less in isolation.Each chapter is formed of sections, each section addressing one aspect of the major problem addressed by the chapter. So far, so good: the book seems well organized, with no piece information overlapping senselessly other areas.The problem with this approach is that this book is not meant to be descriptive. It is not a scientific treaty describing the problems that may arise between parent and child. It is a formative book, something that is supposed to teach the parents something. Because learning is an evolutionary process, the gradual growth in understanding should have been reflected by the book's structure.Imagine that: you are a parent, you want to improve the relationship with your child and you use this book to help yourself. How do you start and where from? How do you design a program that teaches you what to do? What should come first? Is there a difference in importance between various parts? Nothing in the book suggests anything in this direction.In terms of form, that's not all. As mentioned above, each section addresses one aspect of the main problem of the chapter. The author provides explanations, principles and examples (the \\"case studies\\" which are pervasive in all self-help psychology books). The problem is that there is not clear division between the three. Sometimes the section starts with an explanation, introduces a \\"case study\\" (with no separation between the two) only to continue with explanation after the \\"case study\\" as if we're not reading a book containing a minimum of rigor but we're listening to casual talk.If the form of this book is less than perfect, it is the CONTENT that leaves the most to desire. Remembering its content, I am still amazed at how this material became an all time classic.The greatest sin this book commits is that it doesn't do what it preaches. It says over and over that the parents are judgmental towards their children; that they start criticizing the children when they should start with empathy and understanding. Yet, when addressing the parent, the author does EXACTLY the same: he begins with criticizing the parent and only afterward continues with what the parent has to do.The book rightfully states that \\"love and patience\\" are meaningless words in the absence of effective educational skills. Yet, the only thing it does it to replace \\"love and patience\\" with \\"empathy and understanding\\". The \\"empathy and understanding\\" occurs so pervasively throughout the book that it becomes something like a miraculous potion that heals any wound and cures any illness.Is \\"empathy and understanding\\" any more obvious than \\"love and patience\\"? I believe it is not; \\"empathy and understanding\\" may be words just as empty as \\"love and patience\\" in the absence of effective communicational skills. Skills that, obviously, \\"Between Parent and Child\\" fails to teach.The book is flooded with \\"case studies\\" that employ a myriad of \\"real names\\". For instance, in the first five pages of the book, the reader gets acquainted with Andy, Nancy, Carol, Susie, Alice, Lea and David. I think the number of characters approaches one hundred for the whole book. Why so many names? Why not naming all John or Mary, forget the false sense of \\"reality\\" and stick with the message these \\"case studies\\" are supposed to transmit?Speaking of \\"case studies\\", the situations they present are, in many cases, so far from reality that they cannot be taken seriously. Does anyone believe that an angry child will instantaneously calm down upon hearing his parent uttering the idiotic remark \\"I know how you feel: you feel angry\\"?Not only that the \\"case studies\\" are outright false in many cases, but they preach false methods, too. Trying to respond \\"calmly\\" to bad behavior may be a great incentive to continue and extend that bad behavior. The author seems to postulate that children are angelic beings, filled with a transcendental moral scent and all we have to do is to manifest \\"empathy and understanding\\" towards the feelings of the child, no matter how bad or destructive those might be.This is utterly false. The author is wrong when he states that \\"emotions are like rivers, we can divert them but never suppress them\\". Recent studies in anger management proved that behavior DOES control emotions and that emotions can be EXTINGUISHED or EXTENDED through behavioral control. Just as \\"unleashing\\" the anger does nothing else than increasing the anger, an attitude of unconditional \\"empathy and understanding\\" towards negative emotions does not necessarily diminish them, but may increase them.The book is right into saying that we should punish behavior but understand emotions. Yet, it fails to acknowledge that such attitude requires a deep change in the parent. Nobody becomes overnight skillful at making the distinction between the behavior (which must be punished and corrected) and the character (which must be protected and nourished). The parent needs help, determination, a comprehensive plan and plenty of time to achieve that - things that this book says nothing about. What you hear instead is that you have to give \\"empathy and understanding\\", the same litany you get from a priest who tells you to stop sinning today without ever showing you how to attain such goal.To conclude the many drawbacks of this book's content, I must say that some advices are outright dangerous. For instance, it suggests that the child be left alone to decide when to go to bed, when to wake up, how to organize his learning effort for school, and so on. This is sheer nonsense. Putting so much responsibility upon the shoulders of a 7 yo child is absurd. Learning how to use someone's own intellectual capacities, to learn how to learn, is perhaps the greatest achievement that organized schooling produces in children. Learning how to learn takes years and years of exercise, from kindergarten to college. Is the parent supposed to leave his child alone in his most important intellectual endeavor? I doubt that very much.Finally, at the root of all the ills of \\"Between Parent and Child\\" lies the fact that the author believes he knows what is our fundamental duty as parents. More precisely, we have, first and foremost, not to upset the child, to ensure a warm climate in the house and to make everything in our powers that no emotional turmoil ever touches our little ones.While these are good and noble goals, it is doubtful that everyone considers such things as his most important duty as a parent and I doubt even more that anyone has the right to suggest what is fundamentally good for someone's child. With all its risks, the essential duty and the most fundamental decisions of child rearing stay with the parents.That's why I prefer books that show methods and principles while abstaining from preaching values. One such book is \\"Family Rules\\" by Dr. Kenneth Kaye, which one can also find on Amazon."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"you can really tell this book is from the seventies or sixties or whatever. its been a while since ive started reading it, therefore i dont remember exact phrases, but it has advice on not saying this or that to your child, and the examples are pretty extreme insults, something no one would say to their kids nowadays anyway. its like saying dont hit your children, when no one in their right minds does that anyway. it might have been new and valuable information 35 years ago, but its not anymore today."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book came highly recommended as a parenting tool.

While I believe that we need to create a loving, safe, and encouraging environment for our children I also believe that there are times when children defy authority and need to be corrected. This book tries to combat the problem before it happens by the way we communicate with them. Although communication is key to the Parent/child relationship, children need to know that the Parent is in charge, that they must obey the first time and without argument. Don't get me wrong, children are a beautiful blessing from God and they need to be nurtured so carefully. But along with that nurturing comes this demand for obedience because I am their authority. The book was light on parental authority and presented parents merely as guides in a child's life rather than an authority to be obeyed and to protect them. I think our society could use a bit more respect for authority."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"The book itself so far is great.

It took time but it worked so well, it was like magic.Not only did our communication improve dramatically but my children became very much in touch with their feelings.They are all grown up now. All have achieved great success in their chosen careers which as you would have guessed involves a lot of communication with people.One of my children became a nurse and during nursing school her professor complimented her on her excellent communication skills. She shared this with me and thanked me for teaching her. I in turn thank Dr. Ginott for teaching me.I have subsequently passed copies on to them for their families."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book helps me to understand my first daugher, 25 months old, and teach me how I should react properly~"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I am almost finished with this fantastic book, and as soon as I'm done I plan on starting over from the beginning. I have already seen how effective using the tools presented have been with my children. It gives a wonderful approach in communication with your child, and through using these techniques we can validate their feelings and emotions. I especially found it useful with my nine year old son, who is very emotional but we have had a difficult time getting past the outbursts and anger to address whatever the core issue is at that time. I can't believe the change I've seen in our conversations when I am speaking to him with some of the skills I've learned with this book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to be a better parent and therefore have better behaved children."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book is everything it says it is. One of the most helpful parts for me is the end. The book gives specific situations and how to handle them specifically. For example, there is a section on intense sibling rivalry, on recent trauma, and more. I do not have the book in front of me, but it was helpful to read through things that weren't discussed in the book.While my parenting style already adapts many of the principles in the book, I was a little shocked to realize that my words and my tone didn't match my style. I think I expected my four year old to take my meaning even when I wasn't being clear. This book has, above all, helped me to really understand how my four year old hears me.It deserves each of the five stars I gave it, and I think that all parents should read this book."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Seriously, I just want to memorize every single sentence in this enire book. What a deep philosophy and practical and effective tips!!!"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Totally love this book. I read the old edition first from the library and decided to purchase my own. It teaches you very valuable social skills that I believe you can use beyond just with children. It is the same basic idea of how to be understanding to others and respectful to others. When I was reading the book, I had some doubts about is this really going to work, but then I reflected on my own childhood, my mother and father pretty much did every single thing the book tells you not to, and I know how I felt and how it affected me to today. Therefore, I am very willing to try out this kind of thinking on my own children."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I read this when my kids were young (they're now 33, 32 & 27) and I was a beginning teacher of middle school and high school students (just finished my 36th year). This plus Ginott's BETWEEN PARENT AND TEENAGER formed the basis of my philosophy of dealing with kids. If you read this in conjunction with other level-headed dealing-with-your-child books, you'll have a calmer time at home, an actual relationship with your kids, and, in my case, a more succesful work life. BTW, the other book that changed my life was CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book changed our lives. The chapters are short and to the point. I give this book to every parent I know. I had problems with my child because I kept telling him to be a good boy. We shouldn't tell a child to be good because they will prove to us they are not good. Excellent book. Stop all the fighting in our house."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"It was wonderful to re-read this classic; the seminal attempt at translating the therapeutic understanding of ways to communicate with children into an approach that parents and teachers could use. Looking back, it was followed by a movement in such books as Parent Effectiveness Training, Systematic Training for Effective Parenting and dozens of other such books and approaches. The latest manifestation is social skills training. The timeless quality of Ginott was the understanding he showed in why therapeutic communication released parent and child from the pressure of feelings about anything but left problem ownership of those feelings and any problem solving about them to the child. That point is sometimes lost in current books. Ginott was authentic and real. Re-reading his words brings back how truly he meant for his ideas to be helpful and healing. Daniel A. Detwiler, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I came from an extremely abusive home and was too afraid to have children - afraid that I would be a statistic and abuse my own children. A very dear friend gave me this book and coupled with great counseling, I gradually rose above my fears and raised three successful and happy children. I read this book from cover to cover - I had to totally learn a new way of thinking, responding, and feeling. I read it often to keep it fresh in my mind and heart. I broke the abuse chain - I am proud of this. This book gave me the tools to do it! This book gave me the inspiration and guidance needed to be the mother I wanted to be. The reason I wrote this review today, is that my 25 yr old daughter wants to buy this book before she has children - she remembered me talking about it, reading it, and singing it's praises as I raised her. I can't give you a better review than three happy well adjusted young adults and one very happy and content Mom. This book changed all of our lives. Good luck and good parenting, Deb"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I suddenly realized one day that much of the time I was talking to my three young children (the people I care the most about) in a way that I wouldn't speak to my worst enemy...yelling, threatening, constantly nagging and searching for stricter punishments to help change their behavior...none of which seemed to be working the majority of the time. I really wanted some guidance to help me change my discipline approach. This book was highly recommended to me by my mother who used the principles on me and my sisters as well as in her classroom and I finally decided to take a look at it, especially since it has been recently updated and revised. This book has changed my life. I see why Ginott's book is a true classic...It makes so much sense and has taught me a way of communicating respectfully with my children without becoming a wimpy parent. One of the keys to this philosophy is that it is permissive with feelings but not with misbehavior. I am getting more cooperation from my children without resorting to fear, guilt or spanking. I have learned how helpful it is to acknowledge a child's feelings along with giving clear limits and boundaries. As an added bonus...I have noticed that the insight and skills in this book have helped me communicate and solve problems more successfully with my husband as well as with my boss. I am really feeling good about the positive changes. If you have preschoolers, I also highly recommend an A-Z companion to this book, callled \\"The Pocket Parent.\\" Ginott is quoted several times and the book is based on the very same philosophy while addressing most of the troublesome behaviors parents face daily with 2-5 year olds. Both books are filled with practical commonsense techniques that we sometimes forget are options as parents."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"While this book was originally written a number of years ago, the concepts are time-tested and true to anyone looking to foster the best possible environment for their child. Ginot talks a lot about his experience with children (as a child psychiatrist) and is very effective in relaying how a child thinks, feels and behaves in response to our words, actions and inaction.The book makes logical sense in how not only children, but some adults perceive the world around them. I currently have two year old twin boys and I have incorporated some of Dr. Ginot's recommendations and I am AMAZED at the difference it has made in the response of my boys. For example, if a child is doing something they are not suppossed to, like hitting a glass table with a plastic golf club (this is a true example), instead of just saying \\"Paul, do not hit the glass table with your golf club,\\" you say, \\"Paul, we may not hit the table with the golf club but you can hit the ground or your golf ball with the club,\\" the child responds differently because he knows the acceptable as well as the unacceptable, which defines the boundaries for him. In my case, Paul continued to hit the table when I failed to define the boundaries for him but when I relayed the message to him in a way that defined boundaries, he stopped hitting the table (and has not to thie day - 6 weeks later, whereas it was a 2-3 times a week occurance).I have read at least a dozen other \\"child raising\\" books and if I had to narrow it down to one, this would be it...by a long shot!"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book goes beyond vague theory and gives you practical advice. You can begin to use the ideas the day you start reading it. It works so well, as soon as I began using the Ginott suggestions I had many alternatives to the yelling and spanking I grew up with and didn't want to pass on to my kids. It broke the cycle of emotional and physical violence for this family."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"The revised edition of this book not only has Haim's original language and sensitivity, but also includes the wise voices of two parenting and communications experts. Together, these three authors help parents understand children in a way that makes meaningful interactions possible. This book is a timely solution to the hurried parenting we find ourselves doing, even though we never intend to \\"miss\\" our kids emotionally. This book is easy to read, sensitive to the insecurities we all share as parents, and full of real-life recommendations that can actually be implemented. This book will be the best money you spend on your children."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to any parents' library. I am a child psychiatrist who recommends it frequently to parents. It clearly discusses how important language is in our relationship with our children without being judgmental or preachy. It clearly outlines verbal patterns that many parents get into and helpful strategies to get out of those patterns. The premise is simple --- we need to listen more. However, if you are someone who recognizes this is easier said than done, I recommend reading this book. I get hundreds of books out of the library; there are few that I ultimately purchase. This was one of those few."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"The whole premise of the book is that love and common sense are not enough to raise most children well. Good parenting skills need to be *learned*. This book gives terrific examples of good and not so good parenting with each topic it covers. I've read at least a dozen parenting books (I have a very \\"highly spirited\\" 9 year old boy) and this one has made a big difference for me in my parenting. The emphasis on validating children's feelings somehow resonated better with me with this book than others, I think because the authors are particularly gifted in presenting the child's perspective. Using just a couple of the techniques in the book, I have been able to keep my son's emotional outbursts to a minimum -- and therefore my own, too. Better for me, and clearly better for him! I understand him better now."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"After reading over 50 parenting books, taking classes and praying daily, I have found Dr. Ginott's approach works better and more consistenly with children and adults. It is the most respectful approach, allowing children to learn from their choices, but let's the parents set the limits and the consequences. The approach informs the child prior to an action what the consequence will be, in a calm, non-threatening way. The child makes decisions and lives with the outcome. There is no yelling, no telling and no constant coersion. I have used this approach for years and even now with my teens. They respect my decisions because they know, THEY have a say in the outcome. They have learned to respectfully negotiate a win-win situation and we have very few disputes now. Works on employees, spouses, neighbors and in-laws as well! Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Based on the great reviews here, I bought and read this book. It was good. It taught me some useful things, but there were some parts that I disagreed with. I took it with a grain of salt, and I used the things I found to be valuable and ignored the others.The best thing that I took away from this book:The author explains that it's important for children (well, anybody, really) to feel heard. So if a child wants something that you're going to deny, you should not just say \\"No.\\" First, you should tell the child that you empathize and understand what they're wishing for. And then tell them that the answer is still no. It has helped calm my children down when I have showed them that I understand what they want, before I tell them why they still can't have it. For example, your kid wants to stay on a ride at the amusement park. You say \\"I understand that you're having fun and that you want to stay on the ride. But there are many kids in the line behind you waiting for their turn. It's not fair if you stay on this ride all day.\\"The thing I disagreed with the most:The author says that the way you shouldn't tell a child \\"You're bad\\" you should also not tell a child \\"You're good\\" or \\"You're beautiful\\" or give them a label. Even if it's positive. His reasoning is that if you give them a label, then they don't learn to have pride in themselves and they look outside, to others, for validation and praise all their lives. That part, by itself, might be true, but I don't think their solution is better. All I know is that as a child, my parents would tell me positive things about myself and I was confident. However, at school, my teachers must have read this book or subscribed to this book's theories. They never said to me or the other students \\"You're smart\\" or \\"You're good.\\" If they praised me, they would do what this book suggests which is to say \\"You must be proud of yourself\\" or \\"Tell me about your accomplishment.\\" The author argues that this instills self-confidence in the child. However, I remember most of the time when someone said to me \\"You must be proud of yourself\\" that I would wonder \\"Why aren't they saying 'Good job. You are smart?'\\" And then I over analyzed the situation and assumed that the educator didn't think I was smart but was trying to be polite and not hurt my feelings. So the lack of telling me that I was smart, made me think that they thought that I was *not* smart. And so I assumed that they were being polite instead of just saying \\"Big deal. Any moron could have accomplished that goal.\\" It had the reverse effect."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Dr. Ginott is truly one of my heroes. His books are not just about parenting but about how to create strong, respectful relationships. While some of his phrasing will appear quaint by today's standards, readers can find updated and operationalized guides to implementing his ideas in works by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish ('How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen so Kids Will Talk' is in my opinion the greatest parenting book ever published).

It was and is an essential book for any parent, even those who have normal, healthy and happy children. It is even more useful for anyone dealing with children on a daily basis: parent, caregivers or teachers.I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to have a handbook on dealing with children in a respectful succesful way. I was a public school teacher for 17 yrs. and went on to mentor others and homeschool my own children through High School.This is a small, easily read book with clear options for anyone who wants a way to deal with children in an effective, non violent, respectful and endearing way. It saved me and my husband many difficulties and helped us to treat our kids with love and respect, while teaching them appropriate behavior. It taught us how to keep a united front, which is essential in dealing successfully with children. This book assists in showing parents how to do things together that show love and respect for themselves as well as their entire family.Hope this helps readers in their choice of books.M.

The techniques are taught to us parents without blame. Lots of real life examples to help us identify ourselves and our kids. It's all about loving our kids even when they drive us nuts. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"H.Ginott was a teacher and psychologist and had a lot of experience with children -no doubts about that- and he was quite explicit when describing parents in general as unqualified, common people are seen as just not ready for this task. Parents do need guidelines and rules, they need to learn, the book is a long list of what they should do and what they should never do... And it's not small tactical advice he is giving - but when considering the interactions of parents and child, I think his recommendations are much too little and much too much.First - OK, nothing wrong with good advice - but his advices are so general and obvious like good intentions happen to be. For instance:* acknowledge and respect the feelings of your child, criticize the behavior or the problematic situation, but not the child* don't behave in a way that you don't want the child to imitate, don't use words you don't want the child to say*allow children to learn deciding and choosing* and an overwhelming part of the book informs us that it is better not to get angry, upset, polemical, impatient, sarcastic, bitter, don't lecture, don't threaten, don't bribe ... Don't ask \\"why do you always..?\\", avoid the \\"if..then -fallacy\\" and stay constructive, positive, helpful, considerate, polite, respectful, and so on.Obvious, who could contradict that today ? Those advices for more self-control remind me the wisdom of recommendations like the one that you shouldn't show your fear to dogs because this would rather make them bite you. There are certainly some useful recommendations listed in the book but many of them could be replaced by just saying \\"love your children!\\". I can't imagine HG's advices to have any solid impact on parental behavior.And HG's advice is also \\"too much\\": to achieve the goal, parents have to repress and overcome their spontaneous feelings and responses, they do need training and skills. Not just in a few extreme cases but parents in general are unqualified, some seem not to have 24h of free time per day and some may want to sleep occasionally, they get impatient, bored when asked the same question again. For HG the authenticity of the parental behavior isn't relevant at all, the parents have to change their way of acting, their way of asking and of not asking, of talking, deciding. And while HG is repeating that parents shouldn't criticize or blame the child but always be subtle, positive and constructive and of course never humiliate - HG himself doesn't talk like that about parents - they are described as incompetent, often too emotional, and their real/spontaneous emotions do not matter at all. I guess that \\"should\\" and \\"should not\\" is written a few hundred times in this book.And so we come to HG's fairy tales: again and again we get some little exemplary story describing a certain problem, where the parents say this or that to their child, they might be upset, sometimes rude, ironic, they might be lecturing and then we get descriptions of the terrible and counterproductive consequences of their spontaneous but incompetent interventions. And then -again and again- comes the counterexample, this time the wonder medicine has been taken, the parents did read the book or visited courses, now they speak friendly, do respect the emotions of the child, they do not ask Why-questions and so -abracadabra- the rabbit comes out of the magicians hat, it all gets fine, the problem is solved or appeased. This are not just exaggerations or didactical over-simplifications, this is just ridiculous. Those little examples do not describe real human beings and if you are a parent, it will make you laugh loud.An example:\\"Mother: The yard was so dirty, I didn't believe it could be cleaned up in one day.Julie: I did it !Mother: It was full of leaves and garbage and things.Julie: I cleaned it all up.Mother: You put in a lot of effort!Julie: Yeah, I sure did.Mother: The yard is so clean now; it's a pleasure to look at it.Julie: Its nice.Mother: Your beaming face tells me how proud you are. Thank you, dear.Julie: (with a mile-wide smile): You're welcome....In contrast, the following words of praise addressed to the child's personality are unhelpful:\\"You are such a wonderful daughter\\", \\"You are truly Mother's little helper\\" , \\"What would Mother do without you?\\"Such comments may threaten a child and cause her anxiety. She may feel that she is far from being wonderful and that she is unable to live up to this label... She may decide to lessen her burden by a confession of misbehavior....She may not only reject the praise but may have second thoughts about those who have praised her: If they find me so great, they cannot be so smart...\\"Come on...Or another warning:\\"To children, threats are invitations to repeat a forbidden act. When a child is told \\"If you do it once more\\" he does not hear the words \\"if you\\". He hears only \\"do it once more\\". Sometimes he interprets it as Mom expects me to do it once more, or she'll be disappointed.\\"And there is more like that...I do not want to state here that only parents are qualified to talk about parent-child relations, not at all. But while reading HG's book with all respect and sympathy for his professional wisdom, I couldn't avoid the impression that he has never been in the trenches of parenthood. He was teacher, psychologist, adviser - interactions for an hour or two, maybe weekly, professional encounters. I don't know if he had children and I might be wrong, maybe he had a few, but when reading this book I have the impression that he didn't. Many of the smart right answers he lists do work or do look nice only the first time they get used - but the interaction of parents with their kids is a dance for ~18 years, the same moves are repeated again and again, and parents play with/against an intelligent player with his own strategies.And there is so much missing in this book, all about the ambivalence of parental authority or responsibility, the getting angry, the being worried, the experience of having a child which will ..spread out his wings and fly away... Of course there are troubles and anger, but I will myself once miss those moments of in-fight which are just a part of life. Conflict isn't a disease, kids are skilled to wait for the right moment when they see a reduced defense -for instance parents on the phone- and raise the crucial question again for the xth time. To get upset, annoyed, tired is nothing wrong, it's not done because the parents didn't know that they should stay calm. Somehow, when reading those exemplary stories, I just felt that the essential is missing: the loving and wanting to be loved. Being a parent is a non-stop activity, and there are certainly unhappy families and extreme cases but I wouldn't propose to substitute the sometimes ambiguous parental love by psychological professionalism. It would have been simpler to just say \\"Talk more and listen more to your kids\\".And the impact of such good advice ? As we do know, very few people change for instance their way of eating after reading a book. This is such a complex topic, to be a parent is the funniest and most interesting activity I could ever imagine, and it is not pleasant to read how this gets reduced in this book. The idea of parents having permanently to control their emotions and behavior - even if we assume it to be possible - what a strange family life would this be ?What a shallow book... Love is almost completely missing. Doesn't seem like a way to happiness for the kids."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"Some reasonable suggestions for handling kids, but alot of it is quite dated, particularly the advice on gender roles."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I would have liked to read about more real life examples and solutions to the problems.

Let me just say, it is horrible! This is a book that encourages a parent to tell a child that \\"you must hate that person\\", or \\"you must have wished bad things on her\\". It teaches you to acknowledge and encourage hatred. I feel that as a parent you should guide children about their ideas.It is appropriate to talk about feelings, but the techniques discussed are too wishy-washy. The communication style of children presented in this book is a style where the listener has to discern the meaning. I find this to be uncommon. Come on, kids say the darndest things! They will talk to parents in an unfiltered manner! It is only when they reach the tweens that they start to be more secretive and filtered.

The best thing about it is that it applies to all kinds of relationships. Ironically, it helped me communicate with my mother. In the book, it's a child who hurls \\"You don't love me!\\" as both a weapon to divert attention from the actual reason of the fight and to get an assurance that even an angry parent still loves him. The book suggests to answer that it's not a good time to discuss the feeling of love, but to talk about what really made the parent upset. Otherwise, just yelling \\"Of course I love you!\\" can only make a further impression that you really don't have any loving feelings (which you probably can't feel at the time of the fight).

This book changed my view on education and left me totally unsatisfied with traditional rearing. I read a lot of books which clearly inherited from these views and I've changed my way of rearing my child.

It is simple and clear, with plenty of practical examples.My 5 year old child recently teared up after we drove home with our new kitten, and turned to me with this urgent question: \\"Will the kitten never see its Mommy again? Not tonight, not ever?\\" Having just read Haim Ginott's book again (for the 6th time), I remembered to not answer my child's literal question, but to instead address the relationship implied by the question and my child's underlying fear. My husband started explaining to my son how cats are different than people, but when I got my turn to speak, I took my son's hand and said, \\"Son, I'll be with you. No one will take you away from me.\\" He nodded, and began happily petting the kitten again.Thank you, Haim Ginott, for your book. Every time I read it, I remember again how to be a better parent to my children. I have given this book away now to friends and family members at least a dozen times. I can not recommend it strongly enough.Jodi"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"My first child, a son, is four. I have a real temper. With the birth of my second child it was so hard for me to keep my temper when my son did not listen. Finally I lost it! I had no in-between. Everything was yelling, I felt it was all that would work.I purchased this book and it has been wonderful. I can't put it down, i read it constantly at every challenge. I have totally stopped yelling, scolding, and time outs. I used to go to sleep every night feeling ashamed and defeated, now I feel like I am a great mom! My son is so much happier, it is unbelievable. Everyone should own this book.An example lesson from this book is to be succinct. I used to give big explanations. I thought I was teaching and molding him. He would just roll his eyes (ending in a time out). Now I use just one sentence or maybe just a look \\"Playing ball is for outside\\" not \\" throwing balls inside is dangerous! It could break glass! Or hit your sister...\\""},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I first bought 'Between Parent and Child' a long time ago when I was in the midst of having babies and raising my children. This book saved my life and probably the lives of my four wonderful children, too. It is full of common sense, love and caring - all the things we need more of in parenting these days. I have passed my original copy around to my children as the advice was needed, and finally bought a copy for everyone to own.This book teaches you discipline for you and your children. A must for every parent who wants to raise an adult and not a child."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"My first visit with my daughter after I read this & I used one of the principles learned. Instead of her being mad at me for days because of my reaction to a situation, she was mad at me for 5 minutes.Get this book, it will save you hours, days, years of grief and your child will be much the better for it."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I have often wondered what is the \\"right way\\" to respond to a child who is misbehaving and/or upset. Dr. Ginott answered my questions -- plus the many more that comes with having a child. Dr. Ginott teaches us how to communicate not just with our children, but also with other adults. This has been a very eye-opening experience to learn that the way I communicate with others, especially those who are closest to me, may not be the most effective. Dr. Ginott has a great way of teaching through example in his book. It's a great read and a book that I use constantly. It also makes a very good babyshower gift!"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I have lived my parenting life suffused with guilt over the times I have hurt my daughter's feelings with yelling, demands and recriminations over her behavior. Reading this book was a life changing experience for both me and my husband. In the few weeks since I have read this book, life in my home has changed dramatically. I now have the tools to relate effectively to my daughter. I understand WHY she reacts to situations as she does and can handle redirect her anger, fear or sadness simply by letting her know that I understand and sympathize. We are all happier and more secure - this book has truly changed my entire way of thinking."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This book was recommended to me by an elementary school counselor after a child in my son's school experienced violent death at the hands of her father; my son was having a very difficult time dealing with it. I was feeling so helpless and felt compelled to fix, fix, fix my child's pain. This book helped me truly understand that sometimes I need to be quiet and just listen. It gave me practical, ready-to-use words and phrases that encourage communication and allow for the parent to facilitate and guide, rather than moralize or give advice. Before my reading, my son said, \\"You keep trying to teach me lessons in this, Mom....\\" and I thought I was doing the right thing. Between Parent and Child had sections dealing exactly with this type of dialogue and how to work through difficult conversations without the lecture. IT WORKED for our immediate problem and continues to work. I am using its lessons in my marriage and at work and find that my communication overall has improved. Highly readable and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"This is a wonderful book, intelligent and invaluable to any parent. Puts us in touch with the emotional vulnerability of children--but also with their potential strength and independence given responsive parenting. Many vivid examples provide enormous help to parents wanting reinforcement of healthy habits and/or new strategies to reach their children in ways that will enhance the parent-child bond. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"With thousands of books on child rearing, it's hard to know where to start. This is where to start.This classic already has many effusive and well-executed reviews on Amazon. I'm not going to duplicate what others have done so well. But I had read many articles, a handful of books, and conferred with peer parents in my attempt to be a good parent. I wish I had started here. Read the other reviews for the specifics. Then take a deep breath and begin this book. When you finish the book and exhale, you will be a better parent."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"My mother told me this story once upon a time. We had gone to the library, as we often did, and when we went to the checkout counter, we put our pile of books on the counter. I looked at the books she was borrowing and I saw Between Parent and Child.\\"Oooh, are you borrowing this book gain?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Good. You're always so much nicer to me after you've read it.\\"I don't know that parents must always be nice to their children but I do know that this book obviously had a positive effect on my relationship between myself and my mother. As a five or six year old, I experienced the benefits of Ginott's guidance and I appreciated it.When I became a parent, I sought out this book and I read it more than once because I knew it had touched a positive note in my own heart as a child and I wanted that same experience to be a part of my children's lives.Now I am buying the book for my son in anticipation of his being as wonderful a father as I have tried to raise him to be. I wish I had applied Ginott's teachings more fully but I was/am highly flawed as a parent. Still, with this book in hand, I had a foundation that made me a better parent than I might have been otherwise and I am thrilled this book is still available to be shared with future generations of parents."},{"Title":"Between parent and child","review":"I can't say enough about how valuable this book is. If I could meet the author myself to get down on my knees and thank him, I would. He has given such wise advice about the importance of caring about children's feelings. He has taught me more effectively than anyone else in my life what it really means to respect other people. I try to keep his principles in mind every day when raising my three children, ages six, four and sixteen months. Demonstrating the fact that I care about their feelings has helped me tremendously in disciplining them. They are well-behaved and happy children (most of the time!) Excellent, superb. The wisdom is sound and deserves much more than a quick glance. The more time you invest in internalizing the principles, the more you will get out of it. I am forever indebted to Dr. Ginott!!"},{"Title":"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children","review":"\\"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children\\" is a thorough investigation of how spaces for children aid in the development of necessary motor skills, intellectual and imaginative stimulation, and an early exposure to nature that will foster lifelong appreciation. No topic is untouched - history, design process, sustainability, case studies, and fundraising are all included. Not only is the text written in a clear, concise manner with many insightful images, but the text also provides the seeds with which a revolution in children's play will occur, hopefully soon. Designers, parents, principals, and teachers should all read, and will undoubtedly benefit from the unique concepts presented here. The environments for our children can become more inspirational, more nurturing, and should be made over; the authors tell you why and show you how."},{"Title":"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children","review":"I have found 'Designing Outdoor Environments for Children' to be an excellent addition to my library. I will include this publication as a part of the 'Introduction to Horticultural Therapy' class I am teaching. It will be very useful in helping students understand the essential role outdoor environments can play in teaching children about nature. The book is also an excellent resource in my own work designing residences and school playgrounds. Children, more than ever, need to reconnect with nature. The need to strengthen our interaction with nature cannot be overstressed today!"},{"Title":"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children","review":"I absolutely love this book, it is filled with beautiful examples of unique spaces that you can make to engage and educate children about nature."},{"Title":"Designing Outdoor Environments for Children","review":"2007 PA/DE Chapter ASLA President's Award WinnerJury Comments:The book is wonderfully illustrated and chock full of very useful information.

I found the book an interesting, enjoyable, and fun read but not an engrossing one."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"Michael Lindvall's book honestly addresses some of the issues of ministry in a small town (interesting characters, privacy issues, financial struggles, etc.). He writes in an easily accessible, warm-hearted style, and fairly depicts some of the blessings and challenges of serving in small town ministry. This book takes place over the course of a year, anchored by special church events to mark the beginning and end of a year. I found this book to be very much in the same style as Philip Gulley's, Home to Harmony. As a minister in a small town setting, I appreciated how Lindvall describes life in a small town, how time and expectations move at a different pace. Lindvall is an accomplished story teller; this is a book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"Michael Lindvall's \\"Good News from North Haven\\" is a tremendous, wonderful read.\\"A Year in the Life of a Small Town\\" isn't just for small town folks. It's a reflection on humanjourneys that is worth more time reflecting. I am fascinated, and uplifted."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Our church did a book study on it. We all enjoyed it. Being Presbyterian, we all related to the stories. We are looking forward to reading the next one, \\"Leaving New Haven\\"."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"If you have ever lived in a small town, and attended a Protestant church, you will know the characters in this book. Even though the book is written about a small Presbyterian church, it is really about all churches. The stories will touch your spirit and speak to your heart; you will laugh and cry. I give this book as a gift not only to every new minister who comes to our church, but also to anyone who has a deep, quiet faith. I consider this one of the \\"classics\\" in my collection of Christian books."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"This is a wonderful book. The author does something that's not easy to do, at all: he takes true incidents and fictionalizes them in an entertaining and uplifting manner. His theme is an unabashedly Christian one, that of grace at work in everyday life among ordinary people; but he avoids preaching to his readers, and the resulting stories are far more readable as a result. This is the book James Herriot would have written if he'd been a pastor instead of a vet. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"This is a clever book, with stories reminiscent of Midwestern small town church families. It is light easy reading, yet gives you the &quot;big picture&quot; for something to take away from your reading.This is much more realistic and heartfelt than the Garrison Keillor writings. Lindvall brings his pastoral background and experiences into these stories to our benefit."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"The Kirkus Review nails it in the sentence &quot;Prairie Home Companion without the sharp edges.&quot; I'd say without ANY edges whatsoever. Not only are the sermons (preachy little 'stories' that pass for 'chapters') poorly written, but they're boring and full of first-writers' cliches.I was appalled to think that cross-country readers might form their impression of Minnesota based on this minister's experiences. At least Garrison Keillor exhibits *some* sophistication in his small-town stories."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"I really enjoyed the book and was disappointed to see it out of print. I want to buy it as a gift for a number of friends. The book is easy to read, with a message of Gods wonderful humor and love to each of us interwoven through out. The people in the book are all too real, we will recognize ourselves and our neighbors. Each story has an ending you may not see coming. I believe it is uplifting and a spirit filled read."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"In this collection of essays, Michael L, Lindvall presents sensitive stories and caring messages based upon the life of an ordinary church and its congregation. It is clear that Rev. Lindvall loves these people, who although fictitious, are no doubt drawn upon his own experience serving a congregation in the upper Midwest that served as a prototype for the \\"North Haven\\" church.This best seller is the first of his published works. There is a follow-up \\"Leaving North Haven\\" book and two recent (2007) non-fiction Christian works \\"A Geography of God\\" and \\"What Did Jesus Do?\\" Both also receive five stars by this reviewer on amazon.comThose who read this one will want to read them all.Time passes and Rev. Lindvall is no longer serving the church at \\"North Haven\\". If you are fortunate enough to hear him preach each Sunday morning at the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City, then you know that he has a gift for telling stories that reach people, down deep, inspiring, tender, challenging, and filled with light and love.At the Brick Church, Michael L. Lindvall follows several illustrious pastors of other eras, including two different pastor-authors of much loved hymns: \\"This Is My Father's World\\" (Maltbie Davenport Babcock) and \\"Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee (Henry van Dyke)\\"Come to think of it, Lindvall's essays come very close to being hymns, and we believe that his predecessors would both appreciate and approve of his writings."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"Someone reviewed the book and told several of the stories to a very receptive audience. I then purchased several books as I found them for gifts, and made sure I kept one. I used it for a lesson one Sunday with my Sunday School group, and now they want copies. We all remembered similar situations of small towns, people, traditions and change, and how the Grace of God keeps us growing."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"This book is sweet, funny and charming. It's everything we city dwellers think should happen in a hometown and much of it makes us long for a haven.

I highly recommend this book and I'm just sorry that there's not an entire series."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book which looks at life in a fictional small town in southwestern Minnesota through the eyes of a young minister. The characters are sometimes hilarious in their idiosyncracies yet very realistic in their human failings and emotions. While each short story in the book has a message, they are not &quot;preachy.&quot; The stories are reminiscent of Garrison Keillor's &quot;Prairie Home Companion.&quot; An excellent, quick read!"},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"I'm disappointed that this book is out of print. Some friends have heard excerpts from my copy and want to purchase a copy for themselves. Three years ago I gave copies of it as a Christmas gift.

The book will come out again next year along with his new one_Leaving North Haven_. Rev. Lindvall is a pastor first and a writer second.

I have used these stories in sermons for many years for their humor and their pithy heart felt message."},{"Title":"The Good News From North Haven: a Year in the Life of a Small Town","review":"This is one of my favorite collections of stories about a small town pastor. I keep loaning it out and it keeps disappearing so I have to keep it replaced on my shelf."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Once in a great while, a book comes along that touches your every feeling and emotion. Ms. Spirson has managed to make a believable and worth reding book. I felt Audrey's confusion of whether her husband was unfaithful. And when the &quot;younger&quot; man showed her interest, I knew that millions of woman could relate. It all comes down to whether or not we would actually let things escalate from there. A recommended read for everyone who enjoys to escape the normalties of daily living. I would sell this to all."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Ms. Spirson's first novel is a mini-vacation to Southern California. A land of sun and angst, sensuality and sham. Although her story of marraige and fidelity could be told in any part of the country, in L.A. it's film noir. Her prose keeps the reader driven to the conclusion, with a subconscious feeling of watching tornado victims sort through the remnants of their old lives. This is an enjoyable read about believable characters. Better than a trip to the Valley in the hot, fast days of an Los Angeles summer. If you want a taste of living suburban L.A., this is it."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I very much enjoyed this novel. The author was able to draw me into the world of the characters be a part of their thoughts and experiences. The character were well developed and I could understand Audrey's thinking, her motivations, and what drove her to her point of destruction. The writing in this novel was supberb. I kept turning pages until I realized I finished half the novel in a day. I was compelled to keep reading to find out what happens next. I love when a writer is able to make me do this."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I was gripped by this excellent first novel, and moved by its unexpected ending. Read it! 66 Laps was well-paced, with just the right amount of action to keep readers hooked. I liked the short, sharp chapters -- which would have made the book easy to put down if you needed to, but I was too curious to find out what was going to happen next. The author achieves many high points with her vivid prose. Having moved away from my hometown after high school, I related closely to the author's descriptions of going back home to visit. I loved the main character's eclectic family - the jocky, eternally youthful father; the yakky shrink Mom; the newscaster sister. The depiction of modern-day motherhood was on the mark (if a little short on the quiet desperation, boredom and fatigue many mothers experience), especially Audrey's secret yearning for the power job while she tells her friends how much she loves being a stay-at-home mom. I was particularly enchanted by the way Spirson crafted Audrey's daily swimming routine into the theme of the book, used it as her therapy and safe haven, and ultimately turned it into her downfall. Any swimmer or runner will relate to that rhythm that Audrey sometimes found doing exercise, and that all-powerful feeling it occasionally produced, as well as the frustration of not finding it. As for the plot, Spirson convincingly shows how jealousy and insecurity can cause people to ruin those things they love most. I was shocked and disturbed by the ending, and mulled over the book and its characters days after I finished reading it."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me. I'm glad I read it so I now know never to pay attention to any of her recommendations in the future. This book was NOT believable. So many chapters describing how much the main character loves her child and husband and only a few pages for her to turn around and decide to have revenge sex with the ice cream man! The synopsis should read \\" Shallow character, who is easily swept off her feet by cheesy ice cream dude\\". This book is a bad soap opera in print."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Things aren't always what they seem to be and this was a great example of that. I loved the way Ms. Spirson put everything together and kept my attention. It was short but sweet and I hope to see more from her in the future. The ending really caught me off guard........"},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"A trip deep inside the head, heart and soul of Audrey, a youth-and-beauty-obsessed wife and mother who loses it all because of her own lack of trust and love. Her fate becomes a contemporary vision of hell. Reads like lightning. A taut, clear and devastating story. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I was recommended by a friend to read this book, and I am never, ever listening to her advice again! This was a terrible piece of \\"prose\\"! Shallow and poorly written, like a screenplay rejected from a bad soap opera pilot. Audrey, the protagonist, is a horribe wife, a horrible mother, and so lifeless and unreal that you want her to be slapped and locked up instantly!I couldn't finish the book, because with each chapter came more and more badly written storylines that failed to capture my attention. They did garner a lot of laughter from me and the other friends I've shown this piece of trash to.Save yourself the horror and read something else! The book reads like something a high schooler with no literary backround or skill in creative writing would produce."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Whoever allowed this woman to publish such a shallow, distasteful story, was a fan of badly written roman novels and every soap opera in existence. I could barely force myself to read though this horrible novel without laughing; Audrey, the protagonist, is nothing more than a projection of the author into her own story.In short, this is a Mary Sue of epic proportions. The protagonist of the story is so shallow, so egocentric, and so disillusioned that it makes every female in the world look like an idiot. An \\"independent woman\\" cliche that needs to end. I'm ashamed to have even read it because if this says anything about the author as a person, then I would never want to have anything to do with her (and I am another woman).Not only is the writing style fragmented and irritating, but the dialogue is unbelievable, and the characters are dense at best. The next time Spirson decides to publish, someone take away her computer, her pens, and any papers that are nearby; another atrocity masking itself as a good read is not what the world needs.Drown it."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Spirson's style and tone of writing. I found it fresh and clean and the format of the novel with it's poem-like chapters was simply great. A very contemporary novel (including its smaller physical size). Hence the three stars.Unfortunately (and a big unfortunately) I also felt royally manipulated by this story. Why is it that women (especially mothers) have to pay such a high price for their rather minor indescretions? I am SO tired of that morality. It's as if a new mother lay in bed in a rather bad post-partum depression and fantasized about the worst thing that could happen to her family because of her behavior and then wrote a book about it. Extremely self-indulgent. The characters don't grow or change because of their actions and consequences, they just react. I was depressed and irritated by this story. I don't mind a dark story but I do mind a depressing one. If this is marriage in the 90s, no thanks!"},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"66 Laps captures the emotions and conflicts of a 30-something new mother and wife. It's a terrific easy to read novel. Leslie's voice has depth and detail that present concise and carefully chosen descriptions, and insightful dialogue. She has crafted a stylized novel that subtilely mirrors the main characters, their lifestyles and their choices. The lead character, Audrey's, inner turmoil and fantastic imagination combine taking her on a journey of impulsive twists and turns to disasterous results that will forever change her reality. As breezy a read as it really is, the realities will keep you thinking about the novel for a long time. You should buy a copy and read it."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Leslie is an excellent story teller. At the end of each pleasingly short chapter she set the bait for the reader to keep going. It was so hard to put the book down. I loved Leslie's style of writing. She sounded out so many profound life thoughts in simple yet unique prose. It has been a while since I read a book that really helped me to escape to another place. Leslie's novel was a tantilizing thrill amidst a familiar setting making it all the more entertaining.

While she swims,our heroine worries:about her marriage to tv director failing, about many other women-real or otherwise.She has been a winner all her life. But she can not deal with aging & believed loss of beauty and love. This page turner flows--the writing is a joy.The reader is easily convinced that the \\"Hollywood Life\\" is not a goal for her. However, the reader is never prepared for the final tragedy. Wonderful Poolside reading. Tracy Demartino,Ventura,CA"},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"Life is too short to spend time reading this book. After reading the author's non-fiction essay in the book \\"Mommy Wars,\\" I eagerly got this book, and I'm sorry to say I really, really hated it. It was startlingly dark and depressing, without any redeeming literary value. Throw this one back, quick!"},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"This book caught me right at the beginning. I liked the authors style. My sister picked it up and was hooked in the first few pages also. Decent story told quickly and easily. The book is good for a day at the beach or a quiet evening."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"This is a great book for a number of reasons: first time novel (are usually really good - this is no exception); short (214 pages); short but organized chapters; great character development; great writting about long distance swimming; good lessons.I had trouble with a few things like, Audrey thinking her husband was cheating on her with such flimsy evidence (none). It's like she had to believe it whether it was true or not so she would feel justified in having her own &quot;fling&quot;. I think the real motivation was her age but she was fairly young (32) with only 1 young child. The real motivation for her wandering eye could have been developed more. Did her experience in her family (divorced parents) contribute and maybe her current relationship with her parents? I wanted more explanation of the &quot;why&quot; - a few gray hairs on a 32 year old in great shape was not convincing.The shallow relationship between Audrey and Sean, her lover, was odd. The story would have been better if they were more &quot;involved&quot; not just a one time thing. It was a bit unbelievable how he comes out of nowhere at the end: was he stalking her? Sean seemed to be looking for more than a &quot;quickie&quot;.In the end, the children are the ones that pay the price of parents infidelity and this is a sad tale of exactly how high that price can sometimes be.If you have swam laps, you will really relate to the discriptions of what happens mentally. Perhaps this was Audrey's biggest problem, too much quiet time in the pool thinking about things she should only have been thinking about in her 40's."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"There is a moral to this story of young hip marrieds: appreciate what you have, trust whenever appropriate, and don't overdramatize. Although I am older, I found the author's voice fresh and the story realistic. The author captures perfectly the segment of the population she writes about, and brings every character to life, fully. Surprise ending was daring and effective. Would make a great movie."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I didn't want this book to end, and when the ending came, I had to read it again when I was more calm to get the details. Spirson sets up the suspense on Page one and boy does she deliver. I laughed and cried. It's an easy and fun read with heartwrenching truths and thoughtprovoking issues about woman and jealousy and life and marriage. I can see why USA Today raved. It made me more careful of every little decision I make, because it all adds up. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"This book was excellent. Cover to cover I could not put it down. The emotional highs along with the almost sedistic lows led the reader through an amazing adventure.Can't wait to read more from this writer."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"What do you think of being age of 32years old? Audrey in this story has a lot of fear of aging and losing her husband's interest. Although that is not an unusual subject, Audrey's fear causes disastrous results. Painful but beautiful story."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I read this book with increasing irritation. The main character is narcissistic, self-indulgent, and wholly unsympathetic. There was little character development. The dialogue was unrealistic. And the prose was frequently didactic in an inappropriate way for fiction. The writer's background in writing comic non-fiction permeates the text. At times I thought I was reading a piece from &quot;Redbook.&quot; And the abbreviated chapters suggest this was once a screenplay that the writer tried--and failed--to transform into literary fiction."},{"Title":"66 Laps","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It was a fun read, with well drawn characters, very life-like.In some ways, it read like a screenplay. It is a visual narrative, haunting in it's detail.The ending is abrupt, and hits like a ton of bricks.It's a page turner.

I am not the optimistic day dream believer that Kennedy did no wrong and was a saint. I know he was a man with flaws and I accepted that fact. What I can NOT accept is the \\"facts\\" listed that can't even be proved OR disproved. It's like Hersh just wanted to keep beating a dead man who cant defend himself. Most history buffs say Kennedy was the BEST president, he did many great things for this country and I like to believe that had he lived he would have done so much more that would have improved this country even more.

It shows that viewing the guts of the political process, like the making of sausage, may not be pleasant for the squeamish.

Thank you Mr. Hersh, for taking aim at the Kennedy mystique and helping change the popular view of the Kennedy family forever. This is a must read for all. This books exposes what Kennedy should be remembered for: Vietnam (which he viewed as a strategic piece of real estate), stolen elections, adulterous affairs, the invasion of Cuba&Eacute; The Kennedy's-those paragons of reformism and concern for the people-are shown for what they truly were: communist hunters, union busters, counter-insurgency enthusiasts, torture chamber academy founders...

Kennedy should be remembered for unleashing the military might of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese, Cubans and more. Those who've been fooled by the likes of Clinton's liberal image would do well to study this book.

Until the mid-1960's there was an unspoken rule in the press to turn a blind eye to personal flaws and political failures of politicians, thus leading to absurdly inaccurate public perceptions of presidents like JFK, FDR and Woodrow Wilson. For example, FDR has been the subject of several recent studies which pretty much conclusively prove that he actually lengthened the period of the Great Depression. SeeFDR's Folly: How Roosevelt and His New Deal Prolonged the Great Depression. Also revised is FDR's role in instigating WWII. SeeChurchill, Hitler, and 'The Unnecessary War' (Unabridged). Since historian failed so spectacularly at their jobs, save a few cries in the void likeThe Roosevelt Myth, it's good that the truth is finally coming out,however slowly the American people seem to be in accepting it.

Some of the information is probably correct but Oswald DID NOT kill Kennedy; that is a lie that Mr. Hersh knows is a LIE and is perpetuating it probably with some CIA help. Nitrate tests indicate Oswald had not fired a gun that day and wearing gloves does not cover your face. Furthermore he was a \\"fair shot\\" and NO WAY could have killed Kennedy. Witness after witness saw smoke from the grassy knoll. And could the mob change the parade route or tell the secret service what to do? Perhaps JFK was a bad president but clearly the CIA, Allen Dulles was involved in this murder and we do NOT live in a democracy but a temporary KING POLICE STATE. Gore had more votes than Bush yet this electoral college is fascist and the \\"Founding Fathers\\" knew it to protect the rich white male.

Life went on and we kept our fond memories close to our hearts. Then came Seymour M. Hersh. THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT is a perfect title for this book. It is very well written and most certainly is a &quot;page turner&quot; investigation of the Kennedy's before and during John's presidency. JFK was charming, charismatic, rich and the most powerful man in the free world. That is a deadly combination - especially when the press (unlike today) turn their backs or do not report everything they see and hear. Mr. Hersh has written a book that exposes the warts and moles of the Kennedy clan without bashing. He simply presents the information as it was told to him by the people who were there. It's been a long time, we've all grown up and it's time to see how it really was. Does the book change my feelings about Camelot? Not in the least, and I don't believe that was Mr. Hersh's intent. It's just history."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Hersh obviously knows something (or lots of things) about Camelot not meant for public consumption. Although the book introduces some new information, few knowledgeable readers will find substantial new ground here. The best of the book is probably Hersh's recounts of Secret Service inside philoandering of the Kennedy White House. The weakest part has got to be Hersh's revisionist ideas re. the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bay of Pigs, and his overall assessment of JFK's foreign policy. In my opinion, although much of the book relates highly-charged material, Hersh pays too little attention to detailing his sources. If it sounds to good to be true - it may be a bit of literary license!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is one of the most interesting historical books that I have read in a long time. It certainly takes some of the glint & glitter off of JFK and creates some very interesting avenues on who it was that called for his assination. It should be a must read for, at least, every history major & minor and who ever is going to be teaching modern American history. It was a very hard book to put down."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I just read this book, a little late I guess. Hersh should have waited a year or two to write this then he could have added a couple more chapters, in light of the many disclosures that have come out since then. I was always a strong Kennedy fan, but now I find that I am a disappointed Kennedy fan. In spite of the Cuban Crises I think JFK was probably an average President, not great, but also not poor. Hersh covers a lot of ground but seems to have completely missed the Mary Pinchot Meyer affair. Perhaps this was intentional for some reason, but he certainly failed to mention it while discussing all the other JFK women. (I guess Pinchott was of a higher class paramour than the others). Since Hersh wrote this book it seems the entire Kennedy clan has taken somewhat of a dive, but I guess that under today's ethics standards that's to be expected. We wouldn't expect books written by Salinger, O'Donnell, Fay, and in particular Schlesinger to be objective."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Contrary to so many books about 'Camelot', I believe this book is factual and makes for good reading. The younger generation needs to question history as written by The Media to further their own goals."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"...might have been a better title. It would be nave to be shocked at these events (the widely held low opinion of politicians is, more often than not, quite justified), but JFK and his whole clan--what a bunch of punks. Keep in mind: the author is not trying to paint an objective picture of the JFK presidency; neither is he \\"out to get\\" Kennedy. He's dishing the dirt that people have tried so hard to sweep under the rug. It does get a bit slow at points (journalists don't seem to do well when it comes to writing full books, in my experience), but it was engaging enough to keep me reading to the end.Is this brilliant scholarship? No, but it's not just tabloid sensationalism either. This book is a useful counter-balance to all those who deify or otherwise misrepresent JFK. It is undeniable that JFK has a profound impact on the evolution of the modern presidency and it is undeniable that he lived through very interesting times. As a president, JFK deserves study. As a person . . . what a spoiled, selfish loser.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"The reason I liked this book is that it was SO matter of fact. The Kennedys are objectively described, I think. ALL of the things we all now know to be true are presented---JFK and RFK and the women, Marilyn Monroe, etc. But the things I wanted in the book that weren't there were:An analysis of how their negative behavior (the women, the drugs, the ruthless politics) affected the whole Kennedy Family and the people around them. These people constitute the second most ruthless political dynasty in American History (in my mind having been overtaken by the Bushes) and we have no insight into the interpersonal costs, the effects on children growing up in that environment, the effects on women who were married to these men. There is so much that goes beyond the historical fact that just never gets a voice.I'd also like to have seen more information about the women, and how they were trained to fit into this family. Ted Kennedy, according to his eulogizers, was completely consumed with pleasing his mother. Seymour Hirsh gives her no consideration at all, except to describe her as being cold and distant----something that Ted Kennedy's devotion belies. Why is the devotion to his mother manifested as deep Catholicism---it was her coping mechanism, as some sort of intricate denial system, but in Teddy? Why was the man who became known as possibly the most cynical politician in history capable of embracing something so illogical, so beyond critical analysis. What in his character made this possible?Which of the Kennedy women became as robotic about sex as the men? There are so many stories about Jackie Kennedy having slept around, and yet having loved JFK deeply. It's commonplace in men, but rare in women----how does the Kennedy family create this mindset? What leads almost all of them to find solace in drugs or sex or alcohol? Why is this true even after Joe kennedy senior is so long dead?I found the book to be refreshingly realistic, but left me wanting SO many more answers than it provided. There are lists and lists of surprising facts (Duri Malcome) but I wanted more from Seymour Hirsh. I wanted a framework in whichh to understand it all....."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Seymour Hersh, one of America's most respected journalists, and a Pulitzer Prize winner, does his homework here in exposing the Kennedy presidency. He carefully researches and documents the exploits of JFK and the Kennedy family, from the numerous sexual conquests (JFK makes Bill Clinton look like a boy scout) to Kennedy's political errors, including the failed assassination of Fidel Castro, the Bay of Pigs, the October missle crisis, and the Kennedy family's involvement with organized crime. Kennedy lovers won't like it, but everything is carefully footnoted and documented. A well written book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is one of the most disappointing books I've ever read. I can't believe that an investigative reporter of Mr. Hersh's reputation could not come up with something better than this confused mix of hearsay, simplistic interpretation, and self-serving innuendo.By the end of the book, I had hundreds of notes on problems and shortcomings, and I despaired of being able to write a short, succinct indictment of Mr. Hersh's failings. Then I discovered that historian Gary Wills had critiqued this book in the \\"New York Review of Books\\" (Dec. 18, 1997). Professor Wills's review is titled \\"A Second Assassination,\\" and he addresses Mr. Hersh's failings with more insight and authority than I would be able to muster. I recommend that anyone considering buying Mr. Hersh's book to read Professor Wills's review first.A few points not considered by Professor Wills: (1) Little, Brown is an established publisher, but this book is a disgrace. The copy editing is excellent, but the developmental editing is a complete failure -- the writing is nearly incoherant, rambling, poorly organized, and filled with sophmoric conclusions. Someone should have had the courage to confront Mr. Hersh and insist on improvement.(2) The book lacks the most rudimentary front matter to help the reader establish a context of interpretation. There is a one-page \\"Author's Note\\" which provides little insight into why Mr. Hersh chose to write this particular book at this particular time. No Foreword or Introduction by another authority or expert or historian. Nothing. Mr. Hersh has another page of \\"Acknowledgments\\" in which he thanks his publisher and his research assistants and acknowledges funding from Lancer Productions, \\"an independent television production company.\\" I would have preferred to see the acknowledgment of funding appear at the beginning of the book(3) The chapter notes are useless. Notes for each chapter are collected together in one run-on paragraph per chapter at the end of book, making it impossible to correlate citations with references in the text. There is no Bibliography. Proper scholarly apparatus is essential for evaluating the validity of a book such as this that is claiming to \\"reclaim\\" history. The system adopted by the publisher merely expresses contempt for the reader.I have no independent knowledge of the history of this book, but speculating as someone who has worked in publishing, it seems to me to have all the earmarks of a project that is behind schedule, over-budget, and has been pushed out the door in an attempt to meet contractual obligations and minimize losses. Minimize your own losses -- read about the Kennedys somewhere else."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Seymour Hersh, the man according to whom we have to thank for the Church Commission (which led to idiotic government intelligence \\"reforms\\" that, in turn, contributed to the intelligence failures that permitted 9-11), presents his best shot in this book at smearing the Kennedy clan. John especially, but also Joe and even to a certain extent Bobby. In most of the book, he succeeds in this task only to the extent we can trust mobsters, convicted felons, former madams, self-professed ex-lovers, hustlers, disgruntled employees and bankrupt, disbarred attorneys to tell us the truth.However, Mr. Hersh does present some very compelling testimonies from JFK's secret service agents, who describe JFK's White House adolescent hijinks in rhyparographic detail. Believe me, that section alone (pp 226-246) is enough to take the shine off Camelot -- permanently.Hersh is perplexing. He has impeccable anti-American and Democratic Party credentials, yet he savages JFK, a fellow Democrat, in a way that no one had done before, or in the eleven years since the book was published. Why? I can only conclude that Hersh's anger stems from his view that JFK was responsible for Vietnam. Hersh addresses Vietnam in the last two chapters of the book, and although these chapters are better sourced than some of the more salacious sections, the chapters seem disjointed, meandering, and tied together only by rage towards JFK."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I was impressed with the way the author was able to present a large amount of complex information in a very concise and readable format. The subject itself is interesting and the author was able to substantiate the claims made by this book. This book was obviously well researched and serves a valuable purpose in showing us that things are not always what they appear to be. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the surface and get a more in depth understanding of the complex forces swirling around JFK during his time in office."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"The book merely confirmed what had been rumored for so long. JFK, like so many before him, and some after, liked all the things power can bring.We must all realize that powerful men, men of position and men of money can and do use both to bring about any desired outcome. I was not appalled to read anything in Hersh's book. The book is well researched and well written. Whether everything is true, matters not. The picture is quite clear. As we watch the Clinton story unfold, this might have been JFK if things had been different. I am still a great fan of the late president and nothing I read caused me reason for concern.We do need more books like this. I think its time we get to look at both sides of our leaders. Not that I think we need perfect people to run our country, I just think we need put our money and energy into something besides watching hearings and buying tee shirts with a message. get the book and get the facts and move on."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"People see what they want to see, especially when the press colludes to present a false image as with JFK. This book is valuable; it sets history right and shows the real face of Camelot: corruption. The most telling exposure in the book is not Kennedy's sexual excursions. No, it concerns the fate of the four Alabama National Guard pilots, who when Kennedy failed to support the Bay of Pigs invasion with a second air strike, provided air support on their own. They were shot down and killed after doing severe damage to the Cuban defenses. Fearing exposure of US complicity, the Kennedy brothers refused pensions to the families. They relented only when an oil magnate ( approached by one of the wives) threatened to go to the newspapers. The Kennedy's were cold, self-centered egoists, who only cared for their own prosperity, with no feeling for those who sacrificed for them or the country. They were not true leaders, just users and power addicts. This book shows us the truth."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"58,000 Americans died in Vietnam as part of this spoiled, sick, child's 1964 re-election strategy.

But that would have made JFK look soft on Communism, so he had to go. Weep for Diem; do not weep for Kennedy. An excellent book. A necesary book.

Is someone who is wreckless with history,didn't check or care for authenticity (it was some one else who did at the last minute) and incredibly gullible (the other Kennedy papers were also faked, using typewriting equipment that hadn't been invented until many years after JFKs death!) And of course out to make a quick buck,the facts be damned. In the tabloid era, Hersh was hoping to score a hit...and instead, as Gary Wills said, &quot; completely destroyed his own career and reputation.&quot; The book was a flop,collapsing under it's own incredulity and is already verging on obscurity and we can hope to God that other such sensational books will follow the same path."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"From Chapter 15\\"The party was so noisy that a group of California state policemen on duty at the front of the estate, which bordered on a desert wilderness area, assumed the shouts and shrieks of the partygoers were the nighttime calls of coyotes.\\"A Secret Service agent on duty that night:\\"...we didn't want [the policemen] to see that the president was swimming with all these ladies and they were all nude. So we had to lie to them, and we just agreed with them that there are coyotes running like hell all over the place...\\"JFK packed more living into a short life than any thousand guys you can think of. He makes Bill Clinton look like Jerry Falwell.

Imagine what he might have done had he not been a physical wreck (or had he lived longer).Regardless of what you think of JFK, this book is highly worthwhile. If you're a fan, you'll like JFK even more. Or if you hate JFK, this book will give you plenty of ammo for your next confrontation with a JFK liberal.Any fan of Rat Pack history should have this book.

Murrow, and a few others. And like any great journalist, Hersh has written several major books that explore an important time period in American history. This work here looks at the personal and public life of JFK, and explores all the sleaze with regards to money, sex, corruption, and the lies told by the Kennedy clan and their supporters to cover up the money trails and sex. There is fair mention of the other Kennedy family members such as RFK, Teddy, and Joe Sr. And the book confirms what many have suspected for a while, that LBJ blackmailed JKF into the VP slot during the 1960 election. The book's citations are numerous, and the author does a wonderful job connecting all sorts of dots together. I would have given the book 5 stars except for the final chapter. For all the digging the author does, and all the trash he digs up, he short changes the JFK assassination by summarily agreeing with the Warren Commission report."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Seymour Hersh has provided an outstanding book describing and documenting the multitudinous depravities of Jack Kennedy and his father's family. To satisfy those who find the Kennedy's apparently unusual sexual behavior of no particular interest, but who are interested in the Kennedy brothers' malfeasance in office, Mr. Hersh has tried his best to connect the two. For example, he attempts to show that Jack Kennedy's various sexual dalliances opened him up to blackmail. In stretching to make that case, Mr. Hersh has to introduce an almost unsubstantiated case that the award of the TFX jet fighter (later called the F-111) development contract to General Dynamics in 1962 was influenced by blackmail of Jack Kennedy associated with his liason with Judith Campbell Exner.Mr. Hersh didn't have to try so hard to find cases of Jack Kennedy's abuse of his office, to the detriment of the country he claimed to be serving. The most egregious case of this that I am aware of is his acquiescence in the acquisition by the State of Israel of nuclear weapons. As has been well documented elsewhere, Jack Kennedy told the then-Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben Gurion, that the Kennedy administration was going to look the other way as Israel's nuclear weapons program got underway, as a quid pro quo for Jewish political support in the presidential election of 1960.This venerable political payoff has continuing consequences to the present day, as knowledgeable citizens of various foreign countries snicker at American exhortations for them to not build weapons of mass destruction. Can the Chinese diplomats who have to listen to Bill Clinton inveigh against the evils of weapons proliferation really feel that he is anything other than a thundering hypocrite, knowing that his idol JFK went along such proliferation in the case of the tiny State of Israel, for not much more than a few pieces of silver? Those diplomats probably think that his blabbering is just Bill's way of negotiating their level of support for the next election.My question is, why is Mr. Hersh so, shall we say, penetrating in his analysis of the downside of JFK's sexual dalliances, but avoids the above described documented case of explicit political corruption on the part that president? Could it be that Mr. Hersh has his own axe to grind?"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Growing up in the 1950's, we children of the Cold War were repeatedly reminded of how fortunate we were to belong to the Free World. Our news always told us the truth, while the unfortunate people behind the iron curtain only heard lies from their government and their news. Only those able to hear Radio Free America could obtain the actual truth: it was a characteristic of communist regimes to lie and delude their citizens.We believed it. Today's youth would find risible the shock I felt in college when the Watergate tapes were disclosed and we learned the President used swear words and sometimes didn't tell the truth.&quot;The Dark Side of Camelot&quot; is a meticulously researched book of what really was going on in the 1950's and early 1960's while most of us remained deluded in our innocence. Unlike many trashy histories, the author carefully documents the source of his facts, who said it and when, and in cases of dispute gives the chronologies of various statements and positions. The depth of his research is breathtaking.And yes, we need to know these facts, who JFK really was and what he really did. It is the only way we have to truely understand what happened to us and to the world in that time.One is inelucably led to ponder the disparity between what is happening now and what we are told is happening.

What total nonsense."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Responding to the criticism of my last comments about this book. Yes I have read this book, and as an historian the comment that it is easy to scream trash , just is not accurate. The supposed shared mistress Exner is not a proven fact, just by stating what she claimed (passing money from the White House to Giancana) doesn't make it true. Where is the absolute imperical evidence? Just her well paid word?! The Kennedy administration attacked organized crime like no other in our history, so why in Gods' name did the Mafia want to elect him President?! How do you buy votes? It is a SECRET ballot, no one knows who anyone votes for!What kind of written receipt do you get? Not a very smart way to spend money! The supposed stolen election is another falsehood, if people would actually read real history, they would know that Illinois, and Chicago , were NOT pivotal to the election, Michigan was! If Nixon had won Illinois and all of its' electoral votes, he STILL would have lost the election. AND there are accusations(also not proven) that the Republicans were stealing votes to! Just by alleging that JFK had ghostwriters for his book PROFILES IN COURAGE, again, doesn't make it so..again where is the imperical proof?...same for the alleged &quot;orgies&quot; etc..just by making the claim , doesn't PROVE the claim..that is the basic tenent to all historical authenticity. People should not be so gullible. The Late Carl Sagan once said, &quot;Big claims require Big PROOF&quot; Hersh provides little if ANY proof.

I actually found the early sections of the book which deal primarily with his father Joe Kennedy to be insightful into the kind of environment he grew up in and undoubtably led to his immoral nature. Where Hersh is on weaker ground is when he tries to psychoanalyze JFK. He attempts to connect all of Kennedy's personal issues to decisions made about international politics, a hazardous course. I think Hersh was too close to Kennedy and his sense of profound disappointment as well as his breathy, rumormonger style of writing sometimes hurts his credibility which is unforunate because I think the author wrote a thought provoking, intelligent book"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"The Dark Side of Camelot rewrites the history of John F. Kennedy and his presidency-at least the public version. Thank you Mr. Hersh, for taking aim at the Kennedy mystique and helping change the popular view of the Kennedy family forever. This is a must read for all. This books exposes what Kennedy should be remembered for: Vietnam (which he viewed as a strategic piece of real estate), stolen elections, adulterous affairs, the invasion of Cuba... The Kennedy's-those paragons of reformism and concern for the people-are shown for what they truly were: communist hunters, union busters, counter-insurgency enthusiasts, torture chamber academy founders... Those under the spell of the mythic &quot;Camelot&quot; will not like this book, but it's a truth from the 60s we should not shy away from. Kennedy should be remembered for unleashing the military might of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese, Cubans and more. Those who've been fooled by the likes of Clinton's liberal image would do well to study this book. It unveils the liberal as but a sugarcoated mask, the better to eat you with, in their rule of U.S. imperialism. Thanks Seymour, You've got a winner!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I found this book to be utterly fascinating. As Hersh is a relatively well-known investigative reporter, I tend to trust what he says is true, although I have no way to verify any of it. Although others have commented that what he reveals isn't any news, I haven't read any other books about Kennedy, so it was all news to me. It seems to me that the earlier reviewers who have rejected his conclusions resent having their idol smashed to pieces. It's interesting how Kennedy's misdeeds and compulsions parallel those of the current president.

Hersh to be a well-researched and (despite its title) balanced portrayal of the U.S. royal family. John F. Kennedy was a product of his times and his upbringing. That is, everything has its price. If an election can be bought, well, let's buy it.It's just so hard to imagine that the man could sleep with so many women and run the country at the same time. Then again, he was prescribed steroids for his Addison's Disease. And his trusted aides seemingly procured for him.I do believe that Kennedy had a personal turn-around at the time his son Patrick was born and died, and then JFK himself died shortly thereafter. But if Hersh's sources and conclusions are to be believed that Kennedy refused to withdraw troops from Vietnam until after the 1964 election, so he would not be perceived as being soft on Communism, the judgment of history should rest on his administration for the decade-long cataclysm that followed his assassination.Hersh's book is a fascinating post-mortem on an American myth. All of his sources are documented and allowed themselves to be named and there is no seeming ideological ax being grinded."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"First, the disclaimer: although I am a conservative, I like and admire much of what JFK did as president, and I admire the man. Few readers will begin reading this book without a pre-existing opinion of Kennedy. That is/was mine.Hersh does a workmanlike job illustrating the apparently undeniable fact that Kennedy had medical problems, integrity issues, and personal problems that the country would probably not tolerate in a president today. This book appears to be well-researched and well-documented. It does not present a flattering portrayal of Kennedy and it does not intend to.First, the infidelity. Hersh goes into depressing detail as to his theme that JFK's marriage was a sham. According to Hersh, JFK never missed an opportunity to philander whenever Jackie Kennedy was away, and sometimes when she wasn't away. Much of JFK's inner circle conspired with him in this regards (according to Hersh) to a degree that is hard to imagine. Hersh speculates that part of Kennedy's abnormal libedo was induced by various drugs he took for his Addison's condition. Hersh develops this theme further in his discussion of the Cuban Missile Crisis and speculates that the cocktail of steroids and other drugs that Kennedy evidently needed to get through the day affected his judgment and his willingness to take risks. This in turn may have caused him to be more prone to the kind of brinksmanship that Hersh claims characterized Kennedy's handling of the Missile Crisis.Personally I'm not so sure. Despite the fact that the US had an overwhelming nuclear and overall military superiority over Soviets in 1962, Kennedy did not bomb the missiles out but instead negotiated. Here I felt Hersh was unfair to Kennedy.On the other hand, it seems clear that Kennedy's marriage was a sham and his image of youthful vigor was even more of a sham. Hersh is convincing that Kennedy could not get through the day without a battery of probably illegal drugs. Kennedy was suffering from Addison's disease, which is a very serious condition, and had many other health issues, including the famous back problem, which put him in constant pain.Personally I found this book convincing as regards the infidelity, drug, and health claims that it made about Kennedy. Hersh is on thinner ice when he theorizes that these issues caused Kennedy to endanger the country. While this book or one like it is probably needed to balance the fluff pieces about Kennedy (and all the Kennedys) that abound, it is not itself a balanced analysis of JFK. To its credit, the book more or less admits this, in its title if nowhere else."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"\\"This warts-and-more-warts bio is so determined to kill off the Kennedy mystique it should be subtitled The Second JFK Assassination.... Hersh packs so much sleaze and scandal between the covers, he makes Kitty Kelley look like a pussycat.\\" (Editorial Review from Entertainment Weekly, a respected journal of political & historical analysis.)The Kennedys were entertainment, daily, for a nation becoming addicted to the drug of television. Jack, Jackie, Bobby, Teddy, and even strange Robert McNamara were stars, mainlining glitz to the masses in a perpetual party where the best & brightest women, wearing Casini gowns, pushed each other into Georgetown swimming pools and where their men fiddled with Faddle in John Kennedy's hide-away pool at the White House.Seymour Hersh, respected and sometimes venerated for his expose' journalism about My Lai, Cointelpro, and Abu Ghraib, was reviled by the eastern liberal priesthood for exposing in this book a naked liberal icon. Spit and vituperation flew about Hersh's sloppiness, his near miss in almost going to print with some bad intel about Marilyn Monroe. That single slip-up became the firestorm focus of a mainstream media seduced by John Kennedy in 1960 and 1961 (JFK said in January '61 that it was our \\"moment of maximum danger\\" ... and indeed it was; we had entrusted the free world to an amphetamine kid and to the kid's kid brother) and that's seduced by him now.Historian Michael Beschloss said that while the public is still enamored of the Kennedy phantom, most historians now know better. But historical honesty and accuracy are hampered by the priesthood I mentioned. 42 years after Dallas, the Kennedys and their protectors -- who bought absolution for Teddy at Chappaquiddick -- are still buying cover for the darkest corners of Camelot. There's a priesthood or palace guard blocking access to information, and it's reminiscent of Florence Harding, widow of another randy president, burning his papers before historians could see them.(Anyone disputing my assertion about media seduction should review the media's failure to question or challenge Kennedy's failure at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. For a fumigation of smelly liberal pieties about the Missile Crisis of 1962, read liberal Eric Alterman's excellent discussion in When Presidents Lie. For perceptive analyses of assassination plots against Castro, go to Gus Russo and Ronald Steele. I'm astonished, though, that even now there is more concern about inept attempts to kill a tyrant than about the assassination in 1962 of America's ally Ngo Dinh Diem. That assassination, which locked us into a decade of no-win war, must have been approved by Kennedy or by someone close to him.)"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Basically, how you rate \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" all comes down to how you feel about the Kennedys, as the previous reviews on this book have clearly demonstrated. If you admire the Kennedys, then this book is \\"trash\\" and Hersh's claims about John F. Kennedy's Presidency are \\"wildly exaggerated\\" or \\"just not true\\". But if you don't like the Kennedys, then Hersh's claims are \\"without doubt\\" and \\"undeniably the truth\\".Books about John F. Kennedy usually fall into one of these two groups - the scholarly, mostly admiring \\"serious\\" books which concentrate on the issues Kennedy dealt with as President and look only briefly at his many personal flaws; and the so-called \\"sensational\\" books which focus primarily on JFK's wild private life and only briefly examine the major historical events of his term of office (the Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.). I tend to look at Hersh's book somewhat differently - I think that many of Hersh's allegations are indeed true, and there's little doubt (as many other books and sources have confirmed Hersh's allegations), that JFK was anything but a saint in his private life. However, I'm still not convinced that his private behavior had much effect on his judgments and decisions in the great historical moments of his Presidency. For example, does anyone (except his strongest critics) believe that Kennedy consulted Marilyn Monroe (or one of his other mistresses) before giving the order to allow Cuban exiles to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow Fidel Castro (would Monroe even know where Cuba was)?Most of Hersh's claims have been made elsewhere, although he does come up with new testimony from ex-Secret Service agents, aides, and others to buttress his arguments. Specifically, the major charges are: 1) That Kennedy, with the help of his sinister, enormously wealthy father, \\"bought\\" the 1960 presidential election by stealing enough votes to defeat JFK's great rival, Richard Nixon. There was some evidence of major vote-stealing in Illinois (Nixon carried 92 of 101 counties in Illinois but still lost the state by only 9,000 votes, mostly because of a huge Kennedy vote in Chicago). President Eisenhower encouraged Nixon to contest the results there, but Nixon, in a graceful move, refused to. Hersh implies that the mafia in Chicago, specifically mob boss Sam Giancana, stole the votes necessary for JFK to win in Chicago, and that Kennedy and Giancana privately communicated through a woman they shared sexually, Judith Campbell-Exner. Exner's story has been repeated in other books, and there is little doubt that she and Kennedy had a relationship. However, Illinois alone wouldn't have changed the outcome of the election, and Nixon would still have needed to win another big state to change the result. His best bet may have been in Texas, another state that JFK won by a close margin and where there were also claims of vote fraud (courtesy of Lyndon Johnson, JFK's running mate). However, the Texas angle has never been investigated as thoroughly as the Illinois vote, and we may never truly know who should have won the 1960 presidential election - we can only speculate.For his second charge, Hersh provides plenty of eyewitness testimony that President Kennedy had literally dozens of mistresses, extramarital affairs, and one-night stands, thus leaving himself open to blackmail from foreign governments or hostile internal forces (such as the mafia). Again, there's considerable evidence from other books that Kennedy did fool around - two of his secretaries were nicknamed \\"Fiddle\\" and \\"Faddle\\" and often took nude swims with him in the White House pool. Again, the real charge is whether or not these women compromised JFK's ability to do his job, and that's harder to prove. That Kennedy treated most of these women like live sex toys is undeniable - he didn't seem to take most of them seriously (nor, according to author Gore Vidal, a relative of Jackie Kennedy, did his wife. According to Vidal, Jacqueline Kennedy often used the word \\"it\\" , not \\"she\\" or \\"her\\", when referring to her husband's many mistresses). Kennedy also supposedly had a fling with a woman who was later suspected of being a spy for the Communist East German government, and who was quickly deported when Bobby Kennedy learned of the suspicions about her. These are serious charges, and Kennedy does seem to have been guilty of, at least, extremely poor judgment.And, finally, Hersh charges that Kennedy systematically used the power of the Presidency to cover up his shenanigans, thus breaking the law repeatedly and committing criminal acts. If true, this would place Kennedy in the Nixon range of Watergate-type scandals, which means that he should have been impeached. Again, there is little doubt that Kennedy used the Secret Service and other federal agencies to hide his behavior from outsiders, and his brother did use his power as Attorney General to silence embarrassing stories and try to dig up dirt on potential enemies (such as Nixon, the Kennedys had the IRS audit his taxes several times from 1961-1963, with no result). Of course, MANY politicians have done the same, and while it may not be morally right, the Kennedys were neither the first nor the last politicians to do so. Whether this makes them especially evil or sinister is dubious. In short, it is my belief that Hersh's claims, although largely true, still don't provide a clear link between JFK's private life and his public (political) life. Was Kennedy a terrible person? Hersh makes a strong case that the private Kennedy was often a sexually deviant, amoral man. But as for Kennedy the President (and they are different things), I don't believe he was a great President, but he also wasn't the awful leader that Hersh and some others make him out to be. Today many historians rate JFK as about average - in the middle of the pack. And that's about where I would place him, too. And that's also why I'm giving \\"The Dark Side of Camelot\\" three stars - Hersh's research and allegations are worth reading, but whether there's a link between what Hersh describes and Kennedy's political behavior and decision-making remains to be seen."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":". . . I felt just plain dirty.The title gives you an obvious clue that this isn't going to be your average work about Kennedy. And, it's not. If you're looking for a book that portrays Kennedy and his supporting cast in the worst possible light in every case, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to you. If you \\"never liked the Kennedys\\" and believe \\"they always got away with everything,\\" then, again, this is the book for you.Mr. Hersh has run into problems in the past with people questioning his sources and \\"facts.\\" It seems that his sourcing is good here (and, in fact, this book is even cited in Robert Dallek's JFK work, \\"An Unfinished Life.\\")My problem with the book was more one of perspective. Every story, every anecdote, every whispered secret is clearly told to impart the most sinister and devious motives to Kennedy and his clan. Where there are conceivably other interpretations (even when they are well-known), they are not mentioned.The bottom-line is that this book is a hatchet job. I don't know whether most of it is true or not. My guess is that much of it is. I know that I couldn't put the book down once I started it - though not from a sense of satisfaction in what I was reading, but more because, as I turned each page, there was a sense of wonderment as to how the next page could be more outrageous than the one I just read.If you're a Kennedy basher, you'll love it. If you're a Kennedy can do no wrong type, you'll hate it. If you're like me, and somewhere in the middle, you'll learn a few things you probably didn't know before, but you'll find the experience a lot like taking castor oil."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book is based largely on recently released documents, accessed via the Freedom of Information Act, and on the recollections of many of those who heretofore helped safeguard the myth of \\"Camelot.\\" To say that it tells an interesting story would be a monumental understatement, for the book tells a long suppressed story of corruption, arrogance, abuse of power, and immorality at the highest levels of government. And it is so well researched and so meticulously and methodically documented that there can be little doubt that this is, in fact, the nearest we will ever come to the true tale of Camelot.In his day, John F. Kennedy was seen by many as a prince charming who lived with his beautiful loving wife and children in a idyllic sort of \\"Camelot;\\" a man who could and would do no wrong. But nothing could be farther from the truth. As the reader will discover, Camelot was built on mountain money, false publicity, lies, corruption, and deceit and was maintained by secrecy and an all pervasive silence which persisted in various degrees for almost forty years.Without reciting the entire book, here are a few of the many revelations brought forth in these pages: John F. Kennedy suffered from venereal disease (non-gonorrheal urethritis) for most of his adult life and could never be cured because of his incessant sexual excesses. There is strong evidence that Kennedy was married in 1947 to a socialite in Palm Beach and that there was no subsequent divorce, casting doubt on the legitimacy of his later marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier. Jacqueline Kennedy was presumably paid by JFK's father to stand by him if he was elected president, but she planned to divorce him if he lost the 1960 election. Kennedy's father, Joseph P. Kennedy, spent millions of dollars in publicity over a period of years to promote his son's political career, and later spent even more in bribes in Illinois, West Virginia, and other states, mostly through his criminal contacts, in order to ensure his son's election to the presidency. Following JFK's election, his father insisted that he appoint his brother, Robert, Attorney General ostensibly to stymie any possible investigation of the stolen election. While in office, JFK continued his sexual excesses with loose women, including high-priced prostitutes. Kennedy personally cancelled the second bombing mission during the \\"Bay of Pigs,\\" resulting in the failure of the invasion. JFK carried on an illicit affair with a woman named Judith Campbell and used her to funnel money and messages to crime boss Sam Giancana in an effort to arrange the assassination of Fidel Castro. There is some indication that JFK may have been blackmailed while he was in the White House so as to influence the awarding of some government contracts. Kennedy didn't force Nikita Khrushchev to back down in the Cuban Missile Crisis as Americans were led to believe. Instead, he secretly agreed never to invade Cuba and to remove NATO's Jupiter missiles from Turkey if the Soviet missiles would be removed from Cuba. Eventually Kennedy got Judith Campbell pregnant, whereupon he suggested that perhaps Sam Giancana could help her get an abortion. And, shortly before his assassination, Kennedy had an affair with a woman named Ellen Rometsch who was thought, by the FBI, to be a possible East German spy. Rometsch was abruptly deported back to Germany, where she was paid handsomely by the Kennedys to keep quiet. She was never granted another visa to return to the United States, where she might be called to testify.After reading this book, one will likely conclude that JFK wasn't a master statesman or one of America's great presidents, but that he may very well have been its worst. Nevertheless, if Judith Campbell was correct in her observation that it is often impossible to tell the good men from the bad and that some [men] are deadly serious about the games they play, then the Kennedy brothers and their father must certainly be considered masters of the political game. This is a great read - go for it."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"You won't get the whole \\"Camelot\\" picture with this book but you may not get the whole \\"Camelot\\" picture without it.Hersch does a good job of incorporating most of his sources in the text so readers can judge their credibility as they read along--and as they see fit. The bibliography is also written in an easily decipherable way. It's a testament to the strength of an open society that can allow a reporter such as Hersch to spend 5 years probing through such highly sensitive sources of information as the CIA, FBI, Secret Service, organized crime and private bedrooms and will allow it citizens to learn from it.As for believability, what is more gullible, believing the hidden dark side that Hersch paints in this book or the star-struck \\"Camelot\\" image? The truth obviously has elements of both and this book simply helps balance the scale. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the generally accepted charismatic image of JFK.The value of this book is in understanding the potential disparity that can exist between image and reality for our public figures. But, believe it or not, you can also gain a deeper and more critical appreciation of JFK here by looking beyond the highly choreographed PR image to understand the total human being.I don't recommend this as an \\"introduction\\" if you don't either remember or know the basics about this subject. But if you do, even if you think you've heard it all, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat and your eyeballs on the edge of their sockets-a fascinating, informative read."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"First, I'd like to stress that this book, just like its title indicates, is not supposed to appeal to the nostalgia-ridden fans and conspiracy theorists that once found common ground on movies like 'JFK.' Seymour Hersh's 'Dark side of Camelot' is indicting as it is jaw-dropping.In one of the more revealing accounts, Hersh takes on the task of dispelling the peace-loving, freedom-advocate myth surrounding the J.F. Kennedy cult by confirming a long-held, yet underrated perpective that historical events such as the Cuban Missile crisis were in great part exacerbated by the late president and his brother Robert's domestic political ambitions, even when doing so required using the mafia as a reliable ally for the defense of the 'free world' as depicted by the Kennedys. It was the Kennedys' obsesion to bring Castro down and the urge to appear 'strong of communism' that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with the prospect of a catastrophic invasion that was planned after the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Hersh accounts of US and Soviet generals, CIA officers, and other sources of authority complement this view with chilling details.The Vietnam war also had Kennedy's fingerprints all over it, according to Hersh's findings. Kennedy's was as eager as Richard Nixon to continue running the war at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives when the former approved of Vietnamese strongman Diem's murder, although Kennedy was well aware that Diem and his brother had started backchannel negotiations with the communist and buddhist opposition in South Vietnam to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. At the end, Diem's pro-US rivals in the military took over and resumed the reign of terror and reppression that had been encouraged by Kennedy's most hawkish advisers in the Pentagon.The 'Dark side of Camelot' is not only a political indictment of John F. Kennedy, but also an impeachment on utter immorality by a U.S. head of state. In one of at least four main accounts from ex-Secret Service officers, president Kennedy was courted by members of his cabinet with young club girls who were often threatened with lock-ups in asylums if they dared to speak about their sexual anecdotes with president Kennedy and his entourage. Kennedy's promiscuous behavior opened the door for venereal diseases, such as Chlamydia, to haunt him until the day of his death, according to medical records cited by Hersh.For revelations like these ones, it is likely that the 'Dark Side of Camelot' be dismissed as a gossip-teller on the sexual life of John F. Kennedy, however, it will prove immensely valuable for those who wish to pursue the trail of elussive puzzle parts that shaped U.S. government policy during some of the most impacting world events of the 20th century"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book is well worth reading. I have never been a Kennedy-hater, nor an apologist, but think that this book is important and accurate in dispelling the annoying Camelot myth. Americans should be offended, not just morally, but because JFK compromised American security unhesitatingly.I strongly disagree with repeating sentiments in previous reviews. This is not just a rehash; there is much new supporting evidence, and added material. Also, this is not based on &quot;rumors.&quot; Hersh is explanatory about sources to the point that it impedes the narrative -- but is important to his credibility.I give the book four stars because the style leaves a little to be desired, but is still quite agreeable. The content is above reproach. A generation of people who did not live through the assassination do not buy into the concept of &quot;American royalty&quot; -- bought, not earned -- and do not hold a man of youth, beauty and intelligence above the basic standards of decency and statesmanship."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"The on-line reviews of the book are telling: The ones attacking &amp; debunking the book don't provide any substance. They attack the author, they call it sleaze, etc. But not one of them takes issue with the contents of the book, which is what a review should do. To those of you who still are seduced by the Kennedy mystique, I challenge you to find anything substantively wrong with Mr. Hersh's thesis: That JFK, because of his debauched personal life compromised his country in ways we couldn't heretofore imagine. A more apt metaphor for his administration should have been Oz rather than Camelot. And shame on all the people all these years who knew what was behind the curtain, but yet continue to propogate the lie. Unfortunately, there are enough people still out there who try to defend the indefensible, but they distort the debate by avoiding the issues and point out, among other things, problems the author had in compiling the book. Mr. Hersh took great care in researching his book, and that's why the &quot;Marilyn Papers&quot; didn't make it. He was honest enought and thorough enough to make sure only the truth got in. We need to judge the book by it's actual, not it's potential, contents. I wonder what Entertainment Weekly has said in the past about books regarding Richard Nixon? Do they defend him?

To hear Hersh tell it, JFK and his brother Bobby were alternately best buddies and bitter enemies with J.Edgar Hoover, Mafia chieftains and the CIA. Hersh spins a confusing tale of sex, spies, and money laundering by tying one isolated fact to another. When he lacks a second source to support a claim, he resorts to convoluted logic instead. While the author purports to be writing a revisonist history of the Kennedy Presidency, unlike genuine scholarly studies, the broader context of the era is often ignored. Hersh's book will be momentarily titilating to those of us who grew up during the Kennedy years, but ultimately, it leaves many questions unanswered. If JFK soiled the bedsheets of so many rich married women--including the spouses of foreign diplomats-- how is it that not one of their cuckolded husbands raised a stink? Why should we suppose, furthermore, that Jackie would have been ignorant of these affairs, as Hersh claims? If Joseph Kennedy Sr. had actually used his fortune to steal the 1960 election in so many different ways, how was it possible to keep so many Republicans or even independent skeptics silent for so many years--that is, until Mr. Hersh ambled by? Why would they suddenly reveal their secrets to him? Finally, the book is not so much a carefully reasoned account of the Kennedy era as it is a collection of disjointed investigative news articles that are repetitious, redundant and ultimately reckless. Despite the intense marketing of the book--reminiscent of a Hollywood blockbuster movie--this dog's bark is worse than its bite."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Author Hersh has done a good job of presenting an objective thesis. During the Camelot years, the public was fed a bill of goods. The mythical Camelot of musical fame had a mythical counterpart during the JFK administration. This book covers the president's position on issues and, unfortunately some of the more questionable decisions he made regarding his private life.Robert Kennedy, on the other hand was the man who worked behind the scenes. From all accounts, the young lawyer and later Attorney General sublimated his own interests, needs and identity so as to push his brother forward. Robert Kennedy was the clean up man, the one who from many accounts shielded his brother to the best of his ability.When President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, people mourned the loss of Camelot. Sadly, what I think people during that era were really mourning was the loss of the illusion of the &quot;picture perfect&quot; White House world.Robert Kennedy literally came into his own following his brother's tragic death and, it is he who inadvertently &quot;left the lights on&quot; in Camelot. He was the man who, in his own inimitable fashion exposed the myth of Camelot to the light of day during the LBJ White House years. It was Robert Kennedy who actively campaigned for Civil Rights issues and who, along with Johnson (interestingly, these men were at sword's points) forced the world at large to confront some harsh societal ills that the illusion of Camelot omitted."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I'm now more suspicious that the Clinton scandals of the '90s have their origins in a battle going on over the revealed history surrounding Dealey Plaza and Watergate.

Hersh was identified by journalists in the late '70s as being a &quot;CIA media 'asset'.&quot; That is, someone acting in the media on behalf of interests or elements connected to that agency. &quot;Dark Side&quot; was published in 1997 -- the same year that the Assassinations Records Review Board under Clinton released the files and papers of the House Select Committee on Assassinations of 1976-1978. Those document releases support Gaeton Fonzi's book &quot;the Last Investigation&quot; (1993), in which he explains the evidence he turned up as an HSCA investigator and how Chief Counsel Richard Blakey and the CIA suppressed that evidence.Hersh says his book is &quot;not about the assassination.&quot; Instead, it dredges up all that stuff about Marilyn Monroe and Judith Exner and JFK's &quot;chronic venereal disease,&quot; etc. etc. etc. But the fact is, if you have read what I have about the JFK and Watergate histories, Hersh's book IS about the assassination. It is part of a coverup. At the end of the book, he &quot;explains&quot; the Diem &quot;assassination&quot; as Kennedy's doing (it wasn't), and implies or describes Kennedy trying to enlist Maj. Gen. Ed Lansdale in getting Diem killed. He says that Lansdale was &quot;scrupulous,&quot; and that Lansdale begs off Kennedy's request because Diem was his friend. This is a patent falsehood and a lie. L. Fletcher Prouty, who worked for Lansdale something like ten years, describes the man as someone who laughed about throwing VC out of helicopters in Vietnam, and someone who is at the core of the assassination conspiracy. &quot;Why does Hersh beatify Lansdale?&quot; is only a rhetorical question when you look at this literature and history over a longer time period. And when you have two conflicting stories, which one are you going to believe? That of a journalist who never knew Lansdale firsthand, or that of a career CIA official who knew Lansdale and worked for him over as much as a decade? If Hersh's book contains one falsehood or, at a minimum, a serious distortion of fact, how much more of the book is also suspect? We've all applied that litmus test, in one way or another, to the sitting President's prevarications.Apparently Summers' book responds to Hersh's, and presents new evidence about the Nixon connections to organized crime and the CIA's Caribbean assassination projects. And guess where Summers gets that &quot;evidence?&quot; From the document releases by the Assassination Records Review Board under the Clinton administration.There is a quiet war in progress at this moment, and the spoils will be the &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of the American people. I don't think most people know about it. My own suspicion is that the scandals of the last seven years are viciously intertwined with this quiet war. My fellow travelers in the historical research business are correct in recent correspondence regarding the disfunctional roots of Bill Clinton's weaknesses. And also true, Bill could have backed away from Monica as most of us probably would have, knowing the potential implications of such a liaison to the Starr investigation. So in one sense, to answer one person's question &quot;What's the point?&quot; -- there is none -- Bill did let us all down.But in a larger sense, Bill's weakness just plays into the hands of something that goes deeper. From the publications that seem to be &quot;hot off the presses&quot; -- no more than three years old -- I get the impression that there is a war going on with a battleline drawn over the field of history, separating truth from fiction.People who embrace Hersh's book as the ultimate revelation about Kennedy and the Kennedy years will be misled. It doesn't matter who was &quot;doing&quot; whom, or what sort of salacious things occurred between Kennedy, Monroe, Exner, or the legendary interns &quot;Fiddle and Faddle.&quot; It doesn't matter whether JFK had ties to the &quot;mafia,&quot; or anything else. If there had been wrongdoing, the Constitution supposedly provided mechanisms to deal with it. The real questions are these: Who subverted the Constitution in 1963? Who hijacked American democracy through a coup-d'Etat in 1963? Who is really responsible for the butchering of 59,000 young Americans in Vietnam? Who burglarized the Chilean embassy in Washington, D.C., stealing a list of names supporting the Allende regime? Who replaced a constitutional democracy in Chile with a fascist dictatorship, and then caused thousands of people -- including those on the stolen list -- to be &quot;disappeared?&quot; Who looked the other way when a former Chilean ambassador and his American assistants were blown up with a car bomb in Washington, D.C., on September 21, 1976? Who covered that murder up for three years? Who failed to investigate any further in the JFK matter when there was enough evidence from the House Select Committee on Assassinations for indictments and prosecutions? Who is really responsible for the constant feed of spin and scandal during the Clinton administration and why? And finally, who is writing books to confuse the American people about their own history and the threat to their own Constitution?"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"A classic book and very thorough, this refutes the carefully created image that John Kennedy was an especially great president and exhibited good judgment and competence. Kennedy is shown to be very superficial and something of a thrill-seeker sexually and in other areas of his life. It is remarkable that the nation survived such a poor president."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This author is good at research and took the time to read and write about the Kennedy Male Leadership which included personal and public history and how the family made its wealth and from the wealth came the power. Was it good for us the American public; those peoples who this government is suppose to serve. We \\"the poor bastards\\" that John Kennedy referred too. The Kennedy men educated by corrupt methods of making a buck; using it to their advantage in any way they saw fit be it right ethically or not. We do have to ask our selves did we benefit from the Kennedy Clan as a whole? Is this country better off because of the Kennedy Clan? I think we also have to ask the question, why such scutiny of one particular family ... what does it prove, why do we do it and who does it benefit? Common sense would tell me that so much supported data can't be all wrong and how do we compare this family with others that have impacted 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and more importantly us; the American people? It is in my opinion a book full of data about a family and if one takes the time to read the amount of data available about the Kennedy's one can decide for ones self what these people were all about. The author for whatever reason presents significant no holes barred data of a different side of the Kennedys. I would recommend taking the time to read this piece of literature to gain yet another point of view regarding this family and the why fors of this family. I bought my book used after another reader decided to sell it and obviously did not seem intent on keeping this piece of literature. It bursts the bubble of John and Jackie Kennedy to some degree ... if one choses to read extensively into history and learn facts it can be disappointing. Things are never what they seem. It is always easy after the fact to judge actions taken in the heat of the battle and not knowing at the time what the outcome will be. It is all part of history to be consumed by us the public and then judged. The book is interesting, I gave it a 4 star rating because I assume the author had the credentials to follow through and document the data he dug up regarding this family."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Legend and hero are the words most of us learn in school to apply to John F. Kennedy. We usually tend to see him only in his media and photographic image, but Seymour Hersh portrays him here as being a man with an abundant set of flaws and characteristics. Most likely, although I grant that not everything the author says can be definitively proven, Hersh's depiction of JFK is far closer to that of the real person than the one we see gazing down upon us in posters. Of course, The Dark Side of Camelot is about a whole lot more than the 35th President. We find out all manner of fact and rumor concerning his grandfather, Honey Fitz, his father, and the rest of his family; not to mention Richard Nixon and an array of women who are too numerous to name here. Kennedy was the quintessential high status male, and, intrinsic to his status, were a great many politically incorrect features that are fun to read about (while still being informative in regards to the leader and his times)."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"\\"I knew John F. Kennedy, and Senator, you're no John F. Kennedy.\\"Or something like that.This book is pretty rigorous. Plenty of footnotes. Most of the primary sources come from the Kennedy archives themselves.So how does this amount to \\"piling on sleaze?\\"We've been led by men for the whole of our history. These men have been flawed and have made terrible mistakes. We followed them, though, because we elected them and have a need to trust and respect them.I never respected a president more than JFK. After reading Hersh's treatment of him, in a weird way my respect increased. He managed to make the decisions he made under the burdens of drug usage, painkillers, and possibly advanced VD.Helluva guy!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Another nail in the coffin of the Kennedy legend, or perhaps a stake through the heart. The best chapter is the Cuban Missile Crisis which according to Hersh resulted from the obsessive attempts of the Kennedy brothers to overthrow the Castro regime including the use of assassination. This prompted protective measures by the Soviet Union. The Kennedys don't look so good, neither do Robert McNamera, and Dean Rusk, who Hersh claims lied to Congress when asked if there was a deal to swap missiles in Cuba for US missles in Turkey. I thought lying to Congress is a crime, remember Iran-Conta.No book on JFK would be complete without discussing his his sexual exploits. I think Hersh deals with this topic appropriately. For example, his affair with Judith Cambell Exner transcends the merely personal because it made JFK vulnerable to blackmail. Exner acted as a personal carrier for messages and money between JFK and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana. Once she delivered a satchel of money to Sam under the watchful eye of Martin Underwood, who I have seen relate this story on national television. Then there are the romps with Ellen Rometsch, Washington DC prostitute, native of East Germany and former member of a Communist Party group there. Unfortunately for JFK Ellen gossiped and the Kennedy people had their hands full covering that one up.No doubt Kennedy defenders will dismiss all this as a bunch of lies and attack Hersh for trying to tarnish the image of their icon. One thing is for sure, JFK would never survive the background check for security clearance if he were an ordinary citizen."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Mr. Hersh has done an excellent job in exposing the lies and sleaze that was all over the Kennedy administration. While JFK will always be remembered as a martyred president, this book shows the things he should be remembered for, namely Vietnam, stolen elections, and adulterous affairs that may have ultimately (and inadvertantly) cost him his life in Dallas. Those under the spell of the mythic &quot;Camelot&quot; will not like this book, but it is medicine that is sorely needed."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Myths die hard, particularly American myths. That the myth of &quot;Camelot&quot;--the good ol' days under the Kennedy Administration--persists even today, in our post-Watergate society, demonstrates not only our penchant for myth-making, but our intellectual blindness as well.Veteren investigative reporter Seymour Hersh tackles this myth in his new and controversial book, THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT (Little, Brown and Company, 1997; 498 pages), an effectively researched and written summation of the Kennedy years. Beginning with the origins of the family's political clout, and following through until just after the assassination, Hersh weaves a Machiavellian tale of corruption, sex, backroom deals, and intrigues that would be difficult to believe were there not so much evidence to support it.And this is where the controversy begins: just how much of this can we believe? In the wave of publicity before the book's publication, certain commentators essentially accused Hersh of becoming a sort of an out-of-the-closet Kitty Kelley, filling his narrative with unsupported allegations, speculations, and just plain hearsay. Others bashed Hersh for supposedly telling lurid stories of Kennedy's sexual conquests. In short, the general idea was that Hersh had betrayed his ideals as a reporter, shooting instead for the lowest common denominator and a high payday.A reading of the book proves these accusations to be false. As far as sources are concerned, there are many and they are well documented (so well, in fact, that the footnoting becomes a nuisance). When a source has been self-contradictory (such as in the case of Judith Exner), Hersh is quick to point this out. When an allegation seems to be questionable at best, Hersh reminds his reader of this. And when there are details that are simply unknowable, Hersh states this matter-of-factly as well. In no instance in the book does Hersh allow a tabloid mentality to prevail. For the intelligent reader, this is enough.As to the lurid sex tales, there are a few mentioned in passing. But these are in no way made to stand on their own for the sake of prurient interest. When Hersh interviews Secret Service agents and recounts their stories of the young President's numerous trysts, the point is not to rehash old (and, by now, tired) ground; rather, it is to show how his escapades made JFK vulnerable to physical harm and even blackmail. This, in turn, affected much of the way the Kennedy brothers ran the country. It is true that we've heard it all before about JFK and Marilyn; what Hersh makes clear is the gamble the man took with his office and, by extension, American lives. These insights alone make the book worth reading.This is not to say that these issues have never been dealt with before in this way; they have. Indeed, one of the flaws of the book is that it portends to add much to our understanding of JFK's administration. There is new material, but, as a whole, there's nothing that can be considered to be a revelation. Hersh treats the Cuban Missile Crisis as if he alone knows the &quot;true&quot; story, but on balance, his account isn't much different from James Patterson's in GRAND EXPECTATIONS. CAMELOT works best as a synthesis of all we've learned about Kennedy in the last 20 years, with the new details adding some salt to the meat.That the details are often entertaining is gratifying. I personally did not know that JFK was kept sitting bolt upright that day in Dallas by a stiff back-brace, and the CIA plot(s) to assassinate Castro made for often hilarious reading. Hersh's style flows quite smoothly if you can discount the often intrusive, windy footnotes (apparently included to ward off charges of poor sourcing).In all, then, THE DARK SIDE OF CAMELOT is far from the expolitive mish-mash of half-baked rumors and backroom stories it has been made out to be. It is, rather, a riveting piece of history, against the myth certainly, but implicitly fair and reliable."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"It saddens me to see books like this being published.

Hersh allegedly got a ridiculous sum to publish this book & there are many books here on amazon.com wth a ton of solid, corroborated info for a domestic conspiracy, so that is an extremely dishonest allegation. He doesn't give JFK any credit for the Cuban Missile Crisis- would he have prefered Nixon, or Johnson? who would have done exactly what the Joint Chiefs Of Staff wanted-turning Cuba into an ashtray & with the ICBM capabilities that Khruschev & Co. had, conceivably the eastern coastline from Miami up could have been hit in retaliation as they had many more missiles than was known at the time of the crisis. JFK was a great man, look at the people he had to deal with- the afforementioned crooks -LBJ & Nixon, the incredibly corrupt meglomaniac Hoover, Dulles head of the CIA who started the overthrow of foreign Govt's in Iran with Mossadegh in 1953, then Arbenz in Guatemala 54 etc, & along with Ike, left JFK with an incredible mess in Cuba when he took office with no good solution, & other high ranking military men who wanted war, and he had to try everything placating them.There's another side to these stories that Hersh doesn't mention, if JFK was so bad- why has this country been literally a lifetime of lies since 11-22-63?

Hopefully the human robots so in love with this deviant man will read this fine book and cure their obsession with him. A brillant book about a very sick member of a very sick family"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book straddles the line between James Bond and Tom Clancy.It is packed with money,sex,politics,and some classic cloak and dagger.There are also suprising revelations and riveting anecdotes. I didn't know that Richard Nixon took a bribe from Nicolae Malaxa, a Romanian metallurgist who had connections with the Nazi and Communist party. Malaxa,according to Hersh, was using Nixon to get permanent status in the U.S.,because the immigration authority's were reluctant to let him in. Only a handful of C.I.A officials knew about this bribe. This flies in the face of Nixon's anti-communist credentials.If this were made public,Eisenhower would had dropped Nixon off the ticket as his running mate. Nixons career would had been destroyed,plus the democrats might had waged a counter-offensive against the McCarthyite's. Little wonder why Eisenhower had mixed feelings about Nixon. Hersh would had enhanced his credibility if he included a snapshot of this check,{it was deposited in a Whittier bank},in the photo section. The sexual stuff was serious and hilarious. After reading this book I've become convinced that Kennedy suffered from a severe sexual addiction.It's a condition brought on by genetic's,socialization{i.e. Joe Kennedy},cortisone treatments, and Kennedy's failure to seek treatment for this problem. It's like a drug addict getting a fix of cocaine.In Kennedy's case he was getting his fix from prostitutes and girlfriends. On the other hand I busted a gut when I read the part about Kennedy rushing out of the swimming pool with a bloody mary in his hand, after he found out that Jacqueline was on her way back from a trip. The secret service agents account of the orgy at Bing Crosbys mansion had me rolling over; particularly the part when Dave Powers grabbed some of Crosby's clothes and then plunged in the pool with them, much to Kennedy's amusement. One of Hersh's finest moments was his description of the West VIrginia campaign. It's a depressing one for those who believe in America's unbridled democracy. Hersh tells how the Kennedys poured poured millions into the hands of county sheriff's and local committeeman to put their man at the top of the slate. This account is based on interviews with the sheriffs and the local polticians whowere involved with the pay-offs. One sheriff shocked the Kennedy's when he needed only a few thousand dollars,when some of the sheriffs were pocketing 50,000 dollars. The chapter on the Bay of Pigs could stand more detail, but the anecdotes take up some of the slack.Hersh reveals that four pilots of the Alabama National Guard disregarded Kennedy's cancellation of a second air strike. They took off from Nicaragua in B-26's and bombed Castro. At this part I got a bit disappointed in Hersh. He said the pilots did considerable damage before they were shot down and captured. Yet he didn't describe what kind of damage they did. I liked Hersh's explanation of why Kennedy canceled a second strike.It appears to be one of the few places that Hersh veers away from his overwhelming negativism of Kennedy. Here he paints a somewhat sympathetic picture of a young president caught between a rock and a hard place. If Kennedy does'nt go through with the invasion the right wing Republicans would had accused kennedy of being soft on communism. That would give them more impetus to stall Kennedy's domestic legislation. On the other hand a second strike would tip the Russians off to America's involvement, and Khruschev would had been pressured by hard liners in the Kremlin to call off a summit with Kennedy. That would be a major foreign policy blow for Kennedy. Thus the invasion minus the second air strike. Kennedy risked failure,but at least he would have his summit. He could also minimize fallout from the conservative republicans. Cold hard political calculation. Kennedy was more of a poltical animal than the idealist he's mythologized as. Yet Hersh failed to take Berlin into account. If Kennedy moved full throttle into Cuba, Russia probably would had retaliated in Berlin. Kennedy would be compelled to send armored divisions into Berlin. He'd had faced a two front war in Berlin and Cuba.Not an auspicious start for the new frontier. The best part of the book for me was the breakdown in arms between America and Russia. I could not get enough of this. Hersh shows that notwithstanding the 134 warheads Khrushchev sent to Cuba, the U.S. still maintained an overwhelming superiority, with 3000 nuclear warheads,compared to Russiia's paltry 250 warheads and 40 missile launchers. Still,Hersh shows that by having medium ranged missiles in Cuba,Russia had the capability of destroying places like Washington D.C. Hersh shows that though Kennedy looked tough to his associates,he consistently compromised via a backchannel to the Soviets.One example is the Cuban Missile Crisis. Khruschev was not as humialiated as the American public was lead to believe.He not only got a guarantee that America would not invade Cuba,{in return for removing the missiles from Cuba},but he got a secret deal on the removal of Jupiter missiles from Turkey. Strategically this was not a major concession. The Jupiter's were unreliable. Anyway the U.S. could take out the Russians with land and submarine based missiles. Politically,it was another story, if the Jupiter trade were made public the right wing would had cried foul, and Kennedy's public relations coup post missile crisis would had been tarnished. This is probably the first Kennedy book I've ever read that includes actual accounts of Judith Exner ferrying money from Kennedy to mobster Sam Giancana.One item that blew me away was the part when the security chief of General Dynamics tried to bug Exner's apartment,so he could get enough dirt on Kennedy and Exner to blackmail the administration into selecting GD over Boeing to build the TFX fighter. To say that this book is a definitive account of the Kennedy's would be a mistake. It's too biased. For example,Robert Kennedy is depicted as a ruthless one dimensional person.There is some truth in this. He did push obsessively for Castro's murder, behaving more like a mobster than an attorney general.On the other hand,Hersh ignores Robert Kennedy's role in the civil rights movement. Nonetheless the book is too well researched to ignore.It is packed with interviews, footnotes, and Hersh sometimes refer to other well written books about Kennedy. To those who feel heavily disillusioned about Kenndy because of this book,well I have two words of consolation.NO#1,no person in this world can live up to our ideals.NO#2 often the reality about a person is much more interesting than the myth. Disconcerting, yes, but also quite compelling. Kennedy should be accepted as the complex person he really was than the myth we Americans have shouldered him with. Thank you for reading this commentary."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"It must be assumed that Hersh is as good an investigative reporter as his reputation indicates, and therefore the book must be very largely factual.

The average American trustedhis governmental leaders; they could do wrong, we knew, butoperated with the best of intentions. A boy in those years, I canstill recall reading a Dennis the Menace magazine that took baby-boomers like myself on a tour of Washington. The golden-hairedrascal met representatives of the Golden Boy and shook hands withthe FBI Director, who supposedly made all Americans feel safein a way as innocuous as the tike's incessant antics.

A knight had fallen; his armor unable to save him fromsome mysterious, evil force in the world.How utterly taken in we all were by this dead young President's aura ofsheer goodness, and light, and spiritedness. But alas, what a masquerade,after all. Hersh's book does more than expose the dark side to an American Camelot;it suggests to the sober reader that Camelot was, as King Arthur's servant muttersin an aside in Monty Python's Holy Grail, &quot;only a model.&quot;We wanted so desperately to believe in the dawning of a new era in 1960that we conveniently forgot about hardball politics-as-usual. The backroom,cigar-biting, cutthroat deal-making couldn't have been Jack Kennedy's way,could it? America did not come of age with the unfortunate assassination of its youngPresident, after all. It only showed its age: its wrinkles and warts, itsgreasy sidedeals, and its cankerous creations. Hersh's account of the Kennedy presidency, and all thatcreated it, should make us realize, if we haven't allowed ourselves already,that the New Frontier was reached not through a virgin prairieland conceived by Kennedy'sself-described Whiz Kids, but over a too well-travelled road in Americanpolitical history--one continuously pockmarked by corruption, deceit, and tired foraysinto self-aggrandizement."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"If there is one election that was bougth,it was this one.Nixon would have won in a ,,regular,, election!!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book is a disgrace.

Before reading this book, I had my doubts as to whether it would teach me anything new; after all, it admittedly draws on hundreds of books previously written about the Kennedy family. But there was one crucial element I did not count on, and that's the fact that Hersh adds a credibility that elevates this scandalous life well above mere scandal and truly paints a political tragedy. I believe Hersh; I believed his research; I believe his motives. I believe his facts, from Joseph Kennedy's vehement pro-Nazi anti-semiticism to JFK's astoundingly arrogant flirtation, not merely with infidelity, and with the underworld, but with public exposure. Malcolm X was soundly criticized for his response to the JFK assassination, stating something like \\"The chickens have come home to roost.\\" No other book that I have read about the Kennedys has so soundly proven the insight of Malcolm X; for, as this book proves, Joseph Kennedy spawned an attitude, a way of political life, and a son, whose privilege was distorted in a direction that assured his own destruction. Simply put, the Kennedy's used people, used their great wealth, used privilege, even their god given beauty, with little or no thought of the consequences of their actions, or the people they deceived and double-crossed, or the many more they infuriated. It's not a pretty history but it's an indispensible one for an understanding of the way power works in America."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Several themes permeate this work of investigative journalism. The arrogance of wealth, the conceit of position, and the mendacity of politicians stagger the casual reader. It is complete folly to elevate any president to the mythic realms of &quot;Camelot.&quot; Presidents should be viewed as three-dimensional human beings subject to the common limits of that predicament.John Kennedy's personal life was not circumspect, and his political methods not always clean and honorable. It is astonishing by current standards, but his personal peccadilloes had the tacit approval of the news media and the U.S. government agencies (i.e., the FBI) that enabled him to continue his reckless double life after becoming president. The Kennedy family had the money and influence to achieve power. According to this book, the sons perpetuated the sins of the father. The people described in the book viewed reckless personal behavior an entitlement of their family name. It is a sharp contrast to the familiar public image of grace, refinement, and charm of the Kennedy White House that was typical of the early '60s.Differentiating between fact and rumor is the challenge of reading investigative journalism, especially a book that tells of the moral turpitude of a major public figure. The author's research is exhaustive and builds a compelling case. The lengthy footnotes and other digressions documenting the authenticity of the sources can annoy the reader by disrupting a smooth narrative. The Freedom of Information Act made vital records available in the '90s that were off limts in the '60s. These sources lend credibility to the book's assertions. The dismayed disillusionment of the Secret Service agents is easy to believe, for example, after they observed the fraternity house behavior of JFK and his cronies that occurred in the White House when the First Lady was out of town. The book's tone is objective in spite of the tabloid level topics.For comic relief there is the description of the Kennedy brothers' feud with Fidel Castro. JFK and Robert Kennedy viewed the Bay of Pigs fiasco as a personal affront to the Kennedy aura. They cast Castro in the role of the scruffy villain, not an unreasonable image for him. The CIA's fantastic retaliation plots are the stuff of some hack writer's spy thriller. The &quot;Spy vs Spy&quot; antics eventually came to nothing, but the bemused reader can only wonder how the U.S. government could consider such absurdities. Exploding fountain pens! Good grief!Reading this book is both fascinating and repulsive, a very unsettling experience that destroys the &quot;Camelot&quot; image of the Kennedy era. The central theme of John F.

LBJ had a personal hit man named Malcolm Wallace and he had murdered many folks by the time he got to John Kennedy.Secondly, Hersh demonstrates the Johnson was on the verge of political annihilation at the very moment of the JFK assassination with Don Reynolds (a close associate of Bobby Baker who in turn was a close associate of Lyndon Johnson) testifying incriminating evidence in front of the Senate Rules Committed literally at the same time JFK is being assassinated in Dallas.A lot of folks who are fans of the Kennedys have a hard time coming to grips with JFK's rampant promiscuity that is detailed in this book. I say to that folks, it is long past time for folks to learn the truth about the 1963 Coup d'Etat ... and the truth about Kennedy's womanizing should be known, too, even if it is uncomfortable for some.Incidentally, Seymour Hersh has not \\"figure out\\" that the JFK assassination was a coup, but his book goes a long way in explaining why there was one. There are also anecotes of CIA hatred of JFK in this book: see William King Harvey and Henry Kissinger (yes, he is very deep CIA).Read the Dark Side of Camelot by Seymour Hersh, p.124-129:Close JFK friend Hy Raskin: \\"Johnson was not being given the slightest bit of consideration by any of the Kennedys... On the stuff I saw it was always Symington who was going to be the vice president. The Kennedy family had approved Symington.\\" [Hersh, p. 124]John Kennedy to Clark Clifford on July 13, 1960: \\"We've talked it out - me, dad, Bobby - and we've selected Symington as the vice president.\\" Kennedy asked Clark Clifford to relay that message to Symington \\"and find out if he'd run.\\" ...\\"I and Stuart went to bed believing that we had a solid, unequivocal deal with Jack.\\" [Hersh, p.125]Hy Raskin: \\"It was obvious to them that something extraordinary had taken place, as it was to me,\\" Raskin wrote. \\"During my entire association with the Kennedys, I could not recall any situation where a decision of major significance had been reversed in such a short period of time.... Bob [Kennedy] had always been involved in every major decision; why not this one, I pondered... I slept little that night.\\" [Hersh, p. 125]John Kennedy to Clark Clifford in the morning of July 14, 1960: \\"I must do something that I have never done before. I made a serious deal and now I have to go back on it. I have no alternative.\\" Symington was out and Johnson was in. Clifford recalled observing that Kennedy looked as if he'd been up all night.\\" [Hersh, p. 126]John Kennedy to Hy Raskin: \\"You know we had never considered Lyndon, but I was left with no choice. He and Sam Rayburn made it damn clear to me that Lyndon had to be the candidate. Those bastards were trying to frame me. They threatened me with problems and I don't need more problems. I'm going to have enough problems with Nixon.\\" [Hersh, p. 126]Raskin \\"The substance of this revelation was so astonishing that if it had been revealed to me by another other than Jack or Bob, I would have had trouble accepting it. Why he decided to tell me was still very mysterious, but flattering nonetheless.\\" [Hersh, p. 126]"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I started off reading this book with an open mind and an objective outlook. However I found after reading only a few pages, that this is a one sided assassination of JFK's character. On page 3 the author states that JFK endorsed the CIA assassination of two world leaders. I then looked in the back of the back for the author's sources and found it to be a paragraph describing how various information was obtained. Are you serious? One makes a charge like that without a source. I want to see memos or recordings or eye witnesses, not just some hearsay. Bobby Kennedy is also portrayed as the guy who has to cover up the Kennedy shady dealings. I may be naive, but the research I have done on Bobby Kennedy shows him to be a moral person who tried to uproot the mob when no one, including J.Edgar Hoover, wanted to admit they even existed.JFK is portrayed as a womanizer who slept with numerous women. Jack may have had an affair or affairs, but women coming by nightly seems highly unlikely. He even quotes one Judith Exner who even admits to \\"fudging details\\" and \\"acknowledging incidents and dates are not correct\\". Now there is a lady you want as your star witness. As I continued to read, Jack is just portrayed as a womanizer, a drug abuser, a liar, a political cutthroat and an all out jerk. Really? Usually when events are told, the truth is usually found somewhere in the middle. This is nowhere in the middle. This seems to be an I hate Kennedy and I'm going to throw as much dirt on him as I can, and in every situation he will never look like the good guy. Sorry, but this is not how the real world is.The bottom line is that the author seems to want to tie Jack to the mob and his ordering of assassinations to his own death. Jack may not have been perfect and may indeed have been involved in shady dealings, but I believe the truth leans on the side of John and Bobby Kennedy trying to do the right thing, and bring the government back to the people. This is why they were killed and not because of their corrupt character. Throw this book in the trash and find the truth elsewhere!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"If the public knew what was going on behind the scenes of the 1960 presidential election,JFK would never have been elected. The illusion continued for the next three and a half years."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book keeps you on your seat because it has alot information, suspense and alot of drama. I recomment this book to all my friends to buy for they can like it to."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is another tale of our society's ability to become enraptured by someone with star quality and ignore the real picture despite overwhelming evidence. It is easy to see why America was enthralled with the Kennedys. After WWII and a general for President through the prosperous but boring 50's, Jack Kennedy and his beautiful classy wife burst upon the scene and heralded a new generation of leadership--a bit like Clinton did so many years later. But Kennedy's personal life was astoundingly out of kilter--his behavior makes the later antics of a Gary Hart or Bill Clinton look merely foolish. Kennedy ran security risks that are unimaginable, sleeping with a myriad of women unknown to the Secret Service, associating with organized crime figures, using drugs in ways dangerous to his health. On the political front, Hersh portrays Kennedy and his brother as obsessed with Cuba and Castro and constantly plotting to knock off the leaders of various other small nations. According to Hersh, corruption was rampant--cash was routinely paid out to buy votes or hush people up, and cash was routinely paid in for political favors in a way that would land someone in jail today for a very long time.As you can tell, this is not a balanced study of the Kennedy administration, but rather the work of an excellent investigative reporter to put names, dates and facts to the rumors and stories that began to circulate in the years after Kennedy's death. How these things remained secret for so long amazes me--how the standards of the press have changed!--how the pendulum has swung in the other direction to an extreme! The view presented here is very bleak--if one takes this book as the whole story, one would believe that Kennedy was the most despicable sort of politician, with little regard for the law, no moral sense, and no interest in policy, especially domestic policy. Certainly this book is a legitimate contribution to the history of the era, but only one piece of the puzzle."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"a lot has been written about the accuracy of hersh's assertions. i'll leave that for the historians to decide. what i found fascinating was what a fun and detailed read this was about the major events of the kennedy presidency. there are certainly better pure histories of the bay of pigs, the berlin wall, the 1960 election, the cuban missile crisis, etc. however, i am not sure that there is a more entertaining book encompassing all of these incidents.you have to remember that hersh has a strong point of view, and most of what he presents is geared at supporting that point of view. if you keep that in mind and take his conclusions with a grain of salt, the level of detail he provides makes for a very interesting historical read."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"As a life-long admirer of JFK, one who is still haunted by his death,Hersh's book was another journey into the painful,disturbing and exhilirating time that was the JFK White House. Hersh's book deserves recognition for the degree of research and excellent writing that makes this book an instant classic.What I do have a problem with are some of his conclusions... that because of his sexual obsessions, he was a president out of control, that he did NOT handle the Cuban Missile Crisis well, that the Vietnam involvement was politically motivated, and that Oswald was the lone assassin. I am especially disappointed with the last point, as he really sets up the reader to understand why those in power, the &quot;Cold Warriors,&quot; the &quot;dees,dem and dos guys,&quot; and the pathetic anti-Castro forces could use treason and murder to reach their aims: get rid of a president,get rid of Castro and &quot;win&quot; the cold war. Hersh stays away from this issue, which should have been the biggest target of his book. I must come to the realization that JFK and his family were typical of the hypocrisy of the powerful. Hersh has successfully moved me to that conclusion. Anyway, his book IS a tour-de-force that should NOT be compared to the Kitty Kelley or Randy Tamborelli trash."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Hersh does a commendable job with his research. He certainly doesn't lack for sources, and the evidence gathered DOES show that JFK and company acted questionably on any number of occasions. However, his treatment of Kennedy is a bit one-sided.I'm very much a \\"Warts and All\\" person when it comes to Presidential evaluations...and JFK obviously had more than his share of those. My problem with \\"Dark Side of Camelot\\" is that one may get the impression that Kennedy never did anything for reasons outside of personal gain, at ANY cost; that he and his administration were completely incompetent and unethical, and that whatever \\"successes\\" were achieved were done so through random \\"dumb luck\\".I've never subscribed to the \\"Camelot\\" view of the Kennedy Presidency. However, Hersh paints JFK, his family and administration as a mix of Stalin, Machiavelli and Caligula.Again, it was an excellent read...just a little too biased in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"First published in 1997, this book is a companion to Thomas C. Reeves' equally fine book, \\"A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy,\\" which was published in the same year. To have two truly outstanding books introduced at the same time, on the same subject, is interesting unto itself. My earlier review of the Reeves book for Amazon.com appears online as well.Like Reeves, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Hersh lays bare the myth of \\"Camelot\\" for all to see. The Kennedy family and its sycophants have attempted to perpetuate that myth since the day John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas--as well as myths surrounding the entire family, which is surely the most dysfunctional family ever to achieve significant political power in American history. Indeed, when one finishes reading both books, one wonders whether there was anything decent or moral about the family, certainly the male Kennedys.Unlike Reeves, Hersh does not mention Ted Kennedy's culpability in the tragic death of Mary Jo Kopechne in 1969, just as she was about to celebrate her 29th birthday, and the ensuing Kennedy cover-up. Similarly, Hersh makes scant mention of Marilyn Monroe, with whom both JFK and, after him, Bobby had affairs, nor does Hersh discuss the possibility that she was murdered. Instead, he discusses JFK's long-time relationship with Judith Campbell Exner, as well as his affair with an East German \\"prostitute\\" by the name of Ellen Rometsch. The thread that runs through Hersh's writing and through JFK's life is utter recklessness--which not only endangered his life, but the lives of those with whom he came into contact, and every living American.Perhaps the most vivid example is the \\"Cuban Missile Crisis\\" that Hersh documents in considerable detail, which might have been averted if JFK and Bobby had used their back-channel communications effectively with Nikita Khrushchev and the Kremlin. Instead, the two Kennedy brothers turned it into a grand display of American military might--to further JFK's political ambitions--which constituted recklessness that might have brought about a \\"nuclear winter.\\" Hersh states emphatically: \\"[Jack] Kennedy did not dare tell the full story of the Soviet missiles in Cuba, because it was his policies that brought the weapons there\\" (p. 343).Those Americans who believed in JFK, as yours truly did--and to a lesser extent, Bobby--were deceived with respect to almost every issue. The public perception bears almost no relationship to the actual facts. Indeed, thirty-four years after his death, the American people finally learned the truth about JFK (and his \\"hatchet man,\\" Bobby) from these two books and other sources. Even then, as Hersh describes in considerable detail, Kennedy operatives may have destroyed large amounts of documents; and massive amounts are still held by the Kennedy Library with respect to both JFK and Bobby, which have never been made available to the public. Not the least of these are medical records about JFK's health, which have only been reviewed by a handful of Kennedy \\"sycophant-like\\" writers.The failed \\"Bay of Pigs\\" invasion of Cuba, where Fidel Castro humiliated JFK and \\"the Kennedys,\\" led to more than 40 years of enslavement for the Cuban people and repeated attempts by the two Kennedy brothers to have Castro assassinated. This fiasco has potential relevance today--to the Obama Administration--because, as Hersh describes, there was a \\"prevailing sense that Kennedy could do no wrong\\" (p. 202). In fact, the Kennedy brothers ignored advice from the CIA and the military; and like Lyndon Johnson vis-&agrave;-vis later stages of the Vietnam War, they ran the \\"show\\" themselves and then tried to blame others when it failed colossally.Ample mention has been made of JFK's perpetual \\"thirst\\" for women. However, Hersh uses statements from Secret Service agents to describe the president's penchant for prostitutes, and how they and other women were \\"procured\\" by Dave Powers and some of Kennedy's other \\"New Frontiersmen.\\" Jackie Kennedy's travels were carefully monitored so that she would not return to find the president and women \\"frolicking\\" in the White House swimming pool or in the family quarters. What went on in hotels and private homes, wherever JFK traveled, is described as well. The book also discusses JFK's venereal disease(s) (p. 230); and the risks that he and Powers took by cavorting with women who had been waived through routine Secret Service checks without prior clearances, and who might have carried weapons, listening devices or something similar.There is no question that Kennedy launched this nation into Vietnam; and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara, was the architect of that lost war and the enormous suffering that it produced. Almost 60,000 brave Americans died, some of whom were friends of mine; and it impaled this nation's honor on the horns of a tragedy that still haunts policy makers and citizens alike. What was not known generally until Hersh's book is that JFK \\"had a chance in 1961 to disengage from an American involvement in South Vietnam\\" (p. 265). Instead, he chose to go to war, and to spend the blood of young Americans in a war that made no sense. Hersh states, again emphatically: \\"Whatever Jack Kennedy's intentions were, Vietnam was his war, even after his death\\" (p. 437).Hersh also describes the constant pressure especially on CIA operatives, which was brought by the two Kennedy brothers to have Castro and other foreign leaders killed. Mob operatives were used with Bobby's knowledge and involvement, even though as the U.S. Attorney General he was ostensibly prosecuting the Mob. The patriarch Joseph Kennedy's ties to the Mob are also detailed, as well as his ruthlessness and penchant for women. JFK's first marriage to Durie Malcolm is also described, as well as his father's efforts to expunge the record.Hersh also discusses how Bobby and Jackie believed that JFK was struck down by a \\"domestic conspiracy,\\" probably involving Chicago Mob boss Sam Giancana or others (p. 450). However, Hersh states: \\"Robert Kennedy did nothing to pursue the truth behind his brother's death [in 1963]. . . . The price of a full investigation was much too high: making public the truth about President Kennedy and the Kennedy family. It was this fear, certainly, that kept Robert Kennedy from testifying before the Warren Commission\\" (p. 456). Aside from prostitutes and other women, and close Mob ties and health issues, and a stolen election in 1960, Hersh details \\"cash payments\\" that JFK requested and received--which monies were ostensibly used to buy Ellen Rometsch's \\"silence.\\"A footnote in history, perhaps, but a very important one is that JFK hurt his back cavorting in a West Coast swimming pool. He was \\"forced to wear a stiff brace that stretched from his shoulders to his crotch.\\" And Hersh concludes: \\"The brace would keep the president upright for the bullets of Lee Harvey Oswald\\" (p. 439). Hence, JFK's sexual escapades may have contributed to his tragic death.Finally, John F. Kennedy is not someone to look up to, much less deify, as many of us thought when he was president. That conclusion has been reached reluctantly by lots of Americans, years ago, with a sense of sadness rather than anger. Greatness is often achieved in times of war, and Kennedy never won the war with Cuba, much less the Vietnam War that he started, nor did he win the Cold War--which Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush won. Kennedy was a tragic Shakespearean figure who may be forgotten and consigned to the dustheap of history, in no small part because of the question of character that both Reeves and Hersh described brilliantly in their terrific books."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading this book and I love books on JFK, but this is truthfull and an exciting read, I hadn't long finished this book when I began it again."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book is very well researched.Mr.Hersh used the Freedom of Information Act and a lot of sources.Some of the info that was new to me was the serious,juvenile health problems that Jack Kennedy had.I hadn't read about his personal physician or the trouble that his Dr. had in the future.Mr.Hersh detailed Joe Kennedy's business ventures and lack of ethics.Especially his boot-legging.Startling events at the Democratic convention explain the strange choice of Lyndon Johnson as VP.There are a lot of assassination \\"players\\" mentioned in this book.He covered the corruption in the 1960 Presidential election.The chapter on Judith Exner and the suitcases highlighted John Kennedy's connection to Sam Giancana.JFK,like his father was a risk-taker and his womanising was a case in point.After reading this book,one has to wonder if his re-election would have been a success.The scandals likely would have been his downfall.If you want to read about the political intrigue of the Kennedy presidency this is the book to read!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"If Hersh doesn't like Kennedy that's fine, but to do such a one sided hatchet job and make millions is pathetic. Kennedy did not initiate plots to kill Castro, this started under the Eisenhower Administration. In fact Kennedy Advisors and Intell. officials to a man said they did not think JFK knew of the these plots during the Church Comittee in the mid 70's.There are two fine books regarding the President and his policies in South East Asia- Dereliction Of Duty by McMasters - and JFK And Vietnam by Newman. Both Authors are Military Men with distinguished careers , who give it to you straight. When you read either of these, especially the latter you will see Kennedy always had a firm no combat troops policy in Vietnam.What is also disturbing is the reliance on Intell. Assets to trash Kennedy.Not that some of them can't be objective- but to just seek out enemies.............How much of the Womanizing is true I don't know-but you can bet there is substantial embellishment. Just because something is in FBI FILES doesn't make it true.I'm sure lower level agents made up stories to appease the tyrannical Hoover. Read Summers Official And Confidential for the real goods. What Hersh says on the Assassination is wrong and very insulting.Other than the quick buck- this book was written for two purposes: One- to blame JFK for everything and give him no credit for the big crisis. Two- to make no one care about his death, which was obviously a domestic conspiracy. Please read Noel Twyman's Bloody Treason or Jim Marr's Crossfire.As JFK once said &quot;things don't just happen they are made to happen&quot;Same for this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Kennedy fans, beware. All of the trite, happy fictions and mythologies about your beloved President are forever popped by Seymour's tome. He has done extensive homework in defeating the Kennedy propanganda machine's skilled agenda of disinformation and lies. (Just for the record, I am a leftist with no sympathy for anything Republican or conservative. That does not, however, allow me to ignore the unpleasant facts about Democrats.) JFK's immoral, illegal and reckless behavior is that of a spoiled, indulgent child with an inferiority and manhood complex and a domineering father. That aspect of his presidency is clear. Less obvious is how he got away with it for so long. That bespeaks of an as-yet-undescribed conspiracy of silence, dissembling and coverup that is as troubling as the mysteries of the assassination. Curiously, Hersch tersely states at the end of his book that he found no compelling evidence of any conspiracy in the 11-22-63 murder. However, his book is intended to dismiss myths about JFK's life, rather than death, and in this he admirably succeeds. Hersch's masterpiece does a wonderful job describing how the sex-obsessed Kennedy was constantly being threatened to have his numerous liaisons exposed, some, like that of Marilyn Monroe, that may or may not have ended in suicides. Even his alleged triumphs, such as the Missile Crisis, are shown to have been public relation manipulations as much as any competent Cold War victory. Sadly, the unbiaised reader must conclude that JFK was as immoral, venal and corrupt a President as we have ever had in the White House, and that probably includes the present idiot who has been bought and sold by every special interest in the world.Read about Kennedy's accepting bribes from defense contractors, how he was married before he met Jaqueline but never got a divorce, how he plotted to get rid of South Vietnam's Diem because Diem wanted to make peace with the North, how his operatives were planning Castro's death the very day he himself was murdered, how he slept with an East German whore and hundreds more less-suspect women, how he sought Mafia help in winning the crooked 1960 election, how he looked the other way at corruption within his own group of cronies, how he planned to bomb the Chinese nuke facilities, and how all the evidence points to a more massive US involvement in Vietnam had he prevailed in '64. In short, just about everything you know in the public forum about JFK is a lie."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"My only question to Mr. Hersh is why has it taken 34 years for this stuff to come out. If these things really happened as Mr. Hersh and his so-called witnesses say they did, then it surely would have come out much sooner. It's really easy to kick a man that can't answer for himself."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is the mainstay of all JFK revisionists books. We know that Kennedy was a man who had questionable morals. He did cheat on his wife, yes. However, this book makes absolutely no note on what JFK did successfully as president. Every possible negative judgement is made, most of which are products of a notion or rumor. 'JFK may have...which definetly lead to...' is usually the point of argument. All the while, he makes no statement on the fact that JFK had inherited all the assassination plots agaist Castro in the Eisenhower administration and that he was advised by Eisenhower and Dulles to go ahead with the Bay of Pigs. It tries to use the arguement that JFK's womanizing demeaned the presidency by 'making him the butt of jokes' (which NEVER HAPPENED TO ANY OF HIS SUCCESSORS). The truth is that his womanizing did not affect the presidency any worse that Nixon's resignation, Reagan's Iran-Contra, and the existance of the current president. His recklessness is used to explain his recklessness in foreign policy, but nobody can explain why he decided not to invade Cuba and punch out Castro. Plus, Kennedy rejected every proposal to send combat units in Vietnam, an he drew up plans for withdrawal of advisors which was approved in May of 93 and would send 1000 Americans home by December of 1963. Recklessness, eh? Plus, he also states that gangster Sam Giancana was paid by Joe Kennedy Sr. to get Chicago for him in the 1960 election. funny that at that time, Bob Kennedy was prosecuting him and wrote the book The Enemy Within which had some harsh words agaist Giancana. Anyways, regardless of what happend in Chicago, both Kennedy and Nixon were cheating and the 4-1 Republican electoral board in Illinois certified Kennedy all the electoral votes. If you want real Kennedy information, read PROMISES KEPT, the recent Cigar Aficianado article written by Arthur Schlesinger, or President Kennedy. The absolute worst piece of garbage in this book was the chapter on JFK's pre-Jackie marraige, which is &quot;confirmed&quot; as factual from a drunken priest that gives no names. Reckless writing to be sure."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Interesting book, Seymour. Quick get onto the British royal family, they would love you to write '' The Dark Side of a Wayward Princess'' If you got the girls slavering over the Kennedys exploits , just imagine how the boys would love..... the dark side of Lady Di, go get 'em Seymour!!!.All in all an interesting book , but like an early reviewer I could not get Kitty Keller out of my mind. Still we have to keep an open mind about all politicians."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I think Seymour Hersh, in the book &quot;The dark side of Camelot&quot;, has given more than just hints that the Kennedy presidency came about as the result of vote fraud. And it continued in cooperation with the Mafia to be involved in almost all sorts of illegal activity. But more than that, it once again gives an insight into the Kennedy family morales, or more precisely, lack of morales. How Jack Kennedy could ever become president strikes me as odd to say the least. Below I have collected some issues raised in the Hersh book. It should be rather easy for the Kennedy family to put out there own true story of what went on -- If not there was some truth in all of this. At least Nigel Hamiltons &quot;JFK, reckless youth&quot; hinted in the same disturbing direction. It is just so easy to scream &quot;tabloid trash&quot; without having read the book. Read the book !!!------------ 1. Jack Kennedys grandfather: Honey Fitz of Boston - was unseated by the house of Representatives for vote fraud in 1919. He offered no defense other than the OJ stand &quot;I've been framed&quot;. His opponent was sworn in instead. --- 2. Joseph Kennedy left nothing to chance in his drive to have his son elected to high office. In Jacks first campaign in 1946 hundred of thousands was poured into the campign for a congressional seat. The platform was extremely vague: &quot;The next generation offers a leader&quot; instead primary rivals were paid $7500 to stay out of the race, others were paid to join to split votes in key districts. --- 3. During prohibition Joe Kennedy had made a fortune in the bootlegging industri. Working hand in hand with organized crime, if not being a made member of the mafia. According to Frank Costello, the most powerful mafia boss of the 40s and 50s, he and Joe kennedy had been partners in the bootleg industri during prohibition. --- 4. Joe Kennedy was appointed ambassadourto Britain and had hoped to become american president himself. Unfortunately for him he didnt understood morale issues at all. So he had assumed that people would not fight Nazism, if it did cost them anything. He surely wouldnt. Besides, he had anti semitic feelings himself and could sympathize with much of the goings ons in Germany. --- 5. In the 1960 presidential election there were vote fraud in 11 states. Here Kennedy had bought the election with the help of the mafia. Afterwards official investigations either never got under way, or was stopped by grossly partisan democratic judges. The planning of the fraud was carried out after meetings between Joe Kennedy and Sam Giancana, head of the illinois mafia. Interestingly enough they felt most secure when meeting in couthouses belonging to judges owing favours. --- 6. For a period in the JFK presidency communication between the Kennedys and Sam Giancana (Chicago mafia) was done through a shared mistress, Judith Cambell Exner. --- 7. In the public Kennedy was portrayed as working hard and long hours for his country. In reality a good deal of his presidency was spend in various orgies. On an ordinary day Jack Kennedy would take lunch in the White House pool with &quot;secretaries&quot; Fiddle and Faddle. And have sex with prostitutes or starlettes in the evening. --- 8. Jack won the pulitzer prize for the book &quot;profiles in courage&quot;. It is certain that Joe helped it make the bestseller list by buying up large numbers himself. Probably the book wasnt even written by Kennedy, but by a ghostwriter. Even though Kennedy knew its content."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"It is a sad commentary that anyone can take a collection of unproven allegations and present it to the public like this without any evidence backing it, and some people still defend it by citing the book's own flawed and unsupported arguments.Two words; prove it.With all of the supposed orgies going on where are all the women who can now cash-in with their own stories? In a post-Clinton world what is to stop them, if it's true? 180 degrees from this piece of effluvia is The Kennedy Tapes, where they back up statements with transcripts from tapes made at the time. Yes, unlike the world that the tabloid historians live in, real historians have to (and do) back up their writing with research and documentation from credible sources.

The Kennedy Presidency reads more like Melrose Place (sans Allison), and Seymour Hersh does an excellent job of uncovering the truth behind Camelot. Hersh should be commended for his copious research, and she be applauded for his breezy story telling manner. Along with Roger Simon's new book, this is the best political book on the shelves.

The network of sources and investigative attention to detail that exposed the horrors of My Lai and made Mr.Hersh's reputation become nothing more than a platform for a commercially-motivated thrashing of a flawed man who happened to be president for less than 3 years, forty years ago, and whose greatest claim to fame is that he was assassinated in highly suspicious circumstances - thus entering a uniquely American form of popular-mythology.Mr.Hersh contributes nothing that is substantively new to our knowledge of JFK. His book produces a litany of \\"evidence\\" to support the well-known view that Kennedy was seriously-ill for much of his life and often resorted to heavy drug use, was a political animal who made much use of the often dubious network of contacts that his super-ambitious father had developed and was an insatiable womaniser behind the veneer of a \\"respectable marriage\\". The book makes no serious contribution to anything other than Mr.Hersh's bank account (and that of his publisher) because it seems that anything that is written about the icons of American popular culture, whether good or bad, is destined to be a commercial success - all the more so when it is written by a \\"respected investigative journalist\\"."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"It wouldn't matter who wrote this book. The mindless Kennedy lovers will never accept anything but their tired old cherished myths about their hero. If Republicans loathed Kennedy and his legacy, it was because he got away with in spades what they could only hope to do. Nixon was a sloppy schoolboy compared to the capers of JFK. Being ugly and uncharismatic, he could never get away with the things Jack Kennedy did. JFK's assassination protected his legacy forever, putting him in the martyred &quot;beyond reproach&quot; category of a sacred being. Hersh's sloppy journalist style doesn't wipe away the dark truths of Kennedy, his family (Joe Kennedy, the corrupt, money-grubbing, Hitler loving, gangster power-broker)and the people around them. Someday a real historian will write a professional work about the real &quot;Camelot.&quot; Until then, we can only wait. The post baby-boomers are not so enamoured of JFK because they have learned the truth about politicians the hard way. Kennedy never gave a real damn about civil rights, the underclass (a rich kid who read about the Great depression &quot;in books&quot; while at Harvard--even as it was going on) or social progress. He wouldn't have handled the mess in Vietnam any better than Johnson or Nixon. The champagne socialists and limousine liberals who so mindlessly worship JFK are enthralled by his memory just the way JFK's contemporaries were enthralled by his overwhelming charisma. Adolf Hitler also exerted a powerful thrall over many people who met him. Are looks, charisma, money and a will to power all that are required to be a leader? Apparently so. Jack Kennedey was a cold, calloused, ruthless risk taker who played with fire and lost. He used the mob to get what he wanted and then turned on them, so they paid him back by putting a &quot;hit&quot; on him. Its that simple. This is why the truths of his assasination will never be revealed in our lifetime, because the WHOLE truth would have to come out, and it wouldn't be pretty for old Jack's legacy, or make his sheep-like admirers look very good. Until this current generation of gutless, sychophantic, baby-boom Kennedy lovers dies off, the truth--a well written and documented history (if all the pertinent documents haven't been destoyed by then) will have to wait."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Finally, Americans are unshackled from the political myth and spin doctored history of the Kennedy clan and their admirers. Hersh is not the hero, the courageous individuals who were willing to tell the truth are, notwithstanding Hersh's meticulous investigative research. Few will gain financially from this book; Americans will gain enomously from a more accurate historical record."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I found this book to be the first, and to-date, the best documented account of Camelot. Mr Hersh should be applauded for his courage to take on the myth of an American martyr and bring it back into propper perspective. President Kenedy and his brothers Robert and Ted have always been heros of mine. I have always known however that these men could not possiblly have been the saints the media protrayed them to be. I personally see nothing wrong with confronting a hero's socalled warts as well as his achievements. In fact, Mr Hersh's approach, in my mind, lends credibility to the human aspects of Kennedy thereby making him a more believable human being then the media created icon that was Kennedy before this book.Thank you Mr Hersh!"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Mr. Hersh's book truly impressed me because for (1) contained reliable sources and (2) there have been other books on these same subjects in the past--only Hersh elaborates in a more adroit and concise manner.

One chapter in the Kennedy family history not addressed however, is how it dealt with the NASA proposal in Woburn,Mass in the 1960s, a precursor to events depicted in the book &quot;A Civil Action&quot; by Jonathan Harr.JFK was involved with the NASA deal in Woburn before his assassination. Also, one must balance the alleged scandals in this book with the good things the Kennedys have tried to do over the years.One of the most disturbing things about this family however, is that it appears that it is not truly a family except in name only. They seem to maintain a veneer of 'family' but in fact seem to be more of a managed political entity with individual members representing different factions. One might wonder how much control the Kennedy family has over itself and whether they are merely pawns by the real power behind them, those underneath them that ensure their position."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Let this be a warning to our un-informed; and/or worse,uneducated voting populance.

I found his multi-generation biographical overview of the Kennedy Clan and the possible etiologies of their personalities and behaviors enlightening and disenchanting at the same time. The numerous \\"wart's and all\\" account illustrates how important the family dynamics were to the inner workings of an influential President during a difficult, and fragile time in America. JFK's bravery and personal sacrifices, are tempered by his foibles and infidelities as well as those of the rest of his family. Their Machiavellian strategies lend a very human insight to the Kennedy's power and how the men in their administration were masters of spin. I was shocked by the various accounts of those present in the Oval Office, on the beaches, in the air, and on the ships during the Bay of Pigs Operations, and I believe it will be especially of interest to Alabamians, and those of us too young to clearly remember those times.This book is a testament and is re-readable over time. It uncovers numerous secrets as though they were pried out from under huge rocks, and suggests how out of the muck grow powerful things.This is a replacement for my first copy lost in the muck of Dog River during Hurricane Katrina.

If this book was written before November 22, 1963, I would classify this writing as an unbelievable attempt to surpass all flamboyancy of any tabloid headline; if it was written after the president's assassination, I would call the writing unnerving, at best. This history has all of the emotions of a trashy novel- love, marriage, children, careers, sex, violence, secrets, trust, betrayal, and grief- but the greatest grief here is to think this might have actually happened in our country. The media painted the John Kennedy's as the \\"American family\\" during the presidential campaign, into the presidency, and even after the assassination. If one is to believe any of the accusations disclosed in this history, we have to question if there is any such thing as national or international security. The accusations make me question if there is any ethical morals left, or were they ever present, in this country. If only the walls of the White House could talk- how many political figures have we placed our deepest trust, only to learn they did not deserve this trust. I do not think I will ever view a political campaign, a President, or the White House in the same light. Are we making a mockery of our faith in having the president take the oath of office and placing his hand on the Bible? What will this country come to? Will all of these \\"trusted\\" people eventually be guests on the day-time talk shows? Surely their stories top the stories being aired on these shows daily. It is truly a sad time in America."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I would give it an 8 1/2. Superior. Anything can be better, I suppose, and there are polished jewels produced by unusual intellects (example--The Anatomy of The Nuremburg Trial by Telford Taylor) which I browse through over time and draw literary and in my case legal inspiration. But in its genre this book of investigative reporting deserves high marks. I note the range of reactions to it, both in the Amazon reviews and in the general media--indicating it has touched nerves, both pro and anti Kennedy. I lived through the Kennedy years, which was one reason I bought the book. I feel I have some insight into the period merely by dint of living then and reading the newspapers then, watching the TV, sensing the popular reaction to events, and touching base with my own reactions to events.I saw Kennedy driving up Broadway in an open car (premonitions of Dallas in retrospect) in Oakland, California, in the early 60's. I noted that the exposure in the convertible car was offset by the fact he was traveling about 40 mph.I think his trip through Dallas, by the way, was also at about 40 mph, SOP (standard operating procedure, as they say in the military). But, speed notwithstanding, and to dwell for a moment on the digression, Oswald had an easy shot. Much has been said about his skill as a U.S. Marine trained marksman. I have never seen anyone comment on the fact, obvious to any marksman or hunter, that he was shooting at a target moving directly away from him and below him. Kennedy was almost a stationary target. Even more, Oswald didn't have to track his target except in the left-right axis. A bullet sent down the left-right slot would have a very high probability of hitting the target, which was vertical. The bullet would lift, meaning it would hit higher than the weapon was sighted in for (unless it was sighted in downhill, an unlikely although in review an intelligent preparation) because gravity would not act as much on the weight of the bullet since it was not traveling at a 90 degree angle to the surface.What this means is that Oswald only had to align the muzzle with the left-right axis, and he had a target about five feet high, (and 18 inches wide). He could hardly miss.Consider the obverse. Kennedy is traveling across Oswald's sight picture. Then Oswald has a much tougher shot. He has to move the muzzle tracking the target, and the target is only 18 inches wide, instead of 5 feet high.I think your readers will indulge this digression. I have never seen these simple observations, obvious to anyone familiar with marksmanship, mentioned in any of the many books written on the subject.Hersh has been attacked as credulous and worse. Amazon reviewers call his book &quot;trash.&quot; I think that is, at the least, overstatement, the sort of overstatement that leads one to question the objectivity of the reviewer. Indeed, there is a projective quality to this overstatement--after all, the thesis of Hersh's book is that Kennedy is trash. Charismatic, intelligent, but morally deficient. Along with his pit bull-loyal family members.Many leaders in this century have been charismatic and intelligent. That is a practical requirement. Examples can be readily found which I would rather not compare to John Kennedy.Hersh's larger point, I think, is that there must also be a personal moral component in the leader. Lacking that, his effectiveness degrades.To put it the other way round, gross immorality in the leader is a fatal defect.Hersh proves, I think, defense carping aside, that Kennedy was guilty of gross immorality. Sexual, of course. But more importantly ethical. By which I mean, immorality in his personal relations with other persons in a non-sexual context. This includes political behavior which goes beyond the normally conceded bare-knuckles political rules of conduct.Hersh lays out his research before the reader. As he has said repeatedly under attack recently, he stands behind his book and his research. The articles I have seen attacking Mr. Hersh's book seem less straightforward than Mr. Hersh himself. The authors of these articles would like to believe Mr. Hersh has some sort of hidden agenda against Jack Kennedy. But Hersh's critics instead reveal, it seems to me, an agenda of their own against an author who has the temerity to say the emperor wore no clothes."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is definitely one of the better books written about the Kennedy administration.It is NOT an assasination conspiracy book.

We've been hearing for years now of JFK's personal behavior and this book confirms it once again. In addition, and more importantly, it shows how that behavior may have endangered the country. Hersh states up front that the book is neither about Kennedy's great successes nor about the assassination mysteries. True.I didn't give the book all stars because I would have appreciated more legitimate source \\"proofs\\". Otherwise it's excellent.Sad that the so-called great successes of JFK are never written about. At this point I don't even know what they were. But the speech he made in Paris referencing his wife and the one made in Berlin are priceless. Check out youtube."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is one of the most shocking books I've ever read. Talk about having a dark side! Even the footnotes were shocking. For example: Seymour M. Hershs had a footnote about how 69-year-old Joe Kennedy Sr., President Robert F. Kennedy's father, \\"clearly and noisily\\" had sex with his 17-year-old caddie from the French Rivera while Joe's wife Rose, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson were having lunch at the Kennedy's beach front home in Palm Beach, Florida. This book portrays JFK like Charlie Sheen on steroids!Katie"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I found this book to be quite interesting regarding the facts of JFK's presidency...and his constant conspiring with RFK to get their way. I was quite familiar with most of what I read. I had heard about lots of this information on TV documentaries and other books about JFK. So, most of it didn't come as a surprise. It didn't come across to me as filth, but facts. And I'm quite sure most or all of it is true. Hersh was quite free in naming his sources. Worth a read and adding to your library if you are unfamiliar with the dark side of JFK. If you think JFK walks on water, don't read it. It will shatter your beliefs. I gave it three stars because of the familiarity of the material."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"that is for sure. The main problem I have with this book is the lack of &quot;proof&quot; a substantial number of all the presented stories. I have read a number of books of Mr. Hersh and I was an little bit disappointed on the amount of hearsay and annonymous sources that was used in this one."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Now let me see if I got this straight--John F. Kennedy was hated in greater or lesser degrees by the following: 1) a host of CIA &quot;advisors&quot; along with hundreds of Cuban exiles----for JFK's command failure to give the final go-ahead for the bomber strikes necessary to give crucial air support for a successful landing on the beach at the Bay of Pigs for CIA-backed Cuban exiles in their attempt to overthrow the Castro brothers; 2) the Castro brothers----for John and Robert Kennedy's relentless attempts to remove the Castros from power in part so the US Mafia could restore its casino gambling empire to the island; 3) the Mafia----for JFK's double-doublecross in not getting the Justice Department to back-off in pursuing the Mob after the Mob provided critical support (after Chicago Mobster Sam Giancana was approached by patriarch Joe Kennedy) to get JFK the votes he needed to win the 1960 presidential race, and for JFK's failure to get rid of Castro so the Mob could reestablish lucrative casinos which had been shut down on Cuba when Fidel Castro overthrew the Mafia-backed Battista regime; 4) Members of the Joint Chiefs of the US military----for JFK's utter failures as a commander-in-chief by his placing the US (and the world) in harm's way through the unnecessary use of nuclear brinkmanship against the Soviets during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and for then caving-in to the Soviets by giving-up stategic nuclear missiles stationed in Turkey; 5) Lyndon B. Johnson----out of personal jealousy for JFK's popularity, and for Kennedy's freezing-out LBJ from any position of power in the Kennedy White House; and 6) J. Edgar Hoover----also out of personal jealousy of JFK, and in response to JFK's personal distaste and disdain for Hoover. It would appear to this reader that Mr. Hersh's marvelous investigative coup leaves unspoken the remaining weighty mass of the JFK tragedy--that being the answer to the question of Who (or Whom) would have wanted this President dead, and Who (or Whom) would have had the means to accomplish this end. Judging from the stew of highly dangerous groups and powerful individuals above, there is certainly no dearth of willing agents with the necessary means for such executive action (and it is now getting harder and harder to swallow the Warren Commission's lone gunman/magic bullet theory). It is a tragedy of history for which we are all still paying in one way or another, and one which has thus far regrettably taken an unbelievable 34 years to ferret out (so much for the investigative fortitute of the major US news organizations). Were Kennedy and his crew &quot;The best and the brightest&quot;?. I don't think so anymore."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Were you alive in 1962? If you were be very greatful that you are alive now. John F. Kennedy was incredibly ill-suited to take over the Presidency when he did. He was terribly ill physically. He was a compulsive adulterer who could barely devote the time needed for his job. He was thoroughly ruthless, dishonest, vengeful and self-centered. And above all he was reckless. He thrived on personal and political recklessness. In 1962 I was a child. Whenvever I feel badly, I think of how easily it could all have have ended in October 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis. Count your blessings folks."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This eye-opening book reports on the unseemly aspects of the events leading up to and taking place during the presidency of John F. Kennedy. It is essential reading for anyone with any glamorous or romanticized notions of JFK, his administration, and his presidency.In an author's note, Hersh says explicitly that the book does not report on JFK's brilliant moments, nor does it dwell on his assassination. Instead, it covers the many unethical practices of Kennedy and his staff. These include:* the theft of the 1960 presidential election, both in the West Virginia democratic primary, and in the Illinois electoral college;* the strange last-minute selection of Lyndon Johnson as Kennedy's running mate, most probably due to blackmail by Johnson;* Kennedy's philandering, whose shocking extent is documented by secret service personnel responsible for protecting him;* Kennedy's continuation of Eisenhower's secret plans to assassinate Fidel Castro, both before and after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion;* Kennedy's secret ties to Sam Giancana, a Chicago mob boss, who Kennedy dealt with both during the 1960 election, and in his attempts to assassinate Castro;* Kennedy's secret first marriage to Florida socialite Durie Malcolm, which was quickly annulled, and all records of which were destroyed;* Kennedy's continuous use of amphetamines, and other aspects of his physical health, such as the fact that he had sexually transmitted diseases for the last 30+ years of his life, due to continuous reinfection;* Kennedy's use of a secret back-channel in his negotiations with Nikita Krushchev over the Cuban missile crisis, including the secret withdrawal of U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey in exchange for the removal of Soviet missiles from Cuba;* Kennedy's affair with Judith Campbell Exner, also Sam Giancana's lover, who on at least one occassion carried large sums of money between the president and mob boss, and who also arranged for a secret meeting between the two men in her apartment;* Kennedy's affair with East German Ellen Rometsch, a potential national security threat; and* Kennedy's role in the overthrow of several foreign leaders, including the ouster and assassination of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem.Perhaps the most spectacular aspect of this book is not the quantity or importance of its revelations, but its thoroughness. Hersh spent 5 years writing it, and conducted hundreds of interviews. Many of the new revelations come from these first-hand interviews or from previously unreleased private manuscripts. Even some of the many interesting footnotes seemed to me like they must have taken days or weeks to research."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"yes john kennedy was not perfect ( look at all the womanizing) or as healthy as we were led to believe but he wasn't as &quot;bad&quot; as the book makes out. the only gripe i have with this book is that since it did what it's title implied, show the dark side of camelot, it's not a very balanced account. hersh puts the absolute worst possible spin on everything that happened in the administration. I'd recomend the book an unfinished life for a more even handed account"},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I was born after the Kennedy Administration so I do not have the nostalgic feelings for him that many people do. I picked this book up to get a little less fawning impression of him then some other books tend to portray and for some good old fashion dirt. I have also read some other books by this author so I new him to be a straight shooter. Well, I was not disappointed. This book covered JFK's father, grandfather, campaign and full presidency and my impression is that the author left no rock or bed sheet left unturned. Before I go further I should add that I have read any number of political books that are basically hatchet jobs and I was a little concerned this book would fall into that category. I was pleasantly surprised that the author was able to present all the unflattering bits in a very evenhanded manner. The author could have tossed in little nasty comments here and there, but did not. He stuck to a very \\"just the facts\\" type of reporting.The book covered some very interesting parts about the campaign and the unique financing that took place. The author did not pull punches, he detailed out vote buying to a rather large degree. The one area that was left unsaid was just how prevalent was this behavior. This is not an excuse, but if the Kennedy team was just doing what every politician had and was doing up to that point, the activity is not as exciting and revolting as the author stated. For me the other two most interesting parts were the detail on Cuba and Berlin. I was not upset or surprised at what the administration was doing to try and get rid of Castro. I think we all know about the Bay of Pigs and the attempt to have Castro killed. This book just filled in a lot of nice details. Again the author tried to make these activities far more scandalous then they were given the times that they took place in. Sure, if these activities were taking place today it would be a \\"blank gate\\" of some sort, but back then this was just how the game was played.The most overriding theme of the book was the extramarital affairs JFK was involved in during his term. At first this was rather interesting in a playboy sort of way. How he carried on like this was a bit of every high school boys adolescent dream come true. It was just that it got to be too much of a good thing. In almost every chapter of the book we get details about this woman or that woman. At about the mid point of the book I was thinking, \\"Ok, I got it - he was a playboy -lets move on\\". It just got to be a distraction within the book. My only other complaint would be that the author tried to make hay about the political trip to Dallas that resulted in JFK's assassination. He tried to imply that the choices JFK made resulted in his death. I thought this was a bit of a reach. Overall the book was interesting if not a bit over the top on the woman issue. If you are a big fan of JFK you will want to stay away, but if you are looking for more interesting and in depth look at the man then this would be a nice addition to your JFK reading."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This book was fascinating.

The writer sounds almost petulant."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"I used to think Seymour Hersh was a dedicated journalist but this book, although right on many parts about JFK and his father, seems as if it was written by an ex-lover of one of the Kenndey's who got screwed over. Granted Jack did put himself in danger by sleeping with a lot of women (which all of Washington knew) but he misses his character completely which somebody would with there simple-minded christian outlook on life. I would say 3/4ths of this book is right but this rest is fabrications and falsehoods propagated by Kennedy bashers (who exist to this day) but on many points he is dead wrong such as Vietnam, the Bay of Pigs, the mafia-CIA murder plots, and so on. If you want a one-sided book showing the dark side of Camelot than this is for you."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"This is a very readable, interesting book, that delves into the totality of JFK and his family. It's not a hatchet job, it's not unfair, and Hersh abstains from grandiloquent grandstanding. I think, personally, that Hersh is actually sympathetic towards JFK, whose life was a vicarious tool for his father, Joe Kennedy. Old Joe, if anyone, comes off the worst: a shrewd, ruthless, completely amoral snake of a man, who let absolutely nothing come between his dynastic designs and their ultimate fruition. Bobby Kennedy is depicted as a humorless square (who was, not surprisingly, handed the job of Attorney General--without ever having tried a case beforehand!), and Teddy--well, the less said about Teddy, the better. This book will reveal the reality as opposed to the utter myth of Camelot, and shed some light on America's most famous family of plutocrats."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"The previous reviewer states that &quot;if republicans disliked JFK...&quot; Well , I am a conservative Republican and I greatly admire the late president.

Pulling back from the brink of nuclear catastrophe in Cuba, and making Russia look weak, which in turn , started their arms build up which eventually bankrupted them and helped bring communism to its bitter and glorious end! The moon shot, which is still the greatest technological triumph in human history! THAT is what JFK set into motion, and as a Republican I am in awe of it! Presidents Reagan and Bush and now George W., seem to quote him constantly!! He was a role model for leadership and they know it.

Like other Americans who were young and impressionable, I loved the Kennedys and bought into the Camelot myth.Now, we find that even Camelot had its warts and secret hiding places. I'm sorry to learn about the President's dallying and maneuverings, but I am not surprised. It was all too good to be true.This is the first comprehensive book I've read on the cracks in Camelot's facade. It seems to me that Mr. Hersh has done his homework. I read the entire book. I didn't like the facts that were presented, but I believe Hersh did a thorough job researching his subject matter.Now, our current President faces charges that would have most probably been levelled at JFK had he lived. Maybe Hersh is already at work on &quot;InternGate.&quot;I guess it's true that power is the ultimate aphrodisiac."},{"Title":"The Dark Side of Camelot","review":"Normally I would not review an 11-year-old book, but as it presents a distorted view of JFK to say the least, and is still in print in 2008, here goes.Mr. Hersh has obliged his corporate and government sponsors with a double-barreled hit. First, he produced a best-seller, and second, he produced a JFK biography sure to please both the corporates and their government cronies.Mr. Hersh reveals JFK's sexual escapades in great length and detail. I estimate that at least 25% of the book is spent on this topic. This is fair enough, since JFK apparently spent the same percentage of his time pursuing sexual adventures. Mr. Hersh also presents much evidence backing claims of JFK's health problems, including frequent doses of various medications that kept him going. The early chapters tell some interesting stories about JFK's father, Joseph, and other family members including JFK's maternal grandfather, John F. \\"Honey Fitz\\" Fitzgerald.Mr. Hersh presents some interesting insights into crucial moments in JFK's presidency. The Bay of Pigs, the Berlin crisis, the Cuba missile crisis, plots to assassinate Fidel Castro, and the escalation of US involvement in Vietnam are dealt with in detail. Mr. Hersh contradicts accounts of these events written by close Kennedy associates, Ted Sorensen in particular. Mr. Hersh reveals a secretive, inexperienced, power-hungry and vindictive President who trusted only one man other than himself, his brother Robert. There does seem to be some truth to Hersh's contradictory accounts, but there also seems to be an underlying motivation behind this book, and this is the promotion of an official version of JFK and his presidency that focuses on JFK's personal weaknesses, presents CIA in a favorable light, and either lies about important events, or omits them entirely.Did you know, for example, that the Bay of Pigs fiasco was entirely JFK's fault? Did you know that JFK and RFK micro-managed plots involving the Mafia to kill Castro, and that the Vietnam War is JFK's legacy, not something he would have ended? With that knowledge, surely you should also learn about JFK's firing of Allan Dulles (later appointed to the Warren Commission), General Cabell and Richard Bissell? Sorry, that's not in the official story. Furthermore, since JFK was obviously so much at odds with CIA, surely you should read about JFK's threats to disband CIA? Sorry again.I quote from the \\"Author's Note\\" at the beginning of the book:\\"It [this book] tells of otherwise strong and self-reliant men and womenwho were awed and seduced by Kennedy's magnetism, and who competed withone another to please the most charismatic leader in our nation's history.Many are still blinded today.In writing this book, my hope is that I have been able to help the nationreclaim some of its history.\\"Some very select and well chosen bits of its history, perhaps, but nothing that really matters, like who was responsible for JFK's assassination. Mr. Hersh is not one to talk about being \\"blinded\\", as he still professes to believe the official Lee Harvey Oswald \\"lone nut assassin\\" myth. Among the few remaining adherents to the myth are mainstream corporate media types like Mr. Hersh, anyone in government, and current and former intelligence agency employees who don't want to lose their security clearances or be sentenced to \\"dine alone\\". John Loftus and Tennent H. \\"Pete\\" Bagley are two examples of the latter.Despite this best-selling book and others written with the same intent, most of the public continue to admire JFK despite knowing that he was a highly flawed human being. Most people also disbelieve the official lone-nut assassin myths about JFK and RFK. To remove the spell of Mr. Hersh's quote above, I'll close with a quote from St. John Hunt (source: a Rolling Stone article you can easily find), author of \\"The Last Confessions of E. Howard Hunt\\":\\"Actually, there were probably dozens of plots to kill Kennedy, because everybody hated Kennedy but the public.\\"Edit June 22, 2008: There is a new book that anyone with an interest in JFK should read:JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It Matters. In particular, it puts paid to Hersh's contention that Vietnam must be considered as part of the Kennedy legacy."},{"Title":"Ozzy Unauthorized","review":"Ozzy Unauthorized by biographer Sue Crawford is an informed and informative charting heavy metal icon and unforgettable personality Ozzy Osbourne.

That was all it was, a time passer. Being an animal lover I was disturbed about his antics of biting doves and bats heads off, but catching a few episodes of MTVs \\"The Osbornes\\" I liked the way he was and what he put up with with his own cats and dogs. I.E. cleaning up after them, walking them and showing genuine affection. But throwing animal insides back and forth at concerts, shooting every last one of his chickens, stabbing his aunt's cat... didn't settle well with me. Of course his drug and drink stupors are obvious and well known. But this was UNAUTHORIZED, and most of the authors words are either hearsay or from interviews she has seen of Ozzy. Maybe I will try the 'Ozzy in his own words' bio and take his own word for it. There wasnt anything else new to learn, same stuff that has been around for decades. The one great thing about this book is it has a listing of all of his recordings, films and even all of his tatoos. Why there is a big astronomy chapter of sagittaris and how it relates to Ozzy is beyond me, I couldnt even finish that chapter, it was so ridiculous.

At least one economist has argued that there is no need to worry about global warning because the only sector of the economy affected by it -- agriculture -- contributes only 3% of the United States' GNP. Davidson observes: \\"Like Marie Antoinette's suggestion that the French peasants without bread could eat cake [more accurately, crumbs from a bread pan], this view of how the world works seems to suggest that if the crops fail, the people could eat the 97% of the GNP which remains.\\" This is Fallacy #1: \\"Marie Antoinette Economics.\\"The second fallacy naively asserts that the technological \\"cavalry\\" will come over the hill in time to save us from economic disaster; the third fallacy incorrectly assumes that, because of certain modest improvements of the quality of air and water, environmental pollution is no longer a serious problem. Davidson's purpose is to examine the implications and consequences of these fallacies. He believes (and I wholeheartedly agree) that economic realities and environmental imperatives are NOT mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are interdependent.One bestselling tee-shirt proclaims \\"We're Having a Great Time Spending Our Children's Inheritance!\\" In a sense, that is what Davidson has in mind when lamenting the relentless depletion of the earth's natural resources to achieve short-term financial objectives. To illustrate his key points, he introduces two pyramids in Chapter 2. One shows how dependent we are on a stable resource as our base; the second (inverted) pyramid shows how the principle of supply and demand results in a relentless reduction of that base. According to Davidson, the priorities of ecology and economics can be accommodated if certain prudent national and international measures are initiated and then sustained. These he proposes in Chapter 9:1. Stop building new roads.2. Eliminate tax reductions for more than two children in countries that have income taxes.3. Reduce taxes on income and increase taxes on consumption.4. Eliminate governmental subsidies, such as water projects that hinder the market forces that would otherwise promote water conservation, more prudent use of groundwater, and prevent soil salinization.5. Support governmental and nongovernmental extension efforts to encourage farmers in both industrialized and developing countries to make more efficient use of their land while conserving soil and using only essential quantities of fertilizers and pesticides.6. Eliminate governmental subsidies for industrial fisheries and foster agreements among nations and among and within communities to protect the fisheries commons. 7. Ratify and enforce the binding international agreement reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 reducing greenhouse gas emissions.8. Negotiate international agreements on maintaining forest cover and managing forests to maximize genetic diversity of plants and animals.What if we don't take these and other initiatives? Davidson has written this book in direct response to that question. In ways and to an extent many of us do not realize, there has been an on-going process of discounting, devaluing, and degrading the earth's environment. Davidson is somewhat encouraged by certain developments (albeit isolated and inadequate) which suggest that there is at least some increased awareness of the various problems. He is fully aware of the great difficulty of changing the minds of policymakers, business leaders, voters, and consumers by helping them to understand -- and properly value -- the \\"essential links\\" between ecology and economics. Davidson makes a substantial contribution to the achievement of that objective.If you share my high regard for this book, I suggest that you check out Natural Capitalism, The Lexus and the Olive Tree, and Holding On to Reality.."},{"Title":"You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered","review":"If the fundamental concept in economics is scarcity, why has it proven so impotent, if not downright counterproductive, when it comes to addressing environmental issues? This question is of central importance to those, like Eric Davidson, would like to see \\"ecological economics\\" enter public discourse and the policy-making arena.This is an informative book written in a very engaging, if polemical style. As the subtitle (Economics as if Ecology Mattered) suggests, the general approach is to contrast the ways ecologists and economists look at the natural environment and to show how traditional economic theory encourages resource depletion and pollution. That may sound like a mouthful, but Davidson's approach is to introduce, illustrate, and even popularize economic concepts (pricing, cost-benefit analysis, marginal analysis, discount rates, and externalities) from the critical perspective of an ecologist. Along the way, he invents some \\"fallacies\\" (which, arguably, he also succumbs to), provides graphic visualization aids to contrast the different ways ecologists' and economists' view natural resources, and he explores some interesting case studies and possibilities based on his own work in the Brazilian rainforest. As an introduction to both environmental studies and basic concepts in (micro)economics, the book succeeds on two levels. (As an introduction to macroeconomics and sustainability, it probably succeeds on only one - environmental studies.)Unfortunately, the strengths of the book, namely, its simplicity, also point to its weaknesses. For anyone who, like Davidson, has been struggling along this same path (me, for instance), it seems clear that Davidson's book cannot hope to convince professional economists or policy-makers who, to give them credit, possess far more theoretical virtuosity than Davidson's arguments might suggest. To make matters worse, popular works of (micro)economics are often written by economists who are staunch libertarians, and their counterarguments would be...well, it wouldn't be pretty. They inhabit a theoretical universe which does not recognize a \\"precautionary principle\\" higher than free choice, and they abhor the kinds of government intervention and regulation that Davidson's brand of environmental economics suggests. Indeed, most of the time Davidson is arguing for a normative (what should be), rather than a positive (what is) brand of ecological economics that is never made explicit (enough). Ultimately these kinds of theoretical differences boil down to questions about human nature, and the darker, greedier view of humans, who blindly follow their self-interest and \`trash the commons', has a proven, if hardly illustrious, record in both theory and practice. Davidson's critique notwithstanding, one can't help but fear for the fate of homo ecologicus who pursues long-term sustainability, but is forced to compete with homo economicus who sees only short-term gains.In his conclusion, Davidson makes some suggestions about what kinds of constructive steps individuals can make on their own. Foremost among them is to \`lend this book to someone who is unlikely to buy literature on science, economics, and the environment.' Frankly, since he is preaching to the converted when it comes to me, I will follow his suggestion and lend the book out. But I also intend to follow his recommendation regarding audience - which underscores my only caveat."},{"Title":"You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered","review":"Both ecology and economics share the same Greek root, oikos, meaning, literally, \\"house.\\" Linked with nomics it means management of the house. Linked with logy it means study or knowledge of the house. Obviously, study and knowledge should go hand in hand with management, and good ecology should be a basic ingredient in good economics. Unfortunately, in the recent past, ideas about management of our world as encoded in conventional economic theory, in biologist E. O. Wilson's words, \\"can be summarized in two labels: Newtonian and hermetic. Newtonian, because economic theorists aspire to find simple, general laws that cover all possible economic arrangements. ... hermetic - that is sealed off from the complexities of human behavior and the constraints imposed by the environment.\\" Eric Davidson's book is a readable summary of many of the main ideas of ecological economics. He begins by describing three basic fallacies of the mainstream economic model. The first he calls the \\"Marie Antoinette\\" fallacy. The mainstream model assumes near perfect substitutability between land (natural resources), labor, and capital. If we deplete all our natural resources, \\"no problem\\" claims the mainstream model, we simply substitute more labor or capital - or as Marie Antoinette reportedly said when the French peasants were complaining about not having any bread - \\"well, let them eat cake!\\" The truth is that manufactured capital, human capital, social capital, and natural capital function more like compliments than substitutes and a sustainable economic system requires a safe minimum of each of these four types of capital. The second fallacy Davidson calls \\"Custer's folly\\" - the assumption that the technological cavalry will come over the hill to save us from ecological disaster just in time. The problem is that while technology might come up with solutions, it is foolhardy to assume that it will, especially when the stakes are so high. It is much more rational to assume that technology will not come to the rescue at the last minute and take a more precautionary approach that assures our sustainability regardless of hoped for technological changes. The third fallacy is \\"False complacency from partial success.\\" If we can solve some environmental problems, we can, by extension solve all environmental problems. Davidson likens this line of argument to a claim by a spouse abuser that he is a good person because he no longer beats his spouse as much as he used to. The truth is that many environmental problems that have appeared to be \\"solved\\" have actually just been moved to other regions or countries or social groups, often as a consequence of more open trade. Also, in the crowed world in which we now live, many new technologies have unintended consequences that may completely undermine and outweigh their initial, positive effects (i.e. DDT, chloroflorocarbons)."},{"Title":"You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered","review":"This book is great for the beginner in environmental economics. For someone who is concerned about the environment but insecure about defending arguments against those with some economic background, here is you ammunition. It is easy to read and full of examples of how natural resources are not taken into account properly in current economic theory, and therefore not conserved as they should be. It is a basic idea but this book maps it out wonderfully.

Finally, I have. And the world has moved on. Nevertheless, the book was an important one, and one that proved to be a bit of a paradigm shifter for me.Davidson makes an eloquent case for what he calls ecological economics. His attempts to describe this new field seem to lack something ... and I'm not firmly enough grounded in economics (or axiology) to figure it out. I do know that when your economic models assume that resources are infinitely renewable (and Davidson points this out, too), your economic plan will bring nothing but destruction and disaster.This is not an Earth First! monkeywrenching tree-hugger manual. It is an attempt to take both economics and ecology seriously. And Davidson deserves major props for his efforts.For me the paradigm shift came when I realized that we need to balance ecological concerns with business and agricultural concerns. I believe that doing this balancing without taking the next seven or so generations into account leads to a economics of destruction, and the Easter Island Scenario would happen planet-wide.But there are just too many homo sapiens sapiens wandering around the planet to revert to some neo-eco-hippie hunter/gatherer lifestyle. We need everything that technology can teach us to develop a sustainable lifestyle for 6, 8, or even 10 billion persons. And our economics needs to take this into account.I also came up with a new metric for discarding broken economic approaches: If the economic philosophy values the Mona Lisa only in terms of what the market would pay, and thus allows it to be destroyed if a larger amount of cash (GNP) would be generated that way, then it is truly a broken model. Once the Mona Lisa is gone, she is gone. Period. End of art.Our souls would be poorer, but we could survive without her. After all, what percentage of the earth's inhabitants will ever get to see her with the own eyes?But the this applies with much more intensity to biomes, to ecosystems, and to the marvelous balance of spaceship earth. Learning to exchange your labor for the products of mine, to exchange goods and services in a way that respects the diverse and robust environment which sustains us is the key focus of this book.Well worth reading and pondering."},{"Title":"You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered","review":"I wanted to write an enthusiastic review of this book because of its provocative title which suggests economic solutions for ecology. Unfortunately, the book emphasizes ecological problems more than economic solutions. It also doesn't look enough into the economics of sustainable development, but author Eric Davidson does offer sound ideas on environmental regulation.The author starts his thesis with the idea that soil is the building block for our survival as human beings. I agree that soil is critical and appreciate the details of soil erosion. However, I was looking for thought on the larger picture: sustainable development and the corresponding economic/ecologic conflict. Likewise, I tired of reading about the green house effect, forest depletion, and the exhaustion of water resources without thought devoted to how we might address general reduction of natural resources, i.e., apply potential eco-economic solutions.Mr. Davidson clearly demonstrates that sustainable development must reconcile ecology and economy. One of the strong points of the book is a pyramid graphic that contains economy within ecology. He mentions a similar concept: the \\"Precautionary Principle\\" as a way to plan for the future. Yet, aside from mentioning cost benefit analysis and discounting, Mr. Davidson only scratches the surface on how to approach sustainable development from an economic perspective. Eco-economics is mentioned but not elaborated on as the author doesn't claim this as an area of expertise.Some strong regulatory ideas are presented such as limiting road construction and other governmental intervention. He suggests pollution permits, which have become a reality (see The Wall Street Journal 11/8/04). These and other regulatory ideas aren't listed until the end of the book. I would have liked to see the book begin with these ideas and made more central to the argument.For a book focusing on eco-economics, I recommend \\"Beyond Growth\\" by Herman Daly."},{"Title":"You Can't Eat GNP: Economics As If Ecology Mattered","review":"The premise of Davidson's book is that if you look at the gross national product abstractly, it's easy to lose sight of the impact that a non-environmental approach to business takes.

I loved this book and its sequels and kids still love them. Plenty of books have been published since 1965 and have since gone out of print, yet this story of Ralph S. Mouse remains as popular with readers as ever.Something about this book made it stand out from the pack. Part of that something has to be Beverly Cleary, who also gave us Henry Huggins and Ramona Quimby (another post, Esteemed Reader) who, like Ralph S. Mouse, are gods in the pantheon of middle grade fiction. But that's not all, because Cleary also wrote Ellen Tebbits, Muggie Maggie, and Sister of the Bride, which have failed to keep the same staying power.I don't know how Clearly pulled off the magic imbued in The Mouse and the Motorcycle. If I did, I would reproduce it, and then the Book of the Week section of this blog would be filled with my books. But I can speculate and paw at her methods the way the confused monkey men pawed at the monolith at the beginning of 2001.So that we may discuss the techniques employed by Cleary, let's dispense with my review: this book is awesome! It's one of the best books ever written, middle grade or otherwise, and if you haven't read it, stop reading this review and go get a copy. If you want to write successful middle grade--and as you're here, I'll assume the thought has at least crossed your mind--you owe it to your craft to read this book (and a fair amount of others, many recommended in the list to the left of this post:)I love this book and either you do too, or you will once you read it. It's impossible for me to imagine anyone disliking this novel , unless certain religious zealots somehow find the idea of a vulgar mouse riding a secular motorcycle an abomination in the eyes of God. So let's role up our sleeves and pop this book's hood to see what's driving the engine.A good place to start is with the book's first sentence:Keith, the boy in the rumpled shorts and shirt, did not know he was being watched as he entered Room 215 of the Mountain View Inn.Now there's a good old fashioned hook if I ever read one! Plenty of horror novels have begun with similar sentiments and the sentence, taken by itself, is a bit off putting. What sort of story is this anyway? Who is watching Keith and why and should we be concerned? Note, Cleary doesn't actually confirm who is watching Keith until chapter 2 (even though there's a spoil-sport illustration of a mouse peering out of his hole) and by then then the reader's interest has been thoroughly peeked. And that, of course, is the point. By the time the reader has satisfaction to the question of who is watching Keith, Clearly has raised other story questions and made a few promises to the reader and the pages will continue to turn.The next thing to notice is Cleary's ability to get completely inside the heads of her characters and to take us with her. Her characters do not seem to exist to serve the plot. Rather, the plot arises from the motivations and actions of her characters. More on this in a moment, but first I want to share a passage with you. Many writers have presented us with a believable child's perspective (I continue to seek them out for interviews), but how many writers outside of Hilary Wagner can give us a believable mouse's perspective:At first he was disappointed at the size of the boy who was to occupy the room. A little child, preferably two or even three little children, would have been better. Little messy children were always considerate about leaving crumbs on the carpet. Oh well, at least these people did not have a dog. If there were was one thing Ralph disliked, it was a snoopy dog.Next Ralph felt hopeful. Medium-sized boys could almost always be counted on to leave a sticky candy bar wrapper on the floor or a bag of peanuts on the bedside table, where Ralph could reach them by climbing up the telephone cord. With a boy this size, the food, though not apt to be plentiful, was almost sure to be of good quality.The third emotion felt by Ralph was joy when the boy laid the apple core by the telephone. This was followed by despair when the mother dropped the core into the metal wastebasket. Ralph knew that anything at the bottom of a metal wastebasket was lost to a mouse forever.Sure, there's a bit of telling: Ralph felt hopeful (blasphemy, my critique partners would cry), but who cares? Clearly does plenty of showing elsewhere and the important thing is how much consideration she has given to Ralph. I imagine a young Beverly Clearly standing up quickly when someone came into a room, an embarrassed look and crumbles of cheese on her face, yet still trying to assure the interloper that she was most certainly not crouched on all fours attempting to see the world from the perspective of a mouse.Ralph S. Mouse lives at the Mountain View Inn, and what he wants is to eat the boy's crumbs (perfectly believable motivation for a mouse) until he sees Keith playing with a toy motorcycle. Ralph wants to ride that motorcycle and was there ever a child anywhere who didn't hope that cute, talking mouse would come to them and want to play with their toys? Keith is lonely and so is Ralph. They each need a friend and they both love motorcycles. The fact that they are of different species does not present a problem, as explained in my favorite passage from the book:Neither the mouse nor the boy was the least bit surprised that each could understand the other. Two creatures who shared a love for motorcycles naturally spoke the same language.In my own writing, I almost always start with plot and then find characters who are up to the job of servicing it. I like to imagine Beverly Cleary began with a mental image of a mouse on a motorcycle and worked her way up from there:How would a mouse get a motorcycle? Perhaps a boy loaned it to him. Perhaps they're friends. But that's not a story, that's a situation. Hmmm... (eats some cheese)... I've got it! The boy gets sick and Puke the mouse (from an early draft) has to use the skills he learned riding the motorcycle to save the boy's life.I speculate, of course. For all I know, Cleary spent weeks and weeks working on the characters and then added a plot, or perhaps she had a vision and woke up to write down all the prophet had told her. In any case, it got done. What do I know about how great literature was produced, I can't even maintain a steady blogging schedule:)One more point about plot and characterization, and we'll call it an overly-long review--what can I say, I was just so happy to be back with you Esteemed Reader! Mice are a natural fit for children's stories, which is why there are so many books about them. Mice are small and a nuisance to adults, sort of like certain little Esteemed Readers. There are as many stories about mice as there are about actual children (probably not true, but it sounds true-ish).It is no wonder why Cleary chose a mouse to star in her children's story, but it's worth noting the kind of mouse she chose. She didn't go for happy go-lucky bachelor like Mickey, or a wise old fatherly mouse, or even a Fonzie parody (which would so have been the easy way out). She chose a child as a mouse. There are two children in The Mouse and the Motorcycle and Ralph's arc dovetails with Keith's, or maybe it's the other way around. And when choosing a character to empathize with, do you suppose children will be more interested in a sick kid lying in bed or an adventurous mouse who risks life and limb for a friend?Here's a nice after school special moment to illustrate my point:You mean you aren't mad at me anymore?\\" asked Ralph.\\"I guess you might say I'm mad but not real mad,\\" Keith decided. \\"I've been lying here thinking. It wouldn't be right for me to be real mad, because I get into messes myself. My mom and dad tell me I don't stop to use my head.\\"Ralph nodded. \\"I guess that' my trouble, too. I don't stop to use my head.\\"\\"They say I'm in too much of a hurry,\\" said Keith. \\"They say I don't want to take time to learn to do things properly.\\"Ralph nodded again. He understood. If he had waited until he had learned to ride the motorcycle he would never have ridden off the bedside table into the wastebasket.\\"I'll never forget the first time I rode a bicycle with hand brakes,\\" reminisced Keith. \\"I took right off down a hill. I had always ridden bicycles with foot brakes, and when I got going too fast I tried to put on foot brakes only there weren't any.\\"\\"What happened?\\" Ralph was fascinated.\\"By the time I remembered to use the hand brakes I hit a tree and took an awful spill.Somehow, this story made Ralph feel better. He was not the only one who got into trouble.\\"The hard part is,\\" continued Keith, \\"I am in a hurry. I don't want to do kid things I want to do big things. Real things. I want to grow up.\\" You look pretty grown up to me,\\" said Ralph.\\"Maybe to a mouse,\\" conceded Keith, \\"but I want to look grown up to grown-ups.\\"\\"So do I,\\" said Ralph with feeling. \\"I want to grow up and go down to the ground floor.\\"\\"Everybody tells me to be patient,\\" said Keith, \\"but I don't want to be patient.\\"\\"Me neither,\\" agreed Ralph.And that's going to do it. It's so good to see you again, Esteemed Reader, I think we should have us another date next week. What do you say, you and me, next Tuesday discussing another fine middle grade novel? We'll even invite an author to join us to face the 7 Questions on Thursday just like we used to do. And if that works out, we'll do it again the next week... and after that, well... let's just wait and see how worn out and behind on the new manuscript the Ninja is, shall we? But next week for sure. And until then, I've got something you always used to like, Esteemed Reader--some of my favorite passages from this week's book:\\"To pilfer a pill,\\" said Ralph. \\"An aspirin tablet.\\" His answer was dramatic enough even for Uncle Lester. His entire family stared at him in disbelief. Not an aspirin! Not after his own father had been poisoned by one of the dread tablets.\\"An aspirin!\\" Ralph's mother gasped. \\"No, Ralph, not that! Anything but that!\\"\\"Why, there's Ralph,\\" squeaked his Aunt Sissy, who thought she was better than the rest of the family because she lived in the bridal suite where, she led her relatives to believe, riches of rice fell to the carpet when the bride took off her hat and the groom shook out his coat.\\"Ralph, stay here,\\" pleaded his mother. \\"You're too young. Let you Uncle Lester go.\\"\\"Well, now, let's talk this over,\\" said Uncle Lester."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"As I said in my other reviews for the Ralph S Mouse books they are an easy, and fun read that anyone can enjoy.

Not because it's an easy reading level or anything like that, but I am also not that good a of reader at all. But I think at some points in the book it was so funny I all most couldn't even breathe. The mouse and the motorcycle is about a mouse with a little toy motorcycle that rides with his tail up because it will get caught in the spokes of the little motorcycle. He rides around a hotel and has to escape all kinds of things like mousetraps, maids, and things of that nature. What I like about the book is the mouse. The mouse is the best part about the book because he so quick and fast and Knows know one can caught him. He also pretty cool. But he all a very dangerous mouse he's crazy in every way trying to get away from the vacuum cleaner and risking he life but he never gets caught because so quick and fast I guess he knows he's not going to get caught.I would recommend this book to a young child who likes books about motorcycles and mouse. Because its very easy to read and understand and funny in some parts of the book to. The cover of the book with catch their eye too. Even through your not suppose too judge a book by its cover but there young. I also think the fact of a mouse riding on a toy motorcycle with interest them in something.

He sat spellbound in his booster seat from the moment the CD began and didn't utter a sound (except for a giggle every time he heard the P-b-b-b-b-b-b of the motorcycle) until the story came to an end.The Mouse and the Motorcycle is a story about the friendship between a boy and a mouse... and the shiny red toy motorcycle that they share. Major themes include friendship, sharing, loyalty, selflessness, keeping your word, and following your dreams even if they are unconventional or unpopular.It is a wonderful story; imaginative, funny, full of adventure, and it is cleverly written. It is a perfect car companion for young and old and I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"Both of my children adored this book and Im kind of fond of it myself. Its just a cute little story about a friendship between a mouse who lives in an old, run-down hotel and a boy who stays at the hotel over a long weekend. The mouse learns to ride the boys toy motorcycle, which thrills them both (and also thrilled my kids), but gets the mouse into a number of scrapes, including losing the motorcycle. Eventually the mouse learns to be more responsible and to care more about others, and earns back his precious motorcycle. I like the books message that the more responsible you are, the more privileges you get. Thats something Im always trying to teach my kids, and I appreciate the help this book offers in getting the message across. But even more, I love Beverly Clearys light touch, her sense of humor, and her obvious respect for children. She teaches important lessons in a nice way. Its no surprise that she one of most childrens favorite writers."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"Story overview:---------------One day, in an old fashioned and unfrequented hotel, a family shows up. The mother is not the most thrilled about the idea of staying at this place, and keeps on insisting that there are probably mice living there, but there were no other options (they had driven for many hours and everything else was full). Her and her husband stay in room 216, but their son, Keith, is allowed to have his own room next door in #215.The boy pokes his finder in a hole only to find, to his disappointment, that there's nothing in there. Little did he know that it was the entrance to the home of Ralph, a young and mischievous mouse who is always giving his mother reasons to worry; particularly on this day when he climbs up a phone cord to look for leftover crumbs.Unfortunately for Ralf, the boy's mother is overly clean and there were no leftovers, however what he saw was something he desired even more than food: a motorcycle.Ralf sits on the motorcycle and accidently rolls off the table, falling into a waste basket, where he is discovered by the boy, Keith, and they become good friends. The two have a lot of fun together until one day-due to Ralf's carelessness-the hotel finds evidence of mice and so Ralf and his family take refuge. Thankfully for the mice, Keith brings them enough food to eat, but one day the boy becomes ill and Ralf finds himself on a mission to help find him some medicine.My thoughts:-------------Extremely charming, this book had me turning the pages. The fonts are big (at least in my edition), so it's easier for children to read, and the illustrations (though sometimes not quite accurate) do a good job of painting a visual picture to the words. As an adult, I still really enjoyed reading this again, and will probably go back and read a few more \\"Ralph S. Mouse\\" books before too long.Things to consider:------------------Keep in mind that this book was written in 1965, and there are some really dated expressions and items, but being from the 60s, and for children, I think it safe to say that this can be read to just about any age. It seems to be targeted more towards boys at around five years old, but I can see girls easily enjoying it too. No cursing, no violence, no sexual situations. Just nice, clean and entertaining reading.James D.

This the most comical, action-packed story I have ever read. I think that Keith is a young, generous boy who gives Ralph his two most prized possessions, a toy motorcycle and a crash helmet. I love the way Mrs. Cleary portrays Ralph as a medium-sized mouse who is bold, funny, and adventurous. I love how Mrs. Cleary writes her books; when I read them, it seems as though they come alive! Her language is sparkling and well written. This book makes me want to read all of Beverly Cleary's books!"},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"I am a beginning teacher and read this aloud to my students, who went ecstatic with the story.

I recommend this to any elementary teacher or parent; good, quality summer reading."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"I believe that Beverly Cleary is the world's most important children's author. Even adults will read and enjoy Beverly Cleary's books. my personal favorite is The Mouse and the Motorcycle. It is about a mouse named Ralph. Ralph is a regular speed demon. He has a love for the thrill of speed. The Mouse and the Motorcycle teaches the values of keeping promises and honesty. Ralph is always breaking promises. Everytime he does, something happens that causes a big problem. The book teaches respect. When Ralph ignores his mother, something happens like falling in a wastepaper basket. In the story's conclusion, Ralph realizes all he wants is to be a respectable mouse. The Mouse and the Motorcycle is enjoyable for all audiences. Its fun and exciting plot makes it a good read-aloud story. A good example of this can be found on page 23. &quot;There it was at the end-the motorcycle! Ralph stared at it and then walked over and kicked a tire. Close up the motorcycle looked even better than he expected. it was new and shiny with a good pair of tires. Ralph walked all the way around it, examining the pair of chromium mufflers and the engine and the hand clutch. It even had a little license plate so it would be legal to ride it. &quot;Boy!&quot; Ralph said to himself, his whiskers quivering with excitement. &quot;Boy, oh Boy!&quot;.&quot; Every boy and girl of any age would love this story! Comparing Beverly Cleary's books, I have discovered they should be rated first. The majority of children's books are aimed mainly to young girls while Beverly Cleary's books are enjoyed by girls and boys. Beverly Cleary's books promote good values unlike books such as Sideways Storys from Wayside School by Louis Sachar. The children in these stories do not respect their elders. Beverly Cleary's beleivable characters make her silly plots seem real. Louis Sachar's characters are not believable which make the plot just plain weird. The Mouse and the Motorcycle should be considered a children's classic."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"The book is about a mouse named Ralph, who finds a toy car- motorcycle.

Keith discovers him and the two become friends. But what adventures will await Ralph now that he can ride a motorcycle?I missed these books as a kid. There is a decided fantasy element to them that is missing from Beverly Cleary's other books. But that doesn't make them bad at all. In fact, just the little bits that were there added a lot of charm to the story.The story started a little slowly, but once Ralph takes his first ride on the motorcycle, things really pick up. In fact, I was often left wondering how he would get out of whatever his next problem would be. Mrs. Cleary does a wonderful job of bring a mouse's world to life and creating problems that would be realistic. Ralph really grows over the course of the book, and that growth is fun to watch, at least for this adult.I know I have missed other books about Ralph, and I just might have to track them down.

By far one of the very best books ever written for kids - when I was young, I used to scour the library shelves for anything Cleary wrote. Checked them all out and read them all many, many times.

He has wonderful sound effects and different voices for each of the characters and uses them well and consistently throughout all three stories in this series. The class especially loved the sounds Ralph, the mouse, makes to get his motorcycle to move. If your child likes this tape, then I recommend you try all three audiotapes in the &quot;Mouse&quot; series. My child listens to them constantly, especially when travelling in the car, and though I enjoyed listening the first few times, there are occasions when I'd rather not hear them again.

I liked the part when the maid was singing in front of the mirror it had me laughing. The maid also had a secret crush on the bus boy. My favorite part was when Ralph got the aspirin tablet to Keith and saved the day. I gave this book 5 stars. ~StardustBeverly Cleary has done it again with another great book for me to read. I would recomend this book to anyone because it is funny. When Ralph went wh-e-e wh-e-e that moved the ambulance and phpbbbb that moved the motorcycle but I can't tell you any more of the book you have to read the book and find out your self. ~RayMouse and the Motorcycle is a great book for children of all ages. It has some funny parts and some sad parts in it. My favorite part is when Ralph finds an asprin. Mouse and the Motorcycle is about a boy that meets a mouse and he finds out that he can talk.

This is another wonderful, amazing, creative, and character-building story for your little ones.The reading level is second-grade (at least), and the chapters are long. It is pure fun -- the boy and the mouse can understand one another, and they each come to the other's rescue. The mouse makes the boy's toy motorcycle \\"go\\" by making engine noises, of course.We enjoy it for family read-aloud time. There are a few illustrations, one or two per chapter, and some 1960's-era vocabulary (modern moms don't give their little boys aspirin anymore, and there's a milkman, and a drugstore that doesn't open till 9:00 the following morning. No Walgreens back then!) So when I read it, I explain a little. I read \\"aspirin\\" as \\"pill\\" or \\"medicine\\". We have stayed in plenty of old hotels like the one in the story book, and it is charming to imagine Ralph on his motorcycle putt-putting along the dark hallways.The story is boyishly appealing. Once your little ones can read well, Beverly Cleary is an excellent author, because she loves children, and her characters stay safe and develop nice personalities."},{"Title":"The Mouse and the Motorcycle (Weekly Reader)","review":"After purchasing The Mouse and the Motorcycle for a long road trip with my 7-year-old granddaughter, I can't say enough about the story or about the reader, B.D.

We rode absolutely enchanted by Cleary's story and Wong's interpretation of it. Although the long road trip is over, my granddaughter still requests that I play The Mouse and the Motorcycle when she rides with me. This will be a favorite of your children and grandchildren.

I found this book so exciting that I did not want to put it down. I got sucked into the book and felt like I was experiencing the adventures myself. I learned from this book, that having friends and people who love and care about you are a very important thing to have in life. I was also able to see how Ralph and Keith both matured from their experiences that they shared.

Ralph was looking around for the aspirin and about 10 minutes into his search he found the motorcycle. Ralph kept looking for an aspirin on the ground floor and after about 1 hour of searching he found the aspirin just before he was going to give up his search. After Ralph found the motorcycle Keith said, \\"Ralph you can keep the motorcycle\\".Keith is sick in bed and he asks Ralph to go get him an aspirin and Ralph says \\"okay\\".

You can't help but relate to a mouse who experiences envy, shame, and guilt - and thereby reflects a real-world humanity that is either entirely absent. or treated ham-fistedly in so many other books for this age. More than adding to our enjoyment of the story, I loved the fact that this quality introduces my children to what literature can be - not merely a diversion, but a call to reflection, showing you the ordinariness of your foibles, and the possibilites for redemption.Then of course (of greater interest to them than to me) was the action. The machine-centric obsession, the necessity of speed and bravery, the near misses - all the heroic theatrics close to most young boys' hearts.I wish I'd bought the whole trilogy at once.

At the end of it, I still had questions to resolve about becoming Catholic but I felt a real desire to become a Jesuit like Campion, ready to sacrifice all and defy anyone for the sake of the Gospel. Whatever your background, if you can read this story without being moved and challenged, beware the state of your soul!It is a powerful story, thoroughly researched and skillfully told. I've often wondered why Waugh didn't write more like it; a life of More or Fisher from his pen, or even of an ambiguous and frustrated figure like Gardiner, would have been a great treasure. His life of St. Helena is excellent in its own way, but a very different sort of book.The reason, it turns out, is very simple. The Campion book was not Waugh's idea in the first place. He wrote it primarily out of gratitude to the priest, Fr. Martin D'Arcy SJ, who had instructed him in the faith and received him into the Church five years before. One of D'Arcy's fellow Jesuits had done a great deal of research for a new biography of Campion but had died before he could actually write it. Not only is the book dedicated to Fr. Martin, but Waugh declined to profit personally from the book. He quietly signed over all royalties from the biography to Campion Hall, the Jesuit house at Oxford University that was just then beginning to be built."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"Evelyn Waugh's Edmund Campion is about the making of a martyr in 16th century England. It will appeal most obviously to Catholics. But it is equally a picture of the politics of the time leading from Henry VIII to James I--with implications beyond, with occasional snapshots of unbelievable coarseness of manners: Queen Elizabeth accepting the hospitality of unsuspecting families and ordering their arrest when they try to honor her as she leaves; her ordering a performance from a courtier, who falls, with her roaring in laughter and kicking him, dubbing him Sir Ox.There is the torture and beastly punishments, etc. But there is in the great changes things we might recognize from our own time. Vast resources were changing hands at the will of the \\"government,\\" ending the tenure and foundation of religious enterprises. It was, you might say, past time for it. But it is hard to argue that the public benefitted. In fact in the short run the public lost by the change. The support the public needed and was used to from the foundations vanished. The charities and schooling were cut off at their source. Oxford itself became unfunded.Still, one might think it was time to end the medieval pattern and to assert change that would tend to secular control of the people's business. But the reality was, from Henry to Elisabeth, the plunder went to the ministers' cronies and supporters, creating big establishments to ennoble and enrich them--thus not only paying for their support, but binding them to it. On the other hand, the engine of reform, the public factions agitating for supremacy and the elimination of Catholics and their foundations, were easily steered. There were competing Protestant views. It was only a question of appropriate reinforcement depending ministerial choice: punish those deemed too extreme; the others would feel supported by the government actions of disestablishment. Such turns of events are not unknown in politics at other times.About Elizabeth: \\"All her life she had been surrounded by plots; plots to implicate her in Wyatt's rebellion, plots against her life . . . many of them real enough . . . plots that had no existence except in the brains of Walsingham and the Cecils [p. 19 EC].\\" Waugh says this only in reference to her dying. From his narrative a reader can see that she led an uncertain life, with every reason to be afraid: of judicial death at the hands of her half sisters or their supporters, for one thing. (She reluctantly condemned two of her half sisters to death at the instigation of her chief minister.) Henry VIII had officially declared her illegitimate and blocked her from the succession--later reversing this. Waugh's picture of Elizabeth needs a further level of generalization to register the totality in which her danger grew up with her and stayed with her to the end. She was brilliant, gifted person: but the sense of danger must have been central in her life. I think that she could see that there was no safety for her to try to live an ordinary life: she couldn't even marry without crown permission (very, very unlikely).Elizabeth could see the likeliest safety was for her to be queen. She would have the power of government behind her. I think that she saw marrying as queen would be a threat to her control, and a merry dance she led them on this. But it made her, too, susceptible to manipulation by her principal minister, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Neither of them were actuated by fervent religious motive. Elizabeth had to sense the danger potential of the religious disorders; Cecil loved power. He may have called it something else, but the reality for him was his ability to be in control and to build a new power structure based on his sense of what could work. The definitive shift in power between Crown and Parliament would grow out of such interplays of actual power.In the end I can recommend this book to anyone interested in any these things, or their romance, whether Catholic or not--with the warning that it is the story of Edmund Campion, martyr and saint.Edmund Campion"},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"Drags a bit, but it is a good read overall."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"\\"My charge is, of free cost to preach the Gospel, to minister the Sacraments, to instruct the simple, to reforme sinners, to confute errors-- in brief, to crie alarme spiritual against foul vice and proud ignorance wherewith many my dear Countrymen are abused.I never had mind, and am strictly forbidden by our Father that sent me, to deal in any respect with matter of State or Policy of this realm, as things which appertain not to my vocation, and from which I do gladly restrain and sequester my thoughts.\\"-- the courageous martyr and \\"seditious Jesuit\\" Edmund Campion in his famous \\"Brag\\"Kudos to the good people of Ignatius Press for introducing new generations to Waugh's masterful biography of St. Edmund Campion. The brilliant Oxford scholar was destined for any career he chose in Elizabeth's Protestant England. Instead, at a time when being Catholic meant persecution and an uncertain future, Campion chose not only conversion, but ordination as a Jesuit and near-certain death.Ignatius' new hardcover edition is superbly done, with a tight binding, attractive dust jacket, high quality paper, and a very readable font. It also includes remarks by modern Waugh aficionados like Joseph Pearce and George Weigel and a new introduction by Fr. Joseph Fessio.Readers might enjoy excerpts from Percy Hutchison's 1936 review in the New York Times:\\"For several years Campion, of the Jesuit order and ordained priest, had been on the Continent. Then Rome ordered him to England to give what mental and religious sustenance he could to the persecuted brethren. Though he knew that sooner or later his life would be forfeit, Campion, ten years before the defeat of the Spanish Armada, landed once again on English soil. From that moment on his days might fittingly be described as a progress toward the cross.He was a marked man. Doubtless it is true, as Evelyn Waugh adduces documentary evidence to show, that Campion was falsely convicted. He was charged with sedition; he had incited no rebellion. He was charged with treason; he had not committed treason. But he had given heart to the English of his faith by surreptitious preaching and surreptitious administrations of the sacraments. At his trial a great show of disputation of doctrine was made, but all this, according to Mr. Waugh, was camouflage.\\""},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"It is always good to read about the saints, but the writing of those who write on the saints is not always good. It is no surprise that one of the great writers of the last century such as Evelyn Waugh would turn out a great book.Edmund Campion is a biography of the Jesuit Saint Edmund Campion who was martyred in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and the increasingly severe penal laws in England. This book was written in 1935 only five years after Waugh's conversion into the Catholic Church. It is a straightforward biography based on the best historical research available at the time. The author does not inject himself in the book in that he tries hard to stick to the historical narrative of what can actually be known and any dialogue in the book is straight from the historical record. This is in no way some syrupy hagiography that diverges from facts with flowery stories or that tries to inflate the actions of Edmund Campion. Though considering the subject this is not much needed when you look at his amazing life.The book running at a little more than 200 pages is divided into four very appropriate chapters: The Scholar, The Priest, The Hero, The Martyr. I wonder if you have to give a spoiler alert when you are talking a martyr. Evelyn Waugh provides the necessary historical background of the state of the Church and of the politics involved and you fast become involved in the biography as if you were reading a novel. Every time you read about the recusants and those in Church history who were persecuted for the faith it always gives you a greater appreciation of what most Catholics in the modern world take for granted. When we go to Mass we aren't worried that somebody is going to turn us in or that we don't need guards to warn is people are coming so that the priest can hide in the priest-hole.The first two chapters deal with his academic life and his early career as he initially leaves England because of the growing persecution of Catholics and his decision to become a priest and then a Jesuit. The biographic then moves to his returning to England. Like many saints he was not specifically making decisions that would lead him on the road to martyrdom. In fact circumstances could have left him teaching in Vienna and Prague since the Jesuits at the time had no chapters in England. But also like many saints when it became apparent that he would indeed be traveling down that road it was done with joy.As Waugh chronicles Campion's year of attending to the Catholics in England you again get caught up in the drama as he and other priests continue to minister to the flock for the good of souls. It is a measure of Campion's genius that his \\"Brag\\" that he wrote in a half-hour's time to defend himself from charges of treason was printed and reprinted across England. Or that his famous Ten Reasons would provide much annoyance to the authorities at the time. So annoying that once he was captured and tortured they brought him to a series of debates to try to counter it. Waugh does not dwell much into St. Campion's grisly martyrdom that will be familiar to those that saw Braveheart, but it is quite interesting the stories he describes by those who were converted by Campion in his last days.Highly recommended and one of those rare biographies that is indeed a page-turner."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"This biography of the English saint and martyr Edmund Campion won the Hawthornden Prize in 1936, and I read it because of that. It is very well-written , tho it lacks a bibliography and footnotes. Campion was executed Dec. 1, 1581, after being sentenced to &quot;be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight, then your head to be cut off and your body divided into four parts.&quot; It surely makes one grateful for the 8th Amendment against cruel and unusual punishmnet. This is a fast read and eminently worth reading."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"Often, when reading a biography of a saint, one is struck by a certain dissonance: the heavenly heights of the subject matter do not correspond to the writing level of the book. The saint biography is one of my favorite genres, but it is at times a chore to get by the substandard writing to penetrate the beauty of the life of the saint.Nothing could be further from the case in \\"Edmund Campion\\" by Evelyn Waugh. Here we have a combination for the ages: the story of a magnificent saint told by one of the great authors of the 20th century. In many ways, it reminded me of Mark Twain's excellent book on Joan of Arc. Waugh's use of the language allows the story of Campion to come alive in ways a lesser author could have never conveyed. One is swept up into the time of Campion, and allowed to experience the persecution he experienced first-hand, as well as understand the motivating love behind his actions.Highly recommended for all lovers of literature and the saints."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"Foxe's famous book of martyrs gave the impression that England's troubled past ended with the martyrs of \\"Bloody\\" Queen Mary. But martyrdom continued at the hands of the Protestant soveriegns that followed including the hundreds of priests tortured to death under \\"Good Queen Bess\\" (Elizabeth I). One of those priests was the beloved Edmund Campion who gave up a lucrative career as a scholar to follow a calling that would lead to the ultimate sacrifice for love of his homeland.Mr. Waugh brings his literary skills to bear in the biographical genre to tell us this moving story of this great hero of the faith. Campion had all the promise as a young man in England and Ireland to make a renowned scholar. Mentioning a fellow English scholar of that time, Mr. Waugh makes the profound observation, \\"Tobie Matthew died full of honours in 1628. There, but for the Grace of God, went Edmund Campion.\\" Campion's life would not end with mere honors of man but the the great honor God gives to those who give their lives for others. Campion's ignominious and gruesome death won him a far greater honor than he might have accomplished as a renowned scholar. He is venerated today as a canonized saint with good reason. His life was one of service and love for his fellow man to the point of facing death in order to encourage those under the brutal persecution of Elizabeth's reign.When the sovereigns of England attempted to squash the Catholic faith, a school for under-cover priests was founded on the continent. Campion attended and took on the austere life of a Society of Jesus eventually teaching at seminaries far from his home. But always his heart ached for his own country. But, as Waugh observes, \\"Campion could help the English Mission best by realising his own sanctity.\\" And so he did, eventually landing under cover on his home island to pray for and preach the Catholics denied freedom of worship there. But his capture, long torture and brutal martyrdom were not a defeat. As Waugh says of Campion and the martyr priests like him, \\"We are the heirs of their conquest, and enjoy, at our ease, the plenty which they died to win.\\"The final chapter conveys the story of one man present at Campion's death. This man, literally splattered with the blood of the martyr, left England to follow the same path of study to priesthood to return and a common end. The blood of the martyrs are indeed the seeds of the Church. Saint Edmund Campion, pray for us."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"This was an amazing book. It was difficult to read as it is of any wholesale murder and suppression of a people. I had never been able to study the effects of the anti-catholic legislation and brutal suppression of the Church in England. I had alway studied it from the Irish perspective. I think that Saint Edmund Campion lived for as long as he did because he spent 10 years in Europe. Otherwise, he would have had a much shorter life, like Man-of-God Father Michael McGivney. He was already well-known in England for his writings, and oratory as a student and Deacon at Oxford University.I was struck by a few items in this book. The first was Queen Elizabeth I's remark to her bishops and clergy as she neared death, calling them \\"hedge priests\\", meaning not being actually ordained and shooing them out. The other was the shear emptiness of the English people's lives created merely to satisfy the political and power ambitions of the English Government and ministers as opposed by the people at large who were generally sympathetic and preferred to remain Catholic. Evelyn Waugh commented about the Queen's Government doing all that it could to \\"removing the people from the Sacraments of the Church so that it would die out in a generation\\" was quite striking and saddening to picture. How desolute were their lives already, but to take away the one thing that they had for hundreds of years? Mr. Waugh also points out the destruction of the abbeys and great places of learning, \\"...that flowed to and from Europe, suddenly cutting off England from the rest of the Church\\", and the greatest minds and service of the monks and priests of the Church from the English people.In Ireland, it was well known to us in America that there were safe houses and secret rooms to hide the priests and the vessels and vestments for Mass. I was surprised that this also occurred in England. I think that in many areas of history, Americans hear an \\"anglicized version\\" of the event and we see that prejudice in our books and common history.I highly recommend this book. It can be painful to read, but should be read. I would recommend some research first on the creation of the Church of England by King Henry VIII, and the Penal Laws, the Law of Supremecy, and the Catholic Faith in England first. This system of suppression remained in force until the middle of the 19th Century! There is a whole litany of English saints and martyrs that have been lost, but are waiting to be rediscovered by you."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"This is one of the most powerful, moving and inspiring books I've ever read. In an age when, by and large, the Faith has been watered down to a Disney version of itself, this reminds us of the eternal Truths of the Holy Catholic church."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"A bio of the English Catholic martyr. Detailed. Not a light read, but if the era or the subject interests you, the book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"Evelyn Waugh earned his place in letters as one of the 20th century's great acerbic wits, yet an undeniable cynicism in him was tempered by his Catholic spirituality. His \\"Edmund Campion\\" is an early testament to his religious identity, but fails to bring much of his literary gift to bear.A promising Oxford student whose talent for debate won him many Anglican admirers, including Queen Elizabeth, Campion's life took a U-turn when something in him rebelled against the primrose path set before him. At a time when faith in old religion cost Englishmen their livelihoods if not their lives, Campion joined the Green Berets of the Catholic Church: The Jesuits, where the goal was the gaol, and grisly martyrdom.\\"...there was that in Campion that made him more than a decent person; an embryo in the womb of his being, maturing in darkness, invisible, barely stirring; the love for holiness, the need for sacrifice,\\" Waugh writes.Published in 1935, after Waugh had published his first four scathing social novels, \\"Edmund Campion\\" examines a different kind of social transgression. The central problem of the book as I see it is Waugh's respectful handling of the Campion story leaves little room for the voice that Waugh had tempered by this point to such a sharp edge.Another issue with Waugh's tone is it leaves little room for imaginative reconstruction. He's writing a pure history, just the facts, and except for two bookend episodes, neither of which feature Campion himself (one presents Elizabeth at the end of her life, the other a pair of street performers at the site of Campion's martyrdom), there's no color in Waugh's account. Often he will write something like \\"we cannot know what hopes stirred in Campion's heart\\" and leave it there, or else relate some fragmentary comment with some note of its historical dubiousness. It's frustrating, distance-putting reading.Two sections of the book stick out as memorable. At the English College of Douai, in Holland, Campion prepares for his martyrdom knowingly and gratefully, a very surreal sequence read at this remove in time. In the other, Campion is tried, ridiculously, by a kangaroo court where he is tortured nearly to death between court sessions but still manages to make his case, puncturing the trumped-up charge of treason and calling attention to the fact his real crime was holding to the same faith that Englishmen and women lived under for centuries.\\"He and his fellows were to die, but the world must know the cause,\\" Waugh explains.But there are long arid stretches between those two sections, and much of the rest has Waugh discussing the Campion story as if the priests he wrote it for and already knew the tale were its only audience. A worthwhile endeavor, \\"Edmund Campion\\" doesn't quite hit the mark as a Waugh must-read, but is worth checking out for those who admire Waugh and want to know more about what made him tick."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion","review":"I chose the rating because,for me,that i could understand British religions and the humans killed all in the name of GOD.I liked the work of the Author.I would recommend this to the serious minded student in Religion."},{"Title":"Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries","review":"Crudely put, the major thrust of Joseph Campbell's and CG Jung's work was the unity of the human psyche throughout the world - that the ancient religions and traditions are psychologically relevant. Neither man, however, was an adept of these systems, ie, neither pursued these systems to their obviously implied conclusions, instead contenting themselves with the (what is now) noncontroversial conclusion of psychological relevance. Jung was obviously at a loss to understand alchemical terms coherently, contenting himself with interpreting alchemy in Freudian and his own terms. Campbell maintained that God no longer speaks to mankind because He never DID speak to mankind.Thomas Taylor, on the other hand, \\"the Great English Pagan\\", was thoroughly versed in the Platonic and Neoplatonic traditions and although he lacked the benefits of twentieth century scholarship, not only approached the essentially same conclusions as Campbell and Jung, but further concluded that there did exist at one time a religion of magical invocation. (See my review of Iamblichus on the Mysteries.) However incredible this idea might seem to us moderns, there are numerous examples from reliable, trustworthy witnesses (Plato, Plutarch, Iamblichus, Proclus) and other ancient sources - the Bible included (eg, the Witch of Endor summoning the spirit of Samuel for King Saul) that argue for this conclusion. Modern Rosicrucians and Golden Dawn adepts apparently concur, arguing for a sober reappraisal of what we understand by the term \\"religion\\".Taylor concurs with Campbell that the Christian religion has inadvertently charted strange and unknown seas by its insistence on the historicity of its symbolism. Unlike Campbell, he is virulently anti-Christian, not only in the Nietzschean sense that Christianity has undermined true Spirituality by its insistence on the fallen nature of the physical world, but also because he considers it a selfishly motivated and bizarre perversion of high paganism. It is a characterization convincingly assaulted by many Christian scholars and authors: eg, see GK Chesterton'sThe Everlasting Man.Nevertheless, this translation is to be highly commended as it is Taylor's. Second, as usual, Taylor provides voluminous footnotes that are very helpful in acquiring a basic understanding of the Mysteries of Eleusis with its central sacrament of wheat analogous to the Eucharist of the Catholic mass and symbolic of the spiritually dead rising from the tomb of the body.A very good and engaging Taylor volume, but like all his works it tends to raise more questions than it answers. If you enjoy this, again, you will want to read Taylor's Iamblichus on the Mysteries."},{"Title":"Life's Picture History of World War 2","review":"This book was in Great shape!

Jean-Luc Picard is playing the star roll as Dixon Hill a detective solving crime in the city by the bay in the 1940's. He is accompanied by the Luscious Bev (Beverly Crusher), Mr. Whelan and Mr. Data, all trying to find the Heart of the Adjuster. Its location is paramount in saving the Enterprise from certain destruction from an area of space known as the Blackness.As with many private eye stories, this has clues woven throughout the story, so be forwarned read it carefully and you'll solve this crime story before Dixon Hill realizes he has all the clues he needs. But time is short and Dixon Hill has a bevy of suspects to encounter in order to find the \\"Heart.\\"This is a well written mystery, a few typos, but nevertheless a compelling story. The deterioration of the Enterprise by the quantum overlap (Blackness) is believeable and the solution found but will it work?We have gangsters with some really original names; Cyrus Redblock, Ghost Johnson, Benny the Banger, Harvey Upstairs Benton, Slippery Stan Hand and his girl friend Jessica Daniels. An intrepid Detective Bell is Dixon Hill's inside source as the book evolves and is Hill's best friend.But as Data said, as he took his gangster stance, \\"As Dexter Drake said, \\"The solving of almost every crime mystery depends on something which seems, at first glance, to bear no relation whatever to the original crime.\\" Pay heed to these words and they will serve you well in solving this mystery.I enjoyed reading this book as it was entertaining and a fast read. But not everyone will like this book to them all I can say is... better luck. Those who want a deeper engrossing mystery, this is not your best mystery, but at least there are attempts at writing more mystery into the suspense of Trek."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"\\"Hard Rain\\" is a waste of the paper its printed on. Even the basic \\"hook\\" of Picard saving the day as Dixon Hill is cliche. How many times can that holodeck malfunction and nearly destroy the ship before they write it off as a bad idea. The 'plot' is Data and Geordi make up a TREKnospeak whatsis to save the ship from a spacial anomaly(again!). They have to test it on the Holodeck. Then the Dixon Hill program comes on and 'someone' steals the heart of the device. It is lost on the holodeck. Dixon has to get it away from the mob. Why don't they just shut the thing down and pick it up off the floor? The author comes up with a weak justification at the end of the book which says. Anything taken in and not held when the program is shut off is destroyed. Even if that was the case in \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" Data shows that he can see past the holo image on his own if he wants to. Lets not even bring Geordi into this. This book is before STTNG Generations but Worf is no where to be seen or even heard from or referred to. As well as other plot/tech holes big enough to drive the Enterprise through. Also the \\"Mystery\\" is no mystery at all half way through the book you'll be going. \\"Please no dont let it be\\" But it is. This is arguably the worst STTNG novel to ever come out. Hopefully a single aberration from the generally high quality of the new ST books."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"I came at this book from a different angle than most Trekkies (Trekkers, for you young people). I happen to love he old mysteries by Chandler, et al., and I knew this was an homage to -- not a parody of, as some have suggested -- the detective fiction of the golden age of pulp before I started reading.Dean Wesley Smith clearly loves the genre as much as I do and cleverly worked in trademark touches from several writers of the period. Including Ellery Queen's summary of \\"clues\\" at the end of each chapter, some of which are red herrings. Even if you miss every little Easter egg and can't tell Sam Spade from Philip Marlowe, there's enough action, interesting characterizations and intriguing plot twists to keep you going.If your Trek simply must have planets exploding and Romulans conspiring and the Enterprise locked in deadly combat against overwhelming odds, this is not the book for you. If you're in the mood for a delightful variation on familiar themes -- with more than a bit of whimsy and humor -- this could be just what you're looking for."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"This novel was just not my cup of tea. It is written just like a pulp fiction dectective novel of the 1940's which is extremely appropriate considering it's a Dixon Hill mystery. I'd forgotten how badly written those stories could be-and a &quot;Hard Rain&quot; was pretty bad. I couldn't even finish it and that's rare for me."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"This book is written in a fairly shallow, somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion. With this author it is hard to tell if that shallow style is deliberate or not. Anyway, this does not read as a really serious or tense book, despite the situation the Enterprise is in. However it is definitely enjoyable. We have never had a chance to see Picard in the world of Dixon Hill for an extensive amount of time. Regardless of the circumstances, Picard is definitely enjoying the chance to spend so much time there. The 1930s detective genre is an interesting setting in itself. The characters are shallow, but they work well as a part of the story. There is also simply an enormous amount of action, of a very unusual type for the Next Generation: gunfights and shoot-outs. Finally, it is actually quite a mystery, and Picard is forced to do some hard deduction at the end, when all his leads seem broken, to finally solve it. I quite enjoyed it."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"I am a fan of Piers Anthony's &quot;Xanth&quot; series, so the horrible cliche's and the many ways of saying &quot;stolen&quot; was amusing to me. &quot;Xanth&quot;, by the way, is a world loaded with some very *bad* puns that can have you busting out with laughter on occasion. However, &quot;A Hard Rain&quot; suffers from excessive repetiveness. I got tired of reading the same lines over and over. Then there were the &quot;clues&quot; listed at the end of each chapter. I wondered if I was reading a children's book by mistake at first. Sometimes children's authors write things like that to help the young reader keep track. But then I got the idea that this is written like a PC game. You have the characters, the set-up, everything you need to play the game. Each chapter is a different section in the game that you can't get to until you gather up all the clues and can move onward. Unfortunatly, it didn't translate well into book form. The writing is too stilted and skimpy. Maybe the author should have gone on and made it into a game. It might have been more of a success."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"It was an excellent idea--Picard visits the holodeck for a Dixon Hill mystery, accompanied by Bev Crusher, Data, and Whelan, the ship's historian, but things go terribly wrong and it becomes a race against time or dire consequences will ensue...wait, they already did that one...Which was part of the problem--the book's plot was too similar in basic outline to the episode &quot;The Big Goodbye&quot;; the spatial anomaly and the countdown until it destroys the Enterprise merely replaces the Jarada and their probable destruction of the ship if Picard doesn't cough up their ritual greeting a.s.a.p. I know there's a saying that there are only six or eight basic plots in Hollywood, anyway, but perhaps Mr. Smith should have chosen one of the others instead. And, as other reviewers have pointed out, spatial anomalies and technobabble are as worn as the soles of a beat-cop's shoes.That metaphor is another reason this book failed to impress me. The problem with writing a pastiche of those cliche-ridden&quot;hard-boiled&quot; detective novels is that...one ends up sounding like a cliche-ridden &quot;hard-boiled&quot; detective novel. If that were a good thing, no one would want to write a pastiche of the style in the first place. And I really wasn't blown away by the revelation of the &quot;culprit&quot;...but perhaps I'm just being catty...In addition, I found it difficult to &quot;place&quot; this story in relation to the TNG timeline. The absence of both Wesley and Worf would seem to put it after the events in the film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, but Data is still acting like his pre-emotion-chip self, with no mention made of his either turning the chip off or removing it for the investigation on the holodeck. Picky, I suppose, but it irritated me.Still, the characters were well-drawn, the villains aptly and imaginatively named, the chapter and section titles amusing--although the various ways of saying &quot;stolen&quot; felt more than a little forced--and many of the events (shorn of their cliches) were attention-grabbers. Thus the two stars instead of just one."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"\\"It was a read so bad that it made an eye chart look like an award winning novel...\\" Anyone who loves hack writing and horrible prose in the fashion of old pulp detective novels will adore this book.If on the other hand, you are looking for another excellent science fiction story written in the STNG world of culture and intelligent dialog, you should avoid this book at all costs. The story idea itself is bottom-of-the-barrel \\"first season\\" quality. The treatment (or lack thereof) of the STNG characters is embarassing.

It's difficult to figure out what is going on at first. An object has been stolen, one that is needed to save the ship. It's obvious from almost the beginning who has stolen the object and you'll probably guess right away, but you have to slog through this awful book to find out if you''re correct.

It isn't really a Star Trek book; it's a Dixon Hill novel with a few Star Trek trappings just to qualify it for publication under the Star Trek umbrella.Furthermore, the very basic premise of the story -- that an item brought from the real world to the holodeck and left there would be absorbed into the virtual world of the holodeck and thus lost if the program was turned off, rather than remaining in the middle of the empty holodeck, is frankly wrong and incredibly stupid. So the entire story is built on a ridiculous premise. Again, if you don't mind this -- if you're willing and able to suspend a whole lot more disbelief than I can manage for the sake of a good yarn -- then be my guest. It's well-written and kind of fun, as fluff goes.

Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the book was the author's overuse of similes. I just wanted to get through one page without something being &quot;like a...&quot;. Additionally, the relationship between Crusher and Picard was never clearly defined.

I kept waiting for the story to grip me, but it never did, and I figured it out way before Dix did.I did, however, LOVE the cover. As I have said in the past, I *do* buy books for their covers, and having met the artist, Sonia Hillios, at Shore Leave at the very time she had finished painting this one, well, I just had to have it when I saw it for sale.But unless you simply must have a complete set of TNG paperbacks or adore the covers like I do, you can skip this one and not be any worse for it.That having been said, I hope Dean gets a chance to try again, because I like the idea of Dixon Hill, and I'm sure Dean does, too."},{"Title":"A Hard Rain (Star Trek The Next Generation)","review":"Hard Rain was a very disappointing book.

The article showed how methane can be generated from water and carbonate rock when the applied pressure is equal to that found in the mantle.Gold's book describes research done largely by Russians and Ukrainians on the origin of oil, which has been shamefully discounted and ignored in the West. The Western dogma, he claims, is just another one of those things that nearly everyone believes, but is wrong.I love books like this. It opens up a whole new world of important ideas and questions that need to be addressed, and make the scientific dogmatists who have \\"proved\\" their hypothesis by superficial reasoning from the most meager of data, coupled with proof by endless repetition, look as foolish as the geologists who rejected continental drift, or the idiots who still revere Freudian psychoanalysis.Evidence that he presents is pretty convincing and is a good example of how many diverse lines of evidence can make the convergence on the truth inevitable. Many of the pieces of evidence were quite unknown to the formulators of the \\"fossil fuel\\" dogma who emphasize the limited reserves available for extraction. The composition of the gas giant planets with their tremendous quantities of methane can be used to plausibly argue for primordial gas on earth as well. The increasing realization among petroleum geologists that at least some petroleum reservoirs are being filled from below is startling news to many readers. The biological \\"markers\\" seen in petroleum are introduced by bacteria to petroleum on its migration toward the surface provide an alternative and plausible explanation of the facts. That Ukraine generates a third of its oil from reservoirs below all sedimentary rock is astounding.As a physicist at the corporate research labs of a major oil company, I've sat through many presentations of petroleum exploration experts with their tables of C13 data, interpreted as signs of age and origins of oil, and I even then recognized the signs of smoke and mirrors. I only wish I'd read Gold earlier...Gold's book is also concerned with many other aspects of the consequences of the presence of biology deep within the earth that are just as intriguing. That microbes exist deep in the earth and have a life style entirely independent from photosynthetic energy from the sun is an idea that is only now beginning to be accepted by some of the more daring Western petroleum engineers. Russians have known this for more than fifty years. The idea that better earthquake predictions can be made, and that fossil fuel reserves are much greater than publicized in the popular press, are big, important ideas that would have tremendous political impact if true.I very much enjoyed Gold's style of writing, which is clear and straightforward, and the story he tells is a very important one, deserving of much more attention and research. The book has a gratifying number of illustrations and is well organized. The notes give a good introduction to the scientific literature on the subject, but I think some criticism can be leveled at Gold for writing as though he had been a major discoverer of many of the pieces of evidence, when he is actually playing more of a role as a popularizer for the findings of the Russians and others. But reviewers, and even popularizers, are not to be sneered at. They play an important and honorable role in the progress of science--Gold does an outstanding job here. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"This is a very well written book. It presents a sequence of inter-related arguments suggesting radical re-thinking of the source of oil and gas on earth, the causes of earthquakes, and the origins of life. The arguments are consistent and to me, with no formal training in chemistry, physics or geology, convincing. What persuaded me most, was the way Gold's arguments tie-in with other research which correlate the discovery of oil and gas deposits with impact craters from asteroids, and many recent reports of new life forms in caves, in rocks, and under the sea. Life forms that thrive independently of solar energy. I have two reasons for giving this book a four star rating, instead of a five star rating. First, geologists I have talked to about the book have presented counter-arguments that might have been foreseen by Gold and answered in this book. (Those arguments have not convinced me Gold is wrong.) Second, the book would have been stronger if Gold had tied in the research I mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph. Still, Gold is only one man! And he writes much better than I do. Buy the book if you are willing to think outside the box."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"Thomas Gold has written a real eye-opener: Oil and gas, and even black coal, derive from primordial hydrocarbons buried deep in the Earth, dating back to the Earth's formation. He convinced me before I was a third-way through the book. It is beautifully argued, by a world-renowned scientist, who has been working on this origins problem for more than 20 years. If you think that oil and gas come from decomposed organic matter, as the standard explanation has it, then think again -- or better yet, let Thomas Gold walk you through the issues from top to bottom, and let the scales of error fall from your eyes.Besides hydrocarbons, Thomas Gold also has some very enlightening things to say about earthquakes (chapter 8). The quality of Gold's book, and the magnitude of its enlightening content, reminds me of &quot;Inventing the AIDS Virus&quot; by Peter Duesberg, which I read a few months ago, and which I found similarly enlightening, albeit on an unrelated subject. Both men are gurus: dispellers of darkness. And as with Duesberg's book, the explanatory content in &quot;The Deep Hot Biosphere&quot; is very good: you do not have to be a chemist or geologist or biologist to understand the book: specialist terminology is explained in context as needed."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"The phrase \`paradigm shift' gets thrown around pretty loosely these days, but this book represents the real thing. For many years Thomas Gold has been the prime proponent of a theory that, if true, would change many commonly accepted theories in both geology and biology. In short, he believes that &quot;fossil fuels' are generated be deep, underground methane sources that feed a vast subterranean biosphere of bacteria. If Gold is right, a lot of what we have been teaching for the last century is wrong. This is the kind paradigm shift that, literally, would require that the text books be rewritten. Scientists will not accept it unless the evidence is overwhelming. Gold recognizes this and he supports his theory with a great deal of evidence representing several independent lines of reasoning. In my mind, he succeeds in making his case. I opened the book as a skeptic, but I am now convinced that Gold is probably right. I look forward to watching the new consensus emerge."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"I am very impressed with 'The Deep Hot Biosphere.&quot; Dr. Gold (an iconoclast, it seems) boldly rethinks some very basic assumptions about the formation, and role of, oil, coal, and natural gas. These are not, he says, (with the exception of some soft coals &amp; peat) produced by decaying vegetable matter and dead sea creatures but are pre-existent in the earth and modified by such geological processes as heat, pressure, and chemical oxidation. Some vested interests will not like his conclusions.His theory of earthquakes, too, flies in the face of conservative paradigms and is a useful adjunct to explain those earthquakes that traditional theories have difficulty with (such as the devestating New Madrid quakes of 1811-12.) The book looks at the very interesting evidence of bacteria happily living deep in the earth's crust, possibly larger in biomass than all above-ground life put together. Was this where life on earth began? And if it did, what's to stop similar organisms from living on other planets, even in our own solar system? Throughout, the book is, refreshingly, clearly written and not at all plodding or condescending."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"Multinational oil companies use microbes that feed on oil to break up oil spills by digesting oil. Evidently the fossil fuel myth is just for public consumption. Gold tells us in this book that Vietnam's White Tiger oil field is producing oil from basement rock, and that hundreds of holes have been drilled down to oil and gas found in basement rock in Russia(Tatarstan), Canadian Shield, and Swedish Siljan Shield.Even if it is at this time difficult to produce oil or gas from basement rock in most instances, due to the depth of wells, the discovery of oil welling up from below sedimentary rock frees us from the fossil fuel myth. Reserve calculations for oil and gas fields are based on the false assumption that those resources are fixed pockets of fossil fuel, rather than waystations for oil and gas welling up from below. We can stop cannibalizing each other for oil according to the fossil fuel propaganda, and we should not allow gasoline to be priced as if in blood.Fascinating reading...microbes freeing oxygen from iron oxide(leaving magnetite, marking accessible oil for us) so they can oxidize petroleum as food, cells surviving at temperatures high enough to make steam because steam cannot form at such pressure."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"My family has been in the oil business almost since it began. Being a very curious person, I received satisfactory explanations on every aspect of the business with one exception; how oil was created. I have never believed that crude oil came from dinosaurs and plants. Everyone else seems to believe it but I didn't and so I looked for a more satisfactory explanation. That is how I came upon Mr. Golds book. His theory on the origin of oil is so compelling and answers so many questions, I have few doubts he will be proven correct in the future. In looking at this problem from so many different disciplines, he can see things that most people just cannot see."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"An iconoclstic book threatens everything we knew about oil and its origins[Disclaimer: I am not a creationist. Nor am I a supporter of its fake twin, intelligent design.]This book could easily be titled, \\"Everything You Want to Know About the Formation of Oil, But Were Afraid to Ask - Is Wrong!\\" Is the author correct, or is he a bit too much of a flake on this issue? Gold died in 2004, but he certainly had the credentials (though I don't set a lot of store in those, necessarily). He was a member of the American Academy of Science, and a member of The Royal Society. You can't get any higher than those, unless you count the Nobel Prize.So, what is he claiming? That oil isn't formed by swamps from the Permean Age settling their leaves, layer by layer, then getting compressed over millenia. He claims that what we learned in science class about salt domes is not where oil is found. Oh, oil was found there, but those were the easy locations. It has, he claims, been found in all kinds of other geological structures, and he is right about that. But most of us don't know that, do we? But the oil geologists do know it. The geological structures in which oil is found now are all over the map, literally and figuratively. No one existing theory can tell us why that is so, but in this book Gold tries to.The status quo tries to explain oil showing up in other places - places it shouldn't BE - by speculating (and it IS only speculation) - that it migrates sideways, sometimes for many, many miles, from the (speculated) \\"right\\" places to the (actual) \\"wrong\\" places, where the oil geologists manage to wander upon it.Gold's physics I cannot verify for sure, because I am not up on all of it. but what I CAN understand sounds good to me. I am a mechanical engineer, so I can have at least a semi-informed opinion, and to me it sounds at least worth looking into.In the long view, whichever theory is correct will show out in the end, won't it? It may be 100 years, or it may be 200 years, but either the existing theory will prove out, or we will continue to find oil in places it \\"shouldn't\\" be (including our \\"depleted\\" oil fields).I particularly like Gold's expansion of the argument to coal. Coal was laid down - so we are told - in essentially the same method as we are told oil was - swamps, layer-upon-layer, decaying, pressure, heat, time, etc. Lots of time. LOTS of time. But it all started out with swamps. Or did it? Then why - cutting diagonally across what is supposed to be tens and hundreds of thousands of years of layers of coal - are there tree trunks, spanning all those years? Heck, just the roots are projecting across a thousand years or more - what held the tree up all that time, while the layers formed around it? And why didn't it decay in all that time?Why do I like this part? Because I have seen this myself. Am I imagining this? Am I misreading what my eyes told me? No, that was almost countless years of layers of coal, and that was one tree - intact - slicing through all those layers of \\"time\\". How did it happen? I don't know, but I do know that there is no way that that coal formed like they claim, not with that tree there. The tree would be turned to dust or mold long before 1/100th of those layers were laid down. Maybe the layers don't represent time, after all. But if not, then what DO they represent? I honestly don't know...As to oil, Gold's theory, if correct, would have one hell of an impact on our thinking.How so?Well, if Gold is correct, and swamps from the Permean are not the source of oil, but it is created continually, down in the earth's mantle, THEN WE DON\\"T RUN THE RISK OF RUNNING OUT OF OIL - AND ALL PREDICTIONS OF PEAK OIL ARE WRONG.Let me repeat that, for the casual reader:There is a top scientist who is on record as saying that oil is NOT non-renewable. That actually would mean that it IS renewable. And that means our polluting can keep on going, I guess! (That was a joke...)Gold also does us all a big favor in pointing out something that almost no one knows:When oil fields are depleted, they sometimes re-fill with oil.When someone first told me this, I was incredulous. But if it is true, what does that mean?......I don't agree with everything Gold says. Toward the end of this book, Thomas Gold overextends his ideas a little bit, getting a bit too ambitious for his theory, IMHO, but who can blame him?I give the book a 95 out of 100."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this book. It is not just a window into the Earth, but a window into the sources of organic compounds in carbonaceous meteorites, the early history of &quot;Fox Holes&quot; in the asteroid parent bodies, even the conditions on (and under) Mars - to say nothing of Europa, Ganymede, Enceladus, Titan, and beyond. Some of his ideas are downright creepy, but as every one of his colleagues will attest, during his lifetime Thomas Gold has been right about too many creepy things to ever be dismissed out of hand."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"I was very impressed Dr. Gold's crisp and persuasive arguments for the deep and non-biological origin of petroleum. Dr. Gold pictures the greater part of the Earth's biosphere infiltrating the rocks of the upper crust, where autotrophic bacteria feed on virtually limitless upwelling hydrocarbons from the planet's interior -- a hypothesis that culminated in the fascinating \\"Siljan\\" experiment in 1987, in which tens of millions of dollars were invested drilling a 5-mile well into the granite of Switzerland in search of non-biological hydrocarbons. Dr. Gold states that crude oil and other hydrocarbons were recovered from rocks where conventional geology said they could not exist. Unfortunately, this may not meet Carl Sagan's threshold of \\"extraordinary evidence,\\" since his work seems to have been largely ignored by modern geologists. Nevertheless, this tightly reasoned and polished book made a believer out of me. Among other fascinating statements, Dr. Gold believes the world's oil reserves are actually slowly \\"recharging,\\" and that life originated within the Earth's crust. I certainly recommend this book to anybody with an interest in oil, geology or the origin of life.-- Auralgo"},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"The author outlined his book on NPR and it sounds very important. (He has made predictions before which were borne out by further research.)Gold argues:Petroleum contains helium -- why? The only possible explanation is that it percolated up through miles of rock, gathering dispersed helium as it went. The organic components of petroleum came from BELOW, not above.A few miles down a microbic anoxic heat-loving biosphere existed before life on the surface -- in fact generated life on the surface of the planet, and will regenerate oil stocks eventually. It is probably a typical component of planets of earth's size.Interesting, no?I hope it doesn't mean we are stuck with the internal combustion engine forever, though!"},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"Thomas Gold's book is highly intriguing and worth the effort to absorb. Since it was first published, field research has confirmed the Earth does have a deep, hot microbial ecosystem that extends as far as observations have gone to date. Several recent lines of field and laboratory evidence support the contention that some portion of Earth's hydrocarbons are formed by non-biological processes. In my opinion he pushes his thesis past the bounds of accepted evidence by suggesting that little, if any of the known oil and natural gas deposits were formed by the deep burial of surface organisms in sedimentary rock formations. Until much more definitive evidence is available, a model that allows for hydrocarbons of biological and nonbiological origin provides the best fit for all of the evidence. Most of the fascination with this book seems to stem from its implication that commercially exploitable oil deposits will not dwindle in the forseeable future and therefore everybody can continue driving huge gas-wasting vehicles and spewing pollutants into the atmosphere with wild abandon. Gold's one weakness is that he fails to mention the obvious and serious consequences of unchecked burning of fossil fuels: worsening air pollution and more risk of disastrous impacts of climate change. This book does not make me want to buy a Hummer and leave it idling all night because oil will never run out, but unfortunately it appears to send this message to some people. A more sober, forward-thinking and responsible approach to reading this book is that regardless of the source and magnitude of oil deposits on Earth the consequences of continued and massive combustion of oil will have a far greater impact on future generations than than a 30 cent difference in the price of gasoline in 2050."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"I have known Dr. Gold for approximately 20 years. During this time I have written several articles for newsstand periodicals based on his work and writings. My most recent series of articles provides a discussion of how The Deep Hot Biosphere furthers the a-biogenic theory of planetary hydrocarbon formation (i.e. petroleum, coal and methane). Since publication of my articles, I have been overwelmed by reader contacts providing everything from clarifications to praise. I went to great pains to reduce the high science presented by Dr. Gold into a practical discussion regarding the abundance of the world's hydrocarbon energy supplies : There is alot more available than originally/continuously promoted by politicians, environmentalists and petroleum geologists; all of whom have relied on the BIOgenic theory of the 1870's era. Although seemingly unrelated to geopolitics, I encourage readers of all walks and persuasions to read The Deep Hot Biosphere. For those interested in my articles, please start with my October 1999 article The Origins of Oil, in Today's SUV magazine."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"As a geoscientist of 30 years, and one who was involved in the use of soil hydrocarbons, helium, stable isotopes, and microbes in exploring for oil and gas, I found the book thought provoking and interesting. Gold tied together a lot of loose ends, and zeroed in on all the areas in which our understanding of the formation and occurrence of petroleum breaks down.I used to teach classes in the petroleum system, and there are areas that you simply have to wave your arms when describing things. Topics like explusion and migration. The industry has always taken it as an article of faith that oil moves from point A, where it was generated from organic material, usually marine amorphous kerogen, not dinosaurs or fish, as some people believe, and is squeezed out and migrates underground along \\"fairways\\" to a trap which if everything is right, forms a reservoir. The trouble is we have never discovered a fairway, where you would expect to find traces of the migrated petroleum. We point to shaley source rocks as the potential source for petroleum. We say that the oil is squeezed out of the shale to be trapped elsewhere. But no one can answer the question at to how the oil moves from the very non permiable shale, the very same characteristic that makes extracting oil from plentiful oil shales so difficult. No matter, we just wave our arms and evoke the Geologic God of the Gaps and have faith that it just happened the way we think it did. Gold was right, this aspect of petroleum science has all the characteristics of religious dogma.As a geologist who was schooled at a time when the Geosynclinal Theory of Mountain Building was being taught and Plate Tectonics was another \\"interesting\\" idea, I know what it is like to see a paradigm shift. Today we accept that Plate Tectonics is \\"the\\" correct answer, just as we once accepted another was the \\"right\\" one. We just could not explain the mechanism for the geosyncline deformation and the upthrusting of sediments or the intense volcanic activity in evidence. We just accepted there was something that caused it. Some great unseen and at the time, unfathomable force. Well eventually two and two were put together. Today Plate Tectonics is understood to be that force and Geosynclinal Theory has been encorporated into a much better understood overall conceptual understanding of which it is only one part. It took the overarching idea of shifting plates in the Earth's crust to tie together all the loose ends.We waved our arms a lot back then, just as we do now. The fact is, so long as we can continue to find oil using today's understanding, there is no real need or impetus to search for what might be the true origin of hydrocarbons. While I was doing research for a major oil company, more than a few of my PhD colleagues who had a penchant for getting distracted in pursuit of interesting topics unrelated to their assigned duties, were reminded by their employers that we were first and foremost an petroleum company, and that their activities should be confined to doing research in areas that would make the company money. If they wanted to do \\"science projects\\" they should go back to academia or government service. Some of them did. In the end, that was it and all about it.Only when the prevailing dogmatic ideas cease to be effective, will there be a push to expand our understanding of those gray areas. Depending on your point of view, Gold either died too soon and became a martyr of sorts, or died at the right time, never to see his ideas discredited, as without him to promote an alternative, dogmatists will just let them languish in obscurity without the need to take the effort to disprove him. Maybe one day, his ideas will be proven out, but it won't be by academia, as they do not have the funds to drill multi million dollar wells, and the petroleum companies don't either, at least not for science projects, at least not now."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"As a geologist familiar with the traditional theories about accumulations of oil and related gases in structural domes, I was skeptical of Gold's theories. But the more I read, the more I became convinced his explanations of facts that went unaccounted for using the old theories had some merit. Of course, the only problem with his theory is that we will never be able to prove it. To prove it we would have to drill at least 200 kilometers down into the earth. But his five assumptions are valid and not disproveable. Plus, I read a recent newspaper article that scientists have found evidence of a deep unidentified source of methane gas. As a scientist you can poo poo it, but hey, wait until all evidence comes in, at least give the author that much respect.

I am amazed that, at the age of 36, I am just now hearing his theories.To those who choose to dismiss his thesis, I ask you to present your own, more plausible argument. As scientists require that experimental results be successfully replicated before &quot;buying into&quot; a theory, the fact, as Gold states it, that no oil, coal or diamonds have been produced in the laboratory according to the &quot;compressed and heated organic matter&quot; theory, greatly supports his argument that these materials have an abiogenic origin.If true, the raw material costs for these fuels collapses, completely changing the industries' business models and, on the flip side, reinvigorates the need for pollution and greenhouse gas controls as consumption no doubt will increase."},{"Title":"The Deep Hot Biosphere","review":"Gold is far-seeing even when his vision is not recognized by other scientists.

Having also acquired oil and gas leases over granitic terrain in the past, and having also scratched my head considerably over puzzles such as the ubiquitous graphite in metamorphic intrusive terrains, it was with great interest and sometimes a sense of shared experience that I read this book. Although it was strange reading about an outsider's (non-geologist) reasoning and observational processes about hydrocarbons in rock and the origin of life, Thomas Gold has all the instincts of a good field geologist who uses his brain and scientific education to imagine the history of the earth.Notwithstanding the advances in understanding and analytical techniques that have happened since this book was published, many of the same questions remain unanswered.

Also, he seems to contradict himself at times.However, through all this he weaves a great story of alternative theories for petroleum formation, earthquakes and even the origins of life. Is he right? Is he crazy? Keep in mind that throughout the years, Gold has developed theories that at the time were at right angles to conventional thought, and on more than one occasion he was correct.For those of us not in the petroleum business the book will make you think. Despite its technical nature it is readable. For those within the geology and petroleum industry the book may be considered as heresy. If you think Gold is wrong, base that opinion on counter arguments to his new theories, sighting what is wrong with his ideas.

In his view, this is from non-biogenic carbonaceous matter that accreted along with the rest of the planet. This book simply ties the hypothesis to recent discoveries of primitive, heat-loving organisms in boreholes extending down a couple of kilometres. Like any scientist, Gold selects his evidence, as is his privilege, but becomes more fanciful than anyone else would choose to and retain any credibility. It is not so much the evidence that he chooses, but the vast amount which he ignores. Among this is the growing realization that the Earth underwent a stupendous impact shortly after it formed, shedding a mass of incandescent rock vapour that gave birth to the Moon, and perhaps allowed the Earth's core to separate from the mantle. The last gave the mantle an oxidizing nature. Far more probably than Gold's hypothesis, the early Earth may have been completely molten at temperatures far in excess of those thought to pertain now. Both consequences spell an unlikely survival for abundant carbon-hydrogen compounds in the deep Earth. This is not a book for those scientists prone to apoplexy, nor for lay readers who wish to see the full breadth of knowledge.

Speaking as a geologist, we actually do have a clear understanding of how oil, gas and coal (e. g., Hypersea) form. The reason most oil is found in the Middle East is because of ancient oceanic productivity in the Tethyan seaway resulting from marine upwelling during the Mesozoic. Gold's thesis is therefore unnecessary. I edited the English translation of Vladimir Vernadsky's book The Biosphere. Vernadsky tells us that there is indeed a Deep Hot Biosphere. It has formed, however, by bacteria moving downward, not by organisms coming up from the the earth's interior where temperatures and pressures make life impossible.

Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is mistaken for a government agent when he is kidnapped by two mysterious men in the beginning. Then, he is on the run for his life, and even the police soon are after him for they believed he killed a prestigious member of the United Nations. Now is your chance to own this fabulous book containing the screenplay. Makes a great gift for film enthusiasts or anyone who loves to read a suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"When Eight Bells Toll","review":"\\"The Peacemaker Colt has now been in production, without change in design, for a century.\\" An inciteful beginning to MacLean's first tale in three years, after Lawrence of Arabia: A Biography (he also released Ice Station Zebra in '63). This sentence is a perfect example of the humor (you'll know it's humor soon enough) MacLean writes into our hero's personality.While I've noticed MacLean's first-person narratives contain fair amounts of his dry wit, When Eight Bells Toll is the first book of his that has made me laugh out loud on several occasions. My favorite part was when Philip Calvert, the hero, is running through trees in a heavy downpour, and he can't see where he is going, so he keeps running into trees. His thoughts as this is happening is simply a delight to read! A British secret service agent with a sense of humor.Of course, MacLean's book is not all laughable. Calvert and his boss must figure out why ships and their crews are disappearing - and each vessel had been carrying valuable cargo. I enjoyed reading Captain Imrie's doppelganger (he's a far nicer character in Bear Island).MacLean isn't afraid of killing off characters. And he throws in the usual dash of twists to toss the reader off his seat, although it has fewer than some of his other books. The book is also loaded with exposition. I found myself dragging my eyeballs over some of the pages, unfortunately.While the book kept me guessing to the very end -- and you're guessing about an extraordinary amount of things -- I didn't feel it was MacLean's strongest work. This is on a sliding scale, of course, as I feel MacLean's tales are more complex in design and more realistic than many modern books published today.The title refers to seafaring vessels and crew who keep track of time by ringing bells. Eight bells represents six different hours of the day, one of which is midnight. Of the time-span each chapter represents, I noticed chapter six (8:40 pm - 10:40 pm) is the only chapter that takes place between the three bells and six bells of the first (evening) watch, meaning eight bells never \\"toll\\" during this chapter. Unrelated, but interesting to note, is that a Christian church will ring a bell nine times for the death of someone.Mr. MacLean also slightly rewrote the story for the 1971 film with Anthony Hopkins."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup to Inspire the Body & Soul: Motivation and Inspiration for Living and Loving a Healthy Lifestyle (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Another in the long line of Chicken Soup books, and as such, a bit predictable.

He wishes that he--not the painting--will remain forever young and beautiful, while the painting ages and decays. Dorian's wish comes true and it is the painting that not only shows his age, but also all his sins. Oscar Wilde crafted not only a brilliant horror novel, but also a treatise on art and reality. Despite the claims of Lord Henry, art does reveal the truths of life. The painting reveals the true soul of Dorian Gray. When Dorian's beloved actress discovers true love (not the dramatic imitation), she is no longer able to participate in the elevated dramas on the stage. Then she loses Dorian's love. A book is what fully corrupts Dorian and causes him to live a life of sin. This is a story of the inability to bring truth and art together. This is one of the greatest books to do the often over-used theme of appearance vs. reality.

I never did, but thought I would give it a try as I really enjoy dry British wit and intelligent prose. Beyond that, I wasn't sure what else I was expecting, but for my tastes, I didn't end up entirely satisfied.The opening 10 or 20 pages insinuated themselves into my imagination and I felt that I would be entertained by the main characters throughout the rest of the novel. The detailed descriptions of the lovely country setting and extravagant flowers gives one an impression of decadence and a high society jadedness that I somehow expected from Oscar Wilde, having read none of his previous work. Unfortunately, the remainder of the novel didn't hold as much pleasure for me.Dorian Grey is a relatively uninteresting central character who is but a blank canvas for Lord Henry to experiment upon; Dorian's own thoughts and musings are not so compelling in and of themselves and yet we are treated to quite a few pages of them throughout. Lord Henry himself is an interesting character whose mean-spiritedness, which approaches evil in some instances, is obscured by his verbose bantering on half-baked, jaundiced observations on Victorian life. These also consume considerable paper stock, and as witty as his musings start out (his thoughts on marriage were particularly humorous to me), they start to run together and become somewhat of a misshapen lump through which I felt I was slogging at times.Anyway, the story is relatively well known to most at this point, regardless of whether you have read the book in question or not. It progresses more or less as one might assume, which is not entirely a bad thing (I would not classify this tale as a mystery or as a horror novel, a genre to which I see it is sometimes curiously attributed). Oscar Wilde is definitely saying something here, and there seem to be many elements of allegory contained within the story. I have read that he saw parts of himself within all three of the main characters, and they do seem to represent different facets of a single personality. Unfortunately these same characters are hamstrung by this very fact, as they each seem only part of a personality, part of a character, and not well rounded or believable in their motivations or actions.This is the first Oscar Wilde I have attempted to read, and I won't say it is my last, but there are classics of English literature which are as well written, more engrossing, and, in the end, more memorable, at least to this reader (\\"Silas Marner\\" comes to mind as a fine book I only just recently read for the first time as well).So, overall, about 3 stars from me. In my opinion it poses some interesting questions, sparkles in a few spots, and held my attention for a few hours, but it's not something I would return to or recommend for pleasurable reading.As a side note, I am somewhat surprised by the criticisms of the homoerotic nature of the relationships portrayed within the novel. Wilde portrayed the passionate nature of what amounts to a love triangle in a very effective (if slightly florid) way, and, as has been noted before, the relationships between the men seem more genuine and believable than those involving the fairer sex. Maybe this type of undertone would be out of place in a Hemingway novel but good grief it's Oscar Wilde! Scratch beneath the surface and read about where this man was coming from and the times in which he lived and worked."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I read this book(translated to the portuguese), here in Brazil about twenty years ago.Being writen in XIX century, this novel remains a classic book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's literary genious is evident throughout.

So beautiful, in fact, that only the best artists can capture his charisma and perfection in a painting. When Dorian looks into the eyes of a portrait of himself, he is overcome with jealousy. Jealousy of the eternal youth and beauty of the masterpiece; youth and beauty which will one day vanish from Dorian Gray's perfect face.It is at this moment that Dorian makes a wish to stay beautiful forever, while the painting ages in his stead. However, his youth corrupts him, a corruption which can be seen on the face of his painting. Beauty, which was once Dorian's greatest attribute, may become Dorian's greatest flaw.Oscar Wilde wonderfully paints the story of The Picture of Dorian Gray. His simple language and sentence structures makes the story easy to read and follow, yet adds a certain level of depth to the plot. The character of Dorian Gray instantly captures the attention of the reader, and Dorian's development throughout the story provides a deeper significance to the novel.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a timeless classic, relating the tale of a young man whose wish to be forever young becomes the greatest mistake he has made in his eternal life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is simply amazing.

His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe. The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old. It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now. A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a quick, easy and enjoyable read. I knew the very basic premise of the story from watching the 2003 movie, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I also had a lot of wrong preconceived notions because of the the movie.The Picture of Dorian Gray was less supernatural in nature than I expected. Other than not aging and having the picture age for him, Dorian was a regular guy. When given the opportunity to live his life without his behavior marring his beauty, he chose debauchery. I found myself thinking, who wouldn't? He tried to experience everything the world has to offer (a noble pursuit) and finds that life can become pointless without boundaries.Dorian's friend, Harry, is the absolute shining star of this novel. He counsels Dorian in the way of the world, full of his own theories and cynical viewpoints. He's humorous and more often than not, what he says makes a lot of sense.The one thing I disliked about The Picture of Dorian Gray was that it seemed like the most interesting pieces of the story were missing. Oscar Wilde was very vague about exactly why Dorian actually did in the years he spent corrupting his soul. People who were once his friends couldn't stand to be in the same room as him and no explanation was given. Perhaps in 1890, when the book was published, saying that he did vile, cruel, disgusting things was enough. Now, 120 years later, I need more. I need to know and it still bugs me that I don't know what Wilde was alluding to."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Beautiful and lyrical told with biting wit.

I AM ALSO A HUGE BEN BARNES FAN"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals.

The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read. Baffling."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better.

Of the three main characters we have; Dorian Gray, who is a brainless puppet the personifies vanity; Basil Hallward, the artist who painted the fabled portrait and represents the sorrowful conscience; and Lord Henry Wolton, who is the quintessential 19th Century fop whose sole purpose in the book is to act as Wilde's voice on politics, religion and homosexuality and as a driving corrupter of everyone else in the book.The pacing is horrendously slow, the chapters devoted to explaining Gray's hobbies and the pictures of his ancestors in his hallway don't help with the lousy pacing.

It was written in a style of gentle prose that was easy to read, and it did put forth at least a few interesting concepts. On the whole though, the ideas in this book were utterly ridiculous and totally lacking in any true depth. They appear to me to be the vain ramblings of a man consumned in his own deepness, thereby proving how shallow he truly was. I would liken this book to a picture in which detailing, shading, and general looks are pleasing, but the perspective is off, ruining the whole picture. So perhaps you would enjoy this book if you are looking for a few ideas and smart sayings put together in a seemingly random, and almost chaotic order."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Every so often one has the good fortune of discovering an author whose work reaffirms all that is appreciable in literature by exemplifying its worst. Oscar Wilde, after reading whose novel and two fairy tales, quickly obviates any further need or desire to be further acquainted. The knowledge found on the cover of my paperback edition, between the obligatory sickly hagiography that usually betrays the expectation it inspires, that The Picture of Dorian Gray was apparently the author's only fruitful attempt at a \`full-length' novel, leaves one snickering ante facto in not entirely facetious gratitude. Wilde was seemingly more at home in the realm of fairy tales, and this 217-page full-length novel not by itself finding ground to fill the space between the covers, finds itself supported by three samples of that genre.One might be forgiven for assuming that the novel portends to explore an emotional or philosophical metaphor of a relationship between the eponymous painting and its subject, but the implied exploration is unfortunately mostly specious. The metaphor, to be sure, is there, but it is a mere seed that never takes root or grows out of its entirely obvious and superficial form, and the story thus fails to fulfil its promise.Furthermore, the filling leaves one with a bad aftertaste. None of the three characters have any endearing features to redeem themselves for the gall they otherwise freely spew. \`Lord Henry' in particular has no characterizing dimension other than denigration of everything else in the form of dull pseudowitticisms, from which comparison we take it the aristocrat was intended to benefit. We learn his contempt of clergy (bishops \\"don't think\\"), stockbrokers (\\"even a stock-broker can gain a reputation for being civilized\\"), dowagers (they are \\"overdressed\\"), academicians (tedious), the middle class (not modern), Americans, marriage, women, and Jews (I don't believe any mention of the religion ever lacks the adjective \\"fat\\"). The misogyny in particular is so pungent and the female characters so weak that the protagonists cannot otherwise but treat them with the contempt that they do. If indeed \\"women are decorative\\" it is merely because the men do not have a vision that sees beyond superficialities. This is no parody of aristocratic vanity (in the style of Thackeray, for instance) so one quickly finds oneself wishing for one of these maligned targets of Lord Henry's dull wit to return the favor with a dull but well-deserved kick in the [rump].When the characters are not railing against the world, they are theorizing about it, but the obvious inconsistencies and utter inanity of the theories make them impossible to consider seriously. To give an example, and not have one character take the brunt of all the book's failings, the artist Basil Hallward states first (speaking of his own work) that \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter,\\" but six pages later that \\"an artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them.\\" A story dealing ostentatiously with a profound relationship between ars and artis, in which the artist doesn't remember from one moment to the next whether or not he put feeling in his art, reveals that its author has lost control of his subject. Othertimes the theories are merely silly and quite impossible to take at face value. What to make, for example, of the idea that \\"beauty is a form of genius- is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation,\\" or that \\"people say sometimes that beauty is superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.\\" This is just tripe without considerable meaning.Within this theorizing there are faint reverberations reaching toward some oblique philosophy of hedonism, but never quite advancing beyond a mere slogan. Without actually doing the work of fully expounding the philosophy, or having the courage to fully sound its implications, in the way that for example de Sade did, the author cannot reasonably expect us to sympathize or find the actions of his characters anything but wholly unsatisfying and their reactions rather balmy.Wilde quite clearly has no desire (charitably assuming it is not from a lack of potential) to prepare and construct a plot. One of the adjunct characters, Jim, whose sister Sibyl later commits suicide over the protagonist, finds out he is a bastard son, his mother was orphaned, and forgives her (what for, we are left to guess), all within the space of three quarter page. Dorian's swings of attitude toward Sybil from ignorance through love through despisement through sorrow to self-forgiveness are so extreme and irrational that they make a pastiche of emotion. Jim's completely unfounded anger toward Dorian is so unrealistically sudden and out of proportion that it is obvious how Jim's fears will be realized and that there will be a confrontation. There is no mystery, less a sense of a world to discover than of being dragged along by an uninterested parent. The rhetorical questions Dorian asks in his histrionic despair are answered immediately, it is for me simply to get in, sit down, shut up, and hold on.Even more fundamentally, the characters are shallow, undeveloped, and quite stereotypical, the dialog stilted and unrealistic- altogether a surprisingly unsophisticated style, especially in the light of the beautiful writing of his contemporaries. Dialog has a tendency to spin off into unrelated tangents that are unceremoniously and artificially \`snapped back' to the main thread. Henry's inability to speak in any other form than witless aphorism is at first merely unfunny, then quickly boring, later irritating, and finally not bearing further reading. And this is unfortunately barely the only character development in the story at all, the only other characters having little strength of will of their own to resist mimicking this trite ascerbicism.If the book has revealed anything at all, it is not a deeper analysis of art or hedonism, but a much more animal homoeroticism. Dorian Gray is much more than anything else a love story with the trimmings (envy and a murder-suicide), and all the less respectful because it dares not speak its name. Female emotions are contemptible, but the same expressions of liking (Wilde can never bring himself to call it more), admiration of beauty, and extreme flattery by men towards other men, are accepted naturally and not subject to this contempt."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Well, I had to read this book for a school assignment. I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but I know I didn't get it. This book shows the true demoralization of our society- past and present. The absloute worst part of the book (about 90% of it) was the long, monotonous, verbose speeches that consisted of the characters'ideals that were just &quot;off the mark&quot; by a little. I would not suggest reading this book, partly because of the boring content, but mostly because of the fact that I still haven't found a plot."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The novel The Picture of Dorian Grey is an unoriginal story line with disturbing morals in which innocent people are corrupted. Written in the late 18th century by Oscar Wilde the novel is an example of homosexual fiction. While the sexual preference of the characters is never addressed it is often hinted at. Many of the morals presented in the novel are very disturbing. Harry presents his views in such a way as to make them seem right. He \\"preaches\\" on living a life for pleasure, and the sensations. He stresses that women are merely brainless playthings there to provide entertainment. His theory on remaining young is to repeat all your youthful sins. This is presenting a lifestyle of self-indulgence, in which material things bring happiness. Harry's corruption of Dorian leads to the corruption of many others. As Dorian begins to live as Harry has suggested he begins to use his influence over people to his advantage. He drives Sibyl Vane to her death, and also her brother who tries to seek revenge. Many close friends become outcasts because of his escalating bad reputation. In this story of twisted corruption, Basil Hallward is a very likely target for destruction. Had is not been for his adoration of Dorian then Harry never would have become interested in him. It becomes obvious that in order to be rid of all the mishaps Dorian must be rid of the originator. Basils death is almost obvious from the start. The main storyline, man sells soul for youth, is one used many times by several authors. It is based on a 15th century German magician Johann Faust. In his time he was considered a fake and a criminal. In the original Faustbook (1587), written by an unknown author, is a biography of Johann Faust in which he sells his soul to the devil Mephistopheles for 24 years in return for power, knowledge, and youth and finally goes to hell in terror. It is ironic that this is also approximately the same amount of time it takes Dorian to become fully corrupted and destroy the painting. All in all the book was a waste of time. With its disturbing morals and unoriginal storyline the book left something to be desired. It was often predictable and uneventful. This is not a book that I would recommend to other people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Please refer to page 212 of the Baronet Books version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.

Dorian Gray is a very dark work with drug use, murder, and depression. One of the main themes is homosexuality. It shocked and outraged the public when it was first realeased. It is scary. It scared me . Frankly, I doubt very much that many children would appreciate this book. Colleges study this book in literature classes. That's not to say no child would not get stuff from this book, but the few children that could would probably be just fine with the original work. Folks, stick to Treasure Island and White Fang for the kids. And if you want something kinda spooky, try Phantom of the Opera.

The writing is accessible, even to those who tend to dislike more old-styled English writing, and the plot is certainly among the greatest ideas in literature. However, the character of Lord Henry, who carries a great deal of the novel, often goes on seemingly unending rants of his views on life and they bring the book down quite a bit. With these discourses, the book loses development in favor of pseudo-philosophy in a clever if rough attempt to both attract and repulse the reader. There is a mid-chapter in the book that describes the middle of Dorian's life that is absolute work to make your way through. The philosophy of the book is important of course, but it's much better when the story lends itself for the purpose. Overall, for the brilliance of the idea of the story; it's required reading."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.Quotes:\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).\\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is the most decadent of all the English works in the canon of literature, I think.

As curiosity got the best of me, I finally looked this person up on the Internet. Finding that Dorian Gray was the main character of a most elaborate and interesting tale, enthralled me. Therefore, I set out to read this novel. From the preface alone, I was spellbound and couldn't put the book down.Lord Henry, with his quips and one-liners literally made me think twice. His tranquil ability to convince anyone of anything, sans Basil Hallward, amazed me. Although, I did find a few opinions of Lord Henry to ring true, for the most part I found myself thinking: \\"He's absolutely correct. Oh, wait! That's completely immoral and self-indulgent!\\" Needless to say, Lord Henry was my favorite character in the book.This book truly puts one's own life into perspective. It makes one think, and re-think of the importance of being true to only oneself without influence of others. As Lord Henry said it best: \\"Because to influence a person is to give him one's own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one's nature perfectly - that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself\\"."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I thought this book was amazing. While the writing for some might be difficult at first, the later chapter are the ones that capture the imagination. The morals of Lord Henry might seem somewhat selfish and shallow, but I guarantee his quotes will make their way back to reader's head. This is definitely the most influencial book I have read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of my favorite books. I've read it again and again. Just make sure you don't get an abridged version. Read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty and brilliant writer, and his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a treasure. One of it's best aspects is something another reviewer mislabeled as a flaw, that every viewpoint presented by Wilde is contradicted in another part of the book. This is absolutely brilliant. By building an entire book out of contradictions, the reader can take absolutely any message they want from the book, or no message at all. It meet Wilde's goal (if indeed anything Wilde said can be taken seriously - remember that the paradoxical Henry Wotton is basically a fictional version of Wilde) of \\"art for art's sake,\\" but it can just as easily be a morality tale for anyone that wants one. Henry Wotton can either be the worst kind of villain or a quite harmless and likeable chap who a dumb kid took too seriously.So read this book for it's witty and memorable dialogue, mostly from Henry Wotton. Read it for the shocking (at least at the time) tale of Dorian Gray. Read it for the myriad meanings you can take from it. Just don't skip it because it doesn't have one, consistent message. Anyone can write a message. It takes a genius to write a collection of messages that perfectly balance and disprove one another."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Of all the fears that creep into a man's heart,the most disturbing is the fear of one's own self. A man may evade the whole world but can't deny his conscience and as William Shakespeare remarks somewhere,\\"Conscience doth make coward of us all\\". One may accomlish painting goodliness on one's visage but would never be able to blend his soul in a similar fashion. The whispers of the soul about one's past sins and misdeeds keep lingering in one's heart.And that's precisely the theme of Oscar Wilde's only novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\". It is a telling tale about a stunningly handsome,almost beautiful,man's bizzare idiosyncracy of authoring his own tragic doom,about how a youth so splendidly bestowed with beauty,wealth,royalty and women could get sucked in by the myriad forces that he himself gave rise to,about a man's confused,complex frame of mind.Dorian Gray is that ultimate effigy of an ideal youth gifted with all arts and talents. He's the instinctive and eternal source of inspiration,\\"simply a motive in art\\" to his friend,artist Basil Hallward. The backdrop is the gentry and the royalty class of London during the late 19th. century and the Irish writer's genius lies in exploiting this landscape to picture in words and absolutely ethereal imageries man's obscure desires. Dorian becomes obsessed with his portrait traced by Basil and in the general flow of the tyde,conceives an unimaginable notion:to remain forever young whilst the portrait may wither! Indeed such a wish lurks deep inside everyone and so does the realisation o its fruitlessness. But for once,at least in fiction,the fantasy is translated into truth,a dark,troublesome truth.Evey novel,and for that matter every incident,requires a certain spark to unfold a series of actions to conglomerate into a rare item called literature. That urge in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is impelled by Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and witty man just ten years older than Dorian,whose eloquent gush of words \\"touched some secret chord\\" in Dorian's heart and sets it \\"vibrating and throbbing to curious impulses\\". The philosophies and crisp remarks by Lord Wotton about life in general and youth in particular push the youth onto his demise.Supernaturally Doian Gray's desire to remain young for good does manufacture itself into a fascinating reality but there's nothing called free lunch under the sun. Commencing from the time when Dorian turns an implicit murderer of his lover Sibyl Vane through the constant denudation of principles and character in the subsequent fourty or so years culminating in him murdering his friend Basil,Dorian stays protected under the shade of evergreen youth whilst his portrait consistently deteriorates and ages---it even turns a mirror of Dorian's own soul with dark contours signifying the crimes committed by him lining its entire figure and in his attempt to relieve himself of the picture,and with it his hideous sins,the eponymous potagonist brings about his own end.The theme of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is singled out to be about how we get disturbed by our own souls but there're other ideas webbed in as well. That the author Oscar Wilde had an inclination towards gay culture is of course a subtle truth and this is ever so slightly pictured in Basil Hallward's unassuming and suspicious admiration of Dorian. The general occurrences in the gentry society and invokation to women's feelings too are colossaly and humourously penned down superadded by a streak of confusing and often conflicting ideas of life that never falter.There was never really a Faust who sold his soul to the Devil but it was actually Goethe's authorical magic that made it seem so. There was never really a Dorian Gray who exchanged peace for youth but it's actually Oscar Wilde's staunch belief that \\"it is the spectator,and not life,that art really mirrors\\" that materialiases into a concrete portrayal of life in fiction. After reading Emile Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\",we rue that the authoress never composed any other novel and similarly after imbibing the charisma of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\",which just remains on the margins of a psychological insight into a man's nature,we regret that we can't lay our hands on another classic by this wonderful,wonderful writer."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Almost from the day that this novel was first published in serial form it has caused controversy and debate. It was immediately condemned as an immoral work that did not follow the custom of showing that evil deeds would in the end bring punishment to the evil doer. Just those evil deeds, which were acted out by Dorian Gray, were enough in themselves to scandalize Victorian society. Then, just as his novel was about to be published in book form Oscar Wilde added fuel to the fire by adding a preface that seemed to indicate that there was absolutely no hidden meaning or moral lesson to be found in this book. Apparently, according to the preface, it was simply art for the sake of art. The fires have raged ever since and I'm sure that the author's spirit has enjoyed every second of it.The fact is that the reader can read almost anything he wants to into this work and there have been almost as many interpretations as there have been readers. I found myself intrigued by a passage that is spoken very early in the book by the artist who has painted the now famous picture. This painter, Basil Hallward by name, tells a friend that, \\"every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.\\" Just what might this book have revealed about Oscar Wilde? Or could this book have been a dark commentary on London's high society of which Wilde does not paint a pretty picture? Maybe this book was indeed as written Wilde wrote in his preface and he had no deep purpose but just wanted to tell a good story. Better minds than mine have pondered this question and have arrived at no conclusive answer to the problem. I have however learned one important thing about this book as I have read it. That being that if one reads this book without worrying about it's implications they will find it a very enjoyable read.Dorian Gray is first introduced to the reader as a young man who was exquisitely handsome and wealthy but he had had a rough childhood. The thing he remembers most about the Grandfather who raised him in such a harsh manner was that he was old. This may well have played into what became of the young man although he would almost certainly not have sank to such depths of depravity had he not met Lord Henry Wotton. For the life of me I can not fathom what Dorian Gray saw in Lord Henry for he comes across as a loathsome, self-centered, tiresome know it all. Gray however becomes enamored of Wotton however and slowly adopts Wotton's theories of pleasing oneself no matter the consequences to others.The real change begins in Gray after an act of particular curliness for which he is already feeling sorry when he arrives home. It is not long until he notices a change in his recently finished portrait, a portrait that was in the beginning as handsome as Gray but suddenly was marred by a cruel mouth. Gray couldn't believe his eyes but suddenly it dawns on him that this picture will bear the scars of his sins and of the passing years. He himself will remain forever young and beautiful no matter how he conducts his life. As I mentioned above, some critics bemoaned the lack of punishment for Gray's acts but I found that there were indeed consequences for his actions. By the end of the book, Gray has become almost mad from the knowledge of his sins and actually seems to long for death. The very picture that has given him eternal youth haunts his every thought for he knows that the picture shows the wretched condition of his soul. That is about all that I believe I can say without giving away the ending and I hate people who do that.Overall I enjoyed this book but Wilde's characters were given to long tedious philosophical pronouncements that only added to my detestation of these pompous blow hards. I can't say that I would rank this book among the all time classics and much of the time the reader will not be able to locate a plot with a team of bloodhounds. Still, if you can get through the dry areas there is often a rich oasis waiting on the other side."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde's only novel contains some of the greatest dialogue of any literature written in the english language. There are few books that could be considered more quotable, and even fewer that could be considered more insightful. The novel is enjoyable even upon a cursory reading, but its splendor is revealed only when it is studied. Wilde reveals so much of himself in his art, and through reading of Wilde's biographies, plays, and the literature that inspired him, the reader becomes intimate with Oscar, and is able to understand him more throughly than most authors would allow from a study of their work. This is a piece I have truly enjoyed, and continues to be one of the premier pieces of English literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book, which I read quite some time ago but will never cease to love, is a beautiful horror story. The language, the surroundings, even the characters, are gorgeous, but at the same time, everything about them is frightening, and even a little grotesque. Lord Henry is utterly cynical, continually saying things one can never be quite sure he means or is only saying. Dorian is corrupted and horrible, and yet at the same time, one almost thinks he may suddenly stop and try to turn back. Basil is one of the only pure characters in the book, and his devotion to Dorian is sweet, but at the same time, one just /knows/ it will will cause something bad to happen to him--as, ultimately, it does.This book is a very satisfying read, although some people might be disturbed by the content, which is rather mature. Besides that, the homosexual subtext runs rampant waving a Dorian's picture. This may bother some people, although not yours truly. :)Personally, I think it's excellent. If you liked Victor Hugo's style, but would rather not hear historic digressions; if you liked Crime and Punishment's moral conflicts, but were highly irritated by the happy ending; if you enjoyed The Invisible Man's supernatural circumstances but would have been satisfied without the scientific explanations, then go forth ye and read Picture of Dorian Gray. (...)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is an exceptional novel. Through this novel Mr. Wilde presents many characteristics of the human heart and mind. It hits hard telling the truth of the way in which people really are. Mr. Wilde in his novel asks the question how far would one go to obtain beauty and youth forever to please society? And in doing so presents the desires of most humans to remain young forever and the lengths in which they might go to obtain it. This novel illustrates the obession society has with the outward appearance rather than the inward and is shown in the novel by the Dorian Gray being accepted into the 'circle' despite the 'rumors' that he is a bad man. Through Dorian Gray and Lord Henry Mr. Wilde also illustrates the influence of people over people. Resulting in the destruction of character.I enjoyed the book Dorian Gray because of the fact that it does tell the truth and quite often people don't like to hear the truth, but Oscar Wilde went against what society would view as good and did and wrote what he believed, which makes an wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to be the FIRST to review this one here. Haha, go me.Picture of Dorian Gray is a great work of fiction. Its interplay of Hellenic thought and Judaeo-Christian ethics was light years ahead of its time, even though it might come across muddled to the casual reader. Perhaps, this novel was too far ahead of its time, as it was eventually used as evidence against Wilde in two court cases for 'gross indecency' in 1895.It is a simple story; really, Basil Hallward paints a lovely portrait of Dorian Gray, a veritable Adonis. As the Painter puts the finishing touches upon this portrait, Gray is involved with a conversation regarding the nature of beauty with Lord Henry (Harry) Wotton. This culminates in Dorian wishing and praying that his beauty may never diminish; that he'd have eternal youth. Ultimately, the painting would bear all of the marks of sin, decadence, and decay that cause our physical bodies to age, while Dorian kept his stunning good looks. Wilde brings about a rather wonderful conclusion, and it is a very enjoyable story.The Picture of Dorian Gray has its dull parts. It doesn't remain current, and I'd suggest getting a copy with notes, so that you may be able to keep up with all of the references. Let's be honest, in 2004 who really cares about what was fashionable in 19th century France? These are questions the notes can clarify, and make some of the references more amiable. Still there are parts where Wilde just lists things, and these you should skip.When reading this novel, I think it becomes clear that the three main personalities are a reflection of society at that time. While Basil Hallward seemed to personify Christian conservatism, and a mundane attachment to the status quo, Lord Henry is the questioning romantic, a character that seems to argue everything yet prove nothing, and believe in even less. This makes him no less interesting, and I believe Wilde may have included him as a farce of some of his contemporaries, yet some of the best insights and quotes actually come from Lord Henry.Dorian is the romantic ideal of perfection. Though a horrible character that fears no consequences for his actions, he still remains perfection. I think that aristocratic England valued physical appearance, social wit, and worldliness more than an ethical life.Dorian Gray also typifies Wilde's affections for Hellenic culture. Dorian is the stereotypical Greek Tragic Hero. He has a flaw; his vanity; this flaw leads to his downfall; a life of sin; he realizes his flaw in the end, and tries to make amends, but it is too little too late. If you enjoy Shakespeare Allusions, you will enjoy this.I really liked The Picture of Dorian Gray, but I will not advise one way or the other whether you should read it or not. If you want something stimulating that will have an enormity of good quotes that will make your dominating intellect seem even more so to the untrained eye, then check it out. If you're looking for pulp go check out Tom Clancey or Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde gives a new definition to the good. Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian\`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading Dorian Gray, it took numerous books to accept that not all authors can have the genius and prose gifted to Wilde. Dorian's journey of making his life an art, exploring issues such as hedonism, sin, conceit, deceit and youth is an unforgettable one, and this book has lingered on in my mind since I first read it, and I think will continue to do so forever. The best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Over 100 years later and still a very popular book, this speaks for itself. My favorite of the classics. ."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"One of the great joys of fiction is the positive encouragement to discard the intentions of the author and draw out individual meaning from its pages. This positive fruition is exemplified quite extraordinarily by Oscar Wilde in \`The Picture of Dorian Gray', as he weaves a tale of youth, corruption and disregarding hedonism.The protagonist of the story is the youthful and worldly-naive Dorian Gray who, through enticement by his mentor, pledges himself to eternal youth. His wish is sanctioned and the ravishes of age are transferred onto a portrait. Knowing that his appearance will remain forever innocent, he embarks on a pursuit of reckless pleasures, spiralling further into iniquity yet remaining unchanged, whilst his picture grows grotesquely disfigured...The novel was--and to an extent, still is--controversial due to the unsubtle suggestions of homoeroticism. Personally, I don't see the fuss. Partially for obvious reasons, but I also remain unconvinced that it is presented in such a way to have ever been an encouragement for others to embrace such a 'lifestyle'. Rather, it would appear that Dorian's sexual exploits with the same gender is a method to achieving his goal of ecstatic delectation; the goal which, in the end, is his destruction. But, of course, considering Wilde's own sexual practices, one could read it as a defence of those with same-sex attractions.Ultimately, I understood this novel to be a warning against unchecked desire and the pursuit of pleasure without limits; certainly an apt lesson for our own age."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book was truly one of the jewels filled with beauty that will never fade with time. It was the way I think a book should be written. The plot was both intriguing and unsettling. The ending to this beautifully told story would be - in itself - reason enough to read it.Although, the plot is not even the best reason to read \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" Lord Henry Wotton, one of the main characters, hold beliefs so incredible that they actually prove to be quite credible. They are very interesting to read, and you may find yourself agreeing with the majority of what he says, as I did.Make sure not to skip over the preface. It is also quite interesting. The whole book in very fascinating and enjoyable. But, be warned, chapter eleven is quite difficult, so make sure you are able to concentrate on it when you read it (although, it does not exactly play a large role in the plot of the book)."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I love The Picture of Dorian Gray, and also was amazed by \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaul\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is the version I read while first discovering the many talents of Oscar Wilde. Dorian Gray is captivating, though the actual storyline is not intricate. The descriptions are extraordinary and left me wondering why he hadn't written more novels? Very short, very effective. It is inconcievable to think that Wilde was denounced for this book being immoral as it is really quite moral, considering the consequences of Dorian's behaviour. (He once commented that there never was an immoral or moral book, simply badly written or well-written) For insight into Oscar Wilde's very colourful life, pick up a copy of Richard Elmann's biography; it is not a happy read but very readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was known for his outrageous takes on life (in terms of aesthetics, superficiality, beauty and the like). This book seems to both explore and satirise them. It is about the decadence and superficial pursuits of Dorian Gray, who is \\"ruined\\" by Lord Henry Wotton who teaches him that beauty and youth are the only true values. When Dorian's friend Basil paints a portrait of him, Dorian exclaims that he wished the portrait got old instead of him.This comes true and under further tutelage of Lord Henry, Dorian lives a life of debauchery, hedonism and the like while the portrait bears his age and sin, becoming more malformed with each act. The book is full of philosophical digressions on sin, beauty and indulgence and its most fabulous aspect is the fact that it is (or as least I think) both an ode to hedonism and an allegory against it all in one, all perfectly blended, all achieved through the medium of the witty writing of Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"No one really impresses me when it comes to Literature. Oscar Wilde, Sylvia Plath, Shakespeare, those are the great people of literature amongst thousand others.Dorian Gray is an amazing fascinating book. I finished the book in a day, it just trapped me into the plot and I couldn't sleep without knowing what would happen the next, the next, the next page. I think a good book does that to its reader.The language is very fanciful and the usage of profound words help me a lot to express my words too. it's quite poetic, and for the young readers like me, i think we like how cynical Lord Henry was, and how submissive Basil seemed to appear as.

While years pass by, the portrait starts to reflect the man's sins and wrinkles while he remains as young as it was at that moment. He becomes a person driven by pleasure and he decides to experience everything he can, whether it's good or evil. Until one day, he cannot stand it anymore..."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Back in a world where vanity is a good trait to have and beauty is worshipped. This is a time where the most important thing is preserving a good appearance. Sin is thought of as merely an adventure and the past is only a forgotten bother. The life of Dorian Gray is a race to see who will win his young mind and form it into his being. A most handsome boy, he never had much opinion and was content just to sit and be painted. Basil Hallward loves him for his features. Basil also was in love with the inspiration he felt whenever he was painting Dorian or whenever Dorian was near. Basil thought of finding beauty and living only through art, but none of this was appealing to the impressionable Dorian Gray.Upon meeting Dorian Gray, Lord Henry Wotton becomes completely intrigued. A man who loves nothing more than observing the behavior of human beings and implanting his ideas into anyone who will listen is quite a companion. Where many do not agree with his words, Dorian couldn't agree more with him. As days and years pass, Dorian is shaped into the perfect being that Lord Henry has only begun to imagine.Where there is beauty, worship, and incorrect influence there is flaw. There is hatred, there is jealousy, and there is corruption. Dorian has the strong belief that everyone will love him and he will forever be preserved the angel of time. To himself he is everything, but to everyone he is bad luck. His ideals, taken from Lord Henry, seep into the minds of others and cause them to fall. Precisely because of these beliefs he would never understand he was wrong.With the horror of the ego and the love of oneself there is no clear path again to the light. This is Dorian's story, his desperation, his trials, his losses, this, good people, is his soul.Lovers of philosophy and gothic idealism will find nothing to hate in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I am still baffled by many of the perspectives created and endorsed by Lord Henry. Though there are undoubtedly sections that could put a hyper person to sleep, this book is filled with so much philosophy and plot twists that it is worth the read despite the at times slow plot. Broaden your mind and reflect on your morality. It is time to rediscover your path."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this just to read Dorian Gray, and read the whole thing. Never read any Oscar Wilde before, and didn't think I would love it. Truely witty dialogue and great morality tales are both fun and though provoking. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is not just a book, it is a story that delves into each human's beliefs and views of the world, a book that makes a person really look differently at the world around them. Although Oscar Wilde wastes much space with over-explanatory details, the moments in which he tells his story are moments of inspiration and causes of great self-examination. The story, in which a good-looking young man gains eternal beauty, really makes its reader look within themselves and find the person they are and who they want to be. Also, through some very good symbols, Wilde is able to make his reader find new meaning in the world around them and is able to open the reader's eyes to the magnificence--and ugliness--of life itself.Even though the book is mostly filled with simple dialogue and extended (and sometimes, unnecessary) descriptions, the overall effect the story itself can have upon the reader's mind is overpowering. Not only does Wilde's occasional complex dialogue add to the reader's understanding of the world, the ideals with which Wilde writes (and therefore gives his character) make the reader work to understand where they fall within the spectrum of day to day life.The book was slow moving at first, but really started to pick up, due to its author's ability to excite the reader's mind, with the first meeting between the main character and the man who he would eventually blame for all of his problems. I would definitely recommend this book to those who have an open mind (there are some controversial ideas and lifestyles within the story) and are able to follow a character's complex mindset because, although most of the book is simple and in some people's eyes, artless, it still provides the reader with multiple \\"out-of-the-box\\" type ideas.I enjoyed the book, and the message it sent was one that I will probably never forget. It is one that forces the reader to question what they value in life, make them question what a \\"perfect\\" life would be. Because of the story's ability to reach within the readers mind and plant a new outlook on life, the book would be a great read for anyone who is interested in hearing the story of a man who gave up everything in order to keep the only thing he believed to be important within the world, the thing that he himself feared losing the most."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"A classic noir fiction novel were the worship of material values related to physical beauty and immortality drive the ego of a young man belonging to the upper classes of the English society of the XIX century to a tragic fate after circumstances force him to confront his real self.

There's a lot to be learned from Dorian Gray, I promise he's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I decided to re-read Dorian Gray for an upcoming book club discussion but I knew that I wanted to read the annotated edition because I cannot resist special editions--books, films, and music-- with all the accompanying special features. I had not realized the extent to which Wilde's original version differed from the final published edition. This edition gives me everything I would ever want to know about Dorian Gray, including not only everything he wrote that was edited out later but extensive footnotes, illustrations, photographs and paintings of innumerable peripheral points of interest.The Picture of Dorian Gray bears similarities in my mind with other notable philosophical metaphysical fantasies of the nineteenth century--Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and one less well-known than those others but perhaps an even more direct influence on Wilde--Balzac's Le Peau de Chagrin, or The Magic Skin. In that novel, a man purchases a magic wild ass's skin that is supposed to grant his every wish. He, of course, indulges in every kind of debauchery and decadent, hedonistic activity he can imagine and discovers that the skin magically shrinks and his life span is correspondingly shortened with every wish fulfilled.All of these novels were published before Wilde wrote his philosophical fantasy and they all influenced him, along with other tales of magic portraits by Hawthorne, Poe and Gogol. Wilde used the device in a particularly unique way. The portrait is kept in a locked room in an attic as any reminder or repository of our darkest impulses would be, in a back chamber of the subconscious. In the final published version of the novel, there are connotations of homosexuality and bisexuality among the characters of the impossibly handsome Dorian, the effete artist Basil Hallward and the caustic, witty, married (and bisexual) Lord Henry Wotton. Each of these characters depict aspects of Wilde himself, with Lord Henry being the primary expounder of Wildean bon mots and witty aphorisms--\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about,\\" \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" etc.In the original, uncensored version one can easily see from our \`unsuppressed' 21st century perspective that Wilde is writing about characters that are gay or bisexual. Even though Wilde was writing between and through the lines about these matters of sexual identity, it wasn't subtle enough to not be used as evidence against him in his trial for \`gross indecency' a few years later.From the perspective of someone outside Wilde's era, the novel is a strange, nightmarish parable of sexuality, youth, immortality and moral conscience. Without the sexual components, the novel is a strange neutered fable and attempts to heterosexualize it, as in the famous 1945 film version, only produce strangely asexual men with nebulous fetishes.It is Wilde's only novel and it is a brave, noble attempt. Its weaknesses, of which Wilde was aware, stem from his experience writing for the theater. There are pages of dialogue that could have easily been lifted from a page of script in which not a line of descriptive narration appears. On the other hand, there is an entire chapter in which there is no character interaction whatsoever, no dialogue, merely an extensive, descriptive catalog of the cultural stimuli that contribute to Dorian's dissipation.Upon reflection, one wonders if Wilde would have felt the need to write this novel in a less sexually repressed era. In our current day there would be thousands of opportunities for objective purgings of the darker impulses to be manifested not only through painting but numerous other visual media. Wilde would be one of many gay authors. The novel cannot be separate from the time in which it was created, however, and in the England of 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray was an extremely daring shot in the face of Victorian social and cultural customs."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is full of memorable lines. The conversations exchanged are witty and poignant. Definitely worth a read. A good intro into Wilde.I feel it is relevant to young readers struggling to define themselves in a morally ambiguous world. The ideas are timeless and apply especially in today's time, where I feel the average young adult confronts these issues; whereas in Wilde's time, it was likely only relevant to the wealthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde is one hell of an elegant writer. He focuses a lot on beauty in his writing, and it really shows. The Picture of Dorian Gray is about a narcissistic man, only to fall in love with a a beautiful painting done of himself. He says aloud that he wishes he could stay young and beautiful, like in his portrait, and lo and behold, his wish comes true. He never grows old, but the man in his portrait (himself) does instead. He hides the portrait in the attic (his dirty secret), because he doesn't want anyone to see him growing old in the picture, and the story pretty much goes from there. This book is poetic in its writing, has a lot of witty commentary, and is a must for Wilde fans. All in all, I gave this story 4 out of 5 stars, only because I enjoyed his play much better...

I know, crazy right. No, I havn't lived under a rock my whole life. I don't know how i missed it. Well, after seeing the movie I rented every movie of The Picture of Dorian Gray I could find and fell in love with the story. Then I read the book... and fell in love with the writing.Reading the first chapter is like being swathed in wonderful writing from head too toe. I felt completely surrounded by it. You can almost feel the warmth of the garden, hear the sounds of the birds and dragonflies, and smell the beauty of the flowers as you sit and listen to this conversation between Harry and Basil. The writing is an immersive experince. And Basil's description of his first encounter with Dorian and the feelings that Dorian stirs in him, sound almost... romantic. At the least there's definately a bromance going on. And we also see the first crack of Dorian's facade in this chapter, which Basil's decsription of how Dorian sometiems seems purposefully cruel to him. Isn't it interesting, the first chapter ends with Harry demanding to meet Dorian and dragging Basil into the house and we haven't even met Dorian yet ourselves.As I read the book it occured to me that it could also have been titled the Influence of Lord Henry Wotten, for Harry's (as he's called by his friends) opinions and influence are as central to the story as Dorian Gray himself and more of a factor than the portrait itself. Hardly a scene goes by that Harry, whether present or not, is not quoted as an authority. It was as if he was the potter and Dorian was the clay. Harry was fully aware of his influence, and Dorian... Dorian seemed to be racing from one sensation to another like a spoiled child.This was by far one of the best written, most interesting stories I have read. I will read it over and over and would recommend it to everyone.STATS:Nook Pages: 240Genere: ClassicRe-readability: Very High"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I was curious about this book from another book I recently read. I first picked up the audiobook narrated by Edward Petherbridge (8 disks, BBC Audio, 1994/2010) from my Library, but I couldn't stand Edward's narration. He was terrible. He spoke really fast, then slow all of a sudden. He was british but it just was NOT working. It's was like Narrator ADD, and I just HAD to put the Audiobook down.Then I took out another AudioBook, narrated by Michael Page (7 disks, Brilliance Audio, 1995), and it was absolutely AMAZING!!! Michael does a wonderful job of keeping the pace and volume easy to follow and the words were British and clear. WOW!! Great job! I highly recommend Michael Page for all audio recordings.The Picture of Dorian Gray (The Classic Collection)Moving on to the story....It was great! It is definitely a Gothic classic. It is a story about a boy, Dorian Gray, who is beautiful beyond belief, but naive as well. He is first discovered by an artist, Basil and becomes the artist's muse. Basil paints the most wonderful, telling portraits, when Dorian sits for him. His work like never before. The artist has a friend, Henry, who is an absolute cynic. Henry thinks he is enlightened, but he is just a miserable existentialist mess! Dorian takes to Henry and they get close, thereby pulling Dorian away from Basil the artist.Henry is full of skepticism, and a deliberate, mean, philosophy on life that he expresses through twisted words and phrases. To Dorian, this is all new and he starts to look up to Henry, emulating him, and following his words. The Good, beautiful, kind, and chaste Dorian becomes a wicked, evil, manipulative, infamous character that everyone is afraid of. His good looks remain, through a portrait made by Basil.Just as Dorian is an inspiration for Basil's blank canvas, so is Henry an inspiration for Dorian's mind as a blank canvas.That is the story.But my summary won't really help you understand the book, you just have to read it.It's very interesting, and well written. I definitely find myself getting angry at some of the things said and done. I am repelled, I feel disgusted, I feel for the minor characters. I sympathize with Basil and I hate Henry.

While you are remaining curiously young and ageless to your friends and the world at large, your aging portrait hidden from all eyes is inspected by you alone as the years go by with some trepidation as the case may be, and as time marches on. Not only is your true appearance accurately portrayed in the picture, showing your actual physical age, but revealing in great detail your personality along with your good deeds and misdemeanors etched meticulously across the painting. When friends of mine sent word recently saying \\"Expect us to look younger since you saw us a decade ago!\\", I was quick to respond \\"I fully expect you to look your appropriate age, and far superior than when you were last here\\". Although this was meant as a note of humor on my part, the thought of Wilde's masterpiece came to mind immediately and the air around me was chilly for a moment. As for Dorian Gray when he attempts to alter and amend his portrait (which might be interpreted as his soul), I shall leave new readers to discover the results of such an enterprise for themselves.

I love this about Oscar Wilde's writing style. How deliciously dark and disturbing this book is. I am astonished it has taken me so long to read such a brilliant book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Set in the 1800's in the streets of London, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a haunting story of corruption brought unto Dorian Gray by the Lord Henry Wotton. Oscar Wilde explores the pleasures of life, beauty, and temptation through the character of Dorian who, one day realizes that his beauty will fade after Lord Henry's comments on Dorian's youth being captured perfectly: \\"Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!\\" (Wilde 3). Dorian unknowingly offered his soul to the devil for his physical beauty in return, all his sins would be reflected in the painting.After his friend Basil, paints a masterpiece of Dorian, he tries to protect Dorian from Lord Henry's thinking and goals in life knowing where it would lead him. Although Hayward is only in the novel for a short time, his character inspired me to keep reading until the end where we can finally see how justice is served. Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil Halyward, who grudgingly introduced him to Dorian. Lord Henry is the character you love to hate; he is such a perfect character, you can sense that something is wrong with him.The young and handsome Dorian Gray is the main protagonist who made me rethink my future and how I looked at life. Although very rich and in good social standing, he chooses to hang out in the slums of London in opium dens and around the docks, symbolizing his sins and where his values lie. The way Oscar Wilde characterizes Dorian gives a vivid and accurate picture of a good boy gone bad.The principal theme of this novel is that self-worship leads to self-destruction, this is one of the main themes that pulled me into reading this book. However, another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the previous one is living a double life. Many speculate Oscar Wilde used this as one of his themes because he was inspired by the story; The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson.Although written over 120 years ago, this book is a must have and should be in every library across the world or on your shelf.

While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details.

A friend of Dorian Gray, Basil Hayward, paints a picture of Dorian which the painting's subject falls in love with. Dorian wishes that he could remain as beautiful as the picture and that the picture may take on the effects of human aging in his stead. In Wilde's creative twist, Dorian's wish comes true, although this only becomes evident to him as his life becomes increasingly chaotic. As the novel progresses, Dorian, in obsessive love with himself, fights to keep his sanity as the burden of his stress, sins, and guilt, are transfered to the picture which increasingly haunts him.Wilde's writing is colorful and his characters' emotions realistic. This novel is a cutting, yet accurate, observation of human nature in general, especially in our modern, self-glorifying societies. Wilde makes the perfect critique of our selfishness and vanity when Dorian Gray says: \\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.\\" For many in our TV and Hollywood crazed world, this statement is not troublesome but rather, a personal mantra."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I had really high expectations for this novel, which were not fulfilled. The novel consists of mostly &quot;mindless&quot; dialogue and the true story does not really occur until the book is half over. then the story picks up pace until Dorian's descriptions of a book (totally unrelated to the rest of the novel) drag on. Once that portion of the book concludes, the end briskly approaches. Overall, I think I was expecting a more emotional response to this, which never occured."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a fine piece of literature- a tale of excess, of corruption, of decay and of facades.Basil Hallward, an artist, paints a picture of Dorian Gary, a handsome and vain young man, whom the artist is besotted with. Dorian Gray sells his soul for eternal youth, in a Faustian bargain, whereby all the age , decay corruption will show in the picture , while Grey's appearance will stay eternally young and fresh.Encouraged by the hedonistic cynic Lord Henry Wotton, Gray embarks on a life of corruption, decadence and cruelty. Lord Henry is also the vehicle through which Wilde put down his many uniquely Wildesque epigrams into the novel, such as \\" Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil. Conscience is the trade name of the firm. That is all\\"; \\" Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love. It is the faithless who know love's tragedies\\"; \\"There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about\\" ; \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\" ; \\" It is better to be beautiful than to be good. But it is better to be good than to be ugly.\\" And \\" As for the virtuous poor , one can pity them of course , but one cannot possibly admire them\\".The bargain made by Gray can only lead to eventual destruction , and the novel is a statement by Wilde on humanity and society , in the cavalier and irreverent way that only Wilde could."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story about a man whose wish for eternal youth comes true through a portrait of himself delves into numerous philosophical nether regions. Set in upscale 19th century London, The Picture of Dorian Gray deals with such topics as truth, death, and most especially beauty.Dorian Gray's portrait ages while he remains his youthful self. Gray uses this to his advantage (let's be honest, who wouldn't?). Gray breaks hearts, corrupts others, and avails himself of numerous vices...most notably opium. Gray also takes advantage of his youth by learning new things...music and gemology come to mind. But Gray's self-enhancement does not make up for the copious sins he commits, both large and small...and even though his face does not bely his crimes, the portrait's face does.Wilde's play on eternal youth was almost certainly novel for the time. These days the concept has been played out time again. But I do not begrudge Wilde for this...in his time, he was an innovator.Four major things irked me about this book:First, the prose is overly flowery. I don't read many books written in the 19th century...maybe most of the books were written like this. Second, Wilde seems to use this book as a platform to give us his take on philosophical issues large and small. True, most good works of fiction are a reflection of the society in which the author lives, but Wilde is NOT subtle about giving us numerous opinions on art, love, life, beauty, etc. I think he could have been a bit more subtle doing this. Third most of characters seemed overly naive. Granted, this story is supposed to be set in a time and place where the rich did not concern themselves with trivial matters. Nonetheless...so much was going on under the characters' noses! Even, Henry Wotton -- Gray's longtime friend -- seems to come down with a bout of extreme naivete toward the end of the book. Somehow, this made the characters seem shallower than they otherwise might have been. And my final gripe kind of ties in with the characters' overall naivete. From the time that Dorian Gray is granted eternal youth by whatever powers that be, to the end of the book, nearly two decades elapse. There is only one, very minor, mention of Gray's youthful looks toward the end of the book. Didn't anyone notice that this guy has, supposedly, aged nearly twenty years and yet still appears as youthful as ever? Come on, even these days with plastic surgery and $100+ cosmetic cream, a 40 year old doesn't look half his age. Why did only Gray's closest friend only offhandedly mention this toward the end of the book? Surely someone else must have noticed?Wilde's concept had a lot of potential, and it certainly does make one ponder life's intangible mysteries, but Wilde spent to much time proselytizing his 19th century philosophy for this book to really stand out. This book is only recommended to those who enjoy Wilde's other works."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I do not know words to describe the way I feel about this book. The first time, with the exception of one chapter, I could not put it down. I have been hooked on Oscar Wilde since. I researched the period and wrote a term paper on this book alone, and after that, when I still was not satisfied, bought his complete works, a book of quotations, and a book about his plays. I only wish by byeing these books I could understand and be swallowed into the beauty of his wisdom. I can sometimes be an obsessive person, and I suppose this is how my review sounds at this point, but don't let your opinion of me detract you from interest in this book.It's worth giving a try...you may become hooked too (by the way for Wilde fans..the movie WILDE is a great window into his life). This book is written with beauty and the words flow like poetry...warning though...people with closed minds towards homosexuality should think of choosing a different book. One of the most descriptive and hiddenly believable parts of this book is the secret feelings Lord Henry has for Dorean. I don't want to misinterpret the book, but i believe Lord Henry's feelings to be more than fatherly...great excelent story!! my favorite book!! what more can be said???-SArah"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is just a warning to prospective kindle customers - the kindle version of this book is not \\"lavishly illustrated\\" which is not so surprising in a digital edition. But what was more surprising to me, Nicholas Frankel's extensive notes, which run alongside the text and which exceed the actual length of the novel itself, are not included. In fact, both the paperback and kindle editions are 'reader's editions'. Yes, there are two rich scholarly introductions, replete with notes, and some three pages of notes to the actual text (which are also included in the hardback) , but the \\"annotations\\" which have excited so much comment from reviewers are in fact missing from the kindle edition. There was no warning from Amazon that the kindle edition omits the textual notes that run side by side with the text in the hardback. However, when I pointed this out to Amazon, 'they' very generously offered me a certificate for the amount of the book on my next purchase. So that was very nice.In fact Stonewall Riot Press has a complete, uncensored \\"reader's\\" edition on Amazon for 9.19. The editor himself, JOHN MCARTHUR, praises Nicholas Frankel's annotations:\\"I was already at work on my edition of the text when I received my copy of Nicholas Frankel's P-book edition published in 2011 by Harvard University Press. Though I was somewhat dismayed at having been scooped, I could only admire the quality and thoroughness of Professor Frankel's scholarship. His notes, which run alongside the text, exceed it in length, and he also provides lavish illustrations and other resources.

I am in LOVE with this story. The way Wilde writes is fabulous- I am an increasingly voracious reader of the classics, and Wilde's writing style is exactly what I like. It is written in the eloquent verbage of the time, but not so much so that I find it stifling and hard to get through ( I am currently reading an Emily Bronte, and am having this problem). The story itself is charming and devious, with an ending that you expect and yet are shocked by. All in all, I am currently parousing more Oscar Wilde books to add to my collection."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review of the Kindle formatting of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray.\\" I really enjoyed the story itself, but the Kindle layout could really use some work. Like a lot of free public domain ebooks, this one isn't exactly user-friendly. The lack of a title page doesn't bother me, but this book is also missing a table of contents. If you're reading this for a class or a reading group, that missing table of contents might be a deal breaker. Additionally, while you can always refer to line numbers, this book lacks pagination. Again: I realize this isn't something that's going to bother everyone, but if you need to refer to page numbers in an essay, you might be in trouble if you use this copy.If you're like me and you're interested in reading this book just for fun, page numbers and a table of contents probably don't matter much to you. However, I think everyone can agree that things like page breaks and proper spacing between chapters vastly improve one's reading experience. That's the real rub: There are none. Paragraphs sit immediately atop one another like a great wall of text. Chapters receive the same treatment and are only demarcated by plain text- no bolding, no new section, nothing. The whole effect is not only visually unappealing, but just plain annoying.So the layout of this Kindle edition isn't great, but this book isn't all bad. For one thing, it's free. You get what you pay for formatting-wise, but it's a fantastic story and it's yours forever at absolutely no cost. Plus- and this is also big- this ebook isn't riddled with spelling errors and typos like a lot of the other public domain books available on the Kindle. In sum, while the formatting is annoying, the book is still totally readable."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a novel by Oscar Wilde. The soft cover is 176 pages in length.Maybe one of Wildes' most famous works. An increasingly macabre tale set in London, England during the 19th century.Most are familiar with the plot behind this book...but some *SPOILERS* ahead for those that don't want to know.A most handsome young man has a most lifelike portrait done of himself by a up and coming young London painter. In his youthful exuberance over the detail and beauty of the work, he casually remarks that he'd give his soul to remain young and beautiful, like in the painting, forever.His curse is that he stays young while his friends age and the face and body in the portrait grows old through the years. But the portrait does more than just grow old, it reflects every bad or evil thing he's done (using his beautiful looks to gain unfair advantage); resulting in a framed visage that becomes more grotesque and ugly with every new sin he commits.*END SPOILERS*Beautifully written, with great descriptive detail (maybe at times, a little too much). Wilde conveys a tense atmosphere filled with forebodling and apprehension as he gets into the second half of his extraordinary novel.Conclusion:A short, brilliant work. A masterpiece! 5 StarsRay NicholsonP.S.The Kindle edition of this book is free via public domain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I loved the idea that someone's true nature can be portrayed on a canvas. Although a beatiful young man, Dorian finds that his debauchery and sin are not reflected by the state of his own body, but by the image cast in a painting. As Dorian continues his decline in morals, an interesting question arises. Kind of a \\"which came first, the chicken or the egg\\" type of thing. Was his soul corrupted by his lack of consequences for his mistakes? Or did the freedom merely let him unleash the evil that already poisoned his soul?"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This sophisticated but crude novel is the story of man's eternal desire for perennial youth, of our vanity and frivolity, of the dangers of messing with the laws of life. Just like &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;The immortal&quot; by Borges.Dorian Gray is beautiful and irresistible. He is a socialit&eacute; with a high ego and superficial thinking. When his friend Basil Hallward paints his portrait, Gray expresses his wish that he could stay forever as young and charming as the portrait. The wish comes true.Allured by his depraved friend Henry Wotton, perhaps the best character of the book, Gray jumps into a life of utter pervertion and sin. But, every time he sins, the portrait gets older, while Gray stays young and healthy. His life turns into a maelstrom of sex, lies, murder and crime. Some day he will want to cancel the deal and be normal again. But Fate has other plans.Wilde, a man of the world who vaguely resembles Gray, wrote this masterpiece with a great but dark sense of humor, saying every thing he has to say. It is an ironic view of vanity, of superflous desires. Gray is a man destroyed by his very beauty, to whom an unknown magical power gave the chance to contemplate in his own portrait all the vices that his looks and the world put in his hands. Love becomes carnal lust; passion becomes crime. The characters and the scenes are perfect. Wilde's wit and sarcasm come in full splendor to tell us that the world is dangerous for the soul, when its rules are not followed. But, and it's a big but, it is not a moralizing story. Wilde was not the man to do that. It is a fierce and unrepressed exposition of all the ugly side of us humans, when unchecked by nature. To be rich, beautiful and eternally young is a sure way to hell. And the writing makes it a classical novel. Come go with Wotton and Wilde to the theater, and then to an orgy. You'll wish you age peacefully."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first was introduced to Dorian Gray through a book club, and I thought 'Oh no, Oscar Wilde, here I go, another hard to read boring society book&quot;. I was wrong. Within the first two chapters of Dorian Gray I was intrigued and fascinated. This book deals with several issues that are as important now as they are today: the way our culture worships beauty and youth, an admiration that boarders on homosexual love, virtues, the differences between men and women, and what art is and what makes it truly art. Dorian Gray is a beautiful young man, who sees a portrait of himself and says &quot;How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young...If only it were the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the portrait to grow old...I would give my soul for that!&quot; The book takes off from there, leading you from a small theater to great parties. While younger readers may find some of the wording as tough as an old gym shoe, anyone older than 13 with an interest in mystery, romance, and how society runs, will find this a pleasurable and haunting read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities. Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton. Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward. Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him. It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall. There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry. He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas. Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after. Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost. He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself. To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled. Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait. His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery. He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul. He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities. In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone. For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character. The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts. One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment. Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret. The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray. Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray. By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it. This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age. Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What made Oscar Wild(e)?The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press has published a new edition of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. While there is no burning need for such a volume in the day of Lady Gaga and marriage equality, it's important to remember that Wilde spent two years in prison for being gay and for having the guts (stupidity?) to flaunt his sexuality. In many ways, it was the flaunting rather than the act themselves that so angered his persecutors.And Dorian Gray, his first and only novel, was certainly a shot fired directly into the heart of Victorian prudery.And in this day of Kindles, e-books and tweets, this is truly a magnificent job of bookmaking. Oversized, lavishly illustrated and gorgeously presented, Oscar would have loved it. The text is examined minutely, with a variety of comparisons from various publications of the novel, as well as Wilde's original manuscript. While there's nothing particularly new to discover in the emendations from the sources, merely a reinforcement of the outrageousness inherent in the piece, the scholarship is both astounding and informative.The annotator and editor, Nicholas Frankel, easily and effortlessly places the modern reader in Wilde's time and place, London's late Victorian Age in London. There is still a tingle to Dorian's story of endless debauchery while he remains looking pure and innocent for decades and the painting ages and grows monstrous, reflecting his sins and crimes.Strangely, the book seems more modern than one would imagine. Rather than merely a potboiler from two centuries back, WIlde's genius imbues the story with a strange and haunting immediacy, and a cautionary tale for us all: Be careful what you wish for.One could hardly wish for a more beautifully accoutered book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Is your soul a good bargaining chip for perpetual youth and beauty? Young Dorian Gray was led to believe so and impulsively struck that bargain. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is the story of his decline into depravity following that ill-advised trade-off. The story is well-known in popular culture. An artist becomes obsessed with his young model's attractiveness. He and his jaded friend compete for influence over the young man. The friend corrupts young Dorian, encourages him to embrace a life of sensual pleasure and to prize his own beauty. Dorian exclaims that he resents the portrait because IT will keep the freshness of youth -- then the fateful words, that he would give his soul if the picture could decay instead of his own face and body.Be careful what you wish for! Over the next twenty years Dorian sinks into the depths of moral slime and watches the hidden portrait show all the signs of that immorality, while his own face and figure keep the blush of youth.Along with the adulation of youth and beauty, Oscar Wilde delves into the theme of art as morally neutral, a principle of the aesthetic school of thought. Can art be moral or immoral? Should it teach us, improve us? That was the common 19th century view but the school of aestheticism believed that the arts had no role in moral enlightenment. The preface of the book lays out this theme in a series of proclamations.The entire book, like all of Wilde's work, is packed with \\"sound bites.\\" The corrupting friend, Lord Henry Wotton, is particularly prone to Polonius-like declamations, and Dorian tells him, \\"You cut life to pieces with your epigrams!\\" In fact Wilde does that, ripping into polite society and the opium dens of London alike.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is Oscar Wilde's only published novel. It first appeared in a magazine in 1890 as a shorter work, and was later expanded and edited to remove some of the more blatant homosexual references. His writing is exquisite, his themes repugnant but (dare I say it?) edifying. \\"What does it profit a man ...\\"Highly recommended as a true classic of modern literature. I read this book when I was young and thought I understood it. Now that I'm not so young, I'm sure that I don't.NOTE: I listened to this book on CD, not tape, but I chose this product link because it's the same production. The Brilliance Audio Library Edition, read by Michael Page, was incomparably presented and added a great deal to my enjoyment of this absorbing book.Linda Bulger, 2008"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book contains the story 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' - in original typescript form. This is the way Oscar Wilde wanted the novel to actually read before the publishers got hold of it. There are two other versions of the novel out there - the version printed for magazine publication & the one printed in novel form. After the publishers got hold of the manuscript a lot of changes were made because of content - the homoerotic element was toned down. The novel version is also longer - Wilde expanded the story. There are pictures, illustrations, & extensive notes included to explain all the changes. It's very interesting to see a version in print that is how Wilde intended it. If you are a fan of Oscar Wilde's works or of Dorian Gray in particular, you will appreciate having this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy. He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man. Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time. Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips. As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him. His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures. But at what price? As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth. Who wouldn't want to stay young forever? We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful. Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience). We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men. By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian. Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife). There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty. In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel. That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"While Oscar Wilde's central theme of corruption initially captures the readers attention, the character development does not help to hold the reader's attention for a long period of time. Dorian Gray, the central character, has the potential to be a very romantic and dumbfounding character, but because Wilde does not go into great character development, he seems almost more like the painting that comes to represent him ... dimensionless. The point of the novel is to point out how changed Dorian becomes over the years and how he goes from being the epitome of beauty to someone that is hardly recognized as the person he once was. However, in order to feel this transformation, the reader would need to feel as if he or she knew the original Dorian Gray. Because the beginning of the novel does not describe him enough, the full effect of Dorian's startling transformation is unable to be fully comprehended.In addition, although the theme of outer beauty coupled with inner corruption is a strong one, this book seems more like one that should be read in a class and discussed in groups. It is not a novel that is easy-reading for pleasure. The style of writing makes it hard to breeze through the book, although on the positive the book brings about much self-contemplation and is very thought provoking. The reader cannot put it down because the whole novel leads to the very disturbing, although somewhat predictable, ending.In general, it is a book that should be read and will be enjoyed by many. The reader can relate to the feelings felt by the main characters and the themes in the book are ones that can be witnessed in real life. The general faults of the novel are eventually outweighed by the suspense and the intrigue as the painting of Dorian Gray, once a masterpiece, becomes more defiled with each horrible act committed by Dorian."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray.

He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. Moreover, with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. In addition, we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story, Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.The Picture of Dorian Gray Starring: George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"After reading some of the contemporary reviews of this book, I was more than a little curious to see how awful this book really was.

Looking back from a historical perspective, I can see why the critics of the time disliked it. But from today's perspective, it is nothing short of brilliant.

That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes.

However, it's a classic, even if parts of the book are disappointing. Nevertheless, the beauty of the prose and the depth of Wilde's words are such that one can't fault the author for not living up to the standards he set for himself. If you're an astute reader and care to analyze the text, the points made by Wilde can change your life and why this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book reminds me of other great stories--Faust, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, Macbeth--where the main character's corrupt longings become his or her undoing. Dorian Gray searched for immortality through immorality and discovered that it fails to deliver.Wilde presents biblical passages on occasion--usually scornfully--the last of which serves as an apt summary for the whole book. Lord Henry asked Dorian, \\"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?\\" (Mark 8:36). A rhetorical question that pricked Dorian's conscience.I think if we're honest, none of us can bear to stare at our own portrait. We either try to cover it or knife it--anything but face it! In that sense, the portrait is a mirror. But the picture frame is also a window. It reveals the reality of any life that seeks to gain the world through a compromise of character.Basil's dying words are worth repeating: \\"It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and see if we cannot remember a prayer.\\""},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I knew what this story was about long before finally reading it. That's probably common. The famous premise is a fascinating one, though I found myself wondering if the narrative would have been even more impactful if written as a short story or novella length rather than stretched out to a full novel. The Lord Henry character who serves the purpose of putting bad ideas in Dorian's head gives multiple speeches throughout detailing his hedonistic world view. If the number or word count of these lectures was cut in half I don't think the story would suffer much from the absence. Another decision made by Oscar Wilde was not to show readers very much of Dorian's behavior. His first act of cruelty is laid out before us as is his final one, but in between we are only told that his bad reputation precedes him without being shown what he has done to earn it. It's left to our imagination. A few more scenes exhibiting decadent behavior rather than various dinner party conversations in which a pro decadence philsophy is expressed would have made for a juicier read. Would it have made for a better read? That's arguable, as perhaps it also is whether this book is intententially homoerotic or simply written during a time when heterosexual men were much more comfortable going on and on about how good looking a guy was. What's beyond debate is that Oscar Wilde came up with a great idea to build a story around, one that is as timeless as the desire for eternal youth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is a very dark tale of vanity, debauchery, drug use, murder and depression. When a nave and stunningly handsome young man unknowingly trades soul for eternal youth and beauty with a wish caught by the devils ear, he inevitably finds that physical perfection, charm and pleasures of the flesh are worth not at the cost of ones soul.Is this classic an enjoyable read?... that's a tough one to answer for such a ominous story , but I will say it's an interesting one that holds some entertaining characters and introduces many thought provoking ideas. Obviously THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY is far from the best piece of literature I've ever experienced, but for me it was worth the short time it took to read, if for nothing else but for the appreciation of Oscar Wilde's famed wit."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The digital version (free) is quite good.

I saw the movie and decided to read it again and it never failed to entertain"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is my first Oscar Wilde book, and I finished the book very happy that I had read it. Dorian Gray is a young man, who has an incredible presence, due to his innocence and uncorrupted state of mind. We are introduced to him through painter Basil Howard, who is inspired by the young man. His acquaintance, Lord Henry Wotton, wants to meet the beautiful young man, and that is how Dorian Gray's demise begins.Everyone probably knows the premise of the book. Where this beautiful young man has a painting that ages, while the Dorian Gray never goes through the aging process that everyone around him inevitably goes through. The portrayal of how one changes over the course of a lifetime is seen through the life of Dorian Gray, as well as the portrait, which becomes more hideous over time.I did not give this book five stars, because I was disappointed in the character development of Dorian Gray. I feel that Lord Henry (Harry) was fully developed through his \\"musings\\" which are common throughout the book, yet the book's namesake sometimes seems to disappears into the background.The Kindle version seems to be complete (at least to someone who has never read the book before). A classic that definitely deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde had a wonderful talent of being able to totally take the reader into whatever story he happened to be telling. In this tale of sin and tragedy, one can feel the fog wrapping around them, the cramped and dark opium dens, and the longing in the heart of Mr. Dorian Gray.If you are in the mood for a work of art that will capture your emotions and drag them along for a ride filled with 'shadows and early doom' (as Bob Dylan might say), this is the book for you. At its end it will leave you sitting staggered, feeling like you have been to the depths of a human soul and back again."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I first read The Picture of Dorian Gray in my senior year of High School. I was pretty sure I would hate it, because I've been forced to read all manner of \\"classic\\" books that were just ho hum dreary.However, Wilde did an amazing job! I just think its sad that he got such harsh reviews in his time. The book is full of mystery, and asks a question that is still valid in today's society. \\"What are you willing to sell for eternal beauty?\\"So, ask yourself that as you read this book.

He asks the reader to ponder the unsymbiotic dichotomy of beauty and goodness. Can one possess both while maintaining a clear conscience?As for the irrepressible and intrepidly narcissistic Dorian Gray, \\"I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.\\" The Picture of Dorian Gray is a short work of literature that I read in one day. However, its brevity is due to Wilde's publisher purposefully omitting material at the time that was deemed vile and unprintable. This causes some holes in the story - references made to the many sins Dorian committed along the way to others were left unanswered upon finishing the book. More than a little frustrating. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with the Gothic, sordid, and dark themes that Wilde so aptly transcribes. Wilde amuses us with the copious amounts of witty quotable lines from Lord Henry such as, \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"I found myself writing down clever witticisms constantly as I read the book. A good read if for nothing else than the unsurpassed wit of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I usually try to go into English classes with a sense of optimism about the reading materials, and they're actually not usually bad. I find myself finishing almost every book ahead of schedule, and liking quite a few of them. So when I found out we'd be reading The Picture of Dorian Gray in junior year of High School, I started it with a positive mind. It was a famous classic after all! However, in this particular case, I was disappointed.The Picture of Dorian Gray is a novel with far too much unused potential. It's about the adventures of Dorian Gray, an upper class young adult living in the 1890's. Dorian acquires a magical portrait that diverts all physical traces of sin from him to his face in the portrait, allowing him to commit as much sin as he wants and remain looking youthful and innocent (i.e., after his insults drive his girlfriend Sybil to suicide, his portrait develops \\"a touch of cruelty in his mouth\\" [pg. 91] but his actual face remains the same). He gets advice from other characters about how he should live life, and after following his friend Lord Henry's way of life (outlined in a little yellow book that encourages Dorian to remain vain and shallow) and living hedonistically and selfishly for years and years, he finally realizes how \`ugly' his soul has become and launches an attempt at redemption. While it seems like there would be lots of action, I was disappointed at the lack of plot in general, and most of the book is actually rich people talking about human nature. Many of the book's lessons are taken from the obscure musings of Lord Henry, who acts as an outlet for Wilde's opinions, and while this is a decent way for Dorian to learn about life, I would much rather have read about him learning through experience as he traveled around doing something interesting. He could have been living a life of incalculable sin, and yet chooses to have sex and hang out in gardens smoking opium all day; not quite the worst decision ever, but not an exciting book.The lack of action isn't the only disappointing thing about the book. I constantly felt that Wilde was too busy sending messages to the audience to really give his characters life. Every dialogue read less like a real conversation and more like a (sometimes cryptic) scripted debate, and Wilde skips past something like twenty years' worth of Dorian Gray's character development (summarizing the slow corruption in one chapter). Other characters serve only to invoke development in Dorian, and no other characters show any significant development themselves, making the story just slightly distant. Wilde wastes space for the plot to talk about his ideas about human nature, crossing the line between novel and essay too much for my pleasure (\\"...you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\\" [pg. 220] is a good example of Lord Henry voicing Oscar Wilde's opinion on not just Dorian, but on life, and the Victorian generation). Another book that actually balances preaching with plot well is Animal Farm by George Orwell; it manages to simultaneously deliver a message about communism and entertain the audience. If you want a book where it is mostly messages and the entertainment is scarce, Dorian Gray is the book for you.Well, why is the story so famous? Part of its reputation is due to its shock value concerning homosexuality. There were various less-than-covert hints at homosexuality and adultery, which, unfortunately, are no longer effective in the 21st century. Now that the president is praising gay service in the military on national television, it is hard to be amazed about having gay characters in a book, and so a lot of impact is lost on me. Besides these homosexual exchanges between Dorian and the other male characters, the book is fairly void of plot, and Wilde's reliance on shock value make it boring and harder to take seriously at this point in time, no matter how revolutionary his writing may have been back in his era.The book was short enough to read through without losing focus, and to be fair, Wilde's writing is always very elegant with a signature fancy flair. Many of Lord Henry's musings are interesting, and most of the dialogues are widely quotable. The problem is that the story is just a little bit too boring for me to consider it a book you would normally read for fun, and combined with the superb premise of Dorian's magical portrait, this book's plot was really disappointing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I never heard of Dorian Gray until I watched the movie The League of Extraordinary Men. I heard of Dracula [who wasn't in the movie], the Invisible Man, and Jekyl and Hyde, and Captain Nemo. But I have never heard of Quarterman or this guy Dorian Gray, and I wanted to read more about him. The idea of the picture growing old instead of the person, I thought was a brilliant idea. I could not wait to read this book.How disappointing it was for me, but I gave it two stars for two good reasons: the idea and the writer. The idea is quite neat, and I believe Oscar Wilde was ahead of his time when he thought of it. I think he was a genius, and it is apparent in his writings. There are some deep meanings in some of the passages of the book, and it requires a person to sit back and think about what he's saying. I can appreciate that part of it.But I have a huge problem with the characters in the book. I did not like Lord Henry AT ALL. I barely liked Basil, and Dorian was so over the top emotionally. They are all so judgemental and shallow. I knew this book was not going to work for me when Lord Henry kept talking about how beautiful Dorian was. It was just too much. I believe with Oscar Wilde's exceptional talent at writing, he could have made his point in less pages.And then did I miss how Dorian got his wish? Did it just happen out of the blue? Did he go see a witch or someone with supernatural powers? I would love to know how his wish happened. I must have missed it.Anyway, overall, this book is not my cup of tea. No doubt, Oscar Wilde has a lot to say and he's very smart. It is a must in someone's library. Unfortunately, not in mine.Thanks,Joy"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If the book was entitled \\"The Picture of Dorietta Gray\\" it never would have become a classic. The idea of a man's beauty when the book was written and even today is suspect. There is something feminine about a beautiful person, pretty eyes, long eyelashes, a voluptuous mouth and smooth skin. Masculine men are suppose to be rugged even if handsome, a jutting jaw, thin lips and leathery skin. That Dorian was barely a man when his portrait is completed is important because when he wished for eternal youth, he refused to become a man and to be a pretty boy as he aged was itself, a decadent act.The book begins with lots of talk about Art and how Dorian Gray himself was a work of art who shouldn't bother with the hurley burley of real life. His first corruption comes when he can't accept Sybil Vane is so in love him she loses her ability to inhabit the lives the Shakespearean woman she played so well. But then the book become less about how Dorian fails to live up to the art of his life and more about his shadowy, decadent ways.Men and women fall in love with Dorian Gray. After Ms. Vane, it appears that Dorian falls in love with no one but he lurks around the docks, bars and opium dens with other men. What he actually does that is so disreputable is never clear and but for those of us living post Stonewall have a pretty good idea that it involved casual sex with men.The novel anticipates the celebrity that consumes us. It also proudly promotes male beauty in a new way. But after setting up a grand discussion about art and beauty, I think the book transforms into something more pedestrian, a creepy tale of horror where art and beauty are forgotten."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian GrayBy: Oscar WildeReviewed by: M. PoppinsPeriod: 5Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray. Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful. Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met. After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old. His wish came true. Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older. Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished. He never let anyone know about the picture. One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered. Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again. The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him. Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone. He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it. A cry and a crash were heard. A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was. On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful. On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage. They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time. This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot; He didn't know that his wish was to come true. I love when things like that happen!I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand. Also, there was too much philosophy in this book. This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated...&quot; The quote still goes on. I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me. That is what I hate to hear."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I expected Dorian Gray to be rather dry and restrained when I picked it up. However, it is anything but! This is an enjoyable fast paced novel.Basil Hawthorne paints his masterpiece inspired by (and the portrait of) Dorian Gray. In the blush of innocence, Dorian begins to spend time with Basil's friend, Lord Henry who revels in making shocking statements and defying social protocols. A quick study, Dorian takes this to new levels as he - spurred on by Lord Henry and his own vanity - winds his way down a road of moral corruption all the while horrified at the changes on the canvas. When Basil decides that he would like to exhibit the portait (unaware of what has become of the portait while hidden away by Dorian), Dorian can no longer hide the flaws that have been for so long protected from outside eyes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This story was really good. It's about Dorian Gray who is about 18 at the time his friend Basil paints a portrait of him. Gray prays that his portrait would age and he himself would remain young, and of course his prayer is answered.Having been written in the late 1800's, it's hard to get past some of the vocabulary in this book, and also there are endnotes which makes it hard to read because you have to flip to the back and find what that part meant and then go back to reading. Another thing that I didn't like was when the author went on and on about jewels and embroidery - it was so hard to follow and it wasn't necessary the story at all.Overall I liked the story, but it was a tough read, and although it's not a very long book (a little over 200 pages) it is not a light read. I think you should read this book if you're into classic literature, but otherwise I would pick something else."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"When I first bought this book, I expected it to be one of the best novels I had ever read.

If all that excess in the middle had been deleted, I would have given the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"First of all: I wish people would stop deconstructing Oscar Wilde before they deconstruct his message. He should be free to contradict himself, because &quot;the way of paradoxes is the way of truth&quot; (Dorian Gray).

For me it was a new experience, because I haven't read many books from the 19th century. I would believe that at the time when it was first published, it was a very different book for everyone. You can definetly see that the book contains lots of homosexual stuff. I think it's amazing that Oscar Wilde had the courage to write about that at such an early time. The book touched something deep in me even though it didn't have anything to do with my life or my present situation."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Picture of Dorian Gray was written by a man who was egocentric, socially polished and forever looking for the quiticential colloquialism. Notwithstanding, this book was a pleasure to read! It was easy to understand and was smattered with references to events and literature which were likely considered posh by English nobility in the mid-ninteenth century (i.e. Shakespeare, Greek Mythology, etc.). As stated above, this book is very reflective of the author in both spirit and style. I would definately recommend this book to a beginner reader of the English classics, due to its length and lack of confounding implicies which are common for this type of literature."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I wish I could give this book more stars but I can't.

Wilde did an outstanding job in conveying his thoughts and opinions through Lord Henry. Dorian Gray was a very intriguing character who made me really think about myself and my actions. The only downfall of this book, in my opinion, is that there was no substantial background given on Lord Henry. I kept waiting to find out about his history, but there was none.

It does ask some &quot;deep&quot; questions but it doesn't make you really care about the answers; the characters are one-dimensional and transparent. It's hard to seriously relate to any of them, or this story. The writers' language is beautiful in a flowery way. If you want a feel for the book, read the intro/prelude; there are some interesting statements Wilde makes about &quot;ART&quot;. Otherwise, don't bother. There's only so much of art-imitates-life-life-imitates-art you can take."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... \\"The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary.\\" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. \\"I find people infinitely fascinating.\\" Which he quickly followed up with something like, \\"I pay no attention to people at all.\\" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Informative, deep analyis and fascinating to see Wilde's own annotations in the text. Highly recommended for a closer look at a classic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Fistly, I would like to tell you why I'm interested to read this book? I have many reasons to read this book such as my friend is the big fan of Oscar Wilde's stories and she told me that it's a great book, another reason that really made me want to read this book is after I saw the movie called the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, in this movie all charaters are from very well-known book or we can say that they are classic characters. For example Dracula or Vampire, invinsible man(skinner), Dr.Jackle and Mr.Hike, etc.Only one character that I don't know is Dorian Gray(forever young guy), so I find the book to read.When I bought this book, at first I think it would be boring book because it's quite a all style.....but after I read a couple chapters from this book, I change my mind. It's fun, in teresting ideas and use a easy language or I can say that Oscar Wilde use a simple word but feel brilliant and amazing.Another good point for this book is explain the character and place very clear that you can imagine follow the story.I can't say that it's a bad point but it's quite difficult to understand some qoutes but if you read twice or more and think about fact or in a present time you'll understand or may think it's a great qoute.For other thing that I received from this book is social life in the past(around Victorian period), especially for the upper and middle-class people."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The beginning and end of this book were fairly interesting, we get to see Dorian Gray first as a young man (a child essentially) and how he was poked and prodded into becoming the man we see at the end of the book. The middle is somewhat lacking, and I completely lost interest for almost a month before picking the book back up and finishing the story.The story is essentially that of a man who sells his soul for something petty, namely, beauty and about the downfall of not only the main character but also those whom he encounters in his life. It is an interesting story, but I feel that the story could have been written better and become somewhat of a mystery novel. Instead of revealing Dorian's secret at the moment he discovers it, it would have been fun to leave the reader guessing as to why Dorain was so afraid to let others see the great picture of himself, and perhaps delve into the inner turmoil of Dorian a bit more before the conclusion.I have only read the story once, but in future readings I'm sure this story will become more intriguing."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"It's been a while since I read The Picture Of Dorian Gray, but I'll try to review it as well as I can.The Picture Of Dorian Gray takes place in late nineteenth-century England, among the wealthy middle- or lower upper class. It is about Dorian Gray, a young man who is beautiful, charming and popular. His good friend Basil Hallward is painting his portrait, and during a visit at Basil's house he meets Lord Henry, another friend of Basils. Lord Henry is decadent and provocative, and Dorian is very impressed by him and his ideas.Lord Henry tells him about how precious his youth and beauty is, and how awful everything will become when he grows old (\\"When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter then defeats\\").When Basils painting is finished, Dorian sees his own beauty in it and is struck by the fear of aging. He makes a pact with the devil, and sells his soul so that he can remain young and beautiful forever, while his painting grows old and repulsive. His former kind and lovely self is gradually reformed, and he grows evil and corrupt although he still appears just as fresh and innocent as he has always been.This book is not the best one I've read, but it is pretty good. I think that the characters are sometimes turned into caricatures of themselves; they don't really appear to be real persons. Although I really liked Lord Henry's philosophical monologues, they sometimes grew tiresome and a bit too long. The novel, and in particular the ending, is quite predictable.However, the book is beautifully written (like most of the books I've read from that time (but I don't know if it's because of their superiority to the writers of today, or merely because the good ones are the only ones that are left to future generations))(...) There are strong homosexual tendencies in the friendship between Dorian Gray and both Basil and Lord Henry, and their friendship does not feel like a mere friendship.Apart from being a way for Wilde to, through Lord Henry, give voice to some of his philosophical ideas, I think the novel is about the shallowness and hypocrisy of the Victorian society, which considered outward appearance more important than ethics and moral."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"In the book the Picture of Dorian Gray Dorian, the main character makes a powerful wish that impacts his life and the lives of others.

All throughout you want to rush through the pages to see how the story concludes. What will happen to Dorian? What will become of the hideous painting?The book's three main characters are Basil Hallward, the painter; Dorian Gray, the paintee; and Lord Henry, the intellectual mind behind Dorian Gray. It seems as if all of Dorian Gray's evils are inspired by his sidekick, Lord Henry. So, throughout the story, the reader is left asking: &quot;Is this guy a villain?&quot; As to the answer to that question, it still remains uncertain to me.And the ending - oh! - flawless, impeccable, divine! I dare not give it away, for you must venture into those pages to find out where all the events lead to. The last page of the book is truly the climax. You'll be left shivering with sweat trickling down your forehead just to see what happens.&quot;Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature,&quot; Lord Henry claims in one part of the story. Nay, they don't, I must say - for it was an Englishman that produced this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray has to be one of Ocsar Wilde's best books. This book, which takes place in 19th-century England, signifies the high price one young man had to pay for eternal youth.Basil Hallward, a mediocre painter, became infatuated with an extremely hansom but innocent young man, Dorian Gray. It was Dorian's picturesque beauty which inspired Basil to paint his best picture ever. Overcome by the beauty of his youth, Dorian wished that he would ramain young forever and that the portrait would deteriorate with age. However, when Dorian realised that his wish had come true and the picture took on the effects of his sins, his lifestyle signifcantly altered. Dorian went from leading a normal aristocratic life, to living a secretive life full of sin and slander.This book is proof that one can not be happy with youth and beauty alone. The suffering of Dorian Gray shows us that there is more to life than mere beauty. Dorian's life was ruined by a simple wish to be forever young. Although no one can stay young forever, this novel is a key example of why one should not simply focus on base characteristics such as youth and beauty, for these things will always fade."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This edition is slightly shorter than the others available, but it is the ONLY one whose text reflects Wilde's true intentions. Don't be fooled by the other editions claiming to be the \\"unabridged\\" or \\"complete\\" version. The material Wilde added later was meant to make the novel seem more morally edifying. It makes the novel worse. This one is WAY better -- and also way dirtier. A bunch of the more explicit stuff was cut by Wilde's editor. The editor of this ebook version has restored it all, based on Wilde's actual typescript, which he went and consulted in an archive. If you're a homophobe, get the other, more \\"moral\\" versions. If you want to read one of the great modern novels as the author wanted you to read it, get this one. You won't regret spending a couple of extra bucks."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's strange and intriguing mind is apparent in this book, which is full of interesting concepts and bizarre happenings. Dorian Gray, a young man who is obsessed with his own good looks, befriends an English Lord and a struggling painter. After Basil, the painter, finishes Dorian's portrait, they are stunned by its magnificence and how lifelike it appears. Seeing this, Dorian is angered when he realizes that the portrait will live forever and retain its beauty while he himself is left to age. Dorian decides to trade his soul for everlasting youth, and to always retain his beauty, just like the portrait.Since Dorian believes himself to be immortal, he dabbles into various sinful acts. He carelessly pursues a relationship with Sibyl Vane, an actress, constantly letting her down and breaking her heart. Dorian is involved in several mysterious deaths, and he even explores the London underground opium scene. Even though Dorian does all of these things, somehow he remains young, to the surprise of his peers. In the end, however, Dorian receives the punishment he deserves through a series of bizarre events. The &quot;what goes around comes around&quot; theme is strongly emphasized in the conclusion of the novel, which serves as a fitting end for Dorian's struggle with sin.This classic literary work is frequently exciting, but can sometimes delve into the monotony of 19th century British affairs (which may be a little tedious.) All in all, the novel is a wonderful concept which is given life by the genius of Oscar Wilde. It is a perfect research topic as well because it contains many themes which can be applied to anything from English rhetoric to the Original Sin. I myself wrote a term paper on the book and it was very easy to express my ideas because Wilde is so straight forward in his literary agendas. So, whether you pick it for required reading or just for pleasure, The Picture of Dorian Gray is definitely a good choice."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Nota Bene: Once purchased, my Kindle download page contained this note near the download button: \\"This title has complex layouts and has been optimized for reading on Kindle DX's larger screen, but can still be viewed on other Kindle devices.\\" This message disappeared after a few minutes.Regardless, the formatting on my Kindle 2 looks good.

I am glad that I bought it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.Warning - Spoilers FollowHere's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde was one of the foremost representatives of Aestheticism, a movement based on the notion that art exists for no other purpose than its existence itself (\\"l'art pour l'art\\"), not for the purpose of social and moral enlightenment. Born in Dublin and a graduate of Oxford's Magdalen College, he initially worked primarily as a journalist, editor and lecturer, but gradually turned to writing and produced his most acclaimed works in the six-year span from 1890 to 1895, roughly coinciding with the period of his romantic involvement with Lord Alfred \\"Bosie\\" Douglas, sixteen years his junior. Douglas's strained relationship with his father, John Sholto Douglas, Marquees of Queensberry, eventually resulted in a series of confrontations between Wilde and the Marquees, which first led to a libel suit brought by Wilde against his lover's father (who had openly accused Wilde of \\"posing as a sodomite\\" and threatened to disown his son if he didn't give up his acquaintance with the writer) and subsequently to two criminal trials against Wilde for \\"gross indecencies,\\" based on a law generally interpreted to prohibit homosexual relationships. Sentenced to a two-year term of \\"hard labor\\" in Reading Gaol, Wilde emerged from prison in 1897 a spiritually, physically and financially broken man and, unable to continue living in England or Ireland, after three years' wanderings throughout Europe died in 1900 of cerebral meningitis, barely 46 years old.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" Wilde's only novel besides seven plays as well as several works of short fiction, poetry, nonfiction and two fairy tale collections originally written for his two sons, is critical to an understanding of Wilde's body of work and his personality primarily for two reasons: First, because it constitutes one of his earliest fully accomplished formulations of Aestheticism, and secondly because of its undeniable undercurrent of homoeroticism; an inclination which, after a six-year marriage widely thought to initially have been a true love match, Wilde had begun to explore more openly around the time of the novel's creation (1890). The story's title character is an exceptionally handsome young man who, both in the eyes of the artist tasked to paint his portrait, Basil Hallward, and in those of their somewhat older friend Lord Henry Wotton, epitomizes perfect beauty and is coveted by both men for that very reason. Seduced by hedonistic Lord Henry into believing that beauty can literally justify anything, including any act of immorality, Dorian sells his soul for maintaining his beautiful appearance, letting his portrait age in his stead. (In that, his character resembles Goethe's and Marlowe's Faust.) He then quickly turns from an innocent youth into a cruel and calculating man whom society, in its shallow adherence to appearances, nonetheless never associates with any of the results of his cruelty, never looking beyond the surface of his handsome exterior and assuming that a man so beautiful must necessarily also be good. Ultimately it is Dorian himself who brings about his own downfall when he is no longer able to face the manifestation of his evilness in Basil Hallward's picture.Upon its initial publication in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was widely scorned as immoral by a public neither familiar with nor particularly open to the concepts of Aestheticism and its mockery of middle class morality, and repulsed by the thinly veiled homoerotic relationship of the novel's protagonists. Wilde republished the work the following year, adding a preface designed to explain his views on art. Yet, it was that preface which, along with several of his other publications and his written exchanges with Lord Alfred Douglas, ultimately would play a devastating role in his trials, where Queensberry's attorney would come to use an excerpt from that very preface - \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written\\" - to extract from Wilde statements to the effect that any book inspiring a sense of beauty (including, as implied in the attorney's question, an \\"immoral\\" book, if \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" could be qualified as such) was well-written and therefore commendable; that only Philistines, brutes and illiterates - whose views on art he considered invariably stupid and for which he therefore didn't \\"care twopence\\" - could consider this novel \\"perverted,\\" and that the majority of the reading public would probably not be able to draw a proper distinction between a good and a bad book. It was testimony such as this, as well as the impending confrontation with a number of male witnesses ready to testify as to the nature of their relationship with Wilde, that not only caused the author's attorney to convince his client to drop the libel suit against Queensberry but also opened the door for Wilde's own subsequent prosecution.If \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" has a central theme besides the supremacy of beauty and the depiction of a society primarily interested in appearances, it is a call for individuality: Dorian's cruelty is brought out only after he allows himself to be influenced by Lord Henry's equally seductive and cynical hedonism; and similarly, Basil Hallward's blind idolizing of Dorian eventually proves fatal for the painter. - Wilde's only novel is one of the first and most poignant expressions of his own individualism; but unlike his protagonist, who ultimately pays a ghastly prize for selling his soul and giving up his individuality, Wilde paid as high a price for maintaining his. Like Dorian, he knew that \\"[e]ach of us has Heaven and Hell in him,\\" and although this novel's preface ends with the provocative statement that \\"[a]ll art is quite useless,\\" it was the very fact that Wilde put his entire being into his art that ultimately destroyed him. But like beauty, which is finally restored to perfection in Dorian Gray's portrait, Wilde's works have stood the test of time; and not merely for their countless, pricelessly witty epigrams. They're as well worth a read as ever.Also recommended:Complete Works of Oscar Wilde (Collins Classics)Oscar WildeWilde (Special Edition)The Oscar Wilde CollectionThe Picture of Dorian GrayThe Importance of Being Earnest - Criterion CollectionThe Importance of Being EarnestAn Ideal HusbandA Good Woman"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others.

I didn't really intend on reading it, but after fumbling through the first chapter, I was intrigued and soon thereafter was captivated by it. This book has mixed themes that are gothic horror at one moment, amoral and corrupt the next, followed by social political statement. I have not read a book before that compares with this one and is indeed one of the best that I have read. This book is full of quotes and one liners that are striking, thought provoking, and even horrifying to the reader. The Picture of Dorian Gray is a great book to read and discuss with a friend or a book club."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I'm a sophomore in high school and usually I don't go for these older, classic books. Usually they bore me so much I can barely finish them. However, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was an exception to this rule. Though the language was a bit more intricate than is commonly found in the books of today (at least the ones I like to read), I found it to be more elegant and eloquent than tiresome and confusing.This book, with all of its discussion of morals, evil, and purity really is a window into late 1800s of England. Despite this, I found the book to actually be interesting. The real appeal this book held for me was its wonderfully potent imagery and mildly creepy, definitely surreal theme. \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is also a very short book, which I thought was pretty cool because I don't have a very long attention span concerning books. In spite of how today's people are probably a great deal more jaded concerning morals, or rather the lack thereof, than the people of Oscar Wilde's time, a lot of this book was fascinating in an almost perverted way. That aspect is offset by the theme of good vs. evil, however. The only faults I found with this book were minor details concerning the definitions of good and evil, issues which I think this book was meant to rise anyway.If you're a parent or someone looking to buy a classic book for a friend or relative in high school, I think this would be a pretty good choice, assuming they like books. The vocabulary seemed fairly advanced to me, but they ought to be able to handle it. The conflict between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" in this book is engaging, and the nature of the book is such that the reader has difficulty simply viewing matters in black and white. This makes the book deeper and more interesting to read. The transformations that occur in this book are slightly haunting, and at the end of this twisting tale of corruption and beauty lies a powerful, sudden, and very awesome ending. I really think that everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"My feelings about this book are nicely summed up by Dorian Gray's description of a hedonistic book he has received from Lord Henry Wotton: \\"I didn't say I liked it...I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.\\"The basic plot of the story is well known: thanks to mysterious/magical intervention the physical consequences of Dorian's action affect his portrait rather than his physical body. Urged on by Lord Henry Wotton (whose shocking/amusing/wicked epigrams are classic Oscar Wilde), Dorian descends into a life of ever-increasing debauchery, manipulation, hedonism, and the love of beauty above all else.Wilde brings up a number of themes in sometimes dizzying succession: the ability to \\"dominate\\" others, beauty as the supreme virtue, self-actualization as the guide to morality, yielding to temptation as a means of getting beyond temptation, physical consequences vs. consequences in general, the fascination of wickedness, etc. It is often unclear where Wilde stands on these matters since their proponent is Wotton who is \\"wicked\\" and the cause of much suffering, but speaks in the manner of Oscar Wilde. The moral ambiguity of the story lets the reader draw their own conclusions...fascinating."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Dorian Gray is influenced by Basil's friend Lord Henry. Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.What will become of Dorian?What will become of Dorian's painting?What would you do if you were Dorian?Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Part humorous fable, part mystery, part gothic suspense, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is another example of the late 1800s fascination with the soul, the senses, and science.Dorian Gray is a mere teen when the story begins, the muse of a local gifted artist, who paints Dorian's portrait in hopes of capturing his youth and beauty. Dorian's charm is also appreciated by Lord Henry, a rascally fellow, able to twist phrases and morals with his sly tongue. His winsome ways captivate Dorian, but Dorian soon finds himself pulled in the direction of a beautiful actress as well. These two loves tear Dorian in different directions, resulting in unexpected turns of events that send him down a road of sin and pleasure, though never with the rewards of true happiness. As his actions lead to even more drastic results, he finds himself fearing every shadow and questioning his own sanity.These events do not occur in a vacuum. With Dorian's sliding moral state, the portrait of his beauty begins reflecting the dark decay in his soul. Even as his own face refuses to age or show corruption, the painting becomes uglier by the day. Dorian is both fascinated and appalled by this. When, at last, he faces the consequences of his own selfish choices, he makes one final decision to try to destroy the evidence.I laughed aloud at many parts, particularly early in the book, then found the tone growing eerie and black. What a thought-provoking book! And one that kept my attention throughout. This is no glossed-over portrait of Mr. Gray, but a grisly depiction of evil--even when it masquerades in a cloak of civility.Oscar Wilde joined other writers of his day--H.G. Wells, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joseph Conrad--in wrestling with concepts of the soul and the senses in the light of scientific discoveries. What about the conscience? Where did theology and psychology fit in? What about free will? In the last few pages, Wilde paints his own sobering portrait of a man who has tried to live as though the soul and senses have no effect on each other.This now ranks as one of my favorite classic novels. The results of Dorian Gray's experiment serve as a mirror for all those who consider themselves holy, heathen, or hypocrite."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is another one of those classics that I'd heard mentioned in passing or read about but never actually sat down to read. It's short, only 200ish pages long - but don't let the short length of it deceive you, it packs a fairly powerful punch.The premise fascinated me from the moment I read it. Innocent young man who manages to remain that way on the outside, but a portrait of him changes to reflect the corruption of his soul. Fascinating, no?I'm positive that this book has been dissected and analyzed from all sorts of different points of view, so let me tell you what I got out of it.I felt the tragedy, deeply. The corruption of a soul is something that is unpleasant to read, unpleasant to see and seeing the effect it has on others is difficult to deal with at times.It's interesting because I read this novel while I am still continuing to work my way through George Eliot's Middlemarch. Whereas I am having such a difficult time relating to and feeling emotions from Eliot's characters, there was such a wealth of emotion being poured out of Wilde's it was almost overwhelming. I felt the passion of love and the despair when it was lost.By the way dialogue was incredible, it makes the book, honestly. I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it. And if you haven't read it in a while, go back and read it now. It's going on my \\"yearly re-read\\" shelf for certain."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I've always known the basic premise but never actually read The Picture of Dorian Gray. Also like many here, I couldn't resist the free version after reading the reviews. The story is original (though of course well told after over a hundred years of publication) and the writing is eloquent and witty. I agree that the chapter about Dorian's exploits and collections did drag on a little but it acted as a segue from youth to middle age and was kind of necessary to show how the years were passed. Otherwise, the entire work was very engaging. I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try. Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade. While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old. Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing. The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time. The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature. Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters. You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring. Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.The second half of the book is by far the strongest. Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are. I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book. That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read. Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing. The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises. I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) is best known today for his witticisms and classic plays such as \\"Lady Windemere's Fan\\" and \\"The Importance of Being Ernest.\\" However, Wilde also wrote short stories, poems and in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" a short but fascinating novel.The tale is a retelling of the Germanic legend of Doctor Faust. Young Dorian Gray is influenced by the evil Mephisto figure Henry Wotton to make a pact with the forces of evil. Gray will not age despite a career of debauchery, decadence, opium usage and murder. However, the portrait of him by the artist Basil Hallward will age as Gray descends into an inferno of crime.The Marguerite love interest from the Faust legend is young Sybil Vane. Sybil is a \\"vain\\" callow actress who portraits the great Shakesperean female roles such as Rosalind, Juliet and others every night on the stage of a seedy London theatre. Gray marries her but she commits suicide since the girl realizes he fell in love with the stage heroines and not herself. Sybil's brother the sailor Jack Vane will return from sea to seek out vengeance against Dorian Gray. He will be unsuccessful being shot during a hunting accident on a wealthy estate at which Gray is spending a weekend. Basil Hallward is the young artist who will be murdered by Gray who is driven mad by the haunting picture of himself. The novel ends in a way never to be forgotten by the reader.Oscar Wilde published this short novel in 1890. In many ways it resembles the better book \\"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" published in 1886 by Robert Louis Stevenson. That earlier work, like Dorian Gray, also looks at a character with a divided self in conflict with the norms and morality of society.Wilde's book is filled with aphorisms most of which are delivered by the cynical Henry Wotton The author is good at painting a scene so we feel as if we ourselves were in the garden and drawing room of wealthy Dorian Gray's London home or seeking an opium den in the foggy slums of fin de siecle London.The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the best selling classics in the Penguin Classics catalogue. It is a satisfying piece of fiction which will make you think on the nature of evil, the human mind and how role playing and mask wearing are part of everyday life."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I have read this book many times, and enjoyed it more each time that I did. I have to admit that Lord Henry's wit and wisdom was what kept me coming back to the book, not the important and intellectual issues about art, life, temptations and all the literary matters. I know there are other reviews with the literary facts and theories presented there, better than I can, so I'm not going to try.All I will say is this is a classic, worth more than 5 stars, should be read by everyone at least once in your life, first for the great writing, if its your first time reading Wilde, this is a great book to start with. You should read it slowly, because Wilde is a word smith, no words for words sake, each one polished like the gems that they are. If one could speak like he wrote one would be like a god, or have a late night talk show better than all others.Second, this is a good, clear and complete edition, so now you have no excuses, read on MacDuff, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Wilde sees the world more clearly than any writer of fiction in the last century. It is for that reason that his work is so filled with countless paradoxes and contradictions that challenge the mind and titillate the senses. Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative.

Wilde lived in an infinitely ironic age, when society had grown so influential as to crowd out the individuals that made it up. Today, we have taken for granted this incongruity and so our writers cannot express the kind of irony that Wilde mastered, despite the fact that we all know that something is amiss.\`The Picture of Dorian Gray' is filled with this irony. The plot shows us the ultimate irony of a man giving up his soul for the beauty of youth--the condition that is exalted in the modern age above all else, intellect, truth, justice, life itself. Interspersed are dialogues and epigrams that persist one hundred years later as some of the finest word handling ever recorded. Even a few samples should compel the potential reader:\\"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.\\"\\"Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.\\"\\"A man cannot be too careful in his choice for his enemies.\\"\\"The only difference between a caprice and a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little bit longer.\\"\\"Men marry because they are tired, women marry because they are curious. Both are disappointed.\\"\\"I love acting, it is so much more real than life.\\"- \\"I am on the side of the Trojans, they fought for a woman.\\"- \\"They were defeated.\\"The mastery of wit that Wilde displays must be seen in its context. He was a decadent as much as the characters he portrays are. Ultimately, the disillusion that the decadent faces comes through in the story and the reader is left with a very uneasy feeling upon completing \`Dorian Gray.' Is life as absurd as it seems? Is there a solution? Or are we stuck with a life of paradox? Perhaps our current period of decadence will show us an alternative. Until it does, we can enjoy the astounding word play offered here."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is haunting, lovely and a great read.

I don't generally like historical fiction much, but I got an assignment in my English class about banned books where we had to pick one to read, so I decided it was the perfect time to pick it up! I surprised myself when I ended up really enjoying the book. It's a great work and definitely a book that everyone should pick up at some point in their lives.Although there were a few characters I didn't enjoy so much, this book was overall incredible. Every book has a couple stumbles and can't really be perfect; but you know you have a true classic when the spectacular parts of the book are so spectacular that you kind of forget about the things you didn't like so much and fall in love with the book anyway. But it's not one of those books where I can easily point out what it is I liked about the book-the love for it was so gradual, I'm not sure at what point I feel head over heels for it or why!Important note! I'd recommend reading the introduction (if you read the version I did) AFTER you've already finished the novel! The introduction has a few spoilers for the book, though it doesn't explicitly say what happens. However, it was much easier to understand already knowing everything that happens.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"An absolute classic. This has always been my favorite. I highly recommend this book. It gets better everytime I read it!"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This book is a classic. Mostly because it was the one book that Oscar Wilde wrote and it express a philosophy of the time in a fictional setting in a very unique fashion. The covert homosexuality is clear, for my personal taste, tolerable. It was an important part of his life. Also, the price was right: free."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" was the only novel written by Oscar Wilde. The basic idea behind it is well-known even to those who have never read the book or seen any of various film adaptations. A beautiful young man named Dorian Gray possesses a portrait of himself, painted by his friend Basil Hallward. Dorian, who is very vain about his looks, expresses the wish that he could remain young and beautiful while the portrait grows old, only to find that he has made an unwitting Faustian bargain, because this is precisely what happens. Influenced by the hedonistic philosophy of another friend, Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gives himself over to a life of debauchery, remaining forever young while the signs of ageing begin to appear on the painting. The portrait, moreover, does not simply reflect Dorian's chronological age. It also acts as a reflection of the state of his soul. By the end of the story Dorian is no more than middle-aged, but the picture is that of a hideous old man, disfigured by a life of sin and vice.When the novel was first published in 1890 (in magazine form) it was highly controversial, for two reasons. The first reason was its undoubted homoerotic overtones, although Wilde toned these down somewhat when the novel was published in book form the following year. Explicit gay sex scenes would, of course, have been taboo in the 1890s, but coded references to famous homosexual lovers from history and mythology (Hadrian and Antinous, Edward II and Piers Gaveston, Jupiter and Ganymede) can be taken as an indication that Dorian's debauches are not exclusively of the heterosexual variety. There is also an indication that Basil's feelings for Dorian, and possibly Lord Henry's as well, go beyond mere friendship.The other reason why the novel was so controversial was that Wilde was wrongly thought to be espousing Lord Henry's world view and advocating a love of beauty and pleasure as the only good in life. This impression was strengthened by Wilde's Preface, which consists solely of twenty-five epigrams about art, including \\"There is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all\\". These statements appear to align Wilde with the literary and cultural movement known as Aestheticism, or sometimes as the Decadent Movement. This movement adopted as its slogan \\"Art for Art's Sake\\", interpreted by many of its followers such as the French poet Theophile Gautier as a denial of the idea that there was any association between art and morality.Wilde's epigrams, however, should not be taken as the Twenty-Five Articles of a prescriptive artistic credo; they were rather intended as provocative aphorisms intended to stimulate discussion. The author himself frequently wrote works with a quite overt moral agenda- children's stories like \\"The Selfish Giant\\", social satires like \\"A Woman of No Importance\\" and \\"An Ideal Husband\\", poems like \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\". Indeed, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" itself can be interpreted as an overtly moral work. In a letter, Wilde said of the three main characters: \\"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry is what the world thinks me: Dorian is what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps\\"- an interesting remark, given that Basil is both the only character in the novel who is a creative artist and also the representative of a traditional, and often explicitly Christian, morality, which contrasts sharply with Henry's amoralism. Henry is a cynical dandy, much given to witty aphorisms, but like other similar characters in Wilde's works is not to be taken as a self-portrait of the author.If Dorian is a Faust-figure, Henry is his Mephistopheles, but he is a devil less corrupt than the man he tempts. For all Henry's cynicism, he never descends into the depths of depravity in the same way as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; does. He never quite has the courage to practise what he preaches, being guilty of what might be called inverted hypocrisy, making himself out to be worse than he really is. As Basil says to him \\"You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\\" Dorian's sins, however, are not limited to sexual debauchery and drug addiction (he becomes an habitu&eacute; of opium dens). His callous behaviour drives his fianc&eacute;e, the young actress Sibyl Vane, to suicide, and in an attempt to preserve himself from exposure he resorts to blackmail and murder.One thing that does link Wilde to the Aesthetic movement is his undoubted love of physical beauty; the story is written in a very rich, lush style with many striking descriptive passages, such as the opening description of the beautiful summer's day on which Dorian first meets Henry. Yet his attitude to Aestheticism is a critical one, and is perhaps closer to that of earlier writers such as Ruskin and Morris, both of whom promoted an appreciation of beauty not as an end in itself but as part of a wider political and social agenda. Wilde clearly saw the limitations, and the dangers, of a cult of beauty divorced from moral and human concerns. It is perhaps significant that, after committing his murder, Dorian sits down to calm his nerves by reading the poetry of Gautier, the writer most closely associated with the \\"art for art's sake\\" ideology. He breaks off his engagement to Sibyl after seeing her give a bad performance in the theatre; her explanation for the decline in her acting skills is that, having discovered real love, she can no longer be inspired by fictional love. For him, artistic concerns are paramount over human ones; for her, it is the other way round.As one might expect from the only novel of a highly original, idiosyncratic writer, the book occupies a unique place in the history of English literature. It is sometimes classified as Gothic fiction, and the work to which it bears the greatest similarity is perhaps another classic \\"Gothic\\" novel from the late 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\", published five years earlier. Like Stevenson, Wilde wanted to explore the duality within the human soul between the virtuous public side and the darker private side which we are compelled to keep hidden. As a homosexual forced to conceal his homosexuality, this theme had an obvious appeal for him.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a complex, multi-layered work, and there is insufficient space in this review to touch on all its many aspects. It is, however, a work which well deserves its status as a literary classic more than a century after the death of its author."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is to my knowledge, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. It is very intelligent and at some points, rather dark, but that all makes it even more fun! The story is that Dorian Gray, is a young man who finds the thought of aging, rather depressing. As it so happens, his best friend is an artist, who has been quite happy to paint a portrait of Dorian. Upon witnessing his youth preserved in art, Mr. Gray wishes it could perhaps, be the other way around...and his wish is granted but, in a nightmarish way. For now the painting reflects his sins. Believe me, he has more than enough. This is a great, if tragic story and I'm so glad it was free, as this was my first time reading it! Also, this book is positively packed with good quotes so, now's the time to create a My Clippings file on your Kindle."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (Tor, 1891)I cannot comment on the scariness of &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em>, the only novel ever written by Oscar Wilde. Why? Because, despite the reams of column inches I've read over the years on how scary the blessed thing is, I couldn't find myself even turning a hair. Simply put, Wilde was a comedian, albeit a bitter, misanthropic comedian. The man didn't have it in him to write horror the way the Jameses (M. R. or Henry, take your pick) or Poe did. (Though one should note that none of those three acknowledged masters of nineteenth-century horror ever produced what we would consider, today, a novel-length work of horror, whereas Wilde did; Poe's only novel was a fantasy, while the longest works of James one and James two are both novelettes.) So if you go into it expecting a horror novel, you may well find yourself disappointed. If you look at it, however, as yet another exposition of the incredible strengths of Oscar Wilde's creativity--the biting satire, the homosexuality so repressed it's half-erotic when someone stands up from a table, the rampant quotability--then like everything else the man ever wrote, &lt;em>The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/em> will be right up your alley. It contains some of Wilde's most-recognized one-liners (\\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.\\", \\"If the cave-man had known how to laugh, history would have been different\\", \\"It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.\\", and dozens of others), some thoroughly entertaining characters, a plot as old as time itself bent to Wilde's indomitable will, and any number of good, solid laugh-out-loud moments. It also, of course, comes with an excellent backstory that inspired Wilde's most important one-liner of all: \\"There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written.\\" Needless to say, were this not the former, there wouldn't have been such an uproar over it, would there? ***"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The book \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", written by Oscar Wilde, deals with the issue of getting old and the question of how you want to live your life. In my opinion the book is a typical book from Oscar Wilde which shows the difficulties and the pressures in the community. Oscar Wilde is a critical author who always writes about his own point of view. Furthermore you can also learn about his personality and the society this time.I think that the Picture of Dorian Gray represents the wish from every person to stay young and beautiful with all the opportunities and chances, waiting for you to grab them. Also the second chance and the possibillity to change is a facility which is usually offered to the youth.Also the end is a perfect rounding which brings all topics and themes together to one point. And as Oscar Wilde shows in his opinion, the point is not how you look, it is more how you lived and what you did. At least the ending says that when you die,you die as the person you were and it does not matter who you pretend you are.The story of Dorian Gray is in my opinion a very gripping book which did not leave me until I finished it. And even then it makes me think about these things. Oscar Wilde's writing is very fast-moving and there are no long or boring scences in the book.Bringing all considerations together I have to say that I enjoyed the book very much, which is why I have read it in only three hours."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"The Picture of Dorian Gray is Oscar Wilde's color commentary on the tug of war between Basil Hallward (good) and Lord Henry Wotton (evil--think Wormwood in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters). The rope they pull is the young Dorian Gray. The score in this classic battle is widely known; in the end Wotton pulls Gray completely to his end of the field with Hallward dragged face-down in the mud. For those who have not read it, I will not reveal the absolute ending.Several themes apply to us all: the high price of pleasure and self-indulgence as a way of life; the absurdity of our superficial preoccupation with outward beauty; and how idolizing appearances blinds us to the truth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"What would a portrait of your soul look like?More than anything else, this question beats at the heart of this thought provoking book.For Oscar Wilde, his alter ego Dorian Gray would not be too pretty.As the book demonstrates, years of sin ultimately rob Gray of his youthful beauty. But, consistent with a wish made by Gray, this theft occurs only a canvas copy of him made by an adoring male artist when Gray was still young.While it would seem that eternal youth is a great prize, especially to the very vain Gray, it ends up becoming a curse. Gray locks the aging picture away in an attic only periodically returning to it to witness the ravages that would have been visited upon him were he not to have made his wish.In this way, while Gray is permitted to retain his external beauty, he's also forced to witness his moral deterioration.As with the more contemporary Angels in America, self reproach over one's homosexuality moves deeply along the subcurrents of this book. Though most don't know it, homosexuality was prohibited by law in Great Britain until 1967 and those convicted of it were forced into harsh punishments and even harsher treatments intended to \\"cure\\" them.It's this deeper sense that most people resonate with in one way or another...substituting their own private sins for those of Gray in their estimation of their moral appearance.Having said all that, it still prompts consideration that Gray himself and his friend Lord Henry -- sinful that they are -- are the most interesting characters in this book. Unintentionaly (perhaps), Wilde is suggesting that it's our sins that make us noteworthy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into.The first half is a vehicle for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading. The second half of the book tells the majority of the story and is a much more accessable read.Would I reccomend this book? I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film (1945 starring George Saunders and Angela Lansbury) and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a review for the Penguin Classics hardcover edition of \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", ISBN: 0141442468. Amazon.com, despite its general excellence, fails to take into account the bibliophile for whom the quality of the edition he determines to purchase matters, so, this is not a review for the intellectual content of the volume I have recently bought, but, rather, a review of the quality of this particular volume's production.I had hoped, that Penguin had finally decided to market its considerable store of intellectual wealth to those who desire a book of some distinction, to those who still admire the craftsmanship of a finely wrought tome. Largely, in this edition (and in those others, similar to it) they have succeeded. The cloth covers of these editions are attractively designed; the typesetting modern, attractive, and readable; the cloth marker a thoughtful edition. However--and this is a thing unabidable--the binding is glued and does not have signatures. Sewn signatures are a sign that some care has been taken to ensure the longevity of a book. The crude, merely glued together pages make this volume little better than some cheap paperback in deceiving, meretricious garb. I will not again be purchasing a book from this line, and would advise anyone else to avoid doing the same."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty. He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes. Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is. Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded. When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place. When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life. Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download. This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been. To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself. Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book. And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus. It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it. I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray. He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place. Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story? It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it. Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This novel is one of the best classics available. It is more entertaining for its controversy value than for anything else. Lord Henry Wotton is probably the most engaging character in the entire novel, and one gets the impression he is the mouthpiece of Oscar Wilde himself.

This is a fast pased book that doesn't have a single speed bump, you are forced to create them yourself putting down the book every few chapters to marvel at EVERYTHING. The dialog is world class, the theme's truer today than back then, the characters moving and dynamic, all tied up in as few of pages as possible. With the exception of one chapter, you'll know it when you read it.The dialog, I haven't read a book that I am more impressed with. The poet and playwrite in Wilde shows through here. The constant gloomy witt of Lord Henry is awesome. The dinner scenes are great, and you just want to memorize a few sayings to pull out at the next party you go to. Things like, \\"The only way to get rid of temptation is to yeild to it.\\", or \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\" Now you might come off thinking this is a book for an angry teenager, but there is a lot more here than that. If you are an angry teenager though.... read this book you will not regret it.This book cannot be avoided for anyone who considers themselves well read. Also a great intoduction into the world of literature. I recomend this book to anyone that has only read Harry Potter or Twilight, it is an extremely easy read and for its age surprisingly undated, and shows how older books are just as entertaining, yet more thought provoking, and what good writing looks like.

This was not a comfortable read for me; in fact, it was quite difficult for me to finish. However, the difficulty did not arise because it was poorly executed; rather, it was so well done that I couldn't bear to watch the destruction of one man's soul.Oscar Wilde writes beautifully and eloquently, and this book overflows with witticisms and epigrams that are eminently quotable. However, many of these bon mots come from the observations of Lord Harry, who is the cynic that leads Dorian Gray down the road of temptation and vice. For that reason, I could not fully enjoy all of these wonderful sallies, knowing from whom they came and whose mind composed them.Dorian Gray is by no means an innocent throughout this book. However, he begins the book as An Ideal - the physical embodiment of all that is good, youthful, innocent and free of sin. In fact, his ideal purity is what inspires his friend, Basil, to paint the titular picture of Dorian Gray. Once Dorian makes the acquaintance of Basil's friend, Lord Harry, however, Dorian is fascinated by Lord Harry's worldly and cosmopolitan views. In a burst of youthful enthusiasm, Dorian wishes for the picture to bear the physical outcomes of his actions so that Dorian can retain his beauty. He soon discovers that his wish has been granted. Adopting Lord Harry's way of life, Dorian descends into a lifestyle of vice and pleasure seeking and perversely (and childishly?) anticipates the devastation he can wreak on the portrait without bearing any evidence on his own physical form.The levels of Harry's influence, Dorian's self-destruction, and Dorian's blindness to the true elements of his fall from \\"goodness\\" combined to make for a powerful read. I couldn't help but get a Faustian vibe throughout this novel, and I found myself calling Harry (in my head) \\"Mephisto! Mephisto!\\"The story told in \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" of the ruination of a man's good character and moral compass is terrible, tragic, and, despite the fantastical nature of a portrait that reveals the blackness of one's soul, terrifyingly realistic."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is really a must read, I recommend it highly.

At first I thought it was going to be an old fashioned novel hard to understand, but in the contrary, even when it was written in 1890 Oscar Wilde criticizes so many attitudes and behaviors that our society still has. The book was quite \\"revealing\\" for me, it put into words so many thoughts and ideas in which I agree. What I liked the most about it are the amusing quotes and phrases that it has, it was quite difficult to choose my favorite one, most of them from Lord Henry for me the best character. Lord Henry has a unique style, like the book says \\"I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.\\" For me he is like a paradox, and I like him for that because he is like the opposite of me. I think the book makes you want to have a good discussion with him. In general I think Oscar Wilde like the painter Bassil in Dorian Gray's portrait, puts so much of him on the book. His thoughts, ideas, critics and points of view are clearly reflected. I really recommend the Picture of Dorian Gray, for me is a must read book.

The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.Is sin inseparable part of one's life? No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul? Oscar Wilde would agree. The novel is an intense meditation on morality. Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality. Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur. His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old. During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly. His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul. One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life. Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it. The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it. His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms. We age because we sin. Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life. As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that \`Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination? Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit? Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others? If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption. And we need to attain it through Him. If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins. Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel. Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart. Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel. The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art. This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray. In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's. The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay. Art affects lives exorbitantly. Art changes lives. Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart. Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that \`All art is quite useless\\"? Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled \`useless'. The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend. Art, here, gave him a new life. Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life. Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics. It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time. The movement was called \`Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s. Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting. Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective. He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin. Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\" -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\" -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.=== Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"\\"\`Always' is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it. Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever. It is a meaningless word too. The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\\"\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"To define is to limit.\\"\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy. To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life. I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme. Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes or drug usage. Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"If I had read this book decades ago, I would rate it higher. Today it would be difficult to get people to read it. As a former English teacher, I was fascinated and intrigued by Wilde's sentence structure and word choice; most readers today would find it stilted and actually difficult to read. In addition, the class structure adds more problems for understanding how the characters behaved. Lastly, the older British custom of describing men and their feelings about their friends would put off many readers. (Same problem with some of Shakespeare's sonnets.) While it is certainly a classic, there are many contemporary authors who deal with the theme as well as Wilde. It is probably a great choice for English literature majors; however. I suspect the general public could invest their time better with another book."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This is a great book... slow read, drawn out... just like i remember.

In this story, Dorian Gray is an extraordinarlily good looking man. As he is so beautiful, painters use him as a sitter. One day, as he is looking over a portait of himself he realizes the fragility of his beauty and wishes for portrait of himself to grow old, rather than himself. For this, he would give his soul; and that was exacly what happened.This is no ordinary book. This book is funny and interesting. While reading this book, you will find that it is saturated with Wilde's epigrams and wonderful sense of humor.

Do you want to know why this doesn't make him happy? Magnificent ending. Read it"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Still controversial today, Wilde's study of a man's moral distintigration is both richly poetic and ultimately disturbing. The book even resists classification today. Is it part of the Decadence movement or the Symbolist movement?Or is it an experimental novel, fashioned perhaps as a psychological gothic study? More importantly, though, Wilde's creation poses the question: Can a book be poisonous? Gray succumbs to the &quot;evil&quot; influence of Huysmans' book A Rebours. As Wilde as written, &quot;there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book. Books are well written or badly written.&quot; Wilde may have created a well written book, but he also, albeit purposely, created a book when, viewed from its many horizons, can be seen as terrible moral study in the lesson Gray undergoes."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":". . .of what we love about books: superior critical work, excellent physical presentation.

Finally decided to re-read it in English. I was astonished as to how differently I perceived it this time around. Without a question, Wilde is a master of words, but the subject of this book was questionable. It appeared to me, that Wilde was set on pushing his own philosophy and views of life and self onto others, and, as I read it, I found myself rejecting it with every fiber of my being. I was rather surprised to have such a strong reaction to this piece of literature. Would not read again and would not recommend it to others either. Just my two cents."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"This may be entirely shallow, but I bought 8 of these books just because I was obsessed with the cover design.....they look so great on the shelf, and I am sure they are good reads too!

My only qualm...the pages are bright white, and I wish they had gone with a more \\"vintage-y\\" look on the inside to match the outside. But I guess they will get that with age ;)"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Normally, I would love a Gothic novel, even if it flaunts conventions and is highlighted by long-winded descriptions of proper gentility. However, The Picture of Dorian Gray gets bogged down with trifles too often, which is distracting. There is an air of stuffiness and superficiality that becomes a little tiresome.Also, there are few redeeming characters in the novel, as the principal ones are nauseating. Take Lord Henry for instance. His long-winded philosophies and monologues dominate a good deal of the book; rather than adding much to the story, they become heavy-handed, like a point is being shoved in our face too often. And, then there is Dorian. So overdramatic and high-maintenance. Everything revolves around him and his precious little world. I get that he is supposed to be vain and materialistic, but there's little sympathy for him at all, especially when you realize he's more about forgetting his sins than actually repenting them. I realize that Wilde is philosophizing through his characters and the plot, but the means with which he goes about this is tedious.Still, there are redeeming aspects to the novel. Wilde does give us a moral to take away from the reading experience, as the Faustian angle of selling one's soul for beauty becomes apparent in Dorian's life. As Dorian ultimately chooses vanity over spirit and conscience, he sets the wheels of fate in motion. With devil in disguise Lord Henry egging him on, he gradually sees the portrait embody his tarnished soul: vanity, pleasures, sins. Wilde does give the book a very Gothic vibe. Dorian's portrait almost seems alive with grotesqueness, something horrible and monstrous hiding behind that sneer.While I did enjoy the Gothic aspects and the moral to Wilde's novel, I didn't like this novel as much as others."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I've only just started reading the book but so far I've enjoying what I've read of it to this point."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I ordered this book some months ago for my love, and it arrived quickly and was in phenomenal shape; exactly as the description stated, and was priced very fairly."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"Only read three pages.

We rented Dorian Gray with Ben Barnes and Colin Firth. It is loosely based on the book. I like the book better. There are several movies out about the book.

Like most of his works this novel is few in characters, but copious in themes. The novel captures the ideals of aestheticism or \\"beauty for beauty's sake\\", a philosophy for which Wilde was a spokes person and prominent proponent. He used this novel as an opportunity to combine the elements of aestheticism with his observations of larger social themes of the era and really define his philosophy as it pertained to society. As part of the observed social themes, the novel incorporates Wilde's refined ideas relating to the supremacy of art and society's view upon decadence, duplicity, and beauty. Yet despite Wilde's attempt to bring focus to his ideas of aestheticism his novel serves as juxtaposition to his ideals if not the exact opposite.Aestheticism was a movement that sought to free art of the restricting responsibility of having a meaning and also of being moral or immoral. Wilde was under the impression that art, of all forms, need serve no purpose but be beautiful. In his novel Wilde uses two prominent symbols of these ideas: the picture which represents beauty and the unnamed yellow book that served as a symbol that literature also needed to moral restrictions. Though his intentions may have been to advance his own ideas, this novel serves to counter that for despite the idea that art have no purpose this novel gives a purpose to both of the aforementioned symbols. The picture is transformed into a mirror of sorts and through this mirror the world can see the corruption and age that Dorian's physical self has been spared. Wilde created the idea that Dorian's portrait became a portal into which he could look and see the nature of his soul and its transformation as his actions corrupted it. The novel itself may have escaped morality but served as a guide to which Dorian became corrupt. Therefore the novel served the purpose of being the catalyst causing Dorian's corruption. This simply proves that although it is possible to subvert and avoid moral restrictions everything can be interpreted to serve a purpose and thus nothing can escape having a purpose.The primary principle of aestheticism is the importance placed upon beauty to which Wilde ties this in with the superficiality of society. Throughout the novel Dorian is influenced by the philosophy of Lord Henry, who believes that beauty and the senses are the most important values, and beauty reigns for most of the novel. Wilde writes of how society places such high a value on beauty and refers to it as the most valuable of commodities for it is soon to be lost. The idea is that beauty is the only thing of importance. For throughout the novel Dorian is treated the same by the company he keeps despite his ethics. This is a clear representation of aestheticism in which beauty need have no relation to ethics. Wilde juxtaposes this idea with that of another character who believes that the price is too high. The way in which Dorian meets his doom confirms this second idea, for he gives his soul. However, at the end of the novel beauty is still held to the upmost of importance which again refers to the both the value of beauty and society's superficial nature. Yet the reader comes away feeling that beauty is something dangerous to value so highly, as is apparent by the demise of the model of beauty, Dorian Gray.Wilde may have intended for his novel to further his own philosophy however, The Picture of Dorian Gray, does the exact opposite. Wilde effectively illustrated both the flaws in a society that valued beauty so highly and the flaws in his own philosophy."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I got this free for my iPad and I enjoyed reading it.

I think this is one of the few times I would say see the film first and then read the book. The book alone is not the best showcase for the genius of Oscar Wilde. would love to give this a five star review because I am a great fan of Oscar Wilde from his well known works to De Profundis, but the inconsistancy of this story made it difficult to get into. The first half is a way for Wilde's wit, unfortunately at the expense of story line and character developement, although I should that for me the wit of Oscar Wilde was reason enough to keep me reading.

My experience is that school actually demotivates people from wanting to read. How many of us can relate with the feelings of never wanting to read another book after high school. When grades are the motivation to read, people search for the cliff notes and or look for reviews in Encyclopedias. In my High School English class, grades were given on the basis of how many books one read. If you read 8-10 you received an A. The problem was that after knowing one was going to get an A, all reading stopped. Reading is supposed to be done for the joy of it. I hear the word boring used a great deal when reviewing a book. I know so many kids who end up hating reading because they received a poor grade. The classics are challenging books. I would never use boring as an adjective to describe a book however."},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","review":"I feel sad that I couldn't give this book more than two stars.
