From my personal recollection: I tried to take an introductory graduate-level DSP course twice, once with the old DSP text (but did not get to finish), and the second time completing the course from another college with the DTSP text. DSP, in spite of its introductory and pioneering nature, turned out to be the more readable and better organized textbook among the two. It is shorter by many pages, less verbose, less &quot;heavy and circular in arguments&quot;, and quicker to come to the point, not to mention being clearer, more lucid, and well-illustrated with good examples and diagrams without overwhelming the reader. The beginning chapters are well written with introduction to the applications of Complex Variables in the context of DSP as an EE subject. In short, DSP by Oppenheim and Schafer is the less ambitious book of the two, but really accomplishes much more by doing less and focusing on the essential concepts underlying DSP.I can see why and where many beginning EE Signal Processing students tend to get frustrated. DTSP, 1st edition, is actually a rewritten version of DSP, albeit meant to be a major extension (or expansion, if you wish) with more applications appended and &quot;heavier expositions&quot;. (This reminds me of many other books by MIT EE faculty on the market.) I find the most frustrating part of DTSP is the chapters on transcending from the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Why? All you have to do is look at the way the authors present the DFT, then get to understand the truncated DFT, and try to follow the steps that supposedly get one toward FFT's - not at all clear or well-connected conceptually. It is even more obvious when one tries to do the moderately difficult and somewhat tedious exercises at the back of each chapter. While it is true that DTSP appears superficially &quot;precise and rigorous&quot;, I find it a bit convoluted and too ambitious in its treatment of digital signal processing topics, indicative of a desire to reflect trappings of the latest applications by demonstrating the power of the theory presented. Why not just return to the fundamentals of DSP and limit the topics to a manageable level, thereby retaining a high degree of visibility for the more average EE student. (Maybe DTSP was meant to be taught by the authors themselves, or by their Ph.D. students. That way, the obscure points, discussions and topics in the textbook could be explained away in live classroom lectures via student interactions. Right?) In spite of all this, I think DTSP has intrinsic value in EE Signal Processing, being that it retained much of the key concepts in the older DSP text with some original flavor.Suggestion to authors: Write another book on DSP, but limit the book to concepts and some elementary applications, just like the 1970's original, or better still edit and update the original to be published as an inexpensive classic by, say, Dover. Rewrite DTSP as the follow-on textbook. How about it? I really miss the lucid style of the more original DSP textbook by the authors. And I mean it, seriously!"},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","review":"This is the outstanding 2nd edition of Oppenheim's classic DSP book, which for over two decades was the only real choice for a textbook on the subject. That was too bad, since the first edition was probably the worst thing I have ever seen in print - terse, incomprehensible, and with only a few awful and poorly illustrated examples. When I decided to take a refresher course in DSP, I was horrified to see our class would be using the second edition of that horrendous text. What I found instead was a completely rehabilitated textbook! This is not a beginner's DSP textbook by any stretch of the imagination, but absolutely everything is explained and there are plenty of well worked out examples. The end-of-chapter problems are broken down into simple, intermediate, and advanced problems with quite a few mind-puzzlers in the advanced section. Plus, the answers to the first 20 problems in every chapter are in the back of the book.There is really nothing unique about the book's format. What does makes the book unique is the density and amount of material included. Just about every page is packed with well-explained important information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has had a prior semester of an upper-level undergraduate class in Signals and Systems and wants to study DSP. An accompanying book that you might find helpful is \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Lyons. That book is good for getting an intuitive feel for DSP. Another book that will help you with some of the earlier concepts in this book (linear systems, DTFT, Z-transform, DFT, basic filter design) and some of the direct computations involved is \\"Schaum's Outline of Digital Signal Processing\\".

This book is a no nonsense approach towards DSP. You need firm grounding in calculus, signals and systems to be close to even understand what the authors intend to say.With a good professor and with the skill set that the authors assume you have, you will find this a life long reference. How ever for the not so sure Stanley's Digital Signal processing is a much better choice.The beginner should find Richard Lyon's Understanding DSP to be more user friendly, but if you outgrow Lyon, then this is the book that would whet your appetite.This book will be one you will frequently refer to clear your doubts."},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","review":"This is probably the most complete reference in DSP. It's full of examples covering the whole stuff in DSP. However this is certainly not fur use as an introductory book because the aim is not the explanation of fundamental concepts in DSP (for that go to Lyons &quot;Understanding Digital Signal Processing&quot;). Maybe it is possible to learn DSP with this book but then as a companion of a good undergrad course, not for self-study.As stated by another reviewer, this book is over-crowded with developments, details and examples that could be overwhelming to the newcomer. This is probably its biggest drawback, in that its completeness hinders on its readability.

Unfortunately, it does skip a few important topics. For example, the second edition threw out the section on designing IIR bandpass and highpass filters from lowpass prototypes. This section used to be in the first edition and is VERY important, so I don't see how Oppenheim &amp; Schafer could have justified throwing it out. They also conspicuously left out filter design based on the frequency sampling method. But in spite of these omissions, it's hard to recommend another book over this one. The one that comes closest is Mitra's.In the end, if you want to learn DSP and work in the field, you have to have this book, as well as the ones by Mitra, Proakis &amp; Manolakis, Jackson, and, of course, Rabiner &amp; Gold. If you get all those, you'll have the complete reference of CORE DSP texts."},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","review":"I found this book to be an excellent fundamental text about DSP.

The book covers the essential topics in great depth and that means every one of its 800+ pages is packed with concepts and details and examples. The style is clear, but the amount of information can be a little overwhelming when you read it for the first time. If you have time, patience, a good maths background, the desire to master the subject, and someone to clarify your doubts, this can be the best first book on DSP you could ever buy. If you just want to learn the basics, and don't have much time or patience you should probably look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","review":"As others have said, this is the DSP bible.

It is the book I learnt my DSP from; it is the book I have taught DSP from; it is a very good reference book for the practitioner.Having said that, I should also point out what I believe this book is not (and why it gets only 4 stars) : it is not a good book for self-learning. If this is what you are after, I recommend Rick Lyons' book \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" (five stars from me).If you are a mechanical engineer learning DSP, I suggest asking your local Bruel & Kjaer representative if he'll give you a copy of Bob Randall's \\"Frequency Analysis\\" published by B&K; (ISBN 87 87355 07 8; \\"only\\" 3.5 stars, but 4.5 stars if you're a mechanical engineer)."},{"Title":"Discrete-Time Signal Processing (2nd Edition) (Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series)","review":"I used the author's book &quot;Digital Signal Processing&quot; in my college study, and I also read and cite the 1st Edition of&quot;Discrete-Time Signal Processing&quot; during my work experience.

I've also read the Schaum's Outline by Monson Hayes and \\"Understanding Digital Signal Processing\\" by Richard Lyons, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone really interested in the subject.This book can appear more intimidating at a first glance, but chances are that is just the fear of a mind not accustomed to precise, throughout exposition. Actually, such preciseness is the only way to really understand a subject and it is much harder to learn something without it (although, it's easier to delude oneself into thinking that one is learning).While studying on the Hayes' book I often found myself trying to reconstruct the steps taken to build and use a mathematical representation of a problem, and realizing that there were some informations I was missing; that the exposition made sense only as long as I didn't put it under a magnifying glass to see the holes. As my interest for DSP and my hunger for thoroughness grew I had to turn more and more to the Oppenheim-Schafer in order to find the missing steps, until I decided that it would have been easier to use it as my primary book.As for the requirements, there isn't really much: some basic calculus and, for some chapters, a knowledge of analog systems - something that you have probably already studied if you are doing this for university, and something that you should study if you are a diy enthusiast.If this isn't your biggest interest and you only need to pass an exam, the Schaum's outline should be enough. If you want to build a solid foundation in DSP design, acquire new mathematical models and the skill to use them (in my opinion this is a central part in increasing one's intelligence) use this book."},{"Title":"Mr Noon (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of D.

I frequently asked myself, did this guy even have the book proofread even ONCE. In a couple of places, the copy makes no sense, as if it had been accidently copied and pasted in the wrong place.What the author does to those being quoted is even worse. I strongly suspect that he went around with a tape recorder, conducted some interviews, and then wrote the book a year or more later. Quotes tend to be presented in \\"string quote\\" fashion, with the speaker just rambling on. No nonsensical statement is questioned to perhaps draw out a sensical response. The result is that those being quoted sometimes appear to be blithering idiots. It's really unfair to quote people in this fashion.The author states that the private school didn't start until 1970, but I know I started attending in 1968. A not-so-minor error, and one that makes me pause before accepting other things presented in the book as fact.The author is really attempting to share the black story of school integration, and apparently only quotes blacks in the book. I suppose I understand that, but by limiting the views presented, he really only tells half the story. He really needed far more sources, both black and white.I think the history of the Mississippi private school movement, and the effect of integration on both the public schools and the communities, is one worthly of serious academic inquiry.Unfortunately, the author in this case is guilty of poor reporting, although the book certainly contains some interesting facts."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"This is probably the funniest book i have ever read.

A man who like all the cliched comics of history suffered with depression and most people didn't understand him, including his wives.His style of comedy is not for all peoples tastes I remember watching one of his \\"Q\\" TV shows in the 70's when my father came in, and his comment of, \\"What the hell are you watching\\", has stuck with me all this time.Comedy like music I guess is a generational thing!He had once quipped that he wanted his headstone to bear the words \\"I told you I was ill.\\"For lovers of, \\"zany\\" \\"left field\\" comedy or whatever way you want to describe it, this book is one of Milligans best."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"The New Tain... without the bulls, the Hound, Fergus or Meave. However, there is, a wild panther, Roman Centurions, wild bike ridss, a Chinee policeman and the worlds most sophisticated commode. All these threads (and more) are woven together by a master storyteller, hilarity ensues. Hilarity in the truest sense of the word, this is not a book you would read in public as the resulting howls of laughter are sure to draw unwanted attention. I'm new to Spike Milligan, having read only one other book, and I'm glad I discovered him. A truly talented writer who has written a truly memorable work."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"The book is a solid 5 stars for good reason.But you'll especially love it if you read it while in Ireland. There is a subtle cheekiness about the style of writing and the plot as a whole that embodies the nature of Ireland itself. Ummm... okay, so basically, it's an easy read, it will make you laugh, you'll end up writing your own 5-star review afterward."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"Spike Milligan was born in India, the son of an Irish father who was serving in the British Indian Army. He spent most of his life in England and served in the British Army in World War II - though he took Irish citizenship. Milligan was an undoubted comedy genius and was the principal writer of The Goon Show. He was one of the few people who could get away with referring to a member of the British Royal Family - Prince Charles - as a \\"little grovelling b@$t@rd\\" on live television.The story is set in Puckoon, a fictional village located a few miles northeast of Sligo . Dan Milligan probably the closest thing to a central character we get - and is, presumably, based a little on Spike himself. Dan lives in one of the Peat Cutters' Cottages - although he isn't actually a peat-cutter. (He's a skiver through and through. The peat ran out several years previously, and the peat-cutters didn't take long in doing the same. The Free State Government then awarded the cottages to those who'd fought for Irish independence). Milligan the character is, naturally, at the centre of much of the book's daftness : for a start, he can hold a conversation with Milligan the author. He isn't at all impressed with Spike's writing abilities, and is particularly unimpressed with his own legs. In an attempt to even things up a little, Spike gives Dan a magical word - squorrox - that'll get him out of any trouble. (Dan could've used that word on his wedding day - his wife's a fearsome looking creature, and is described by some as a \\"danger to shipping\\". Dan's two brothers had arrived with his wedding suit, just in time for him to make it to the church...he never forgave them).Dan's wife sends him to the church to try and find some work - the grass needs cut, and Father Rudden, despite his own good health, is obviously too busy with religious matters to deal with the problem himself. (It's the first time Dan's been to church since his baptism, but at least it'll be a little money for him. Well, it would if the parish wasn't broke - there are so many buttons going into the collection plate, it's a miracle how the faithful can walk to mass without their trousers falling down).However, Milligan and money aren't Fr Rudden's only problems. Although the majority of Ireland has now wriggled free from the United Kingdom , part of the country is staying put - which means a new border has to be drawn up. Unfortunately, thanks to a group of idiotic bureaucrats, the border gets drawn right through the church grounds. The chapel is in the new Free State , the graveyard is in the UK - which, being a Spike Milligan book, leads to all sorts of complications with Dan Doonan's funeral.While it is (unsurprisingly) a hugely funny and very daft book, there is the very occasional touch of sadness here and there. (The story of Farmer O'Mara particularly stands out, probably because it contrast so much with the rest of the book). Totally recommended."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"Oh, how Spike Milligan is missed! His humor is unsurpassed; and completly his own. Puckoon is Milligan being Milligan. The novel moves along at a brisk pace, even when it seems little is happening. Reading everything coming together at the end is pure delight. I can't recommend this book enough... the only drawback is that it's so short it leaves you wanting more."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"When I was 14, my friend lent me his stolen copy, and I loved it so much I went back to where he stole it and PAID for it! ( I had morals back then). Over the next 15 years I recommended this hilarious book to many, many friends. I lent my well worn copy over and over, never learning that it may not come back to me, it was always passed on by another new fan of Spike. So today I bought my fourth copy, amazed to find it still in print. My son will pee in his pants as he reads it! BUY THIS BOOK. If you like it, by Spike's &quot;silly verse for KIDS&quot; -- that's great too, but I can honestly say I believe this to be the funniest book EVER written."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"The title of my review says it all.

Spike Milligan, radio and movie star, one of the original goons, is a manic-depressive and this is an example of his manic best.

However, I doubt many Americans and probably few young Brits will catch the full implication of (and I paraphrase) \\"Brown, now dat's the colour of money\\"."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"I love this book to death and my admiration for Milligans manic and surreal humour is surpassed by no other. But to put into context the comedy element of this book I have to tell a story. My father gave me a well thumbed copy of this book when I was twelve yeras old and frankly it was a revelation. I was in bed reading it and found one particular passage so amusing I started to laugh the ubiquitous 'out loud'. I laughed and laughed and laughed hysterically for a good five or six minutes. This was the kind of laughter which if observed by a pediatrician would have been diagnosed as symptomatic of my good self going right round the royal bend. Anyhows I laughed so long, so loud and so hard, my parents rushed up to my bedroom believing I was asphixiating in my sleep. This story is absolutely true. Ask my dad. God bless Milligan. Read this and die laughing."},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"Brilliant. I loved it. I nearly wet myself with laughter. Puckoon is full of that mad humour which keeps me sane. He gives a view of the Irish as being country bumpkins with little intelligence. Any book by Spike Milligan is worth buying. His war memoirs are brilliant, as is his interpretation of the Old Testiment. Puckoon must be his masterpiece though. I loved the bit when Dr. Goldstein impersonates a goat as they are trying to catch a vicious Panther thats escaped from Gulio Ceaser's circus, as well as the chapter on the Boundary Commission. The Chinese policeman is also the best. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Brilliant.Long Live Spike Milligan"},{"Title":"PUCKOON","review":"Puckoon has to be,without a doubt,one of the best books i have ever read.It's funny and inane,and a great insight into the genius of Spike milligan.Everything about it is just totally hilarious.

It is a great way to gain insight into a life and Helen Keller is a symbol of overcoming limitations. She refused to live her life shut away in a dark room and instead she taught herself to speak many languages, traveled to many countries and loved to read.Helen Keller's life is truly inspirational and although her life started out in such a bleak way, she overcame many obstacles and eventually exceeded everyone's expectations. She was actually world-famous by the age of 10. It is truly amazing to see the articles she wrote at age 12.After we read about the initial illness that left her blind and deaf, Leslie Garrett takes us on a beautiful journey through Helen's life. She was quite the little prankster as a child and also had a great sense of humor about life in general. She also had a temper and this is where Annie Sullivan enters the picture.We learn about Annie Sullivan's life and how Helen and Annie meet. Leslie Garrett explains how Helen learns about life and how to live in a world where few people understand her. Annie shows extreme patience in very difficult situations and eventually teaches Helen how to deal with everyday situations. She also teaches her how to read and later on attends college classes with her to spell out the lessons into her hand.Leslie Garrett's writing style is perfect for this story and this is definitely one of my favorite DK biographies. After reading this story, you will never again think about life in the same way.\\"The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.

Well this person was Helen Keller! This book Helen Keller is about the story life of Helen growing up blind. She is an amazing person she had to learn how to talk with her hands and that was hard because she was blind and deaf. The author of this book was Leslie Garrett. I think this book is for 9 to 16 year olds. This book has 121 pages. This biography is a fantastic book.Helen Keller was an amazing woman she was blind and deaf her whole like. Did you know that Helen went to Harvard, that's the best college in the world? Helen had many challenges in her life she had lost a lot of her family when she was younger. When she was about 9 years old this girl named Annie came to help Helen be able to live a happier life being blind and deaf. Helen and Annie worked hard so Helen could live a good life. When Helen grew up she made many movies and books during her life. Without Annie's help and guidance she would not have seceded.When I read Helen Keller I think my favorite part of the book was when she was going to Harvard and when she studying, it's a huge part of the book!When I read this book the most important thing I learned from reading this book was keep trying and don't ever give up!There are lots of books like this one, but there are lots of other DK books on Helen Keller.

For example abstract, proctor, inauguration and Bachelor of Arts are all defined inside an unobtrusive text box at the edge of a page.I also liked the way the author didn't sugar-coat issues, she included the fact that Annie Sullivan had detractors and at one point Helen was separated from Annie in an attempt to protect Helen.

This Pulitzer Prize winning novel captures the spirit of the times as those hardy pioneers struggle to settle a difficult land. Mr. Davis' wry humor makes this a reader's delight. Having lived in the general area as a youth I found many of the incidents sounding like the seemingly endless tales that my father and his collegues would spend hours swapping."},{"Title":"Honey in the horn,","review":"I have enjoyed extremely some other works by H. L. Davis, most notably the novel Winds of Morning and the beautifully executed short story, \\"The Homestead Orchard.\\" It was with pleasurable anticipation that I obtained Davis's prizewinning magnum opus.But this monstrosity totally surprised me. The rendering of Oregon's history and geography is too far removed from the truth for a novel that is supposed to be a fanciful tapestry of Oregon's history and geography--it's so fanciful as to merely annoy. The characters are not well-developed and are cartoonish. I can stand fantasy sequences (loved Dickens's Little Dorrit), but this endless ramble exhausted my patience. I kept waiting to reach the good part. I should have given up after the first 100 pages.H. L. Davis is a little-known and under-appreciated author whose works are not of even quality. Following is my list of his works that I've read, in order of my esteem from highest to lowest.1. The Homestead Orchard--Humorous, sad, joyous, beautifully crafted short story about a father and son.2. Old Man Isbell's Wife--Humorous short story3. Bench Squatters--short story about a single dad and his kids4. Flying Switch--action-packed hilarious short story5. Open Winter--sweet & realistic short story about moving a herd of horses6. Harp of a Thousand Strings--sweeping novel of the French Revolution related to the American experience7. Winds Of Morning--novel8. Several other short stories9. The Distant Music--saga-like novel of an Oregon family's generations10. Beulah Land--saga-like novel of America's westward movement11. All of Davis's essays--not profound but they reveal Davis's thinking12. The Kettle of Fire--a fictional legend that doesn't really work13. Honey in the Horn--spare yourself! Saga-like, overlong, random, Pulitzer-prize winning, historically inaccurate, pointlessTo access the short stories, get a copy of his Collected Essays and Short Stories, published by the University of Idaho Press. Even better, if you can find it at a reasonable price, buy a copy of Davis's short story collection, Team Bells Woke Me (currently the best Amazon Marketplace price is $19.21, but this gets you Bench Squatters, Flying Switch, and some other lesser pieces not in the Collected Essays and Short Stories)."},{"Title":"Honey in the horn,","review":"This book was impossible to put down.

And it is a rollicking good story."},{"Title":"Honey in the horn,","review":"I used to have this long speech I'd give about 'literature' and how much more concerned with quality of content I am than the topic of the content. I used to say that I'd read a 1,000 page book written on the history of a couch, if the writing was done interestingly enough, because I am not typically very concerned with plots, suspense or other manipulative techniques that are typically used to make me forget / not notice that the writing is sub par.It's been a long time since that speech and a long time since I've read something on a topic that bored me to tears, yet I remained completely absorbed. This book did manage to do that for me though.Honey in the Horn takes place in the Pacific Northwest, when it was still half overrun by indigenous people and almost everyone in the area was transient. There was a lot of farming business, killing of people business and jail-breaking business. None of these topics are ones that I'm ever particularly interested in, but H.L.

No, it was part and parcel of her personality, and can be seen in her writing as well. Watson discovers that outside of the famous TALES FROM SHAKESPEARE which she wrote with her brother Charles (splitting down the corpus of Shakespeare by ignoring the histories, writing up the comedies, and leaving the tragedies to Charles), Mary Lamb wrote other books as well, which she makes sound perfectly fascinating. I would love to read the \\"Mrs. Leicester\\" book and hope that Tarcher, which published this fine biography, will print a companion book of Mary Lamb's collected writing.She hints also that Mary was drawn to many men, including the romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who was so sexy that she just couldn't help herself when he was around. Charles eventually had to ask Coleridge not to come around because a visit from him would find Mary going a little crazy.Watson brings us into the early 19th century world of the madhouse, which is a pretty creepy place. Women with private means like Mary Lamb had their own rooms and own attendants, but still they must have seen some dreadful sights, making their lives very different from other women of their class who were in general protected from the seamy. You can never forget however, that Mary killed her own mother with a knife, a crime so rare that people hardly ever run into it, even judges with long histories of criminal cases, even hardened homicide cops. Why did she do it? Watson provides a limited answer. In my mind Mary Lamb's psychology was similar to Lizzie Borden's, except she was perhaps more lovable and had more of a humorous nature. But both were brooders and both nurtured an unassimilable hatred toward the patriarchal structure of the family."},{"Title":"The Devil Kissed Her: The Story of May Lamb","review":"Charles and Mary Lamb's slim volume, \\"Lamb's Tales Of Shakespeare\\" has been one of two children's books in continous publication since the late 1700's (the other is Robinson Crusoe). The lines in an encyclopedia do not begin to describe the intertwined histories of the brother and sister authors. Kathy Watson has attempted a daunting task: To put into context eighteenth century English societal structure, women's roles and education in said society, and historical treatment and diagnosis of mental conditions, all amidst the author's effort to tell a cohesive individual family history of at least two generations from birth to death. May I add, in 238 pages. The end result is sloppy, headache-inducing, confused, and exhausting for the reader. Focus and vision is what this book lacks, and a feeling that historical letters and documents that should have been rigorously used and cited, and were not, leads readers with a gaping absence of solid documentation. Instead we are left with imagined fancies of possibilities and insinuations that are annoying and amateurish. The story of brother and sister Charles and Mary Lamb had the basis for a compelling historical and societal story, but is miles away from fruition in this work. An initial enthusiasm and energy in the beginning quickly fades to a dull desperation. Her conclusion that Mary's life took a turn for the better when she killed her mother in a fit of manic rage was quite disturbing. The liberties taken demote this book from a potential literary history to tawdry dime store novel."},{"Title":"The Devil Kissed Her: The Story of May Lamb","review":"At a time when people were rather routinely hanged for non capitol offenses, Mary Lamb was released into her brother's cuistody after staqbbing her mother to death with a kitchen knife.She went on to be a writer (with her brother, \\"lamb's Tales From Shakespeare\\") and be part of a literary circle that included a lot of writer contemporaries.She went to a mental asylum several times in her life.This book presents a good picture of a certain British subculture and also of the state of mental health in her day and time.I found it interesting throughout."},{"Title":"The Devil Kissed Her: The Story of May Lamb","review":"The book is slim. It is heavily padded. If someone wrote a poem, the author quotes the poem at length. If someone wrote a short story, the plot of the story is given in excessive detail.

Mary Lamb murders her mother and then spends the rest of her long life in and out of insane asylums, while her famous brother (Charles Lamb) tries to take care of her. Even when they both achieve literary fame, the ominous shadow of the madhouse looms over them. But the importance of the story is negated by the constant punctuation errors."},{"Title":"The Oresteian trilogy; (Penguin classics, L67)","review":"It's easy to see why Aeschylus is still revered as one of the great dramatists of the ages. 2500 years later The Oresteia still presents poetical problems of great urgency, probing the darkest depths of the human psyche. While Agamemnon, the first work in this trilogy, is the most lauded, all three are of nearly equal value.I'm of two minds regarding Vellacott's translation. For the most part the language is vivid and the verse is spacious and eloquent, though his fixed rhyme (which has no analog in the original Greek) is sometimes distracting -- particularly as he is in the all-too-frequent habit of forcing rhyme with ostentatious enjambment. That really breaks the flow.With a verse translation this admittedly free in its rendering, I'm always left with the nagging question of which images belong to the author and which to the translator. When I want to experience a great work of the canon that can be a bit troubling.These quibbles aside, Vellacott's translation does an outstanding job of framing the vital images of Aeschylus' trilogy with vigor, and overall my reading experience was first rate."},{"Title":"The Oresteian trilogy; (Penguin classics, L67)","review":"This is the quintessential tale of ritual sacrifice (homicide), blood debt, self-conflicted justice, patricide, guilt, and (ultimately) the divinely bestowed rule of law (reason). Written 2500 years ago, perhaps it's where respect for law originated. If before clan/society/religion (honor) demanded unthinking sacrifice and revenge, Aeschylus advocates divinely endorsed law as a mediator of the irrational (and emotional): reason alone can tame the madness.Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Electra, Orestes, and Aegisthus have since appeared in millions of derivative venues as dramatic models under different names. None approach the power of this work. I read this translation 30 years ago: it remains vivid and memorable."},{"Title":"The Oresteian trilogy; (Penguin classics, L67)","review":"&quot;Agamemnon&quot; is the first of the Oresteia trilogy (the only extant Greek trilogy) and should be required reading of all university students. The trilogy won First Prize at the Greater Dionesia in 458 B. C. Agamemnon returns to Argos from the Trojan War. He is killed by his wife Clytemnestra and his first cousin Aegisthus. Clytemnestra's reasons for the murder of both Agamemnon and Cassandra were questioned even in ancient Greece: was it for revenge for the death of her daughter Iphigenia or was it for her adultery with Aegisthus? In one of Pindar's odes (c. 474 B. C.), &quot;Pythia 11&quot;, he asks: &quot;Was it Iphigeneia, who at the Euripos crossing was slaughtered far from home, that vexed her to drive in anger the hand of violence? Or was it couching in a wrong bed by night that broke her will and set her awry?&quot; The Oresteia trilogy is a study in justice. Agamemnon's death must be avenged; but, this means matricide. Orestes, in the next play, should not have been the hand of vengence. &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (or, &quot;The Choephoroi&quot;), the second play in the trilogy, is the earliest known play containing an intrigue as the main plot. Electra, sister of Orestes, has been sent to the grave of Agamemnon to offer a libation. Clytemnestra is attempting to placate the spirit of her dead husband. When she and Aegisthus are killed by Orestes, Orestes finds that now the Furies will pursue him rather than his mother. In the last play, the Eumenides (or the Erinyes), daughters of Night who avenge crimes committed by offspring against parents and who punished people who fail to keep their oaths, seek Orestes. Apollo purifies Orestes by washing him in pigs' blood. But the Erinyes reject Apollo's order to leave Orestes alone. The conflict is resolved via a trial overseen by Athena. Athena succeeds in restraining the Erinyes who are persuaded to make their home in Athens and will now be able to punish violence done within the polis.

While Vellacott, whose translations of Euripides I love, captures the mood, his rhythmical verse somehow obscures the meaning, at least in the less didactic passages.Having said that what comes across is a story whose drama to me can only be rivalled by the great stories of the Old Testament, or by Hamlet, whose dilemma is in some ways a mirror of that of Orestes.Orestes' father Agamemnon has been murdered on his return from victory in the Trojan war by Orestes' mother Clytemnestra, who has shacked up with Aegisthus and who grieves the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia made by Agamemnon to ensure a wind for his fleet on its way to Troy.This family, the house of Atreus, was under a curse anyway, following the cruel murder by Agamemnon's father of his brother's children.Orestes murders Clytemnestra and Aegisthus and is then pursued by the Furies. The whole drama of the plays is about his decision to do this and the agonies he is likely to incur whether he does it or not."},{"Title":"The Oresteian trilogy; (Penguin classics, L67)","review":"The Oresteian Trilogy is a classic set of tragedies, centring around the royal family of Argos, and sparked off by the infamous back-stabbing wife of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra. The translation reads well, but the over-extended dialogue may become tedious for readers who prefer something punchier. Aeschylus does not achieve great 'closure', especially with Orestes himself, a hero who fades from view at the end, overshadowed by the deal being struck by the immortal Athene and the Furies.Similarly, certain plot lines lack sophistication, whereby characters drop out of the story, or events are telegraphed well before occurring, and then occur entirely as expected. However, there are a couple of genuinely gripping passages buried between the acres of soul-searching. In a less secular age immortal intervention might be seen as a natural plot device, but here it takes the fate of Orestes out of his own hands, when we might prefer to see how he deals with his deeds himself. Then again, maybe that's the point."},{"Title":"German Grammar, An Approach to Reading (English and German Edition)","review":"Easy to use instructional book.

The visit ended before I could finish the book, and then the relative got rid of the book during a move. Every so often over the years I would search for the book (partially because I wanted to know how it ended, and partially because the memory of reading the book as a child was a particularly poignant one) but to no avail, until I finally found it on Amazon last year. To be honest, the book was not quite as riveting as my imagination had built it up to be over so many years, but it was a solid read, with interesting characters, a strong sense of time and place, and a satisfying ending.

Fancy is an unusual Yerby character in that she's actually interesting and worthwhile. (Yerby usually can't write a decent female protagonist to save his life.) While struggling to make a better life, even if that means bellydancing for backwoods men, Fancy stays true to herself, despite all the talk and rumors from people who don't really know her. She's strong yet tender, resilient and willing to learn from her mistakes. You truly want to root for her, except for one thing. Her inexplicable love and devotion to Court Brantley. Court does NOTHING right. He cheapens her, ridicules her, shames her, doubts her, cheats on her, lies to her, abuses her and abandons her. You just want to reach into the book and shake Fancy while yelling, \\"Cut him loose and let him sink on his own!\\" Alas, like too many women in real life, Fancy just keeps taking him back, hoping that one day he'll change. He won't. They're called 'loser' for a reason, honey."},{"Title":"A Woman Called Fancy","review":"This is a great love story. Read it years ago.

The first involves sending positive energy to your internal organs and other structures so that they can function better. The second is the &quot;microcosmic orbit,&quot; a very ancient practice which moves energy in a circular motion up the spine, over the head, down the front of the body, and back up the spine. At the end of this exercise the chi is then focused in the Tan Tien center, right below the navel.The microcosmic orbit differs from the Hatha Yoga practice of raising the kundalini energy up the spine in that in the Taoist practice you always bring the energy back down, thus grounding it. Much of the purported danger in these sorts of energy exercises comes from leaving the energy &quot;raised,&quot; which sometimes happens in Hatha Yoga, or so I am told.Thus I don't agree with the warnings that these exercises are dangerous when not practiced with a master. Although I do have a Tai chi/Chi Kung teacher, I started these exercises years ago when I was working alone. The most notable change that I have experienced doing the microcosmic orbit is that I have many more lucid dreams than ever before, plus a sense of having a clearer energy field.It is important to note that Chia does not make any reference to Taoist yoga as a religious practice. You may do these exercises as a Taoist, a Christian, a Buddhist, a Wiccan, whatever. They are simply exercises to learn about and work with your own life-force energy.If you are working with a teacher, this book is a good adjunct as it has diagrams of the energy pathways and certain internal organs which you should know about. If you don't yet have a teacher, the book will introduce the subject in a straightforward, simple way that you can easily work with."},{"Title":"Awaken Healing Energy Through The Tao: The Taoist Secret of Circulating Internal Power","review":"I have been working with Mantak Chia's materials for the past 17 years. Originally I found few of his books ine one small Chinese store, and decided to give them a shot. I was thrilled when even my very first attempt resulted in noticing the difference. While the books were wonderful I did wish to have personal instruction, too. Lucky for me, about few weeks after I purchased the books, Mantak Chia was teaching a workshop in Toronto. Even though thsee initial practices are rather simple, it helped attending a workshop, too. I have attended all the workshops he came to teach in Toronto at the time. In the meantime, videos came out, so in time I got those too.You may or may not want to attend a workshop, but if for any reason you don't feel comfortable proceeding on your own, you may consider getting Mantak Chias videos. I like them very much (I have just about all of them) Another excellent resource is the book Qigong Empowerment.The focus of this book, Awaken Healing Energy Through Tao, is learing to circulate the energy through Microcosic Orbit. It is the essential practice for all future practices in Taoist Alchemy. The book also gives an overview of practices you can do if you wish to continue with your studies and practice.It is not hard to do. It is really simple. If you are new to this, the more complex part than the practice may be the use of different names in chinese for different points and a lot of theoretical information behind the practice.The practice essentially involves guiding the energy with your imagination - generating it, circulating it and storing it in your body.You can experience many benefits of this practice from the very beginning. What I experienced from the very beginning is a sense of calm. If I were ever upset and then begin doing microcosmic orbit, the upset would immediately disperse and dissolve. Doing microcosmic orbit practice had a centering effect. The practice is very, very simple but the benefits are far greater than may be initially apparent.As you keep on storing the energy, whenever any part of your body (organs) need more energy, they can use the energy you have stored instead of depleting the energy from other parts of your body. This in itself contributes to health. However, if you choose to continue your learning, there are many more advanced practices designed specifically for healing."},{"Title":"Awaken Healing Energy Through The Tao: The Taoist Secret of Circulating Internal Power","review":"I am working through this book.The main practice is the microcosmic orbit which uses the prenatal energy system. When you were in the womb you received all your nourishment and energy through the navel and this followed an energy pathway to the base of the spine and all the way up to your head, and back down the front to the navel to the dan tien where it is stored.This exercise trains you get the pre natal energy flowing again.Normally, as you go through life your energy does not flow upwards properly and becomes blocked contributing to the ageing process etc.If you have any interest in energy practice, you should work with the microcosmic orbit. The only trouble is it may take a while before a conscious flow can be felt.I recommend the five tibetans, which is a simple exercise routine you can do in five minutes. These are also referred to as the fountain of youth exercises. This also brings the energy up to your higher centers or psychic vortexes, and restores their function to youthful levels, thereby retarding the aging process. You can feel the kundalini (base of spine) energy being activated.If you are new to energy, I recommend you also get Quantum Touch, which has some great exercises and visualizations which can literally have you moving energy within minutes.Combining a few different methods has worked well for me. As with anything, the more you practice, the more you improve."},{"Title":"Awaken Healing Energy Through The Tao: The Taoist Secret of Circulating Internal Power","review":"I read this book when it first came out. You can and will open the microcosmic orbit using this book. I went on to spend some time with Mantak Chia. He's a fine guy and an excellent teacher and communicator. No one EVER left one of chia's events thinking, &quot;gee, I really don't know how to practice this.&quot; He's the best actual teacher of this sort of thing I've ever been with.The problem with some of these lousy reviews is as follows. There's something about spiritual subjects--maybe because they're so dear to people's hearts--that arouses a nasty levelof fanaticism in human beings, especially westerners, but it's pretty universal. No matter how good and sincere a teacher you are there are always people in the back row sneering and screaming that you are &quot;doing it all wrong!&quot;On top of that, and not to be at all discounted, is the fact that Mantak Chia is BY FAR the most succesful teacher of taoism in the west and there are a lot of people who are just plain old green with jealousy and envy and they hate him for it. It's an ugly side of human nature but one we all know all about.The only legitimate criticism of Chia's books is this--he is consciously writing for &quot;the ages&quot; and he makes them almost encyclopedic, and the result is actually more information than you may need to do the practice. Some people find this confusing.Lastly, Chia is one of the great modernizers and debunkers, doing basically for taoist spiritual practice what TCM in modern china tries to do for chinese medicine: sift it to find out what we actually can use and separate it from what we don't need because it is just superstition. There are some goofy people who seem to want the superstition and this also angers them, but for reasonable people like us it can save us lots of time in the future.Chia's energy practices will make you healthier and you won't need any study to prove it to you--you'll know it cause you'll feel two hundred per cent better.

There is no such problem here. The technique can be practiced anywhere, any time and can be incorporated easily into one's breathing. This small, simple book contains one exercise. which can be learned very easily. Half the book, at least, is nothing but testimonials, which I thought were just to fill out the pages. Each of his small books can be read quickly, and takes about three months' practice to learn well enough to go on to another one. I appreciated the fact that he left out the philosophy, and got right to the technique. It makes it easily available to anyone. When these books first came out, I bought each one as soon as it was published, and bought multiple copies of this one as gifts. I admit that at one time, I tried Yoga without a teacher other than books, and got in immediate trouble. There were no available teachers at the time, and I found the books left too much out.

Unfortunately I believe this book is actually bad for anyone who is new to the subject. DOING ANY OF THE EXERCISES WRONG CAN HAVE TERRIBLE EFFECTS ON YOU.To any person who is new to qi gong/internal arts I say this book is not for you and you should first find a GOOD teacher to study under.

I can see people are deriving some benefit from Chia's book, but just from reading the table of contents and the first few pages, I can honestly recommend that you should study the methods of cultivating essential nature and eternal life from an immortal master of the advanced training methods, which Chia speaks of in the sample. The benefits you will derive from Charles Luk's translation of \\"The methods of cultivating essential nature and eternal life,\\" called \\"Taoist Yoga...\\" will far surpass anything you will attain from Chia's, and incidentally help you avoid the many potential problems that can develop in this type of spiritual training. There are also some misconceptions about Taoist meditation in Chia's book that I can see right off the bat, and if you take my word, and check out Luk's book, you will at least be able to practice Chia's more effectively, and less dangerous! Take this sincere advice from someone who hasn't read but the first few pages of Chia's book, but who has actual first hand experience with the TRUE (complete, as opposed to Chia's incomplete) mechanisms of the generative force, vitality, spirit, the microcosmic orbit, and the original cavity of spirit, etc., etc., etc.. One thing I can't tell from the book is whether the whole method is based on turning back the flow of generative fluid, which is what real Taoist meditation is based on. One definite gross misconception that is readily available to view in the sample of Chia's is that Taoist meditation is not dependent on stopping the flux of thoughts in your mind while practicing. If you are TRULY SERIOUS about spiritual growth, progress, and prolonging and enjoying your life, then you must obtain and study Luk's book (AT LEAST as a companion to this one), which also warns against taking advice from the wrong guide, on numerous occasions. If you are NOT serious about attaining the many wonderful benefits that this advanced training method can give, I suggest you not practice Tao Yoga at all, and focus on something less serious for now. Those are my sincerest words, and I stand by them. I feel a responsibility to at least tell you my perspective, so you can make a more intelligent, wise decision."},{"Title":"Awaken Healing Energy Through The Tao: The Taoist Secret of Circulating Internal Power","review":"The short review: Great Book!This book reveals secrets of qigong/chi kung and Taoist practice that are seldom taught in the West even today... and were virtually unheard of before the publication of this book...Had I reviewed this book when I originally read it, I'm sure I would have given it 5 stars. I only gave it 4 stars because Healing Light of the Tao is more modern, covers these same exercises and expands upon them (and shows the increased wisdom of 25 more years of practice and teaching by Mantak Chia). If you only read one, I would encourage you toward Healing Light of the Tao over Awaken Healing Energy Through the Tao.After working with the exercises for a while, it seems to have lifted my energy and...

After reading Mantak Chia's book, Awaken the Healing Energy Through the Tao, I was inspired and determined to find a teacher. I kept the book in close proximity during the day, and I read it dutifully at night. Already into an over 10 year mantra practice (TM), I intuitively felt that there might be more to a meditation practice. It has been said, \\"When the student is ready the teacher comes.\\" And so it was for me. Peter Moy, a direct student of Mantak Chia, came to Madison WI. Peter spent a weekend teaching the orbit meditation to a group of us at our farm house in Spring Green WI.The Micro Cosmic Orbit is an energy loop. When the Orbit is 'open' the energy flows in a circle, and the Yin and Yang Vessels of the body are united. Chinese Medicine calls these, the Governing Vessel or Du Channel(Back)and the Conception Vessel or Ren Channel (Front). It is through practice of techniques clearly presented in Mantak Chia's book, that the Orbit is able to open. The practitioner has access to a wellspring of energy that was previously locked up.For me the Orbit was a jumping off point. The Orbit was the foundation for continued learning and practicing other valuable techniques like Kriya Yoga, Bandhas and Energy Healing over the last twenty plus years.Buy the Book.

I am from Turkey and speak the language. The summer of 2011, we will cruise the Southwest Turkey. I purchased this book and went through the entire length. It has just about all the information one needs to safely and enjoyably cruise the area. Aside from cultural information, food, language etc. it has detailed information about anchorages, boat harbors and other information needed during a cruise. Every bay and anchorage is mapped and useful soundings, rocks, reefs, shallow areas are indicated. It even includes the coastal restaurants one can visit moored at a small village! We have also purchased the charts of the area but I think they aren't as detailed as the drawings in this book. Photographs are great; customs clearing, peculiarities of legal and authority figures are sensitively described. I will have more detailed review after we use the book next summer but I feel very confident having it with us while sailing our chartered boat from Bodrum to Kas and back."},{"Title":"Turkish Waters & Cyprus Pilot: a Yachtsman's Guide To the Mediterranean and Black Sea Coasts of Turkey With the Island of Cyprus","review":"good book, it helped a lot for my advance planning a Bareboat vacation on the Lycian Coast a few years ago.

This particular book covers Turkey and Cyprus, but others cover other parts of the Mediterranean. Heikell gives you all the information you need if you are boating in the Turkey/Cyprus area, from general boating and safely tips to specific descriptions of ports and anchorages (including such information as how to contact, number of visitor berths, amenities) and descriptions of places to see near various ports and harbors. It's the only source for much of this valuable information. It's a pricey book but worth it."},{"Title":"Gary Chang: Suitcase House","review":"First, the book caught my attention because the suitcase house is part of the avant-garde architecture project called \\"the Commune by the Great Wall\\" in Beijing, China. The developer of the project invited 12 young Asian architects form South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand, Mainland China, and HongKong, to independently design 11 houses and a clubhouse at the foot of the Great Wall, all nestled in a beautiful environment - valleys on one side and the Great Wall on the other. The suitcase house was designed by Gary Chang (a HK-based architect and the author of the book), and is located at the entrace of the Commune project.Chan devoted the whole book to his design (suitcase concept and its variations) with overwhelming background information such as the inspiration and philosophy behind this house, the social, economic, and societal background of the project, the early sketches and concepts, detailed floor plans and specifications, original design of coordinating furniture, the building process with documentary-flavored pictures, interviews with the architect and the design team, email and other correspondences between the architect and the client, and a large amount of pictures focusing on details. Really appreciate this approach to get a 360-degree in-depth interpretation of a single modern house. Plus, this book has a great graphic design.That being said, readers have to sacrifice the breadth with depth. Financially, it is not very wise to pay the money to only read about one single house. Also, some readers might not be interested in the excessive background information."},{"Title":"Paroles","review":"I was very favorably impressed with the organization and variety of this book, as well as the fact that it accommodates the different styles of learning among students. French is my sixth language (counting English).This text follows several parallel learning approaches. In each chapter, there is a section emphasizing conversation, there are notes directing the student to &quot;discover&quot; grammatical themes and irregularities, the usual snippets of history and culture, comments on usage, a brief vocabulary, an English discussion of the language lesson (like a plain-language discussion of what's going on from one English speaker to another). Each chapter closes with a condensed technical grammar for later reference and review.Besides the diversity of learning approaches it supports, I especially like the fact that this book includes reading that is an uncomfortable stretch. These excerpts require deduction of the message from context. I'm sure students will complain loudly about the &quot;unfairness&quot; of having to guess the meaning of words that aren't formally defined anywhere, but face it -- intelligent guessing is the skill most required by someone who tries to use a language in real life. Why shouldn't it be taught?As I say, I'm a bit of a language nut, and have several shelves of texts in various languages (Russian, German, Latin, Attic Greek). This is one of very few that actually teaches the skills needed for ordinary conversation, listening to the radio, and reading Le Monde."},{"Title":"Paroles","review":"The author seems more concerned with course organization and pedagogy than with teaching the subject.There are times I wish she would just get on with it."},{"Title":"Paroles","review":"It was unorganized and muddled. I had a hard time learning anything. My school no longer uses it for that reason. I don't recommend you buy this unless you know French and are just trying to expand your basic skills in no order.

It is pretty interactive and user friendly.

It also has grammar sections in each chapter and has nice vocabulary and culture sections. However, there are areas that aren't fully explained and if your teacher/professor is a French native then they should quickly be able to point out the books cultural mistakes and explain the little details (but very important) that the book leaves out. A willing student and a good teacher can really make this book work."},{"Title":"Paroles","review":"My students, who are University level individuals, consistently HATE this book and its ancilliary materials. The textbook is adequate IF the professor is competent and able to supplement the series with other material and practice. The text \\"Accent\\" is superior for French, and this work could benefit by emulating the superb Con Mucho Gusto format for Spanish. My students consistently find the \\"Paroles\\" text and materials to be awkward, tedious, frustrating, and even (in places) patronizing in the \\"new paradigm\\" approach which was the pedagogical fad of the 1990's. (Read some of Steven Pinker's brilliant works, especially his views on language acquistion). A more \\"traditional\\" text series such as \\"Accent\\" was more conducive to effective language learning. My students who use more \\"traditional\\" methods of learning French experience better understanding, retention and communication skills...and, as a skillful teacher, I find that I must heavily supplement the \\"Paroles\\" materials if I am to do justice to my students. Fourteen years' experience in the French language classroom and six years with this textbook series justify my critique, based upon personal experience and student reviews."},{"Title":"Paroles","review":"I have taken many language classes, and they usually go something like this: teacher pulls out a puppet, the puppet says a few words, the students repeat them, and then at home we fill in a wroksheet for 10 minutes adn go back to whatever else we were doing, no more knowledgeable then before. This book is very refreshing- it is challenging but expalins the grammar step by step and directly so the students don't miss anything and can really understand. Also, the grammar pages make it easy to pre-read and review. The culture lessons make learning more exciting and make us use the French- which was my point for taking the class. To be able to use it in real situations! With this book I can learn French at a college level, the same way I learn math or econ or anything else. French doesn't have to be slow, easy and filled with puppet shows that leave you confused. I learned so much using Paroles (more than I did with HS Spanish) and I'm really glad that my university uses it.

The Confederation of Planets claims hegemony over all human worlds and thus is offically in a state of war with all independent planets. Heretofore, the war has been more ideological than active, but recently the Federation has attacked the Second Commonwealth at Camerein. Buchanan is an independent world in the space between these governments and now the war has come to it.In this novel, Doug Weintraub is out hunting when flashes and sonic booms in the sky cause him to return to his home and set up a comlink with the other six commissioners. They are informed that Federation troops have landed and are advancing upon Sam and Max, the two small cities of Buchanan. Then one of the commissioners is captured by the Federation soldiers. Doug leaves the conference and launches the emergency message rocket in his barn to report the problem to the Second Commonwealth and then takes to the hills with his hunting gear. Later, he gathers together a few other men and they plant exposive charges on the Federation shuttles parked at the spaceport.When the Buchanan message rocket arrives in the Buckingham system, the Second Commonwealth promply sends the Second Regiment of the Royal Marines to Buchanan. The HMS Sheffield and her escorts arrive two weeks after the shuttle sabotage and immediately attack the single Federation Cutter-class warship in orbit around Buchanan. Despite all efforts to intercept the ship, it manages to transit to Q-space and flee the system. This establishes a time limit on clearing out the Federation ground troops, for the escaped ship will surely bring rapid reinforcement by the Federation.The marines are landed by shuttle and surround the area containing Sam, Max, and the spaceport. As they land, the Federation troops quickly turn off their helmet electronics to eliminate their obvious signatures and then relocate to other positions, so the Commonwealth marines do not know the present location of the enemy. The Intelligence & Reconnaissance platoon sends out patrols to try to locate the estimated battalion of enemy soldiers in the area and one such patrol walks into an ambush. As they return fire, another party -- the Buchanan group -- also takes the Federation troops under fire.After an air assault and ground reinforcements take out the Federation unit, the leader of the marine patrol, Sergeant David Spencer, takes the Buchanan irregulars back to the I&R; platoon and introduces Doug to the regimental commander. They feed and outfit Doug's men and make arrangements to scatter them as local liaison among the various marine units. This willing cooperation by the Buchanan men greatly pleases the political liaison, Prince William, since it should facilitate a longer range association with the Second Commonwealth.Needless to say, the Federation reinforcements arrive at some point and make life difficult for the Commonwealth marines. A goodly amount of ground fighting ensues, as well as close support missions from the fighter craft. There is also some spatial combat, but the point of view mostly follows the I&R; platoon.This series concentrates on ground warfare and taking back ground without rendering it uninhabitable. Therefore, it mostly consists of conventional warfare with relatively low-tech, and reliable, weapons and protective gear. There are no power suits in this series nor any use of armor per se. Of course, the same was true in Viet Nam; since one RPQ could take out a tank at little cost, the tanks were seldom used in wild areas and never used off the roads in the Delta (an M-48 in a rice paddy often became a submarine -- that is, an underwater vehicle). Some were used in Cambodia, which is not as boggy, and in the dryer northern zone where the North Vietnamese Army initiated tank attacks during the Tet offensives.Recommended for Shelley fans and anyone who enjoys small-unit combat stories in a SF setting.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Buchanan Campaign","review":"The upside to &quot;The Buchanan Campaign&quot; is that the writing is handled very competently. Dialogue is believable and, as a description of an imaginary military operation, it is very readable. Events are easy to follow and logical.The downside here is that there isn't much of a story. The characters are almost totally one-dimensional. The only personal insights that we get to any of them are that one male fighter pilot has female fighter pilot for a girlfriend and that one of the groundtroops is bitter because he was due for discharge but his discharge was postponed because of the military emergency. The main character among the Buchanan colonists has a wife a child, but neither of them ever utters a single word in the entire book. We know that the enemy &quot;Federation&quot; claims sovereignty over all human-inhabited worlds, but that's all we ever find out about what motivates them, nor do we ever see a single enemy face-to-face despite extensive ground action on the surface of the planet. As for Buchanan itself, it isn't very alien. We encounter only one alien species in the beginning of the story, otherwise the story could take place in a wilderness area on earth. This one species, the hippobary, is remarkably like our hippotamus and plays almost no role in the story. Nor are there any political complications back on the Commonwealth homeworld to make things more interesting. In fact, there is never any contact of any kind between the Commonwealth and the Federation as far as the reader knows.In short, this story is okay as far as it goes, but it doesn't go very far. There are no surprises or twists in this plot. No external complications of any kind intrude into the operation. The story is entirely straightforward and predictable from beginning to end. Something like a scoop of vanilla ice cream -- it's fine if that's what you want, but most people prefer something more interesting. &quot;The Buchanan Campaign&quot; is mediocre at best."},{"Title":"The Buchanan Campaign","review":"The introduction was imaginative and held me in rapt state of attention. However, fifty pages later it was clear how the book would end and the book became a chore to finish.The characters are clean cut and represent themselves well. Their society is orderly, envision clipped green hedges and tidy lawns. The cause is fair and just, representing higher, but not unreasonable, ideals. The story, like the characters, reflects an array of stable and secure ideals, comfortable in their superiority.On the plus side, the book is well written and the characters, in their sterile world, are complete. They just don't seem real.No plot twists, no surprises, just a cadre of good men fighting the unimaginative, but very tidy, good fight.3 stars, no surprise:)"},{"Title":"The Buchanan Campaign","review":"Rick Shelley has extrapolted another possible future of our expansion into the vast ocean of space, which appears to reflect historical events.

I feel that Rcck Shelley has done a great job in developing all the major characters in the book. This book is well worth reading.

The twist that sets this above most contemporary military sf is the uniqueness of having the Second (British) Commonwealth being a major power in space -- while the pseudo-democratic Confederation is the enemy. The story is well told and focuses more on the human condition than on &quot;Big Science&quot;. In fact, I was surprised at how Shelley's future was so very familiar in terms of both science and human nature.

Read him and you will be hooked."},{"Title":"The Buchanan Campaign","review":"The Buchanan Campaign is, at best, a bus or train book. Not that it's bad but it's not great either. The plot is simple - a poor, defenseless, planet that never harmed anybody and isn't worth a penny has been invade by the Big Bad Guys. The story is pretty simple after that. The Second Commonwealth has been asked to come to the planet's aid and beat back the Federation.The part that really hurt the book was all the minor characters that died just to try to make the reader respond. That's the only reason the minor characters were made - to die. And their deaths did nothing to push the story or plot along. The ending also seemed a tad railroaded - the author was going from point A to point B no matter how the characters felt about it.The good part is the Big Bad Guys are neither stupid nor cowards. The Federation ground troops have a few tricks up their sleeves and the Federation Navy isn't about to leave without a fight. So the tactics and battles, while not as well crafted as I would like, are not as bland as they would be if the Big Bad Guys were also idiots or plain EVIL."},{"Title":"The Buchanan Campaign","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read, After reading this I went to every book store in search of more books by Rick."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"SOMEONE INTRODUCED TO THIS AUTHOR AND I HAD READ OF HER BOOKS EXCEPT THIS ONE AND IT WAS GOOD AS THE REST."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"I like the book but that's about all I can say.

A gorgeous silver necklace, holding an antique charm, which is beautiful, while at the same time strange. Of course, when Sam rubs the charm and wishes to disappear at the sound of her Father's booming voice coming through the front door, she never realizes that it will take her back in time, to the bedchamber of sickly Edward VI, the teenage king of England in 1553. Soon she has cured Edward of his illness, and is being called his \\"sweet angel.\\" She feels life life is perfect, except for her loneliness, and the knowledge that now Edward has changed from being sweet, and kind to all, to being rude, and nasty to anyone he pleases. Of course, Sam still believes that she will be safe, and protected with Edward, until she falls for Sir Barnaby. A handsome stranger, who has captured her heart, and is ready to save her life, whenever the time comes. And the time may come sooner than Sam thinks.I feel that Judith O'Brien has done a fantastic job with TIMELESS LOVE. The descriptions of ancient England are absolutely beautiful, and so vivid, that you actually feel as if you are there, right alongside all of the exciting characters. Samantha is a fun character, who keeps her spunky personality, even when she is taken by surprise after surprise. Edward VI is a character whom you love to hate. Barnaby is the typical night in shining armor. And Lady Jane...Lady Jane is the character who has captured my attention. She is an intelligent young woman, whom completes the story. With her endless tutoring, and talk of Plato and Socrates, she will capture the heart of all readers. A must-read for all fans of historical novels. Especially ones that involve royalty.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"I found this book in my school library and checked it out for some fun reading. I could not put it down after reading the first chapter, I was totally hooked and was drawn in to a world of love. I love the fact that it takes place in the year of 1553. I love it when she just shows up in king Edwards chamber. I personly love all the characters even Northumberland because he one of those characters that you love to hate. I was thrilled when Sam meet Sir Barnaby Fritzpatrick, because you know that they were meant to be with eachother and it got better when they kissed. The most interesting part was when Sam was taught to dance the volta by Elizabeth who would be the greatest Queen. this book keeps you wanting to read more and more, and always on the edge of your seat. I would be thrilled to see it made into a movie because it would be one of the greatest. I could and will read this book 68 more times. Fiction books are my favorite and this one is at number 1 on my list. I advise all those out there wanting to read a great time travel and romance (that last through different time eras) book, to pick this book up and read it. When one of the characters shows up surprisingly at the end you will won't to read the second book even though there isn't a second one.

She can't wait to get her driver's license, she's looking forward to having the party she's been having planned, and can't wait to get to meet 'Kevin the Hunk' up close! But when she wrecks her father's precious BMW, she wishes to was anywhere but home. Strangely enough, by chance while holding onto the strange antique charm hung around her neck (an early birthday present), she is magically transported to... England in the year 1553! She meets the sickly Edward VI who is the young king of England. He is her own age, and Sam knows he is supposed to die at about sixteen. Determined to save his life, she does just that. Soon, the sick king is back to full health and everything seems to go beautifully. But as Sam thinks about returning back to her time, she is swept into the middle of a dangerous situation where her life might be at stake...First off, I must say that I love all stories about history and romance. Judith O'Brien is a terrific writer and after reading the book it was most obvious she had done her research well. The descriptions are vividly written down, life back in the 1550s was certainly not all about beautiful parties and great adventures. The food, the hygiene, the clothes, etc., everything is made into a reality in the story as Sam struggles in extreme 'culture shock'.The characters are on the whole likable. Sam is a bit too ordinary and is nobody really special. An 'ok' main character though she could have been made a bit more interesting. Historical characters such as Edward VI and Jane Grey are pretty well developed, and I especially loved Princess Elizabeth (soon-to-be the wonderful Queen Elizabeth!). The Duke of Northumberland is a 'good' bad guy. Barnaby Fitzpatrick is unfortunately not a character who went through good character development. By the end of the book, we really didn't know anything about his personality or anything.Which brings me to have to explain the reason for my giving only 3 stars for \\"Timeless Love\\". For once thing, as I said earlier, both Sam and Barnaby were... I don't know, they just felt flat and one dimensional. I just really couldn't relate to them as much as I would like to with the main characters of a story. And as it is hinted in the title, I can't really classify this as a real 'romance' story since Sam doesn't even meet Barnaby till like your a little more than half way through he book. So the little romance there is feels a bit rushed. Also, it's a bit strange and doesn't fit in with the rest of the story, plus it is too unbelievable.All in all, the story is not that bad.

But it wasn't the greatest I'd ever read. The beginning of her stay in 1553 was dragging by halfway through the book and her emotions were not really shown. One minute she would be hysterical and want to go home, and then the next minute she didn't seem to care. Some parts were detailed while others were vague. Her character was not consistent. Then she only met the guy she was to fall in love with (and my did they fall in love pretty fast) near the end of the book.

Clutching her birthday present, an antique locket, she wishes desperately to escape, and finds herself thrown back in time to England in 1553, to the castle of fifteen-year-old King Edward VI. The sickly Edward thinks Sam is his angel, come to take him to heaven. But with her modern knowledge, Sam brings Edward back from the brink of death. As months go by, Sam begins to adjust to life in the past, although she still longs for a way to return home. Then she meets Barnaby, a handsome nobleman, and falls in love with him.

However, the romance between Samantha and Barnaby developed too quickly to be very believable, and the ending was unrealistically happy.

This interesting story written by Judith O'Brien is a teen fiction that incorporates both the subjects of history and romance in it. The story starts out with Samantha, also known as Sam, accidentally crashing her father's new BMW. Sam ends up making a wish that she was anywhere else but home because she didn't want to face the consequences her father was going to give her. Incidentally, she was holding the strange charm necklace that her mother gave her while she was making the wish. All of a sudden, Sam ends up feeling dizzy and opens her eyes to realize that she is in England, in the bedchamber of Edward VI, the young king of England in 1553. Edward, who is about her age, looked very ill because he was sick and was going to die at the age of sixteen. Sam knows about Edward's early death from her history book and so she tries to save King Edward from it. She helps to restore the king's health to normal. She may have thought she performed a good deed, but actually she ended up making the lives of thousands of people who Edward ruled, worse. It is not until later that she realized that she isn't in a dream and that she might not ever get to go back home. She then starts to appreciate and value the objects, possessions, and people she took for granted in her life. The experience of being trapped in a different time era and place makes you really think and be grateful for what you have. Sam even misses her annoying brother and even said that she would give p anything just to be back home. In the 1500s, they didn't have television, or running water, or even electricity. But the whole situation wasn't all that horrible. Sam ended up meeting a very handsome guy and even ended up having a crush on him, but this infatuation they had with each other leads to problems later on in the novel. Both jealousy and conspiracy plays a role in aiding the problems to occur. There is also a character named Duke of Northumberland who greatly despises Sam because of all the changes she has brought about in the kingdom. Due to the drastic changes she helped to bring about, while she was by Edward's side, the future ended up changing with it. Sam's interference with the past changed the entire future. When Sam finally returned back home, by making a wish on her necklace, she realized that her home wasn't right. The changed she made while she was in England changed the whole course of history that was suppose to happen. Many of the great inventions and even didn't occur. She then finds a way to fix the problem so that the course of history turns out the way it should and for the greater good of the whole world.Timeless Love is a very enjoyable book to read that anyone would like. This book has many intriguing twists and will keep the readers attention throughout the entire book. The diction and style Judith O'Brien uses is very effective. All of the descriptive words she uses make it possible for the readers to clearly visualize the time period in the 1500s. The reader can actually visualize the clothing and atmosphere back in that time period. This novel is great for teenagers to read on their free time and I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to enjoy reading books about adventure, fantasy, romance, or a little about history."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"When I heard of this book, I immediately went to the nearest book store to buy it. It was a story about love in a different era, my favorite kind of book. However upon reading it, I found it dull, and rushed. The book was extremly short to have developed a true romance, especially since the pair don't meet until well into the book. I found the characters to be boring... I couldn't relate to anything with them, I couldn't feel what they were feeling. Even in a moment of peril, my mind was wondering. Another thing is that Edward, believing that she is an angel, reports it to several others, including Jane Grey. Upon questioning she reveals that she came from the future, a different time era. These people accept the fact too willingly. Sure, there is the two paragraphs where Jane is frightened of her, but she accepts her unbelievable story nonetheless. It was completely irrational for someone to do then, even today. The idea is just too preposterous to take lightly. Especially for someone as educated and somber as Jane Grey. The reason I even gave it two stars, is because it accurately tells about the fashion, foods, and hygene standards that existed back in the sixteenth century... even though it takes a minimal amount of research... something a fifth grader could do. The storyline sounds wonderful, but unfortunately, it was written quite poorly.I'd reccomend it for ages 10 and under. Sure, it may be a romance novel, but as far as I'm concerned, the book is too easy to comprehend, and there isn't that much romance at all."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"I bought this book after reading a review somewhere. When i picked it up i was like ok it is good but it did get better. It is definetly for kids 15 or younger just becuase of the way it is written. However i am 21 and i liked it.After wrecking her dad's brand new BMW, she wishs (while holding her necklace) that she was anywhere else only to transported back in time. She soon finds herself in love and wanting some soap. She eventually gets back only to find that everthing has changed because she went back in time, so she goes back again to fix what she did. She even just might get the guy she loves from when she went back in time :)......"},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"Timeless Love, at first glance, seems like a cool book with an interesting premise. That's the reason I bought it. But unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. It was chock full of lame ideas and not very well written. The cliches and sadly overused plot points were insufferable. It bored me half to death and I barely finished it. That's too bad, because in the hands of someone else, the book might have been really great. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"T.S. Eliot once famously said, \\"Some editors are failed writers, but so are most writers.\\" This saying is very ably demonstrated here.I found this book painful to read, not only because it was dull and tedious, but also because it was implausible, illogical, grammatically flawed and just plain badly written. The writer didn't seem to know how to write properly, and I'm convinced that she didn't actually understand the meaning of many of the words she was using, judging by the way she used them. She just sort of threw them together, and made pretty sentences that weren't entirely right. Moreover, she didn't just fail in a grammatical sense, she also failed to create a compelling, interesting storyline, which in my view is a far, far bigger sin. I can overlook grammatical flaws in a plot, so long as there's some great ideas behind it (as in the case of 'Lady Knight' by Evangelynn Stratton, or 'The Rose and the Beast' by Francesca Lia Block, which are both amazing books.) But there was no forgiving this. I almost got the feeling that this writer was a history teacher trying to make a history lesson more 'interesting' by turning it into a novel...and failing. There was loads of historical fact here--most of it dry, a little of it highly interesting. But it stood out from the plot rather than blending in. A good writer would have blended history and fiction until they became indistinguishable, like melting together chocolate and cream to make a delectable, tasty truffle. But this was more like blending tripe and lentils...the blend was obviously a mismatch, and an unpalatable one at that.I lost count of how many times I put this book down, thinking, 'I can't go on, this is more painful than getting a leg wax!' And yet, I did persevere, because I paid retail plus shipping costs for this book (which, when you factor in the exchange rate of my humble Aussie dollars to your American ones, is quite a bit of dosh!) and thus thought, gosh-darn it, I'm going to get my money's worth out of it! So I finished the damned thing. But frankly, in retrospect, I would rather have had the leg wax.If you're a hopeless romantic like I am, my guess is that you are going to be disappointed with this book too. In spite of the book's title literally promising 'Timeless Love', the reader doesn't even glimpse the hero for the first time until TWO THIRDS of the way through the book. And even then, the romance between him and the heroine is as underdone as a rare steak. This writer seemed VERY afraid of writing anything remotely mushy. One wonders if she shouldn't be writing non-fiction history books, as she seems to know her stuff much better when it comes to that.The characters are two dimensional and unlikeable (actually, the bad guy was almost more interesting than the good guys), the heroine 'Sam' is often as dumb as a box of hammers but with less charisma, the dialogue is almost worse than a kiss from a scorpion with haliotosis, and the plotline is so full of holes I could use it as a collander. The worst thing, though, the thing that I found most implausible about the plot (other than the way the future changed when Sam went back and forward through time which was so fraught with paradox I began to yell \\"That couldn't happen!!\\") was the fact that Sam could cure King Edward VI's terminal illness simply by making a few changes to his diet, and taking a dog and a bit of fur out of his room. Now, I should have found this plot twist compelling, since I myself suffer from food and environmental allergies, and know what a huge impact they can have on your life. But no way are allergies that easy to diagnose and fix, and no way can they be cured in the space of A FEW HOURS, especially without cleaning any extra animal hairs and dander out of the bed linen or environment! Call me pedantic, but that was just too unrealistic for me.The front cover is the nicest thing about this book. But of course, even this is flawed. The girl on the front cover has beautiful, straight blonde hair, whereas the heroine in the book has frizzy, over-permed, damaged hair with ugly streaks through it.I gave this book two stars because it's not completely without merit. The author does do things right from time to time, and you'll even find the occasional touch of brilliance here and there. But otherwise, I don't think this was worth the sacrifice of chopping down the trees needed to make the paper it was printed on. The nine to twelve year olds will probably find this okay, so long as they're history buffs. But for anyone older, they may find they've already outgrown it.If you're interested in love stories set in this exact period of time that involve Lady Jane and King Edward VI then get hold of the dvd 'Lady Jane' starring Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes. It's touching, it's poignant, it's sweet and it's a damned sight better written than this book."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"I read the book Timeless Love by Judith O'Brien. It is about a girl named Samantha who is magically whisked back in time to England in 1553. While she is there, she is known as Lady Sam. Lady Sam comes to know the procedures of the court. She helps King Edward grow stronger, but he starts becoming a tyrant. In the midst of all this, Sam meets a stunningly handsome stranger who steals her heart away. Timeless Love has great description, a superb plot, and several surprising turns of events.One example of the description in this book is when Sam first meets Edward. \\"...Wrapped in what appeared to be a very thick bathrobe with fur on the collar. On his head was an embroidered cap tied under his chin.\\" This description gave me a very clear mental picture of how Samantha saw King Edward. The entire book had as much description as this passage. Furthermore, Judith O'Brien described people's feelings, looks, and behavior. Another example of description is when Edward thinks of himself as a vibrant prince full of robust vigor. He was no longer a pious youth with red-rimmed eyes and otherworldly air.Not only did this book have great details, but it also had a strong plot. All the events of this book came together and fit. The content of this book was part historical and part romantical. For instance, when Sam's eyes meet Sir Barnaby's eyes, the mysterious young man's expression changed. He bowed to her from across the room, and the smile on his face left. This young man steals her heart at once, and she comes to know him well in a short time. Lady Sam feels that she is in love, and it is more than just a crush. One other potent element of this book is the historical part. King Edward the sixth is in the novel along with Lady Jane Grey, the duke of Northumberland, Barnaby Fitzpatrick, etc. All those people actually existed in the 1500s. Every piece of clothing mentioned in this novel was actually what the woman had to wear in the 1500s. Lastly, the ways of life in this novel are very similar to what life was like then. Bowing and curtsying was a way of life.The last thing I really liked about this book was the interesting twists. Some very unusual things occurred. Sam's friend Lori tried to give her a perm and highlights. But, everything went wrong. Her hair ended up very frizzy, and it resembled straw. Many other twists and turns played themselves out in this novel. A final example of interesting things that occurred in this novel is when Sam first meets King Edward. He thinks that she is an angel sent to him by his mother. These are both very small details in the story, but I never expected them to occur.The description, plot, and interesting twists of Timeless Love were dazzling. I would recommend this book to girls who enjoy books with historic elements and lots of adventure. Girls who like small romantic details and science fiction would enjoy this too. This novel gives a twist on history, and was very fun to read. Miss O'Brien did a wonderful job of combining history and fiction to create an awesome book."},{"Title":"Timeless Love","review":"I was so engrossed. I started yesterday and finished today. I could see them dancing, talking, flurting, and arguing right in front of me. It was so vivid.Sam made a wish and it came true, now, she's in 1553. You are with her as she learns to acclimate to her new environment and the people around her. You feel her passion, and confusion and her sense of not belonging. But you are with her as she overcomes it all.Like I said, I couldn't put it down. You might also want to try reading the Out of Time series by Caroline B. Cooney. Kind of the same picture.

Masterful photographs coupled with a very well designed and produced book. A joint venture between a noted photographer and the El Paso Museum of Art (and Foundation) and the Trinity University Press."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book by H.H. the Dalai Lama may be read by those wishing an introduction to Tibetan Buddhism and by those wishing to begin or develop their practice.The Dalai Lama attempts to answer the basic question: \\"How can people be happy?\\" His answer outlines a path of spiritual growth and practice. Although based upon Tibetan Buddhism, there is wisdom in the book for anybody seeking spiritual growth, within or without any specific religious practice.The book consists of six short sections. It begins with a brief discussion of the life of the Buddha which, as the Dalai Lama points out, encompasses the basic teachings of the Buddhist path: morality, concentrated meditation and wisdom. The Dalai Lama then explains the basis of each teaching in short chapters. It is good that the book gives its focus to moral practice -- curing anger, lust, hatred, and agression and wishing well to oneself and others.Chapter III of the book discusses meditation practices and will introduce the beginner to the value of meditation and to several meditation techniques. The Dalai Lama stresses the need for consistent practice and for patience and for the need of controlling one's expectations.There are several chapters which discuss the difficult but key Buddhist teaching of dependent origination. Much of this material the Dalai Lama also covers in an earlier book called \\"The Meaning of Life.\\"There is a concluding section on Tantra, a uniquely Tibetan practice. I think it is better for the average person to remain with the practices of morality and concentration described earlier in the book.Some of the unique features of this book are the Dalai Lama's anecdotes of his life in Tibet before the Chinese Invasion of 1950 and of his teachers. There is a substantial discussion of sexuality in the book and of how it may be used (and abused) in the search for peace and kindness. (pages 192-196) There is a translation of the Heart Sutra, a key Buddhist text with a commentary by the Dalai Lama. (159-163)I found the Dalai Lama's concluding paragraph captures much of the tenor and the value of this book (page 223):\\"Though my own knowledge is limited and my experience is also very poor, I have tried my best to help you understand the full breadth of the Buddha's teaching. Please implement whatever in these pages appears to be helpful. If you follow another religion, please adopt whatever might assist you. If you do not think it would be helpful, just leave it alone.\\""},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I am completely new to Buddhism and am thoroughly impressed by the Dalai Lama's clear, simple explanation. He effectively describes how even a complete Western beginner like myself can begin to end suffering by practicing. Throughout the book, the Dalai Lama's enlightenment and compassion shine off of the pages through modest stories of his life and experiences. The Dalai Lama starts out the book with the basics of Buddhist morality, moves on to the practice of meditation, and ends with the details of wisdom and tantra. There are images for meditation, lists of moral and amoral thoughts and deeds, and even a short explanation of the concept of emptiness.Most striking of all is the Dalai Lama's comment at the very end of the book, \\"Though my own knowledge is limited and my experience is also very poor, I have tried my best to help you understand the full breadth of the Buddha's teaching.\\" With these words, the Dalai Lama sets a startling example for the aspiring student by both showing humility and providing a reminder of the breadth and depth of Buddhist enlightenment. I higly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in beginning to follow the Buddhist path."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Many people choose not to read the books by his Holiness the Dalai Lama because they believe that this will offend or counter their own religious beliefs. Quite to the contrast, everybody can take the simple practices of this book to better their everyday lives.One line in this book has stood out in the my mind. &quot;You should realize that difficult present circumstances are entirely due to your own past undisciplined actions, so when you experience a difficult period, do you best to avoid behavior that will add to the burden later on.&quot; (p 38). This is just one example of the suggestions given to living a more fulfilling life. I believe that he is right in his suggestion that money and posessions will not make a person happy in life. Each of us must discover what gives meaning to our life. To find this is really not that difficult as His Holiness reveals where it lies.This book is highly recommended for anybody seeking personal and spiritual growth."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This is not really an introductory Buddhist text, although the previous reviews suggest that some (but not all) non-Buddhists have gained by reading it. Rather, it's title exactly describes it - if you are a practicing Buddhist, it tells you \\"How To Practice\\".Of course, there is no single way to practice - in fact, there are at least 84,000 ways to practice spread over many traditions (Theravadan (SE Asia), Mahayanan (Zen, Pure Land), and Vajrayana (Tibetan). This book is primarily written for Tibetan Buddhists, but the guidelines are sufficiently broad that I have given this book to Zen and Theravaden Buddhists who found much to agree about.The book is broken into three major sections - mirroring the three fold grouping often applied to the 8-fold path: morality, meditation and wisdom. The book also introduces the Tantric methods of Vajrayanan Buddhism.Each chapter covers it's topic in a clear, concise fashion, and ends with a \\"Summary for Daily Practice\\". This helps tie the writing (which can be somewhat theoretical) into the title of the book \\"How To Practice\\".The first section introduces the Four Noble Truths, and expands upon them and finally brings them to ground in practices such as such as the Four Wholesum Practices, the Six Perfections, etc.The second section is a brief but very clear introduction to various types of meditation, including analytical and stabilizing meditation, etc. I have loaned the book to other practitioners and they agree that this is a great book to loan to beginners.The third section is about Wisdom - the nature of reality and relative and ultimate truth (and for those of you who are really dedicated - emptiness). He ties all of this together with brief analysis of the Heart Sutra.The book is only 220-odd pages long. This means it is just a brief overview. A Tibetan scholar (Geshe) will spend 18 years studying 1000's of pages covering these topics. However, in one way of looking at it the book is far too long. A student of Zen might say the whole answer is contained in one Koan or statement such as \\"Go Straight\\". And that too is the nature of Buddhism - it is both so huge and ulitmately so simple.Myself? I am at amazon.com to buy 5 copies as gifts for new practitioners (generosity of Dharma - one of the 6 perfections). That means it gets my highest personal rating, as I wouldn't give away anything that didn't meet the highest standards."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book demonstrates how ordinary daily activities can become a form of spiritual practice.

In this book, the Dalai Lama has provided an instruction manual to live a meaningful and happy life. It is not quite a self-help book for people who are lost. It is more a direction for people who wants to explore deeper into this live that we are living. To me, it is more a philosophy than a religion. Read it, and come back to it a few years later.

While the Dalai Lama's teachings are not always easy to implement adhere to, he would invariably point out that &quot;life itself is not easy.&quot; Living a life of peace and contentment generally means taking a look inside one's self and weeding out the negative and self-defeating habits and attitudes.

And, surprisingly, he's very funny! He had the entire rutgars stadium laughing!But I digress. This book is truly beautiful. You know that feeling you get in your heart when everything is right with the world and you are filled with so much love that you want to explode? That's the feeling I get every time I read this book.This really helped me find the path. With simple teachings of love, you are drawn right to the heart of Tibetan Buddhism. This book helps you cultivate selfless love, begin meditating (something I couldn't understand before this book), and ultimately live a better life.This, like many of the Dalai Lama's books, is not meant exclusively for Buddhists. He hardly even focuses on The Buddha. Instead, The Dalai Lama draws from his personal experiences and all that he has learned in his lifetime to convey the need for love and peace in your life.I cannot even begin to describe how remarkable this book is. Please read this!"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I'm not sure if my title suggests that I like it or have reservations.....well, I thought it was a great read.It has a good bit of history about not only Tibet, the Dalai Lama, but also a fair bit about Buddhism. This is ALL of course critical to understanding from where these ideals came from.The Dalai Lama is very open, tolerant and in fact positive about people of other religions. In fact, he does in fact seem to be true to his introduction in that the book isn't so much trying to convert you to Buddhism as to convince you why these Buddhist values and practices are valuable to people of all religion. (and the Nihilist as well) He of course presents his arguments from the Buddhist perspective as you would fully expect.OK, but after all the above glowing about the book, I have to admit that there were several chapters in the final third of the book that I mildly confusing. I think I was confused because many of the unfamilar terms and definitions he creates were getting lost and confused in my head.I am a Christian, and while most of the low-level values (good and evil) are quite familiar to me.....some of the writings on meditation were quite new to me, yet very educational and interesting. But some of the other concepts....oh, like the definitions of the various types of suffering (suffering of change, pervasive suffering) were difficult for me to remember and ultimately made it difficult to follow some of the writings in those chapters.I have to admit that this is probably totally my own fault as I had decided to sit down and read the book in a single sitting, and did so without stopping. (and no, I didn't have a gun to my own head, even with the above confusion, I did enjoy it totally...a second reading will probably clear it all up for me)The end of the book seemed to pull it all together for me, and as I read it it allowed me to mull over all the concepts presented in the prior chapters. I highly recommend you read this book, particularly if you are yourself looking for meaning and more value for your life."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"The Dalai Lama is the teacher of kindness and compassion. I have read this book many times. As with all of the Dalai Lama's works, each time I read them I find new understanding. Even just reinforcing what I already know is so important. This book is so clear, with so much love and kindness, I can only repeat this over and over. No matter what philosophy, religion, way of life, I challange anyone to read this book and say they were not deeply moved by the kindness, love and compassion of the Dalai Lama for both each individual human and for humanity and life in it's totality. Easy to read, well written, great organization, incredible message, both logical, intelligent, and powerful....... this book is a sure winner!!!!!!!!!!But this book, read it several times, then after you read and learn more about Budhism, read it again."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"In this short text the Dalai Lama directs his words towards Western readers and goes into a good amount of detail concerning vast topics, the most important of which I think is his explanation of dependent-arising. He fails in his layout and overall rhetoric and I believe this book would be best suited for either the those new to Buddhism that are not apt to question much, or for those who have had a satisfactory introduction to Buddhism already.After some introduction to the Four Noble Truths which is quite good, he begins his treatise with the imperative of selflessness as the key to greater inner peace. I think that many Westerners who have grown beyond the traditional morality of their societies and are looking for something deeper will find this initial framing of Buddhism rather hard to swallow. For many it is the logic and reason that gives Buddhism it's inner light and wisdom that draws them to it, and yet the Dalai Lama's instruction here has no strong rationality behind it - he expects you to accept his words as wise, and continue reading. For those of you who purchase this book and find this to be true, I implore you to continue reading, for the best parts of the book at near the end! After meditating on what is said in later portions of the book, I cannot say that any of the Dalai Lama's words are inherently untrue or misleading. However, he then goes on in great detail about the stages of death and the special meditations one should do - this should be placed in the end of the book, or perhaps have it's own book, since the majority of this text is aimed at recruiting those of all faiths and those with no faith to essentially add to their depth of understanding of reality.I recommend beginning withBuddha's Brain: The Practical Neuroscience of Happiness, Love, and Wisdomfor the more intellectually curious and/or logical thinker. It will give you a good grounding from which the Dalai Lama's words may take root, and through your own practice, grow to great heights."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This is your Bible, guys and gals. The Dali Lama is the mostwell-adjusted man since Gandhi. ... He has never created an instruction manual before. This is the instruction manual.

His mispronounciations and accent are so irritating it's hard to pay attention to the book and the fact that he reads \\"How to See Yourself As You Really Are\\" keeps me from buying the audiobook, which is a disappointment."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book has very good concepts that could be applied to daily living to create a more harmonious existence, however, it is not for those who do not subscribe to the Buddhist practices as it outlines a core of beliefs inherent to the religion."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I wouldn't quite call \\"How to Practice: The Way to a Meaningful Life\\" by the Dalai Lama a primer on Buddhism, because I feel that someone with no foreknowledge of Buddhist philosophy and practice might quickly get lost amidst the vast amount of information contained in this little volume. However, if you understand the basics, His Holiness presents the details of how to practice, in the Tibetan way, in a very clear and concise presentation. I found myself coming to several new and exciting revelations as I read this book, things I will be working on in my own meditations for some time to come.I did have a few issues with this book. As with most books intended to teach a way to practice (whether it be religion, philosophy, or even sports) there is a certain amount of repetition. By the third or forth time the same thing was repeated I was ready to just skip over it, which would have been a shame because intermixed with some of them were a few wonderful stories about the Dalai Lama himself and his own journey toward Buddhahood. I also found some of his examples to be distracting, especially when they were taken from traditional teachings or contained particularly difficult names. I plodded through these sections and gleaned what I could from them, but feel a less traditional approach might have translated better.If you have more than a passing interest in Buddhism or the ways of meditation, then you can't do much better than this book by the Dalai Lama himself!"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Very well written book, with great advice, and wisdom for anyone, regardless of religious belief. You don't have to be a Buddhist to like this book, and use the teaching offered within!"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I appreciate this spiritual leaders strength and knowledge. His tendency to share in any way possible to any willing to listen is just one of his wonderful qualities. This book is nothing short of what I'd expect of his Holiness. Wonderful insight and information. The only issue I'm finding with this publication: the text seems to be expressed in what I can only perceive as 'aggressive'. While I know the manner in which he speaks may not translate as I might hope or expect, I have to wonder if the editor/ publisher had anything to do or not do about that. I find this similarity with books by Osho as well. His way of speaking must be taken into consideration when reading. Makes it much easier to get into a rhythm and increases the level of comprehension. If this book seems hard to read, just keep going. Maybe slow down and just let the words wash over you. It might take a few readings for this new information to soak in. It's not so much about actually understanding each and every word or phrase. But if you allow it, the parts you need the most just might stick even though you weren't trying. Peace and love to you."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"People of many backgrounds and faiths admire the Dalai Lama for his nonviolent and inspirational struggle to free his home land and the Tibetan people. I was drawn to this \\"Buddhist daily devotional\\" when the military junta began its crackdown against the monks in Burma. I have found it to be like a dipper of cool well water on a furnace-hot day: simple, refreshing and strengthening.The first 55% of the book could be read and understood by anyone. In terms that sound like common sense, the Dalai Lama explores the example of the Buddha, the basic moral and ethical practices of Buddhism. The first six chapters constitute the easiest and clearest exposition of Buddhist thought and practice that I have ever seen. Before this book, I found writers on Buddhism to be overly enamored of lists, i.e. the Four Noble Truths or the Eightfold Path. What is most excellent about this slender volume is that it shows how a layperson of any faith can incorporate these principles into daily life.Chapters 7, 8, and 9 are more difficult but still understandable with careful reading and thought. These cover mediation practices and deeper philosophical aspects. Here the clarity of the language sometimes encounters the density of my head. I have to put the book down and go off and think about it, come back and read it again. This can be quietly exciting as the mind is forced to think in new ways.The final section of the book is for advanced Buddhist practitioners and is completely over my head. I think I would need a teacher to understand some of the concepts referenced here. For this part of the book I find the end of chapter summaries most useful and still clear and simple in their insistence that moral and religious practice must be practiced in daily life. That part of this practice is toleration, even admiration, of other faiths is one of the most inspiring parts of the Dalai Lama's message."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Let me start by saying that I am not religous at all, although I respect and am very interested in all religions. I am drawn to eastern religions for their unique way of looking at life. But his book is not a book for either a beginner or advanced student of eastern religion or even spirituality, unless they are just curious to read something by the Dalai Lama. I have not read anything else written by him, but I was surprised at his lack of style in writing and his ceasless repetition of his ideas.The book is not an uninteresting read, so for anyone really interested in the Buddhist perspective on the issues of \\"A meaningful life\\", definitely read it, though you may find yourself a bit dissapointed at the end, as I did, at the lack of direction you feel at the end of the book. The Dalai Lama defends Buddhism as being a depressing religion, which I don't think it is, but does so very poorly. I suggest reading other authors if you want to learn about buddhism, and not getting this book solely because of who it is written by."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book along with other books from many different people helped my get through tough times easier."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"The content seems good here but the book is very difficult to read. I found that I had to stop and think about every sentence, every paragraph, to grasp what was being said b/c it is filled with jargon that I am not familiar with. Would be better if written in \\"plain english\\"."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book is about the practice of kindness and Buddhism. Like helping the poor, etc. But here's a question I thought of: how do those aspiring Buddhas meditating away in their temples help the poor? Where are they when earthquakes strike? Do you see them helping others in Dharfur, Haiti, Chili, and the other disaster-striken countries of the world? I haven't. The book says you should have only one robe, or at most, one extra robe. This would be if youre a hard core Buddhist. Also, if these guys are into giving and helping the poor, why is it they walk through neighborhoods and residents feed the monks with their donations? Isn't it supposed to be the other way round? At least the way the book reads, it's supposed to be. You can see the contradiction. Moreover, the Buddhist monks in China practice Kung Fu. Hey, I'm all for defending oneself, but I don't see any mention of Kung Fu in this book. From another source I found out that Shaolin monks combine meditation and physicality to perfect their art of self defense.I think the reality of our world is set up for a predator-prey scenario. You see it in nature. The only way to survive is to be alert and have a good defense. For some people, the best defense is a good offense. And those are the ones I try to avoid. Centuries ago, the first Buddha's country was invaded and many people, including women and children, were killed. And all the Buddha did was sit in his lotus position as he was informed of the slaughter. He did nothing. Is this a role model for survival? That is why the some Buddhists decided to include martial arts.The suffering they mention is really dissatisfaction. So to eliminate dissatisfaction (suffering) you must eliminate desire. But, not all desire--the desire to do good is fine; the desire to do harm...not so good.The path, or goal, of Buddhism is threefold: morality, meditation, and wisdom. If you practice the first two, then you may achieve wisdom. And meditation leads to a very focused mind, which is why it is used in martial arts. (This is where it's useful)To achieve morality, you should remove lust and hate from your life. I can understand removing hate (and anger), but lust is a natural part of our makeup. That's what I don't like about religion in general--they manipulate you into thinking and doing what they want you to.Before finishing the book the topic of what to eat came up once again. This time he said that vegetarianism is best, that the best Bhuddist is a vegetarian Bhuddist. But earlier he said it was okay to eat meat. Maybe the trainees are allowed meat until they advance further along. Pacifism is a dominant theme and yet the Kung Fu Bhuddists in China are masters of their devastating martial art. Definitely a contradiction there. But I think Tibetan Buddhists follow the pacifist dogma. As for meditation, I cant really see myself doing exactly what they say: setting up a chubby little Bhudda statue, making offerings to it, and meditating in front of it. However, I like the discipline of the moral compass that is suggested in the book. And I think you can meditate and follow most of the principles in the book and perhaps still reach a certain level of enlightenment, perhaps without being a total convert. In fact I'd like to combine it with Daoism (Taoism). Even the Dalai Lama said you don't have to use everything in the book--just use what you think is helpful. And he is humble enough to praise other religions for the good work they do--I liked that.In the later chapters it is asserted that reality does not exist! This is simply sophism, in my opinion. Some of this stuff in the later chapters becomes esoteric pseudo-science. More to the point, it's really philosophy, along the lines of Kant. I mean, the Buddha did not come up with the scientific method. And if someone discounts the reality of a speeding bus, then step in front of it to find out! (not recommended) However, I am not discounting the usefulness of meditation itself. Buddhism is just another myth that has been around for 2500 years. (the myth part is the chubby Buddha and reincarnation) Nevertheless, it has some attractive aspects.\\"The practice of meditation itself sharpens your mind and improves your memory, qualities that are certainly useful beyond spiritual practice, whether in business, engineering, raising a family, or being a teacher, doctor, or lawyer. This practice also helps on a daily basis with anger. When irritated, you can concentrate on the nature of the anger itself and thereby undermine its force.\\"Perhaps separating one's thought from emotion is also an idea to keep level-headed.On a personal note, the first time I tried meditation something very startling happened. I had read some of Meditation For Dummies at the bookstore. I did a short meditation while in the bookstore. later that night, I awoke at around 2 AM and my mind felt crystal clear. I thought I was losing my mind. My heart was racing. I quickly calmed down and felt normal once again. However, I think since then my mind has been sharper and I have read more books than before. Intellectual curiosity if you will. I am reading and learning more about how to meditate and plan to continue doing it.Also, here are a few dreams I had after my first meditation session from the previous day, and just after reading How To Practice. I had all but forgotten about the dream(s) when I got on the main highway the next day. In the first one, I was quick off the light as I accelerated in my Infiniti I-30, and this rad monster truck was off to my right. We were side by side, and about to race really. In one of my dreams just the night before I had exactly that in my dream!!!! The truck in my dream raced me, and it was a large full size monster truck, essentially the same as the one I was next to only hours later. (I immediately snapped, recalling the dream, wow!!) In real life, he accelerated to full throttle and I let him have my lane, which he wanted. I didnt race him--no reason to. In the dream there was someone stopped up ahead anyway and in real life the next light was just up ahead, with stopped cars.The other dream I had I was observing a scene of something or other and at the center of my vision it just peeled away, like a movie screen, showing something different, like a pattern, instead. This dream was telling my that reality is not reality. I was stunned because I had written most of this review and the comments on reality above. Anyway, that shows the potential. kinda spooky. (Granted the dream is not reality so it's not really logical when you think about it)In closing, I would recommend this book, with only minor reservations. I've simply tried to point out the contradictions.

In the first his holiness describes what he considers steps to enlightenment, viz. via equipping oneself with sound morality, practicing meditation, and then cultivating wisdom. These three practices are explored independently in separate subsequent chapters, followed by a succinct chapter on Tantra, and a final chapter that summarizes what had already been written. The style of exposition takes form of annotations on fundamental Buddhism constructs. Conspicuously lacking were technical details on how to meditate, how to practice Tantra (for e.g. how to breathe, what is good posture).What I enjoyed most were the brief anecdotes. Most of them had to do with how through observances over other practitioners his holiness gained insight.

Morality, wisdom, compassion - these are the building blocks for a meaningful life, and the keys to them are contained in the Dalai Lama's words within this book.

In &quot;How to Practice&quot; he provides us with useful techniques and disciplines to train the mind. In it he will not only cover the basics for beginners, he also has translation and commentary of The Heart Sutra for us. Covering Tantra, and steps designed to develop one's concentration of mind, it's hard to name anything The Dalai Lama did NOT put in this book. For those interested in Tibetan Buddhism who are looking for a &quot;step in the door&quot;, this book is probably your best bet.Just to give you an idea of what is in this work, I would like to share an excerpt from the Introduction with you:&quot;I believe that the practice of compassion and love-a genuine sense of brotherhood and sisterhood-is the universal religion. It does not matter whether you are Buddhist or Christian, Moslem or Hindu, or whether you practice religion at all. What matters is your feeling of oneness with humankind.&quot;This, for me, sums up what our practice is all about. Instead of focusing only on our differences, we should always strive toward finding common ground. To go further, this snip actually expresses how this book is really for anyone. The Dalai Lama doesn't make it a secret that he wrote this book for Buddhist practitioners, yet also points out it is really for anyone in pursuit of &quot;happiness.&quot;Truly, it's a good book. The further you read in, the more you get out. Please enjoy this book, it's a sure winner!"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"The Dalai Lama undeniably is a learned scholar with gifts of human compassion and critical thinking. This book is a good introduction to Buddhist thinking and the Dalai Lama's philosophies.I purchased this book looking for ways to improve my own happiness, better understand the person I wanted to be, and provide a frame of reference for some of the more difficult life decisions. In this respect, I found the book less pragmatic and more educational about the foundations and beliefs of Buddhism.Despite great discussion of the value of meditation and of subjects to meditate on, the section on the mechanics of meditation was very short. There were also many sections that I needed to reread because of the broad use of words found in spiritual practice but rarely in daily life (inherent existence, enlightenment, impermanence, obstructions to omniscience, afflictive emotions, etc.). It's definately a book that you get more out of by re-reading and slowly contemplating its elements.As I read it, there were lots of 'what if' situational questions that came out seemingly contrary to some of the jewels of wisdom. This book does not provide those kinds of practical answers. It does, however, provide more insights into Buddhist beliefs of reincarnation and philosophies regarding how life is defined by suffering.Of the Dalai Lama's titles, I think &quot;The Art of Happiness&quot; is a more pragmatic read, while &quot;How to Practice&quot; spoon feeds you less and challenges your spiritual beliefs more."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Buy and read this book, if you haven't already.I separate this book into two parts - the first half and the second half. (see what I did there?)The first half is practical, universally applicable perspectives on happiness that none of us should live without. If you've lost your happiness, read this book (the first half, at least). It changed my life. After 12 years of Catholic school and an ideal family, I had strong faith, but not a practical understanding of how that faith related to personal happiness. It seemed that there was a relation for some, but I never got it. This book helped me understand my own role in my personal happiness and helped me appreciate the world around me more dearly. This is one of the most highly recommended books when I encounter someone who's run into some personal distress in life, as it really helps you accept suffering and directs you to change your attitude to be one that generates peace and happiness for yourself and the world around you.The second half of the book deals more with the techniques of practicing meditation. If you've got the ability, inclination or time for that, more power to you and this book should provide some rudimentary explanations of how to meditate and some themes to consider when you are.If you've never read the Dalai Lama, this is a great place to start. Not too long, not too deep ... just right and should provide benefit to any reader, of any age or faith."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"The book, although seemingly basic at first glance, is actually quite deep. This book is one of the Dalai Lama's more famous writings, and he gives persons of any religion, not just Buddhism, some useful ideas to, as the books says \\"a meaningful life.\\" The Dalai Lama incorporates some key Buddhist ideas and makes them more accessible for the public. Previously, Buddhist doctrines were complex and hard to make out but this book simplifies the texts well. From a Buddhist view, the book offers the reader a variety of teachings from renowned Buddhist leaders, and incorporates them in Tibetan Buddhism. But you can see from the Catholic reviewer that the book is not only helpful to the Buddhist layperson, but to anyone who wants to know more about the core beliefs of Buddhism. Some of the practices mentioned in the book are pretty deep, but any average person can gain some basic understanding of them. Occasionally, when reading some of the text I had to read the same thing again to get meaning out of it. That is not to say the Dalai Lama is a bad author, but some of the information in the book takes a higher level of understanding Buddhist teachings to grasp. In a way, this book can give a clueless practitioner an almost monk-like understanding of the basics. While other books might contain information in specific topics about Buddhism, this one is more or less an introduction. These are some of the book's stronger points but there were a few things that I wanted to see a little more of. For one, although the meditation section of the book was good, there could have been a little more on the act of meditation. The Dalai Lama probably wants the reader to buy his other book \\"Stages of Meditation\\", and it is apparent by the amount detailed on meditation. Next, although he detailed a little bit about some of the underlying themes of Buddhism, such as wisdom and compassion, I thought he could have made these things a little more clear by adding more practices for the reader. Again, I guess he wanted people to buy his other books. I just thought it could have been longer. That was disappointing, but at least he is using the money for greater causes, after all we are talking about a monk and not Donald Trump here. Overall I really enjoyed \\"How to Practice\\" by the Dalai Lama and I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone. Don't feel left out because your believes differentiate from Buddhist doctrine, this book will give you some ways to gain better compassion, wisdom, and meditation. Also, the Four Noble truths, Ten Nonvirtues, and the Eightfold Path are explained to some degree, but of course there are countless things to say about them. The Dalai Lama has made the Middle Way accessible for everyone; hopefully we can all have better understanding of the suffering that continues in our world."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I am simpithetic to the previous two readers.

The book give you fully detailed explainations on each step of the path. At the end of every section is a Summary of Daily Practice which simplifies the section so you don't fall behind or get lost.The book also explains how to use the religion in daily life and how to treat Buddhism properly.

We first have to accept each other mentally, not with the hand shake or &quot;How are you?&quot;.

The Dalai Lama is definitely a world class teacher and spiritual leader, I can imagine the change this person could make if everyone read this book, we would be at peace with each other, true mental peace. Realizing that we are clothed in a material world but trully live in a mental universe.A surprising unprejudiced book written by a western personality that I also found very enlightening, and must recommend is SB 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox"},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book is an excellent place to start on your path to enlightenment. It would be really hard to write an entire book comprising of every aspect of Buddhism and H.H. Dalai Lama did not intend to write a comprehensive book upon writing this. I usually look for more comprehensive guides when purchasing books on subjects new/unfamiliar to me, but this book was a great place to start in understanding the mindset of a peaceful and happy Tibetan Buddhist. He shows the way by example in his writing as his joy flows from page to page in clear and easy to understand writing. I highly advise purchasing, 'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Buddhism\\", as well as this book to anyone unfamiliar with Buddhism, as, \\"The Complete ....\\", describes the different Buddhist sects and ways. \\"How To Practice,\\" can however be read on its own as well which is what I did prior to dipping into deeper fundamentals of Buddhism.The best aspect of this book is that the way in which it was written applies to anyone, (I.E.- Christians, Etc). H.H. Dalai Lama writes and even tells readers of different faiths how particular teaching can be applied in their faiths and lives as well."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I'm a newcomer to Buddhism, particularly the Tibetan kind, and this book is a terrific point of entry. In prose that is wonderfully clear, the Dalai Lama explains the fundamentals in theory and practice. Everything is concise, logical, and practical. Not everything is easy--particularly the part about having compassion for one's enemies--but it all makes complete sense. You also get a sense of the Dalai Lama's enormous warmth and wisdom, which inform every sentence. It's brief, clear, persuasive, user-friendly and useful."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"A very helpful and thought provoking book. A pleasant read that leaves you wanting to learn more. Not overly term-laden. Just enough to help educate you as to the terminorlogy of Buddhism, without being incomprehensible. The wisdom and goodness of the Dalai Lama comes through in every chapter. I feel as if this book is a good starting point for embracing the Buddhist way."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"An all around good read for anyone looking for some self introspect or not committed to any one particular religion."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"The Dalai Lama explains living a meaningful life through meditation and reflection in a very procedural and objective way. Although he's the leader of a powerful religious movement, he doesn't get bogged down with dogma and stresses the importance of tolerance and acceptance. His exercise to visualize the decision between compassion and selfishness is very powerful. He asks the reader to visualize yourself on one side as a person that has only the worst of your own qualities and to visualize a group of starving impoverished strangers on the other side and to decide which of the two sides you would rather help. He also stresses the need for compassion for both sides, which sums up his philosophy very nicely."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Great beginners guide to Buddhism for those who know nothing/a little about how to live the Buddhism life. Even for non-religious people, there are great ideas in here for everyone about increasing happiness, etc."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I found this book one day while feeling very lost and angry with life. I was desperately seeking some sort of direction. Upon finding this book I flipped through it and had a feeling it was something I should read. I then purchased it and sat down with a coffee in the bookstore and began to read, perhaps for an hour, and I read more I felt a calm sense of clarity. Since then I have been reading the book here and there over the last couple of weeks and have drawn from it what needs to be done to strive for the inner peace I try to have.I am grateful for having read this book and I think that others who experience those moments of being lost and angry at being so could truly benefit from this.

However, with this AUDIO BOOK, I think he has made a mistake (or his people have made one) in not hiring a professional reader to read the book. He uses his translator to read it, and this guy could put a room full of speed freaks to sleep! He has no expression, it sounds like he's TRYING to bore us to death!Other than that, the info is very good for the most part. The first half or so is a kind of introduction to Buddhism, but the last 2 discs or so get very technical, about the meaning of \\"emptiness\\" which is a very hard concept to understand, at least to understand its deeper meanings. The Dalai Lama does a pretty good job of presenting this info, but I think any non-Bhuddist will find it too deep and hard to understand. Even I, as an intermediate student, felt it could have been presented better.That said, you cannot go wrong in listening to this audio book, for it does have a lot of good information.However there are lots of better things to listen to if you want to learn about Buddhism. I would suggest Thich Nhat Hanh's \\"Creating True Peace\\" for example.This audio book could have been much better had they spent some money and hired a professional reader to read it, someone with some concept of how a book should be read aloud."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I like the Dalai Lama and his writings but some of this book was just a bit too complicated for me.

After I read it, I felt that I could start my life over with a blank canvas to paint my catholic beliefs on.I'm giving it 4 stars because I found the book to be a little redundant when it started talking about the inherent existance... at one point I even said aloud \\"OK, OK, I got it! move on!\\", but I guess there's people that need for it to be explained thoroughly."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"I got this book hoping to have an introduction to the topic. I am happy with it as this book is very easy to read and understand. I am definitely keeping this book for reference. I have already gone back and re-read some of the information."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"This book's unimposing lightweight appearance belies its thick conceptual content. A little over 200 pages, it delivers a brain full of Buddhism. Those unfamiliar with the Tibetan flavor of the life philosophy initiated by Siddhartha Gautama, or Shakyamuni, or Buddha, will close the back cover with a clear high-level understanding of this ancient practice. Though it contains some difficult sections, particularly the later chapters, nothing remains insurmountable for the average reader. But there's more. \\"How To Practice,\\" as the title suggests, contains more than mere theory. Throughout, the fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet, in translation from Tibetan, delineates physical and mental exercises that anyone can apply to their own lives. \\"It does not matter whether you are Buddhist or Christian, Moslem or Hindu, or whether you practice religion at all,\\" he writes in the introduction. \\"What matters is your feeling of oneness with humankind.\\" The book attempts just that, to train people towards nurturing this feeling of oneness and compassion with existence, regardless of disposition or background. Avoidance of suffering and increasing of happiness is the intended outcome.The book's three main sections follow the major steps of practice: Morality, Concentrated Meditation, and Wisdom. Morality involves putting the suffering of others above one's own desires. Also called \\"Selfish Wisdom,\\" this perspective helps alleviate one's own suffering while alleviating the pains of others. But the focus remains on others. However, what goes around comes around, because if everyone perceives the world this way, then everyone's suffering, including one's own, receives proper attention. Selfish and wise. Adjusting one's life to a moral framework also prepares the practicer for concentrated meditation. This helps focus and sharpen the mind to achieve \\"calm abiding.\\" In this section, the Dalai Lama discusses his own meditation practices and gives instruction in technique. Lastly, Wisdom comes from comprehending the \\"emptiness\\" of all phenomenon. Through this wisdom we come to realize that things do not have inherent existence, thus everything arises out of dependencies. Phenomenon become known as \\"dependent-arisings.\\" Dependency and \\"emptiness\\" go hand in hand. Of all the book's sections, \\"Practicing Wisdom\\" remains the most difficult to grasp. It may require multiple readings or brain yoga. The book concludes with a short section on Tantra, including a discussion of its sensual dimension, and an \\"Overview to the Path of Enlightenment,\\" which summarizes the book's major points. Along the way, The Dalai Lama relates the story of the Buddha, the four noble truths, the ten nonvirtues, karma, rebirth, stories from his own life, and much that defies summary.Overall, \\"How to Practice\\" attempts to rise above theory and demonstrate how people can apply the teachings of The Buddha to their lives. You can live this stuff. Not only that, the Dalai Lama emphasizes that one does not need to take on the full ascetic life of a Buddhist monk to benefit from these ideas. He writes, \\"Please implement whatever in these pages appears to be helpful. If you follow another religion, please adopt whatever might assist you. If you do not think it would be helpful, just leave it alone.\\" How much suffering could be alleviated in the world if we followed this simple advice: \\"just leave it alone.\\" Loads, perhaps. Regardless, many readers will doubtless find something useful in the Dalai Lama's crystalline text. Some degree of enlightenment awaits anyone who explores this deceptively small book."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Just like the title, \\"How to Practice\\" is a gift to humankind to illuminate the right way to act. The goal of being human is to realize the potential within, which is a permanent state of happiness and peace. To achieve this, the beginner cultivates kindness and harmony for all beings.The Dalai Lama also describes the methods for training and controlling the mind. There is also a brief description of \\"The Middle Way\\", which is the way of renunciation, the real way to escape the Wheel of Samsara or suffering. It is the way to liberation. The Middle Way is not possible without practicing \\"Deity Yoga\\", which is mentioned towards the end of the book. \\"Diety Yoga\\" or the highest form of tantra, is not for everyone, as the practice is exceeding difficult and demanding on the practitioner.For those who are interested, the Middle Way, including the highest form of tantra is described in detail in Samael Aun Weor's books...."},{"Title":"How to Practice : The Way to a Meaningful Life","review":"Be happy, and how is a good question.

Unlike some other books that are said to be by the Dalai Lama, this one is directly by the Dalai Lama - just translated and helped by a professional. I can feel the encouragement and compassion from the Dalai Lama himself. There is no middle man, no scientist, or psychologist breaking down or analyzing his teachings. This is directly from him, with little to no errors. I learned much from his teaching that absorbing the hatred - the negative emotions within me and others - can help my karma. I learned that compassion towards my family, friends and enemy will help my karma. I trust the Dalai Lama. This is advanced, yet simple to understand. He teaches highly of compassion. I would recommend reading this book and also the \\"Dhammapada,\\" translated by Eknath Easwaran, because it is simple and easy to understand and there are so many positive teachings to learn. The \\"Dhammapada\\" is full of verses by the Buddha himself, with simple explanations to dharma, creating good karma, and focusing on meditating in order to overcome the mind's flaws such as lust, greed, envy, anger, and other mistaken emotions.

The enchanting Mitra, the embodiment of everlasting love and light, enlightens a musical craving for love within man. Professor Manoucher Parvin has written a palatable, seductive tale that definitely leaves the reader begging for more. The wisdom of Hafiz and Rumi speaks directly to the heart of philosophy, social theory, and education; it demonstrates a bridge of understanding between the relationship of man to himself (Professor Pirooz) as well as the one between two cultures which are in desperate need of mutual empathy.EpilogueAscendance: The Possibility of You and MeThere is no illuminating nova.There is no cleansing rainstorm.There is no music lifting the spirit.There is no prayer seducing a miracle.There is only the possibility of me understanding you.There is only the possibility of you understanding me.There is only the possibility of one soul caressing another.There is only dardedel.\\"DARDEDEL\\"-Epilogue"},{"Title":"Dardedel: Rumi, Hafez & Love in New York","review":"By reincarnating two legendary Persian poets Rumi andHafez in New York Dardedel connects East and West,Past and Present andintegrates science, art and spirituality in a brilliant fashion.

Dardedel \\"unchains us from the burdens of our isolation and loneliness. By uniting our soul with another soul our deepest thoughts and feelings are set free without the shame of judgment or the fear of betrayal\\". I was unprepared for what a true Dardedel really feels like. But I felt a thirst to Dardedel with someone for the first time in life! How wonderful!This loving, inspired work of art is a \\"magical mystery tour\\". It is lyrical, musical, and profoundly reverent and relevant. It is a testimony of our hunger for knowing, understanding, loving, living insightful and mindful lives. This connection, this dardedel, among the novel's characters, and between author and reader, is a communion - the sacred sharing of private, important, sincere thoughts and feelings. The extraordinary experience unfolds line after line, page after page - as consciousness and conscience heightens!The \`magic' is Parvin's incredible imagination and creativity! Pirooz, the protagonist, a professor intent on suicide, meets the cacti-reincarnations of the great Persian Sufi poet-philosophers Rumi and Hafez in the heart of the Sonora desert in Arizona. Temporarily dissuaded from suicide by Rumi and Hafez, Pirooz returns to the equally inhospitable desert of New York City crowded with equally thorny people! During the return flight home, he dreams of God complaining about His own creation, mankind, as He dardedels with Pirooz. Pirooz's candid response is to ask God why everything God creates turns out to be a lemon. God's answer is best read for yourself.Hafez appears in New York City as a taxi driver to both learn about modernity and to make sure Pirooz does not commit suicide. He is followed by Rumi, whose mission is to look after Hafez and Pirooz. Rumi is also curious about modernity, but critical of it.In the interim, the sparkling Mitra falls in love with Hafez, and he with her. She carries a covenant of past and future unknown even to her. The \`poem of poems', a mythical bird, is a brilliant portrayal of the \`mysteries' that abound when art and science converge and reveal, in their union, their true spirit - not only in the book but also in life.Lastly is the hopeful poignancy when Pirooz writes \\"I am a Sufi atom, listen to my dardedel ... love has many hearts, truth many ears, beauty many eyes, and the human fate is not beyond the human reach\\".

Five years of blogging about music and literature have taught me that the easiest thing to do with a blog is offend someone with your opinion.The stand out figure in my recent audit of 18th century British literature was Frances Burney. She is an appealing Author/Artist for several reasons:1. EARLY WOMAN AUTHOR.2. Daughter of well know 18th century musician/author Charles Burney.3. HAD PLENTY OF HITS: Evelina, Cecilia, Camilla.Burney published Evelina, her first book, in 1778- she was 26. It was a hit, though the combination of Burney's status as a single woman and the nascent state of the development of the market for literature combined to deprive her of financial rewards that would have equaled her critical success.Evelina was published anonymously, but that only lasted until the critics made their positive statements and the initial press of 2500 copies sold out. An important biographical fact of Frances Burney's life was her relationships with her \\"Daddies\\"(her words, not mine)- her actual father Charles Burney- court musician and author of the path breaking History of Music- and her \\"Uncle\\"- Samuel Crisp. It is Crisp whom Burney most often referred to as \\"Daddy\\" in her correspondence. Burney and Crisp played a crucial role in her career- a role best illustrated after the success of Evelina, when Frances decided to write a play.The play (never produced) was called The Witlings, and it was essentially a satire on modern life. Doody wrote this book before Seinfeld aired, but the over all tenor of the play would have to be described as Seinfeldian since it is essentially a \\"play about nothing.\\"Even after reading an entire chapter on the subject, it's still unclear to me why Crisp and Burney pere conspired to suppress The Witlings. The common take on this circumstances is that Burney/Crisp thought it was too \\"unladylike\\" for Frances to be writing plays, but if that was the case, they didn't put it like that. Rather they told her that the play was terrible, and too imitative of antecedent plays, and that she would, essentially, ruin her literary reputation as a result of its performance.By the time The Witlings had been suppressed it was 1781, and she was pressured to write a follow up- a book which became Cecilia. Burney wrote Cecilia for an existing Audience, one that anticipated the release. Cecilia was published in summer of 1782- either 30 or close to it- was the \\"age of spinster\\" in late 18th century London.In December of 1782, Burney met Owen Cambridge, a minister from a good family. They spent the next couple years in a halting court ship that resulted in no proposal. OUCH. After the Cambridge fiasco, Burney secured a job- via her father- as a lady in waiting to the Queen of England. She took her position in July of 1786- having wasted a full four years with Owen Cambridge. She was not excited to take the gig- it involved being \\"on call\\" day and night, and spending many an hour standing around and doing nothing at all.Ironically, it was her journals during this period of servitude that proved to be Burney's most enduring work before her late 20th century revival at the hands of feminist inspired literary scholars. She had a front seat to what we now of as \\"THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE\\"- she was right there, and taking notes the whole time. She managed to escape the clutches of the Queen, essentially by feigning severe illness, and was released with a 100 guinea a year life pension in 1791.She was now 39, unmarried, childless. So what does she do? She goes out and lands an exiled French military man and has a kid. Boom. Then to secure her lively hood she writes Camilia: Also a hit. BOOM. Eventually she ends up in France with her husband and her child, and never writes another hit, but lives up until 1840. She was... 88? When she died.There must be some interest in Burney- since Cambridge University just republished this book. I find Burney interesting because of her unique perspective on 18th century social practices and her status as an early successful Author/Artist. What's interesting is she was simultaneously an outsider (a young woman) and an insider (daughter of Charles Burney, court musician.)"},{"Title":"This Haunted Isle the Ghosts and Legends O","review":"I wish that we'd owned a copy of \\"This Haunted Isle\\" when we toured Great Britain. It would have been either the high-point or low-point of our trip if we'd actually caught sight of a long-departed Lord or Lady. It bothers me to realize that we visited the Tower of London without a clue as to what we really might have seen.However, your trip doesn't need to be spoiled by that same oversight, because Peter Underwood, President of the Ghost Club has published a paranormal tour guide to the haunted historic buildings of Great Britain. His book was first published back in 1984, but I don't imagine that it has gone out-of-date. What do the Grey Ladies, Phantom Hounds, and assorted ghostly prisoners in their dungeons care about the passage of time? According to the author, some of them have been haunting the same spot for several hundred years.Of course, the phantoms may have been exorcised if they frightened too many tourists, so you are still advised to call in advance of your visit. The author even warns potential visitors, \\"it is not suggested that all these places [in his book] are still haunted...\\"\\"This Haunted Isle\\" is arranged alphabetically, starting with Abbey House, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, and ending with Woburn Abbey, Woburn, Bedfordshire. Many of the stories begin as follows: \\"At X we were met by the Duke and Duchess...and in a delightfully informal way they told us of the many unexplained happenings at beautiful and dignified X...\\" The Ghost Society's visits to haunted sites are as much social outings as they are investigations of paranormal phenomenon.Nevertheless, a reading of this book will send many delightful frissons down the spine with its evocative black-and-white photos and stories of violent deaths and equally violent hauntings.If you enjoyed the stories in \\"This Haunted Isle,\\" author Marc Anderson has also published a ghostly quartet of books on the same subject: \\"Haunted Castles;\\" \\"Haunted Inns;\\" \\"Haunted Churches & Abbeys of Britain;\\" and \\"Phantom Britain.\\" I have a slight preference for Marc Anderson over Peter Underwood because of the color he adds to his narratives. Underwood, alas believes that ghosts \\"are no longer creatures of the darkness that strike terror into the hearts of those who see them; rather they are gentle shades who return for a variety of reasons...Ghosts have become respectable.\\"Hah! Phooey! Respectable, indeed!"},{"Title":"King Solomon's Mines","review":"I grew up on the movie so it was quit a shocker to read the book. As stated in the beginning there are no petticoated women in this book. It is a men's adventure written by a man for men. You can not miss the hand of H. Rider Haggard as he has a unique sense of humor that pops up at the strangest times. He may be a little verbose but every word has a use. And as with written stories this one is much more intricate than the movie adaptations. You will find many assumptions of the time such as any complex construction must have been built by white people and natives on their own may turn savage.The story is told first person by Allan Quartermain. Nevil is off to make his fortune by finding King Solomon's lost diamond mines. Allan sends him a 300 year old map to help. This is the last anyone heard from Nevil. Turns out that Nevil is really the estranged brother of Henry Curtis. Sir Henry Curtis now wants to make amends and he with his friend Captain John Good, bribe Allan Quartermain to take them across an endless desert and trough impassible mountains to an adventure that will hold you to the very end. Along with them is their self imposed helper Umbopa who carries a secret of his own.If you get a chance also hear the recording, an added plus is narration by John Richmond; He brings the characters to life and adds to the mystique that this story has been passed down.If you cannot find a copy of the John Richmond, recording you can use the Kindle 2 text-to speak. It is not as smooth but it is functional.King Solomon's Mines Starring: Deborah Kerr, Stewart Granger"},{"Title":"Forecasting prices","review":"This seemingly arcane material is one of the few consistently useful books on financial astrology for the purpose of forecasting market trends and prices. Butaney was interesting because he was a Hindu Vedic astrologer who found better results using the Western Tropical Zodiac. The predictions currently in action, with Jupiter and Uranus in Pisces bringing back new highs in the stock market is fascinating, as many of the pundits including Elliot Wave theorists predicted another crash. Out of the thousands of dollars I've spent on financial astrology and planetary trading books, this is the one that's most useful. Do you have to be an astrologer to use it? Not really as no interpretations needed.

What a fabulous story! Thoroughly enjoyed this novel, from start to finish! Highly recommend! :-)"},{"Title":"Plays (The Penguin classics, L96)","review":"I picked several selections from this book to read including \\"Three Sisters,\\" \\"The Seagull\\" and \\"The Bear.\\" While I enjoyed all three pieces, I found \\"The Bear\\" the most immediately gratifying. The story, a one act jest, centers on three characters, a young widow, her servant and a landowner acquaintance. While the widow and the landowner are at odds at the beginning of the act, attacks soon give way to attraction and the two find themselves in love. The comedy builds as the two challenge one another back and forth over money that the widow's husband owes the landowner. When it seems that the play will end in a duel, the landowner finds he has a change of heart: \\"That's a woman for you! That's the kind I appreciate! A real woman! Not one of those soft weak females, but a creature of fire, gunpowder, fireworks! I'm almost sorry I have to kill her!\\" (413). As he proclaims his love she too realizes that she does not so much want to kill this man as she wants to kiss him. Their comedy comes from their strong characters and forceful stubbornness.Wonderfully developed characters and relationships are also present in \\"Three Sisters\\" and \\"The Seagull.\\" The three Prozorov sisters deal with the pull of love versus responsibility. In \\"The Seagull\\" Nina, Masha, and Trepliov especially, look for what they want in life and what they will settle for. Each play closely considers each character's place in life, their pasts, their futures, their range of emotions. This is what also makes it difficult to distinguish which of these plays is the comedy and which is the drama. While \\"The Seagull\\" is formally the comedy of the two, it ends in suicide. \\"Three Sisters,\\" as the drama, is equally bleak in parts but does end on a hopeful note when Irena says, \\"The band is playing so cheerfully and joyfully-maybe, if we wait a little longer, we shall find out why we live, why we suffer\\" (327-328). While suffering is not so happy a subject the play's characters feel there is reason to keep going rather than to end their lives. A main theme in many of Chekhov's works is suffering. In all three plays the characters undergo tribulations usually related to death or finances. The beauty in these plays however, can be found in the bright moments between the grave truths of life. Though this version is translated from Russian, there are certain rhetorical characteristics of Chehkov's that have translated well. The beauty Chehkov and his characters see is very often in images of country life in Russia created by the author, the birds in flight, a fishing trip. Chekhov also uses this imagery mechanism to portray the darker side of life, alcoholism, depression. However, this is also important when appreciating his plays. Each character often feels very strongly about their surroundings and with this imagery the reader has a deeper connection to the characters through the understanding of their locations.While these plays may be too depressing for some I highly recommend them to realist readers. The stories are excellent; they are deep and yet not bogged down by lengthy analysis. The characters are believable and entertaining to follow. There is a balance between dark and light that Chekhov creates which displays his characters in a way true to life."},{"Title":"Waldorf Education: A Family Guide","review":"I can still remember my delight upon unwrapping the package containing &quot;Waldorf Education: A Family Guide&quot; edited by Pamela Fenner and Karen Rivers. It's a beautiful book, filled with wonderful illustrations, and a wealth of helpful text. In this day, when so many books are typeset but never designed, it's refreshing to encounter a book whose visual appearance and form is itself a statement about the need for rhythm and reverence in our lives.&quot;Waldorf Education: A Family Guide&quot; has its origins as a parent handbook for the Marin Waldorf School. It is a compendium of articles on the history and practice of Waldorf education, content of the curriculum, meaning of the festivals, ways to complement the Waldorf school experience at home, understanding of the temperaments, and other topics that should interest current or prospective parents.While this format doesn't permit in-depth consideration of any of these topics, this is more than compensated by the wealth of material on the temperaments, multi-culturalism, rhythm and balance, and the role of spirit and religion.Some of the articles deserve particular mention. Henry Barnes' introduction to Waldorf education (&quot;Learning That Grows with the Learner&quot;) is an excellent short summary of how Steiner's observations and theory find expression in the Waldorf School, and John Davy's biographical sketch of Rudolf Steiner will help any newcomer understand how one man could be the source of so much wonderful creative ferment.Ren&eacute; Querido's essay on &quot;The Role of Temperament in Understanding the Child&quot; provides vivid examples of how an understanding of temperament can help parents as well as teachers respond to our child's needs:'One Friday [during watercolor painting] there was an accident, and a huge bucket of water got kicked over. What did the melancholics do? They got up and stood in it. The sanguines were immediately standing on their chairs and shouting, 'Ooh -- what is that?' The cholerics rushed out after mops and buckets. What did the phlegmatics do? You may not believe it, but they sat in their chairs and lifted their legs above the water. I got the best lesson in my life.'The book is filled with wonderful gems -- and an excellent bibliography and directory of Anthroposophical resources that will help the eager reader go further. For me, this appendix alone was worth the price of the book -- and will certainly keep me engaged for years to come.In addition to listing books and lectures about Waldorf education by Rudolf Steiner, and other books on Anthroposophy, education, parenting, festivals, music, and crafts there is a comprehensive list of Waldorf teacher training programs, Anthroposophical Society publications and addresses, and references to endeavors working with biodynamic agriculture (&quot;healing the earth&quot;, curative work (&quot;soul care for those in need&quot;), medical practice (&quot;treating patients, not symptoms&quot;), health and hygiene (&quot;products for sound living&quot;), eurythmy, speech and drama, music, painting, architecture, sculpture, finance and consultancy, religious renewal -- all from an Anthroposophical perspective.This book belongs on the bedside table of any parents who treasure the childhood of their young children, and of anybody else seeking a vivid introduction to Waldorf Education. It also should be in our public libraries, in the waiting rooms of our local pediatricians, on the book tables at seasonal fairs, and in any other places where prospective Waldorf parents might have a chance to leaf through this delightful volume."},{"Title":"Waldorf Education: A Family Guide","review":"It's a very good book to start with if you want to know what Waldorf education is all about.It's also very inspiring so you can get good ideas about things to do with your kids.I like that chapters are written by different authors so that you get a broader picture.I'm very interested in Waldorf education for my kids now!"},{"Title":"Waldorf Education: A Family Guide","review":"I thought this book was a great intro to homeschooling Waldorf style.

I had one before for many years but sadly it got lost so I needed to buy another one.I give it my full recommendation."},{"Title":"Waldorf Education: A Family Guide","review":"I am trying to seperate my opinion of the methods described in the book from the book itself. That is not as easy as it sounds!I look forward to a time when I can write a more in depth review but for now I felt it was important to advise potential buyers to look into the Waldorf educational methods and more importantly their philisopical foundations before pursuing more information or purchasing books on the subject.I recommend even a brief web search on Rudolf Steiner, the Waldorf founder, on Theosophists, the movement from which Steiner emerged, and into Steiner's very own movement/philosophy, Anthroposophy.If the ideas put forth in articles concerning these three topics are compatible with your own ideas then I would recommend pursuing information concerning the Waldorf educational methods. This book will be helpful in that search.I received this book at about the same time as a number of other books on edcation, homeschooling, home education and various popular educational methods. We are in the process of learning as it is time to begin our child's education and we must decide whether to teach him exclusively at home or send him to school or some combination. We must also decide by what methods we will teach him or want him to be taught. After a quick look through I concluded that Waldorf methods had some great ideas from which he would benifit but that should a school be our choice I would choose a Waldorf school only with extreme caution. How could I tell without an actual reading? Even the most cursory examination of the various essays in this book told me that this educational method was not based on tradtional Christian beliefs (although many similar values) and seemed libral and New Age. It seemed like a wishy washy version of Christianity.I have come to discover that the origiinal was not based on Christianity at all. Now that I have given a more thorough reading I discover that my impression was based on exact fact! The founder was part of the original New Age philosophy and founded his own philosophy that is absolutely New Age. It is accepting of Christianity but is not Christianity.Now this review is not meant to critize that philosophy or dispute its tenets. I am simply letting potential buyers understand the foundations on which this educational system was developed and if they are agreeable to the potential buyer then I say again that this will be a fine book. Well writen, easy and pleasant to read.I will pull certain ideas and methods from the Waldrof school of thought and will find this book useful in describing what they look like in practice and the idea behind them. I even agree with many of the ideas. I already have another Waldorf based book which I will read and from which I am sure to learn more that I will later use. However, I am finding that much of what I like about Waldorf can be found in other methods of edcation with which I am more comfortable with their foundational philosophy.So, when I seperate my opinion of the book from the foundational philosophy the book rates well and I will use some of what I read as inspiration in educating our son.Review addition, 3/8/09:The more I read the more alarmed I become at the Waldorf methods as typically implimented in schools. Now I know that the root of my vague uneasiness of the content of this book upon initial browsing was spot on. I now am in full disagreement with its foundations and with a detailed reading and further research can confirm that this \\"teaching method\\" is foundationally and philosophically opposed to the Christain spirtual foundation that we are providing for our son.I had initially chalked up my first impressions to the heavy emphasis on the arts and the fact that the book came across with a strong \\"granola\\" Berkley feel. While we are into gardening, nature, hiking, organic foods, etc., the granola feel is not us. I now realize that what I had chalked up to artsy, CA or NYC libralism (sterotype I know but trying to conveythe idea, as CA was also the birth place of the Reagan Revolution) was actually true New Age philosophy that informs the educational materials, subject choices and academic \\"standards\\".While the emphasis arts (music, art, literature, dance), classical history, world history and geography, nature studies, natural play materials, organic foods, practical skills (although the practicality of some these skills is debatable) and encouraging a tv free, creative childhood are all things to be admired in the Waldorf program they are aspects shared by other programs. One can agree with and expose one's children to these subjects/methods and have them as part of their education/childrhood without sending them to a Waldorf school and exposing them to New Age philosophy and occult teachings.If you are in agreement with New Age philosophy, if you would prefer your child be grounded in a European Curlture vs. American Culture, if academic excellence is not your priority"},{"Title":"American Indians (Ethno-geographic reader)","review":"This is a great reference book.

Despite success, Arnelle carries the burden of a heinous secret, perpetrated against her love interest, Winston Carter, III. Several years prior to their chance meeting in Philadelphia, where Arnelle took up residence, she reluctantly became part of a scheme that would victimize Winston. When Winston learns of the deception-to say the least-will his growing love for her all but vaporize?Although interesting, the editing in general felt rushed. Issues such as the scenario of Winston, a private sector attorney practicing law in Philadelphia, somehow is prosecuting a criminal case in California detracts from this story's credibility. Nothing I read in fiction has to be true to life, just convince me that it is possible. Several things like, what caused a three-year lapse in the continuation of the trial kept my mind wondering as well. Other than the occasional awkward phrasing and end of sentence preposition, I could have enjoyed the read immensely, because Ms. Lee does well in making emotion felt, like when the adults interact with the children...that's when Winston's charm jumps off the page.Marian E.APOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"What Goes Around Comes Around","review":"I think ths book was a bomb.

But to Arnelle's dismay, Winston doesn't remember her. At first, she believes it is a game because of what went down between them, but she soon realizes that he really doesn't remember her or anything that happened.Because of their friendship with Venice and Craig, characters from the author's previous works, Arnelle and Winston are often in each other's company, although they can't stand each other at first. But, as time progresses, the animosity turns into attraction, and the couple begins to enjoy spending time together. Although the relationship is going strong, Arnelle's secrets haunt her daily. Will she tell all before Winston's memory comes back of that fateful night? How will he react once he finds out what really happened and the other secret she has been harboring for years?While I did enjoy this novel, it read pretty much the same as Lee's previous works.

You got to know him a little more in \\"Been There, Done That\\" and you begin to respect him. Now in his own story, you will love him!This is the story of Winston Carter III and Arnelle Lapahie.

Continue to bring us the love! Relationship love, and love of family!Being that I LOVE the two previous books, I was excited when this one hit the shelves. I read it then and I just finished reading it for the second time, earlier this week. Now my mind will be nice and ready for the sequel \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\"!

ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"What Goes Around Comes Around","review":"Having read Ms. Lee's first two novels, I had hopes that this book would be more mature in writing style than the others, but nothing has changed. This book, and its other prequels, belong in a teeny-bopper's book club instead of being marketed to a mature audience. As I read, I could easily predict the story: boy meets girl/boy falls for girl/boy loses girl/boy forgives girl/boy and girl live happily ever after. Typical fairytale. No new ideas here. Just something to read if you have nothing else to do, or you are not in the mood for a book that challenges your imagination."},{"Title":"What Goes Around Comes Around","review":"Ms.Lee is a new upcoming AA author and she had done a good job of keeping the sequels coming.

Highly Recommend."},{"Title":"The Symphony of Scripture","review":"If you want a great overview of the whole of scripture and how it all fits together as one story then get this book. It is awesome. What helps the most is at the end of each chapter you are challenged to prepare a Bible study on a certain texts and ideas conveyed in the chapter. Mark gives a big overview of all the groups of books - sometimes he doesnt go into each book in great detail but just how it fits into the overall story. (minor prophets etc) But this has forced me to read a lot more of the Bible to understand the conclusions he talks about. I thought I knew the bible well but this has helped me to understand things a lot better.Its up there with the likes of Graeme Goldsworthy's \\"According to the plan\\" and Gordon Fee & Douglas Stuarts \\"How to read the Bible for all its worth.\\""},{"Title":"The Symphony of Scripture","review":"\\"The Symphony of scripture: Making sense of the Bible's many themes\\" by Mark Strom (1990) was required reading for a CCEF biblical counseling class I am taking, this one focused on biblical interpretation. It had to be read before the class begins, so I tackled it over this Christmas break. The author provides a survey overview of the Bible, looking for the university in diversity. It is certainly Christocentric in its focus, a major strength of the book. The author cautions against our tendency to interpret details without considering the overall theme of scripture. As Christians, I believe we have the tendency to do this with first things and last things. We try to make sense of the many details grounded in Genesis and Revelation, without realizing the centrality of Christ. For example, Strom rightly points out the central theme of Revelation is not whether people will be literally marked with a 666, or whether it is a literal 1000 years, but that Christ will win and will be restored in the end. Believers are called to persevere, knowing that Jesus has accomplished all, and that God is sovereign. That is the point of Revelation. When we move from that, we end up with things like Left Behind or even worse, Harold Camping.I admit this book was a hard slog for me. The print was hard on the eyes and Strom was more academic than I like. He does know his stuff, however."},{"Title":"The Symphony of Scripture","review":"\\"The Symphony of Scripture\\" really surprised me. It's a lesser known title in the pool of Biblical Theology introductions but I must say that I am impressed. Strom's theology is God honoring, Christ exalting, Gospel centered and balanced.I found the structure and layout of the book to be the most simple and helpful compared to other intro's. Each section begins with a summary of the relevant portion of scripture to be covered, ends with discussion questions and then challenges with outlines for assignments like creating bible studies for small groups from all you've learned.Strom's grasp of the Bible's storyline and clarity of writing make this work a fun and interesting read. One thing I've found hard to do when teaching biblical theology is applying it to the lives of Christians. It's very easy to be brought to worship through this discipline, but how do you bring it to bear on hearts of those being taught resulting in a changed life? Here is where I think Strom really excells. He is gospel balanced, which means he is biblical and can distinguish between preferences and scripture mandates. His firm grasp of the difference between law and gospel is refreshing. His handle on the Pauline epistles is enlightening. Get this book and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Symphony of Scripture","review":"I was told about this book by a very good friend of mine.

It follows Masklin, who leads the remnants of his nome tribe in from the Outside, and Masklin ends up in a leadership role when the store is scheduled for demolition. It's up to him to mastermind a plan which will move all the gnomes from the store into the great Outside, though most nomes don't believe in silly fables like 'Night', 'Sun', and 'Rain'.It's written with Pratchett's typical wit, and should be considered a YA book. Plus, there's The Thing (no spoilers here). Enjoyable for all ages."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Now it has taken long enough. Masklin, a four-inch-tall nome, has enough of dragging big rats and other garbage to his home. Not that he doesn't like doing these chores. It's just that he's the only one left performing them. Apart from Grimma, a young female nome, and a few older folks all others have died or disappeared. It's time to go on a quest for other tribes. But the big question is: how will they travel. Luckily they are living close by a truckers rest stop, so hitchhiking should not be a big problem. Then Masklin discovers that there are other worlds out there...Terry Pratchett, mostly known for his Discworld series, does not always write stories about flat worlds. Sometimes he diverts and creates some little treasures of humorous fairytales without linking them to his bestselling series. The Bromeliad Trilogy is one of those excellent, but lesser known stories. It all starts with Truckers, the first book of the trilogy. Again Pratchett shows how fluently he creates fantastic characters that will be remembered and sets scenes for some wonderful adventures. Although not as full of jokes as is typical for the Discworld series, the dosage of humor versus action is much more balanced. For me is was actually the first time that I needed to continue reading, not because of the jokes, but because of the action-packed narrative. I can't wait to start reading Diggers, the second book of this trilogy."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Truly a classic -- a must read for anyone studying young adult/ children's literature as well as parents who'll love the deeper philosophical edge ... and, of course, kids themselves. Have at it.(Dig into the whole series ...)Pratchett is one of the greats.-- Julianna Baggott (aka N.E. Bode) --www.juliannabaggott.comwww.theanybodies.com"},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"This is the first book in Terry Pratchett's Bromeliad Trilogy, and it gets the series started well. It is about a group of nomes who live in a department store--but they have lived there so long that they have forgotten there is a world outside. The only problem is that the store will be demolished in 21 days. It's up to a group of just 8 outside nomes to convince thousands of stubborn people to leave a place they think is the entire universe, then hijack a truck and leave. This book has a perfect blend of humor, mystery, and plot, but the in my opinion the greatest element is the characters. The seemingly emotionless yet somehow smug spaceship computer known only as the Thing provides a touch of science in a world whose inhabitants don't even know what the word \\"thousand\\" means. Dorcas del Icatessen, the mad scientist of the nomes, who has complete control over the store elevator system. Angalo de Haberdasheri, who is fanatic about the possibility of life outside the store and has a pet rat named Bobo, and finally Grannie Morkie, the annoyingly apocalyptic nome elder. The final scene, in which hundreds of nomes wielding levers, pullies, and wires manages to hijack a truck and drive it on a chaotic romp through the city, might be one of the cleverest and funniest scenes in the history of fiction. One of the greatest quotes: \\"Give me a big enough lever, and a firm enough place to stand, and I could move the Store.\\" The next two books in the trilogy are even greater, and do a good job of developing the already marvelous characters."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Pratchett is best known for his off-the-world Discworld yarns, but he also has produced a number of highly engaging, wryly funny, and thoroughly humane novels for younger readers. This one, the first of the \\"Bromeliad\\" trilogy, introduces the \\"nomes,\\" four-inch-high people (well, humanoids) who live on highway medians and under the floors of buildings. They live fast (ten years is a very advanced age for a nome) and humans strike them as slow and stupid. Masklin, in escaping danger in the back of a truck with the last remnants of his tribe, finds himself in the Store -- \\"Arnold Bros. (est. 1905)\\" -- where there are thousands of nomes. These are divided into contending tribes by store departments, live a good life in the Food Hall, and worship Arnold Bros. And then he becomes aware that the store is about to be demolished. The strength of the story is Masklin's struggle to convince everyone else of the danger when most of them don't even believe in the existence of Outside, and then to organize an exodus by stealing a truck and learning to operate it. (Think lots of long levers, pulleys, and bits of string.) But the nomes turn out not to be \\"little people\\" at all. The nomes' interpretation of the signs they see will give you thoughtful pause, as will their unthinking belief in a nome-centered God in the sky. Or on the top floor. Pratchett fans will enjoy this, regardless of their age."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"These books (Truckers, Diggers, and Wings) are a fun romp!

He has succeeded once more in creating a strange, little world, peopled with beings called Nomes. They are small but they face huge challenges. One of their biggest challenges is simply learning to work together to save themselves! Pratchett always shows his readers a range of human behavior, (from the best to the most ridiculous) using his unique blend of humor and gentle irony. This book will make you laugh, think, and believe in turning the impossible into possible!"},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Terry Pratchett's Bromeliad trilogy is a mix of childlike fantasy and offbeat SF. While the opening book, &quot;Truckers&quot; lags in places and takes quite some time to really get moving, it's imaginative and very funny. Certainly it's a good place to start off with Pratchett's fiction.Masklin and the other nomes are tiny people who scavenge on the streets, and now there are only a handful of them left. In an act of desperation, they climb into a lorry and ride to... The Store. Also known as Arnold Bros (est. 1905), where a complex civilization of nomes (about two thousand) live in semi-peace and prosperity. They either are dazzled by the idea of &quot;Outside,&quot; or insist that the whole world is in Arnold Bros (est. 1905).Seemingly, everything is fine for Masklin and his friends, especially when the mysterious Thing (a black box that is a spaceship's flight computer) comes to life and tells them more about their history. But suddenly their world is disrupted by the news of &quot;All Things Must Go -- Final Sales.&quot; Now the nomes must escape the Store and find yet another place to live.Tiny people living in a department store? Who are from another planet? That is something that could have bombed easily and hideously. But it doesn't, at least not in &quot;Truckers.&quot; Clever plot elements like the sign-based religion (they take &quot;everything under one roof&quot; seriously!) and the department-based clans (Stationari, Corsetri) keep this unlikely plot afloat.While &quot;Truckers&quot; is a self-contained story in itself, it has plenty of loose threads (mostly involving the Thing and the origins of the nomes) at the end, for the second and third books of the trilogy. The writing has Pratchett's usual sparseness and wit; the only problem is that it takes forever for the nomes to do anything. At least it's a fun slow ride. The wacky truck drive near the end is one of the best parts of the book.Masklin and his nome band (especially the indefatigable, vaguely frightening Granny) serve as a good window into the nome civilization, since they're learning about it too. The better-off nomes are a bit snottier but eager to explore the Outside. But the Thing steals the show; despite being just a computer, it has a better idea than the nomes what is going on.&quot;Truckers&quot; will delight fans of Pratchett, but you don't need to be a fan already to enjoy this story. While the plot takes awhile to go anywhere, the quirky characters and wonderful worldbuilding make it worthwhile."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Truckers is the first book of the Bromeliad trilogy (followed by Diggers and Wings).Masklin and his family are the last ten nomes of their warren, devastated by cold, predators and hunger. Desperately, they set out on a last chance journey and climb up on one of the lorries of the humans.What they'll soon discover is that this lorry has lead them to the Store of Arnold Bros (est. 1905), the home of thousands of other little nomes who, having never left the Store, think of the Outside as of nothing more than just another fairy tale. The coming of Masklin will be a great upheaval in their quiet lives. And as they learn that the Store is to be demolished, they make plans for their escape.Although Truckers was originally written for a young audience, it's an enthralling adventure but also a story about understanding other people's ways and helping each other, and no doubt grown-ups will love it too. Because Terry Pratchett's unique sense of humour is lurking round every corner, especially when nomes try to interpret our human world... and what's more to make sense of it!"},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"This is the first book in a great fantasy adventure series for kids (and adults). Nomes live 10 times faster than humans, which is why no-one notices them, and they are getting squeezed out of their home by human development. They go forth to try and find somewhere for themselves, but this is very tricky when you're only a couple of inches high.The books are very thin, which is good for reluctant readers - not so daunting to start reading, and then exciting enough to keep them going. I would also recommend it to anyone going through Harry Potter withdrawals.Rather than purchase the three books individually (which you *will* want to do if you buy the first one!) you would be better off trying to get &quot;The Bromeliad&quot; which is a hardcover collection of the trilogy - actually cheaper and set to stand up to lots of re-reading."},{"Title":"Truckers","review":"Whereas I love Discworld and this Trilogy is not a part of it, I have to rate it just as well thought out and written; involving the tribulations and adventures of creatures dealing with a human world, it definitely conveys a sense of 'here there be dragons' in the sense that humans are considered dangerous and there's no way of communication, so the fact that this little group triumphs is masterfully accomplished.

It's both, of course, and the text is very well-written, it's worth mulling over. But the genius of the book is its beautiful design and its inclusion of hundreds of illustrations. This is the kind of idiosyncratic book that drives bookstore staff mad - they never can figure out where to shelve it. The making of a map of the imagination is more than a metaphor, though thinking about \\"discovery and exploration\\" as metaphors for creativity is not exactly new. Beyond the metaphor, though, a writer's mapmaking is both necessary and practical - the mapping out of a work of fiction or of a poem, the actual exploration and plotting of a narrative arc, the sense that the writer is both guided by the mapmaking and providing a guide to his readers. Fascinating stuff, and truly beautiful and full of SO MANY extraordinary illustrations. It's one-of-a-kind, and worth purchasing. Pick it up and be seduced."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"This book defies genre. It is an examination of the correlation between writers and map-makers. If you love maps, and want to incorporate some of that passion into your writing, this is the book for you. I find myself coming back to it frequently, like a reference book on how to write the sort of story I'd like to read.Especially interesting is the portion of the book devoted to the empty spaces on maps.I can't resist Turchi's wonderful phrases, such as:\\"...a blank on a map becomes a symbol of rigorous standards; the presence of absences lent authority to all on the map that was unblank.\\"Brilliant.It will take you on a journey. And the book is lovely to look at and hold."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"Cartography is an analytical science ... mathematical, temporal, evolving. Novels are literal explorations. Perceiving a common link between the technical cartography and the creative novel becomes a fascinating common ground. Ever wonder how a left brainer thinks? Turchi gives us a hint.Turchi makes a living from his application of the understanding of the technical structure of novels ... cartography is his hobby. Right brainers make a living from the technical ... novels are the hobby.The subtleties and enjoyable descriptions of the structure and theory of great novels are merged with the structure and theory of great maps. How we use language and data to convey structural information is common ground in Turchi's premise.For this reviewer, a great map improves efficiency in getting from \\"A\\" to \\"B\\". Turchi is revealing in his observation that humans use maps to reduce an anxious uncertainty of the unknown. As one of those 'if I'm lost, get loster' types, I suppose I do enjoy the ' ... get loster' adventure. The same is true in enjoying the unexpected adventures in the great novel. Turchi's insight into natural human motivation to seek a clearing of the veil of uncertainty left me thinking down a whole other set of rabbit holes.This book is a box of chocolates."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"What a terrific book! I read this around the same time I undertook Cowan's Mapmaker's Dream (which I have also reviewed on Amazon), and the two books -- ostensibly on similar subjects -- could not be more different!Turchi's book is a genuine treasure! His prose is wonderful, full of rich images and musical language throughout. It could easily serve (and probably has done) as the text for a creative writing course, and there are thought-provoking passages on just about every page. The illustrations, too, as a prior reviewer has noted, are beautiful and fascinating. Turchi has unearthed kinds of maps I'd never conceived of before, placing them alongside medieval mappaemundi, early political maps, upside-down maps, maps drawn by children, maps drawn from memory -- you name it! Throughout the book, Turchi reinforces the point that cartography is an excellent metaphor for the way writers think, write, and revise. And as obvious a metaphor as you might be tempted to think that is, Turchi continues to surprise and delight with his imaginative insights, page after page.The book, too, is an absolute jewel (I'm speaking of the first edition hardcover here). The perfect weight, with heavy boards bound in cloth and a sewn binding; the perfect paper weight, highly readable type, and excellent use of color throughout. This is how all books should be made.I can't rave enough about it. Check it out for yourself, and I don't see how you could be disappointed. The only real disappointment comes when you turn the last page and find no others to follow it."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"I'm not a writer, not in any meaningful sense. I am a reader, and I deeply admire writers who can immerse me in their story.I received this book as a gift from someone who I respect. It seemed an odd gift, but now I understand it. This is one of the best non-fiction books that I've read in quite a long time. In this book, Turchi gives us a fascinating and engaging extended essay about writing. He compares it to the art and science of cartography, pointing out the myriad and unexpected ways in which cartography and writing are similar.While the idea is an interesting one, Turchi makes it all the more approachable through the examples and quotes that he sprinkles liberally throughout the book. This is possibly the only book that references both the storytelling of \\"Lolita\\" as well as that found within the Road Runner cartoons that I grew up with. I found myself constantly writing down more books, stories, and poems that I needed to read, based on how they were discussed herein. Many of them are books that I've been meaning to read, such as \\"Treasure Island\\", others are authors that I've heard discussed before but never in a way that made me want to rush out and read them.The book is full of maps, ranging from early maps of the world to a map drawn by the author's son showing locations in town for street luge. These maps serve as a reminder of one of the central points of the book: cartography and writing both choose what to illuminate and what to ignore. I remember annotating a map with landmarks that I found useful, which tells you just as much about what I found useful at the time as it tells you about what I didn't find useful at the time.I can't recommend this book highly enough. I feel like I need to send a copy of it to every writer I know."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"Interesting book. I'll admit I picked it up because of the cover. I also thought it was just about maps. Then when I began to read it I thought, \\"Oh, maps as a metaphor.\\" But no,not quite; the book is evenly divided between maps and writing.

Thanks to the author for such a piece of work !"},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"For as long as I can recall, I have liked the word \\"cartographer.\\" It has frequently conjured up the image of a grizzled little old man creating a map by candlelight. Peter Turchi makes that kind of analogy: the writer as mapmaker. In order to do what a writer does, he must provide a map for his readers. That's what is described here, how the writer imagines that map. My review is based on reading a galley of the book so none of the illistrations and maps was in colour. I am sure the published product was gorgeous. I am a bit of a writer myself and I found the book very helpful. Now that I have finished reading this book, I will pass my copy along to a colleague who is also a writer."},{"Title":"Maps of the Imagination: The Writer as Cartographer","review":"Be warned. This book compares the craft of writing, particularly fiction writing, to mapmaking and other forms of graphic representation. It is not a book about imaginary maps that do or could appear in fiction. This book does refer briefly to a few books containing such maps: Absalom, Absalom!; Watership Down; Lord of the Rings; Treasure Island; etc. But imaginary maps in fiction are not this book's subject.The book tries to be for fiction writers and poets what Tufte's Visual Display of Quantitative Information might be for a statistician. For fiction writers and some readers, this book is probably helpful and interesting. It is well-written, contains many illustrations, and makes some valuable points about perspective, metaphor, and details. But the illustrations often don't match up to the text. And one won't learn much about mapmaking or visual representation here. For that sort of thing, time with books by Edward Tufte or Mark Monmonier would be time better spent.I'd still like to see the book I thought I was buying. What might a map of Combray (In Search of Lost Time) look like? How about the map that Le Grand Meaulnes made? Turchi lives in Asheville, North Carolina. What might a map of Altamont (Look Homeward, Angel) depict?

She was very beautiful in an odd sort of way, with prematurely white hair, great velvety eyes that looked purple in the right light, and a low speaking voice like Cleopatra's that made a lot of man (and Carson McCullers) fall in love with her the minute she parted her lips. Even Goering had a thing for her, if Porter is to be believed.\\"If Porter is to be believed\\"--aye, there's the crunch, isn't it? She was nearly as famous for her lies as Anais Nin, and scholars and journalists early on believed very little she told them. Unrue reveals much about rhe five marriages Porter wanted to downplay, but more importantly she helps us understand just why some subjects were painful for her to revisit, so we come to empathize with a woman whose first marriage was nine years of real physical abuse, broken bones and hatred, a life that might well have driven her insane. Instead she picked herself up, shook herself off, and went completely independent. I have rarely read the life of a person so little connected with others, besides her acolytes like Eudora Welty. She seems to have played up her great beauty and her liberty, and she played games of use with each of her publishers, signing contracts she couldn't fulfill, running out on them despite her promises, and yet whining like all authors about their meanness.She lied about her age, and her 4th husband didn't know he was a full 25 years younger than she was. In 1953 or 1954, she outdid herself by having a sexual affair with a man of 28 when she was 63. She could have given tips to Cher and, with her constantly propinquity, she probably did. I didn't know the extent of Porter's Hollywood connections, how she spent a year at Paramount trying to re-write MADAME SANS-GENE for Betty Hutton! Wish that baby got made! All in all, THE LIFE OF AN ARTIST is one of the very finest biographies I've recently read. Unrue backs off from making the highest claims for Porter's importance as a fiction writer, but in the interstices of her discretion a hunger for her work grows among us. She makes us want to read Porter anew, through the refracting surfaces of her insight."},{"Title":"Katherine Anne Porter: The Life of an Artist (Willie Morris Books in Memoir and Biography)","review":"This comprehensive biography takes advantage of the time that has passed since Katherine Anne Porter's death to sort through conflicting stories from Porter's past. The result is an even more accurate account of the historical details of Porter's life than other biograhers were able to accomplish because of the handicap of multiple, contradictory accounts of Porter's life in wide circulation."},{"Title":"Fall of Saxon England","review":"The book gives a very comprehensible and accessible narrative for anyone pursuing an interest in this subject. Starting from the fall of the Roman Empire and ending with the last entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the reader comes away with a very satisfying account of Saxon England. This book is by no means &quot;dry.&quot; Richard Humble manages to give personality to the people that he is writing about and concentrates on telling the story than give a lesson. Most importantly it makes one want to pick up more books on the subject. The book is not a definitive work, but it is a wonderful general overview and a great addition to an armchair historians library."},{"Title":"The Tartan Conspiracy","review":"I can't say I liked it as well as the other Grindal I've read, Over the Sea to Die (a terrific book). This one involves Scottish nationalism, so there was a fair bit about that and the whisky trade. I found the whisky trade information interesting and wished there'd been more about that, and found the British politics a bit of a yawn (how can you make Scottish nationalism boring? Don't know, but that was my reaction to this book.)The plot involves a young man whose father, a senior civil servant in Scotland, has just died. In going through his father's belongings, the young man finds a box with some mysterious items. Additionally, some items related to the box-items have been left for him with his father's lawyer. His father believes that his old school friend, a famous retired general who died in an apparent IRA terrorist attack, was not killed by the IRA -- but the only clues are in the box and the package from the lawyer. Young man soon meets young woman and a romance develops as they try to unravel the mystery of the general's death. Personally, I thought the author writes about women from a man's point of view and the romance wasn't all that well done. The plotting and level of writing was fairly good, however, and I intend to read more by this author. I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of Scotland."},{"Title":"Gran Diccionario/Dictionary: Espanol-Ingles/English-Spanish (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a very comprehensive dictionary. I've used it on a translation project, and can only recall not finding a Spanish entry in it once. The entries are complete, giving multiple senses of the world, describing idiomatic constructions, distinguishing between figurative uses, domain-specific senses, etc., and sometimes giving synonyms, as well as the prepositions that go with particular verbs.One of the best things about this dictionary is that it sometimes includes sentence-length examples.This dictionary's one weakness (for non-European users, at any rate) is its bias towards British English and Iberian Spanish, at the cost of Latin American Spanish and American English."},{"Title":"Playboy Adult Magazine:July 2002","review":"July 1981PLAYMATE: Heidi Sorenson; cover & pictorial.COVER: Jayne KennedyPICTORIALS: Jayne KennedyINTERVIEW: Robert GarwoodFEATURES: Preview of Mel Brooks' film, History of the World, Part 1; How baseball's best pitchers conquer their fears; article on the birth control pill and contraception."},{"Title":"Practice Grammar of German - New Edition (English and German Edition)","review":"The grammar explanations are very clear, straightforward and succint.

Ironically, in view of its satirising the slavish devotion to French fashions, the play is influenced by early 18th century French comedy: the plot is very similar to Marivaux's 'The Game of love and chance': two fathers arrange a marriage for their children; this paternal decree is severely shaken by disguises, misrecognitions and counter-plots. The difference being, English comedy is always the funniest, and we get lots of marvellous words like 'obstropalous'.In effect, this drama consists of characters staging dramas to get their way, which are spoiled by other dramas, e.g. Mr. Hardcastle decides his daughter will marry a man she never met, and arranges their meeting; Tony tells this prospective husband, Marlow, and his friend Hastings, that the gentleman's house they seek is a tavern; Kate disguises herself as a barmaid to woo the diffident Marlow. The effect of all these conflicting dramas is to take a supposedly solid, class-based system, based on paternal and aristocratic power, and reveal it as a fragile one based on illusion, a series of masks and attitudes adopted to suit the required social context, where wrong directions can as easily derail as resolve the social order. The best comedy here comes from characters mistaking the social context, as when Marlow treats his host and future father-in-law as a pesky inn-keeper. Significantly, in this over-cultured milieu, most of the spanners in the works are thrown by the illiterate Tony.In Goldsmith's world, there is no such thing as a 'natural', whole identity - character is divided by public and private roles, fragmented by clothing and ornaments, with passions dictated by fashions. Goldsmith's benevolently cynical view of his century encompasses all its familiar tropes - the carousing squire rake; the social mobility; the marketplace of marriage; the refined bawdiness; the hints at the incipient decline of the aristocracy (where an old estate has degenerated into a plausible inn); the wars turned into legend from a safe distance. Its teeming culture is catalogued too - sentimental novels, the love of theatre, the rise of Gothic fiction (marvellously parodied to the point where the mistress of the house is terrified of her own garden), Hogarth, caricature prints etc."},{"Title":"She Stoops to Conquer (Standard English Classics)","review":"Few English plays dating from the eighteenth century appeal to modern audiences. For much of that period comedies were characterized by an exaggerated sentimentality and intense moralizing. Independently, the playwrights Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan rejected this moralizing mode, returning to the English stage a humorous, mildly satirical form of comedy.In a short period they created three plays that are still enjoyed today: She Stoops to Conquer (Goldsmith, 1773), The School for Scandal (Sheridan, 1775) and The Rivals (Sheridan, 1777).In recent months I have read all three play. All are quite good, but I especially liked She Stoops to Conquer and The School for Scandal. While The School for Scandal is widely admired for its witty dialogue, She Stoops to Conquer offers the most hilarious situations.The basic theme in She Stoops to Conquer is familiar. The guardians, her father Mr. Hardcastle and her aunt Mrs. Hardcastle, have arranged a suitable marriage for young Miss Hardcastle. She, of course, has other plans. Oliver Goldsmith adroitly transformed this overly used situation into delightful comedy. The plot is complicated by a shy suitor, friends with their own plans of elopement, and an unruly prankster, all leading to utter confusion in the rustic Hardcastle household. I quickly became engaged with the ridiculous happenings; I read She Stoops to Conquer in a single sitting. Five stars.Possible Interest - Another Comedy and Two Moralizing Plays:John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, first staged in 1728 in London, was another exception to the moralizing trend in the eighteenth century. This delightful, satirical comedy is considered the first modern musical. Five stars.In the prologue to The Conscious Lovers (1722) Sir Richard Steele states his objective: \\"To chasten wit, and moralize the stage\\" and to \\"Redeem from long contempt the comic name\\". Steele's objective was to instruct and to ennoble rather than to amuse. Humor is clearly subordinate. Two stars (plus perhaps 1 star for historical interest).George Lillo's moralizing melodrama, The London Merchant (1731), was a resounding success in the summer of 1731 and was apparently performed 179 times by 1776. Its repetitious moral lessons seemingly resonated with eighteenth century audiences.

There is a lot of flirtateous game-playing going on here, but it is entered into by strong, intelligent women who are using the resources they have at hand in their culture to get what they want. Reading this play, or seeing it performed, it is hard to believe that it was written in the 18th Century. Goldsmith has created a humorous story with intriguing plot twists that manages to show women as thinking individuals who take control of their own destinies....even if getting the right man is the way to do that!"},{"Title":"She Stoops to Conquer (Standard English Classics)","review":"This play is a wonderful little comedic satire that is as funny now as when it was written in 1773. Mr. Goldsmith's characters are wonderful, and the storyline is funny without being \\"sappy\\". His characters are so very human! He does not shy away from exposing human frailities, and he does it in such a way that no one would take offence to it. His characters make common human mistakes based on misunderstandings and practical jokes, but his characters are not tragically changed from these occurences. They, as well as the audience, understand human frailties, and look upon these as things that help us grow. This is a jovial, friendly play that is well worth the time it takes to read it. I find that reading plays is a nice alternate to reading long novels. A little different from short stories. I like the economies of a play. So much is written and so much is implied all in five scenes."},{"Title":"She Stoops to Conquer (Standard English Classics)","review":"SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER is one of the best plays to be written during the Restoration era.

The play is quite funny and when performed is one of the few \\"classical\\" (meaning anything pre-20th century) plays that all audiences seem to enjoy. Unfortunately, Goldsmith's masterpiece is seldom performed nowadays. Most American's have never heard of Oliver Goldsmith (is that the guy who directed PLATOON? is a typical response), let alone SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER. SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER instead tends to be one of those plays that everyone in theatre knows about, but that most people outside of the theatre universe don't even know exists.

As I am researching 18th century theatre, this book made my work rather easy!"},{"Title":"She Stoops to Conquer (Standard English Classics)","review":"She Stoops to ConquerIt was said of Oliver Goldsmith that he only wrote one play, one poem and one novel but that each one of them was perfect. The poem was \\"The Deserted Village\\", the novel \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" and ofcourse \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" is the play. I rather agree with the assessment.This play owes much to the Restoration comedy of the seventeenth and early eighteenth century. There is the emphasis on wit, and the rather stock plot of townie meets rustic and the consequences of the encounter.The characters also owe their roots to Restoration Comedy - Tony is of course the boisterous yokel, Marlowe and his friend the townies, Hardcastle the suspicious country gentleman, etc.But there is a twist. The yokel is actually the one with the brains and sets in motion the plot to solve the lovers' problems. The women take action to reveal Marlowe's actual nature. (Incidentally Marlowe is surprisingly modern). And the townies rather meet their match instead of the other way around. The whole is permeated with good nature which does exist in Restoration Comedy although not in William Congreve its most renowned and best writer, see the play \\"The Beaux Strategem\\", one of my personal favorites. Missing from \\"She Stoops to Conquer\\" is the stage Irishman so prevalent in Sheriden as well as Restoration Comedy.This is a romp and works very well onstage - but it's a bit like a number of such plays - the cast has to be superb there are no throwaway roles. And it can make for casting difficulty. And while it is never out of date it doesn't adapt itself very well to trendy different time settings, modern dress, flapper that sort of thing. That period was very much unto its own, at least for its comedy.The Dover edition is well printed, although the paper is not so glossy. The price is right, particularly for a single play, and it would make a great performance edition as there is ample margin room for comments and moves."},{"Title":"She Stoops to Conquer (Standard English Classics)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith (c. 1730-1774) was born to an English clergyman in Ireland and is often described as an \\"Anglo-Irish\\" author. Originally trained in theology, he later studied medicine and worked as an apothecary's assistant. Both then and now, critics regard the vast bulk of his writing as \\"hackwork\\"--poorly written material undertaken for the money offered. Even so, Goldsmith was indeed an exceptional and often innovative author when he put his mind to it, and his finest works rank with the best of his age. By most accounts Goldsmith wrote the comedy SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER in 1771; it was first performed in 1773 and has remained a favorite of the English stage ever since.The play concerns the Hardcastle family, who are country gentry living living outside the common realm of English aristocracy of the day. Mr. Hardcastle dislikes \\"society\\" and frequently battles with his silly wife over his refusal to spend a season in London; Mrs. Hardcastle is in turn besotted Tony Lumpkin, her wayward son by a first marriage. Indeed, the only sensible member of the family is daughter Kate--and as the play begins she is told by her father that his choice for her husband, Charles Marlow, will arrive that very night. But things do not go as planned: due to a prank by Tony Lumpkin, Charles and his companion George arrive under the impression that Hardcastle's house is actually a roadside inn. Needless to say, complications abound, and Kate finds herself assuming the role of rural barmaid the better to study her intended and bring all complications to a happy resolution.SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER is often considered a turning point in English theatre. Earlier comic authors tended to emphasize themes of hypocrisy for comic effect; Goldsmith certainly makes use of this, but instead of giving us cuckolds and strumpets he takes a more kindly point of view. His characters may sometimes be foolish and silly, but they are not so much vicious as playful and although the plot is farcical the situations are never unkind. The result is a charming confection of smiling entertainment. SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER has remained a favorite of the theatre for over two hundred years for a reason: it is as spritely, elegant, and amusing as it was when first produced.

That the book is fun to read makes it all the better. If you only buy one book of this type, I recommend this one.Other books you might find rewarding...For the person new to running/jogging, 2 books by John &quot;the penguin&quot; Bingham, 'No Need For Speed' and 'The Courage to Start' are both excellent.For a more thorough book on nutrition I recommend Andrew Weil, MD's 'Eating Well for Optimum Health'.And for more stretching tips it's hard to beat 'Stretching' by Bob Anderson"},{"Title":"Boot Camp: Be All You Used to Be The Sergeant's Fitness and Nutrition Program","review":"I was a member of the Sarge's Program for 5 years, before moving away to NY.

I've been doing the program for about a month now and notice that I'm not out of breath anymore when I walk up 5 flights of stairs! A good way to go and something a bit easier to stick to with Sarge breathing down your neck...literally of course!"},{"Title":"Boot Camp: Be All You Used to Be The Sergeant's Fitness and Nutrition Program","review":"This book was wonderful for presenting boot camp in a way that doesn't really put you down (except jokingly) for modifying exercises. And, contrary to what another reviewer said, in all cases he considers &quot;brisk walking&quot; to be part of a workout if that is all you can do. Anyone who thinks walking can't be a good aerobic workout should try racewalking. Also, remember that every pound on the body is about 4 pounds of pressure on your knees, so running is not for everyone, especially if all you have to run on is concrete and you are overweight and/or have bad knees to start with.Especially good are the pull-up modifications, and the imaging exercises concerning food and why you should work out so you don't end up in a nursing home.Definitely buy this book!"},{"Title":"Boot Camp: Be All You Used to Be The Sergeant's Fitness and Nutrition Program","review":"This book is great!

If you want an easy way to get in shape and a very funny read then this is the book for you. I have been doing it for about 4 months along with changing my eating habits and have lost 30 pounds so far!

It's very basic and straight forward; exercises are clearly described and effective. The appendices and the pre-workout tests are worth the price of the book, by themselves. The chapter on nutrition isn't very thorough, based on research or practical. Organic produce, free-range chickens, steroid free meat are not readily available everywhere, even if they are the &quot;best&quot; choices. The author also assumes that unless you are obese, you can run. Some alternatives are briefly mentioned without guidelines. Even so, this book is well worth reading and much can be put into practice, if used with other programs."},{"Title":"Boot Camp: Be All You Used to Be The Sergeant's Fitness and Nutrition Program","review":"If you're looking for a quick and simple way to lose at least 5-10 pounds in three weeks, don't look any further!!

I was able to put it to good use right away and I have used it quite often (it's laminated, so that's a good thing when it comes to wear and tear).

Additionally, I think the plastic heated-laminate is of inferior quality. If they kept the physical size the same but used laminated cardstock like the \\"Quick Source\\" products, the font size could probably be increased slightly and the product would have a more professional look, rather than looking like something someone produced at their kitchen table.Still, I compliment the level of detail and amount of reference information that was put together on two sides of a single page--a refreshing contrast to the PMBOK ;)If they improve the quality, I'd be willing to buy one of these for every one of my project managers."},{"Title":"PMP Project Management Knowledge Areas & Processes (based on the PMBOK 4th Edition)","review":"Product has all the information from PMBOK Third Edition as described.

It came much faster than I expected. Thank you."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"when I first began reading this book. I expected that this book was going to be a mix of scientific report and anecdotal evidence illustrating the intelligence of ravens. I was wrong.As I began to read through Feher-Elston's story, I was annoyed by her persistence in discussing religion and spirituality in connection with the raven. However, as I read on, I found myself more and more reluctant to set this book down. Before I knew it, I was reading on voraciously, completely consumed by the story.Feher-Elston very successfully weaves together science, history, and spirituality, guiding the reader through many different and equally important perspectives on these birds. Through her exploration of the importance of Raven in Native American religion, the ghost dance, and creation stories, it feels as if one somehow begins to grasp the gravity of this bird through the wisdom of ages of man.Folded into this story of history and legend, are the modern scientific truths of these birds. The author offers the reader the benefit of humanity's whole history of observations of these birds, and layers it with modern scientific knowledge. Through this book, the reader is left with a greater scientific and emotional understanding of the both the corvid, and of all of man's hopes and fears that it embodies."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"One of the best integrated treatments of Nature, Catherine Feher-Elston's Ravensong: A Natural and Fabulous History of Ravens and Crows,is at last available to a greater public through Trcher/Penguin. This lyrical treatment of ravens, crows and their relationships with people and other animals is fascinating and beautiful. Anyone who reads this work will never look a crows and ravens in exactly the same way again. This is a great book, and anyone with a love of birds, animals, science, literature of mythology will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"This is a good book for people who want to learn about ravens and crows. For more knowledgable readers, there's not much new information, but it's a very nicely written book. The black and white illustrations are special, however, and the book makes a good addition to any bird library for that reason--they beautifully capture the 'crowness' of these magnificient birds."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"This is really a good book!

I found this book to be written with devotion and reverance for these great and intelligent sky masters."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"I really wanted to like this one. But I also needed it to be either more literary or more anthropological. The illustrations and page design are beautiful. But Feher-Elston's text is annoyingly repetitive, with even less actual information than you might expect from a large-type book. Where I was hoping for well-retold stories about Raven/Crow, she gives a few, not particularly imaginative synopses. Where she might have focused on Native American myths (her strong point, if she has one), she throws in psuedo-information about Raven in other cultures, without really giving you any stories. Where you really want her to just tell the Raven story, she throws in Native American history with only a tangential relationship to Raven/Crow. Aaaargh. I can and have read Original Peoples history elsewhere. I can and have read anthropological accounts of shamans elsewhere. It's called Ravensong. Wouldn't it be nice if it collected songs about ravens?"},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"Not a book to read if you are seeking more science than legend."},{"Title":"Ravensong: A Natural And Fabulous History Of Ravens And Crows","review":"This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself. The \\"fabulous\\" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions. The \\"natural\\" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate. Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes."},{"Title":"A Revelation of Jesus Christ","review":"This was an excellent book by a dispensational, Mennonite author (yes they exist!).

I found the writing articulate and the information at worst a honed compilation of all research on the topic, and at best an excellent resource for all in the field of population studies."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is written by small, established clique with association to the Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty. Individually, each researcher has turned out years of credible research. Unfortunately, they have a reputation for deviating from credible research results when arguing policy to the public and when making a case for specific reforms. The major failures of the current child support system are largely attributable to this crowd, which from the 70s have promoted the application of old Soviet Russian &quot;welfare policy&quot; in the United States. Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of this history, is that Congress was so willing to implement the reforms, forcing states to replace traditional Constitutionally based mechanisms for dealing with family issues.I too, would like to rename the book. A proper title would be &quot;Our Two Decades of Failure and the New Spin for the 21st Century: What We Want You to Believe Now&quot;.I agree with the previous reviewer that lack of focus on the effects of child support reform at higher income levels underlies a basic failure of the book to enter current discussion in a rational way. The &quot;success&quot; of the authors in promoting policy reform is largely concentrated in the fact that federal &quot;welfare laws&quot; and welfare bureaucracy have now been extended to all income levels. Simply ignoring the most damaging effects of these reforms doesn't make them go away."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"Each chapter of this book is a separate study looking at child support enforcement and its impact on nonresident fathers. The authors believe the biggest impact of enforcement efforts falls on low income and poverty level fathers, therefore virtually all of what they study focuses on that group alone. Consequently, it would have been more appropriate to include &quot;Low Income&quot; in the book's title. Unfortunately, the majority of nonresident fathers are not in this population, as enforcement activities impact them as well. Understanding the impact on the bigger population would help policy makers improve overall enforcement activities. One area that I was especially disappointed about in this book is the fact that none of the authors address the foundation for child support enforcement, and that is the basis that child support orders are determined. Statistics and figure abound on what nonresident parents (usually fathers) &quot;owe&quot; in child support, yet it seems to be simply accepted as a given that the guidelines used in each state are fundamentally sound in their philosophy and economics. If, as many argue, the numbers are overstated through lack of consideration of the expenses of an involved nonresident parent's &quot;parenting&quot;, the impact on them can be enormous, creating a roadblock to involvement in their child's life. This creates enormous conflict of its own, and certainly can't help but contribute to the problem of father absence. As the US Census has pointed out, when a nonresident parent is involved in their child's life, compliance with child support is approximately 90%. One could argue, which this book fails to do, that for enforcement to truly work, we should do all we can to foster dual parent involvement. This book provides an interesting look at poverty level fathers within this public policy arena. Its usefulness from a practical point of view however, is limited to only that population. Focusing change based on this material would be dangerous as the data is &quot;incomplete&quot;."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is a composite of papers written by social scientists and legal scholars prepared for a conference in 1995. Although revised to consider criticisms and suggestions from the conference, the chapters fall short in providing significant information regarding the impact of current child support enforcement activity, as much of the most significant new government mandates occurred after these works were written. Even though the majority of enforcement activity in this country involves non-welfare related cases, this book focuses almost exclusively on fathers at or below poverty. The title of the book should have been &quot;Low Income Fathers Under Fire&quot;. Although the chapters are interesting, none touch on the fundamental issue dealing with the economic foundation for most state guidelines. It seems to be accepted as a &quot;given&quot; that state review committees have &quot;sound&quot; bases for their respective guidelines, rather than picking them apart to ensure what is said to be &quot;owed&quot; by fathers is indeed appropriate. For instance, an involved father not only is responsible for a formal child support obligation, he must also spend additional money for the child's time spent with him, to which little to no credit is considered. Although father access to children is given some review in the book, very little qualitative attention is given to the subject. This could be explained by the quote in the book that defies common sense, &quot;Children may also benefit from spending more time with nonresident parents, although the evidence for this is mixed.&quot; Throughout the book, it is pointed out repeatedly that data is slim about nonresident fathers, yet somehow there is enough to justify this compilation. Its usefulness from a practical standpoint is minimal."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is written by small, established clique with association to the Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty.

I would say it is good for the 8-14 year old range. Of coure, I'm in my 30s and I loved it. I read it in 3 days.This book is much better than the Harry Potter books (which I also just read). The author has put so much thought and emotion into this story.As another reviewer mentioned the book &quot;makes you sad in a good way&quot;. It is about friendship, loneliness, growing up, time travel, and family. I am still perplexed and mulling over some parts of this book.I won't spoil the surprises by going over the plot. I recommend you read this to your children. If you do, you'll probably spend half the time discussing with them the nature of time and reality, what true friendship is, how wonderful nature is, and how mean some humans can be.Does Harry Potter do this? Yes but in a much shallower, simpler way. This book makes you think and it doesn't let the magic (or whatever) get the hero out of a fix or solve the mystery. The magic creates the questions but never really answers them.***This is NOT a book about wizards or witches. It is a book about a boy who has strange things happen to him that he cannot control and really cannot understand. So please don't buy this book thinking it is a wizard or boarding school book. I used Harry Potter as a comparison as it is a popular modern day children's book aimed at the same age range.***"},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"This book was, as others have pointed out, something I read as a child.

I agree with the cheery reviews below, including the review that noted how Pearce handles the time-travel plot so deftly it doesn't jar or seem hokey.I just wanted to add two comments: First, this is a really moving story about the way people change, and grow up and grow apart. As I read it, I found myself thinking sometimes of friends who've moved on, or of how, looking at old pictures some years ago, my parents said wistfully of us their grown-up children, \\"It was such a nice time, when you were kids, and then suddenly you were all grown up.\\" Tom's Midnight Garden is about a boy who meets a lonely girl, becomes fast friends with her as they play the days away in the garden, but it doesn't stay that way. There are a lot of things like that.The other thing is that the story, the dialogue, the writing, have a sort of mellow, craftsmanlike feel. In other words it reads like a, uh, \\"timeless classic\\", or maybe it's good in the same sort of way that a good Katherine Paterson story is good. I sure did't get the same impression when I read, say, Louis Sachar's Holes.My niece would give Tom's Midnight Garden 5 stars too."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"Tom, quarantined from his brother's measles and sent off to relatives, faces several weeks in a house converted into flats with no other kids, no playground and nothing at all for a boy of his age to do. A grandfather clock that tells the correct time but clangs different hours stands in the hallway of the house. One night, when the clock chimes a mysterious thirteenth hour, Tom goes down to investigate.What he finds is an entirely different house with rich decorations and carpeting. And, behind the back door that in the daytime gives out to an alley, is his fondest wish - a vast garden to play in and a friend with whom to explore every tree and hedge and even the meadow and river beyond.Time is the great mystery in this book. For Tom only 24 hours may have gone by since his last visit but seasons have passed in the garden. As for his friend, a girl named Hatty, sometimes she appears younger than he is and sometimes, she is almost an adult. And while he may spend a whole day in the garden, the grandfather clock shows that he only spent a few minutes out the door.As with all good stories, the reader is not only immersed in the mystery and the enjoyment while reading, her imagination is stirred. And who knows what kind of concoction boils up when that happens? Oh to find one's own secret garden and a good friend behind a seemingly mundane door!This book is not only for children but for adults as well. I would translate Tom's adventures to Zoe's Mid-afternoon Caribbean Cabana in which a cubicle-dwelling computer programmer enters a supplies closet in that hazy time between lunch and tea and finds a white sand beach, a hammock, a chick-lit novel and a cold, umbrella-decorated cocktail."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I loved this book as a kid. I'm glad I came across it recently. Forty years later, it still is a great book to read. Did you ever notice how many English children's classics are about intensely lonely children?

The ending is great, and not quite what you would expect."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I happened upon this gem in my public library, where I haunt the aisles of juvenile fiction. \\"Tom's Midnight Garden,\\" a beautifully-written fantasy book for middle school readers, is a classic in England. It won the Carnegie Medal and is considered Phillipa Pearce's masterpiece.As the story opens, Tom is being rushed off to stay with his aunt and uncle because his little brother has the measles and they hope Tom won't get sick too. The aunt and uncle live in an old house converted into flats. They don't have children and Tom's aunt tells him there isn't even a garden in back to play in.Tom's aunt feeds him overly-rich food, and indigestion keeps him awake at night. One night he slips out of the flat, goes downstairs, and opens the back door. He looks out and sees, beneath a dawn sky, \\"a great lawn where flowerbeds bloomed; a towering fir-tree, and thick, beetle-browed yews that humped their shapes down two sides of the lawn; on the third side, to the right, a greenhouse almost the size of a real house; from each corner of the lawn, a path that twisted away to some other depths of garden, with other trees.\\"But Tom soon learns that the garden is only there at night. During the day the back door opens onto a narrow concrete slab decorated with five trashcans.He goes out every night and soon he meets a little girl wearing old-fashioned clothes. Her name is Hatty and she lives in the very house where he's staying, but as it was long before it was converted into flats. Like Tom, she's lonely and wants someone to play with, so every night they play together. Time jumps around from one visit to another: different times of day, different seasons.When Tom learns that his brother is well and it's time for him to go home, he begs to stay a little longer. Soon, though, he'll have to leave the garden behind. But first more surprises are in store.

Or it might be that it is more likely for Tom to be friends with a boy rather than a girl. Well, this is just an odd observation I have. Odd as it is, it has nothing to do with how I liked and enjoyed this children's story, especially how it played out in the end.I'd say that though it was to be expected, the revelation towards the end still caught me by surprise. For me, that made all the difference in my rating. I was just looking at 3 stars, until I got to the big reveal.The story manifests that anything can happen in our dreams, however impossible when scrutinized in the light of day. It touches on the unexplainable, yet told with so much heart, it becomes perfectly acceptable.An enjoyable read for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book which I must have missed during my childhood. The book had obviously fallen into the bath at some point, this didn't detract from its charm in fact it was an inhancement for it to have a water-mark!

It's a wonderful read.Great Illustrated Classics the Last of the Mohigans"},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"There are certain books the reviews for which always start along the lines of, \\"I remember reading this book as a child ...\\"). Often, those books are well-written, mellow, old-fashioned, almost dreamy, mood pieces. There is rarely any discussion of who might want to read the book now. That's more or less what we have here.This book is certainly a classic. The writing is restrained and the development of the writer's themes is subtle. It is a wonderful example of the best in English children's writing, and quite worthy of all those fond memory reviews. But, do you want this book now for your modern child's library now? I think the answer is yes, not because the book is essential reading, but because you should have it on the chance that you're young reader will respond to it. Would I encourage every kid to read this? No. Would I invite some kids to try it? Yes. Would I want it on the shelf to be discovered. Absolutely."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"'Tom's Midnight Garden' was always one of my special favourites.

He called it Chiquitita and this dog became a very important part of his life."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I read this book when I was nine years old and I never forgot it. I forced all my sisters to read it, and then they forced all _their_ friends to read it.

How they'd contain a section or a snippet out of some of the great works of children's fiction in the hopes of whetting our elementary appetites and interests so that we'd seek out the books on our own? No? Well, I do. I remember reading one of these textbooks one day and coming across a section in which a boy lives in a house where the clock strikes thirteen one night. Then he stumbles onto a magnificent eerie garden that only appears at this time. For years I carried the images from this single slight little passage with me, not knowing where they came from. It was only when I became a children's librarian that I decided to rediscover my mystery book. It didn't take long either. \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" is a true literary classic. Combining a British love of gardens with a bit of ghostly hauntings, time travel, and magical hours that don't exist in the regular world, the book has remained a classic, even if it has slipped out of the public eye a jot.Tom and Peter are uncommonly close brothers. For them, summer is the time when they can play endless games in their backyard for hours at a time. Imagine Tom's sorrow then when Peter comes down with the measles right at the beginning of the warm months AND Tom has been quarantined to his stuffy old aunt and uncle's home. The boy is, needless to say, less than delighted with this chain of events. His relatives occupy the second floor flat in an old building that is separated into apartments. To top it all off, Tom has insomnia every night and finds himself wandering the building. One night the grandfather clock on the first floor starts chiming an unheard of thirteen chimes. Drawn by this peculiar number, Tom goes to the first floor, opens the back door, and finds himself facing a beautiful gigantic garden and woodsy area. This is especially odd when you consider that during the day this place is a paved over alleyway replete with garbage cans and a high fence. At night, however, it transforms into a magnificent wonderland for Tom and the girl he meets there, Hatty. Hatty and Tom become inseparable, in spite of their mutual confusion over what exactly is going on. Only when Tom is threatened with having to leave his aunt and uncle's (and thereby the garden) does he discover the source of the magic and the modern-day tie that pulls him there.Comparisons of this book to \\"The Children of Green Knowe\\" make perfect sense. As I read this title, it didn't take much urging to be reminded of that other great fantasy in which a boy makes friends with otherworldly children. \\"The Secret Garden\\" also pops into the brain, due to its eerie ghostlike wailings and magnificent hidden garden. \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" is a little more methodical and (dare I say?) modern than these other books, though. Though Tom and Hatty don't initially question why a garden mysteriously appears in his backyard every night, eventually Tom must solve the mystery with a little detective work of his own. It's to the author's credit that by the tale's end, everything has been explained in a believable way. Some fantasy authors are far too willing to show something spectacular and then explain it away with the lame excuse of \\"it's magic!\\". Philippa Pearce is no such hack. This is a well-thought through book that justifies its fantasy and still remains fun.I can't help but wish that reissues of \\"Tom's Midnight Garden\\" might consider giving it a bit of an updated cover. The original illustrations by Susan Einzig are inoffensive enough, but wouldn't this book benefit from lush full-page color illustrations from someone like Tasha Tudor, Tony DiTerlizzi, or (as long as I'm indulging myself in pure fantasy) Dave McKean? Slap a post-1958 cover on this puppy (possibly showing Tom getting his head stuck midway through the shed door) and you've got yourself a book that kids would be dying to get their hands on. Instead, you've a title that savvy adult, parents, librarians, and schoolteachers will have to coyly promote. Once the right kind of kid discovers it, however, you'll have a dickens of a time prying it from their hands. A fantasy that deserves more attention."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"With the possible exception of Falkner's &quot;Moonfleet&quot; this is my all-time favourite children's book. I loved it as a child, read it as an adolescent, enjoyed it as an adult, &amp; read it aloud to my children as a father. The story here is how a boy finds his way into the past of a house he is visiting, and his growing fascination with the life of a little girl in that past. The style of writing is so matter of fact, i think i truly believed as a child because there is no sense of &quot;look how cute this idea is&quot; you often get in books of the sort. The reader is invited to fully participate in and identify with both Tom and Hattie, and their growing friendship. The climax of the book, as Tom discovers what has truly been happening, never fails to move me to tears; just thinking about Mrs. Bartholomew's line right now is tightening my throat. Read this book."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"&quot;Tom's Midnight Garden&quot; belongs on any &quot;Best Novels of the 20th Century&quot; list. I came to &quot;Midnight Garden&quot; through Pearce's other books. Read her ghost stories (many about animals), and tales of English urban and suburban children's lives. Ms. Pearce never talks down to children, treating her readers and creations with respect. Also, the adult insights and regrets that we may have forgotten experiencing when we were young, abound in her work. She is very wise. A quick example: A boy dreads a family get together for great grandmother's 100th birthday celebration because of a vicious, bullying cousin. Nevertheless, the terrible reunion day arrives. During a game of hide and seek, as the bully chases our hero, he happens to duck into a quiet room only to find that the 100 year old grandmother has been warehoused there, wheeled out of the way at her own party. Even though age and infirmity have rendered her hardly able to speak, it seems that she senses the boy's fear as the door handle turns and the bully comes inside. As the bully advances into the room, it's silence is broken by a hideous, ghostly wail. Bully runs terrified from the hellish moan, and great-grandmother's face has a slight smile on it, the only (other) physical action she can manifest. She has moaned and (do I remember correctly?) popped her teeth out and protected the boy the only way she can. But that's not all. Our boy gets away, but thinking back on the incident, wishes he had properly thanked great grandmother for her help. (And here is the greatness of Pearce's art) The obligations not met, connections never made, the friend in need never thanked, the other-aged comrade with whom we now know we should have connected, the good words not spoken, Pearce always has woven into the cloth of the story. The immensity of life and our day-late-dollar-short performance in the world is there to be recognized along with the humor and action of the story. This is bittersweet, profound fiction but no moral is grafted on to her tales. It is there to be seen for he (or she) who has eyes with which to see it. Philippa Pearce, who was a BBC radio dramatist before becoming a children's author, is one of the very fine writers of our century."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I first read this book as a young teenager and no matter how many times I re-read it, I am always moved almost to tears by the depth of feeling the author writes about. A simple concept such as loneliness connects two characters across the abyss of time. The author skillfully handles the idea of the past existing concurrently with the present. The simple wish for a friend is the underlying force of this story. This is a book that once I read, I never forgot."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"'Tom's Midnight Garden' is Phillipa Pearce's award-winning novel, as well as her best work - all her other writings are measured by this, and so far none have quite reached its peak. It is a time-slip story, which means I was somewhat cross-eyed by the end of it (I usually avoid time-travelling adventures like the plauge on account of the 'confusing ordering' of them all), but Pearce keeps to all the laws of physics that would apply if one actually *could* time-travel. The real beauty of the story is not the time-travelling at all, but the realism of all the characters, the profound themes concerning the passage of time and growing up, the simple but true friendship between Tom and Hatty, and the idea of a secret garden, not separated from the rest of the world by a mere wall like in [...], but by Space and Time themselves.Tom Long is being sent from his home and the promise of a long, lazy summer to his Uncle Alan and Aunt Gwen's dreary, boring flat, as his brother Peter has the measles. Frustrated and rude to begin with, he lives a confined and utterly restricted half-life within their cold and unwelcoming home. In fact, the only thing that proves that time is indeed moving at its normal pace is the ticking of the ancient grandfather clock belonging to old Mrs Bartholemew, the land-lady who lives upstairs. The clock keeps strange time however, often it gives more or less chimes than it's supposed to, and one night Tom is sure that he hears it chime the hour thirteen. Creeping downstairs to investigate, he discovers instead that the backdoor opens out into a beautiful, silent, vast garden. He soon becomes a regular visitor, but only by night, for in the daytime the door instead opens out onto a grimy yard. But in the garden he meets Hatty, a lonely little girl under the tyranny of her unkind aunt and three cousins, and the only being that can actually see him! After the friendship is made, the real adventures start, but threading through all of this is the continual mystery - how did the garden get there? Who is Hatty? Where did she and the garden come from? Are they ghosts or merely images from the past? *Why* is the garden there in the first place?Pearce treats what is essentially her main character - the garden itself - not as a strange, utterly abnormal event, nor as a comfitable, familiar occurance, but as a ghostly, yet steady place. Tom's reactions to it, from his initial awe, to fright, to intoxication with it is vividly and realistically portrayed so that we too honestly share in these emotions.It is fascinating to read of Tom's explorations of the garden and the twofold freedom he experiences - first that he is away from the regulations of his aunt and uncle, and second that of his invisibility to the denizens of the garden. Pearce creates beautiful descriptive passages of the garden and surrounding grounds, but marks them with intriguing sentences such as: 'Tom often had the feeling of people having just gone, and an uncomfortable feeling of someone who had *not* gone; someone who, unobserved, observed him. Pearce builds up the tension and in this story magnificently, as Tom gradually builds up his knowledge of the garden and slowly begins to traverse its borders.Furthermore, Tom's decision to quit the real world to dwell forever within the 'garden-world' is a thought-provoking one, and coupled achingly well with Hatty's growth, movement into 'grown-up' things, and steady forgetting of Tom. The feelings of change and aging reminds me very much of stories concerning Peter Pan and Wendy, however in Barrie's book, where we predominatly see through Wendy's eyes, here we can see how Peter probably felt as an elusive and 'unreal' figure, loosing someone not through death or place but through the simple inevitability of growing up.Thus the story is definitly not just for kids, as the major message of the book is a bittersweet one - that we must all someday leave our childhoods behind for the bigger realm of adulthood beyond our own backgardens. Yet we need never forget those times, nor loose the friendships we forged within them. Certainly Tom and Hatty didn't."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"All children should be given the chance to read this book. It was the favourite story of my childhood. It is a beautiful, haunting evocative story of childhood, growing up, adulthood and old age. It's also unbearably sad, in a happy kind of way, if that makes sense. It's the story of life. It's beautifully written, and a haunting evocation of a place, a garden, long ago - so powerfully written you'll feel you'll come to know every corner of it - the nut stubbs, the greenhouse, the meadow, the sundial wall and the stream and so forth, that it comes alive in your mind - the old fir tree, that Hatty used to like to stand under in a high wind, and feel the roots &quot;pulling like muscles&quot; under her feet - so wonderfully drawn you'll not want to leave it's world. You can read it when a child and appreciate it, and also as an adult and view it from a different perspective, of a story of a bored boy and one very lonely little girl, and how their friendship transcends even time itself. The ending is so powerful, so moving that it'll have you in tears, and yet it's treated without sentimentality and without condescending to it's readers, of any age.

I had read many books before but this one truly opened my mind to the wondrous joy of reading.Nearly thirty years later I have not yet found a book to surpass it. Re-reading as an adult I still see why its multi-layered, perfectly self-consistent meanings entranced me.The apparent wish-fulfilment of the story is really only the surface. Around the dream garden and its marvels flow deeper themes: of growing apart and loss of childhood, time as an enemy, and unfathomable yearning. Which is not to say that this is an overwhelmingly sad book, though it is certainly one in which childhood wishes are portrayed as tempered for the first time. Even the sadness can be beautiful because it is part of life; and the book shows that the tyranny of time can be overcome with mind.I here have the privilege of urging parents to allow their children to discover the joys of literature through this book. It would be delightful to know that children of today could appreciate it too."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I first read this book at age 12, and still love it today at age 50.

The grandfather clock keeps very unusual time, sending Tom on a midnight escapade into a wonderful garden. Or is it really midnight? There he meets a girl, the only one who can see him, whom he befriends. They have many shared experiences in their little garden world and sometimes out of it, as well. Time passes for the girl, but the magic of the clock and garden always seem to keep Tom at the same age. Eventually, there is a tangible intersecting of their two lives, and through this, a surprising discovery of an old and treasured friend. Tom's Midnight Garden is well written and well paced. A true gem to read aloud or to enjoy by yourself. I recommend it highly. It is available through Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"Strangely filled me with sorrow. In wonderment at the achievement of the writing, I closed the book, and lay it on my chest. I couldn't let go. I closed my eyes and had to concentrate to get my emotions under control. And failed. Memories of the past, of missed opportunities, failed and half realized relationships, were upon me. And again I knew that all stories at their best redeem. And as such, Tom's Midnight Garden is re-creation in the best, original sense of the word.And all this from a belated, middle-aged reading of a children's' book.To say anything about the ingenious structure of the narrative would certainly spoil it for those for whom the reading of it happily still lies in the future. To say that the prose is simple and clear and unobtrusive, would be half-true; It has a peculiarly rhythmic intonation which would make it a treat to hear it read out loud. Like the true subject of the story, time, this quality eludes definition, and has to be experienced by the reading to be understood. It is marvelous.Having been a voracious reader when I was young, it sometimes seems to me that I've read just about everything worth-while in print. I remember seeing the title in the local library all those years ago, but never took it out. So I've regained what I had discarded, a consolation, when it mattered.Louis M."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"Amazing that already 40 years ago, when this book was published for the first time, the subject of &quot;time travels&quot; was treated. This is exactly what we understand now by the modern theory of parallel worlds. Therefore this book is not only interesting for children, but for adults as well. Another aspect why I like the novel and recommend it for children, is the point that by reading the description of the garden you get a deep respect of nature. I simply find it lovely that Mrs Pearce gives names to the trees, as Tricksy and St. Paul for example. The best thing to do is to read the book on a warm summer evening sitting in your garden!"},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"The book cover caught my attention when I was Ross University School of Medicine's student lounge. It looks like a book for little kids, since the book collections at student lounge is sparse; I just had to check it out. I love to read about super-natural stories. And I have to say this book is well done. It has all the necessary mystery and suspension.Once I started reading, I just wanted to keep going till I find out what is really happening. I was a little disappointed that it is not really a ghost story. However, the author's imagination is beyond normal. Who can ever thought about such a scenario, and isn't it fun to let your imagination fly high and into the deep that you have never thought that was possible. Someone could have made a movie out from this book."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"When I finished reading this book I didn't know what to think. It was definitely not boring, but the story wasn't that interesting in itself. I enjoyed it to a certain extent, but when I was done I didn't have the satisfying feeling I usually sense when I finish a good book.The entire book I was trying to figure out what was happening. Not until the very end do you really know. Which means I found myself skimming to the end just to find out what is happening at the beginning. I was kind of confused, I really didn't know what to think. It seemed well written and enjoyable to some extent, but then again it was really weird.As I was explaining the story plot to my sister I realized that weird was exactly the word I was looking for. It is well written, it is interesting, but it is also really weird.If you like stories that go out of the boundaries of time, that get you wondering how time and space really work, and if you have always wondered where the line is drawn between imagination and reality, you may really like this book. But as for me, I can't say that I really did."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"I read this book as a child and remembered it fondly, but in little detail. Reading it aloud now to my six year old son several things strike me. Firstly, it's not as magical as I remember, which is surprising. Secondly, the sense of place is very well evoked and I'm ashamed that I did not remember its Fenland setting. Thirdly, Time - the subject of the novel - has not been kind to it. It was first published in 1958 and the present-day scenes have a contemporary feel to them. In other words, it seems dated, but the late 1950s, which were a very repressive period in recent English history, have yet to acquire the kind of nostalgic charm that attaches to, say, Arthur Ransome's books which were mostly written and set in the 1930s."},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"The book did not interest us. It was well written but if you are not into adventure this book is for you. A boy goes back in time into a garden and meets some people. That is what the entire book is about and after awhile it gets boring"},{"Title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","review":"Well, this book was not too good. The author kept telling how great everything was and then just took the story and ran it in circles. Tom just did the same thing (basicly) every night, just with new elements. The only good part is the ending. Recommended to anyone who has a lot of time."},{"Title":"Regarding Film: Criticism and Comment (PAJ Books)","review":"For more than four decades Stanley Kauffmann has been the film critic for the New Republic. Now after three decades of the reign of Martin Peretz over that journal he is that rarest of creatures, a truly non-ideological critic. He is consistently sensible and sane, and always worthy to be read. For those who think that Roger Ebert is too vulnerable to the slick products of Hollywood, or that the late Pauline Kael was too voluble and dogmatic, Kauffmann is always available as an alternative.This collection of reviews covers 1993-2000 and is somewhat more selective than his previous books. There is praise of Abbas Kiarostami and much enthusiasm for Emma Thompson. Michelangelo Antonioni is given a final review, there is a touching obituary for Marcello Mastroianni, and another touching, and very brief, one for James Stewart. Neil LaBute and Todd Solondz are praised for their ruthlessly unsentimental approach. Pulp Fiction is treated somewhat warrily. Forrest Gump goes completely unmentioned. Fargo and All About my Mother get very guarded praise. Eyes Wide Shut and The End of the Affair are subjected to special criticism. Among foreign films Kauffmann singles out for praise Ken Loach, Gianni Amelio, Zhang Yimou, Daniel Bergman's film of his father Ingmar's autobiography, and Erick Zonca.I find myself disagreeing more with Kauffmann in this collection. I myself do not think that Amistad is a better film than Kundun. Kundun may be excellent, it may be overly respectful, but in my view Amistad is little more than competent and worthy. It strikes me as odd that in American Beauty Kauffmann should praise Annette Bening's acting, since the script caricatures her character as a spiteful gargoyle. (Still, Kauffmann has the movie right: \\"at the finish of the picture, we're left feeling that Ball has had a trial run with them: now he needs to go back and really use them to some enlightening and organically whole purpose.\\") At one point in his praise of Schindler's List, he notes the scene of a child hiding in a latrine and says it is mememorable in the same way as the famous photograph of a child being marched away from the Warsaw ghetto. I would argue that Spielberg's shot cannot be memorable as the original photo, since it is obviously been too clearly designed to resemble it. Another weakness of the collection is that there are fewer dismissive reviews. His criticism is actually one of his strengths, as one sees in the pans he wrote last year of Moulin Rouge and The Man Who Wasn't There.Nevertheless, Kauffmann is an intelligent and literate man, and he is properly pessimistic about the future of film, as the students he tought earlier in the last decade are too impatient and spoiled to recognize the virtues of silent movies, or black and white movies or subtitled ones. They often have no sense of history, either of the movies as an art form or of the wider society. Kauffmann, who quotes Shaw and Graham Greene several times to good effect, is depressed but not desponsdent. And so one should look at, among other things, a fine essay on adapting Mozart to the screen, a surprisingly undeferrential review of Touch of Evil, and a review of the European background and soil of Billy Wilder."},{"Title":"Regarding Film: Criticism and Comment (PAJ Books)","review":"This collection of six years' (1993-98) of thoughtful and passionate criticism (movie reviews and film theory, and related book reviews) is a delight, and a wonderful primer - on thinking and writing about movies. An elegant and informative Foreword by Michael Wood provides biographical material on Stanley Kauffmann, a lifelong theater and film critic, film and theater professor, and essayist.Kauffmann sent his first (unsolicited) film review to The New Republic in 1958, and has been their film critic since then. Kauffmann : &quot;The mere physical act of film-going is part of the kinesis of my life- the getting up and going out and the feeling of coming home, which is a somewhat different homecoming feeling from anything else except the theater...To have my life unpunctuated by the physical act of film going is almost like walking with a limp, out of my natural rhythm.&quot;This terrific collection has been divided into a few sections: &quot;Reviews,&quot; &quot;Reviewings,&quot; &quot;Comment,&quot; and &quot;Books.&quot; The reviews are written deceptively simply, one of Kauffmann's many subtle abilities. He draws you into his view of a film and its possibilities (realized or not) with gentleness and assuredness. He is never noisy, flippant, or condescending. When he objects to something (and he does, often) he lays it out clearly - and humanely. It's a pleasure.Kauffmann can be funny, too, and has an innate sense of what is worth re-telling. Kauffmann's wonderful review of Kevin Brownlow's biography of director David Lean starts off: &quot;David Lean began life as a dunce. His kindergarten teacher told his mother that she was afraid he would never be able to read and write. He managed to disprove that prediction, buy otherwise there was little sparkle.&quot; Of course Lean, raised a Quaker in London, discovered movies at age 13, and everything changed.Kauffmann eagerly promotes his favorites (Emma Thompson is one, he has much respect for Warren Beatty, and pays close attention to smaller, unsung filmmakers) and is painstakingly fair to actors and filmmakers -in consistently thoughtful uses of his pulpit. He begins his review of a small Iranian film, &quot;Through the Olive Trees,&quot; by expressing his thanks to the friend who prompted him to first have a look at its director's work, and then he thanks the director himself. Kauffmann is a man who loves the medium, and reveres its potential to provide hope and transformation - along with a lot of fun.These great pieces are definitely worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"Regarding Film: Criticism and Comment (PAJ Books)","review":"Stanley Kauffmann was still going strong in his critical insights as an 80 year old reviewing movies and book in the mid-1990s as this collection reveals. Telling, however, is how Kauffman laments the absence of good material to review. He points out the wooden performance of Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and the mission to save Ryan is smaller than the opening battle, a movement that makes it simply a good war movie, not a classic. Woody Allen's screenplan for CELEBRITY is an elaborated doodle. Other critics raving over PULP FICTION verges on the disgusting for the movie nourishes, abets, cultural slumming. It is the overkill of escapism.But my favorite take down (and worth the price of the volume) is his total destruction of Neil Jordan's THE END OF THE AFFAIR. Kauffmann perhaps has no greater literary hero than Graham Greene and he is distraught over Jordan's treatment of Greene's famous novel about spiritual pilgrimage. The way that Greene indicates this to include two understated miracles. The first is a birthmark on the rationalist preacher that disappears when Sarah dies. The second is that it is revealed that Sarah was a real Catholic being secretly baptized at birth \\"only she didn't know it.\\" With the first miracle, Jordan transfers the mark to the son of the private detective. The mark disappears after Sarah kisses his face.Kauffmann observes that the battle between rationalism and divinity is thus deleted. There is no victory for God. The second miracle is absent. The removal of the spiritual transcendence matches the removal of all tension. No one cares in the end. Kauffmann sums things up, \\"Jordan's screenplay is not an adaptation, it is a devastation. It's so drastic that we are left puzzled as to why Jordan, who also directed, wanted to adapt the novel at all if he was going to violate it this way. Greene's book is a work of art about religion, set amid involvements of the most banal kind. If Jordan felt obligated to squeeze and distort--almost to apologize--for the religious theme, why bother with the book?\\" Mature, intelligent criticism."},{"Title":"Regarding Film: Criticism and Comment (PAJ Books)","review":"It is with reluctance and of course some pleasure that I approach a review of a book by a film critic, being a film critic myself. I am not however anywhere near as knowledgeable about film as is Stanley Kaufmann nor am I as fancy with the wordsmithing. What I do well in a haphazard way is react to film as character and story with some reasonable awareness of the politics and the culture of the production. Professor Kaufmann on the other hand is deeply learned about all things cinema.Regarding Film is a collection of reviews written mostly for The New Republic during the 1990s along with some other pieces from the Yale Review that he calls \\"Comments,\\" and some movie book reviews. His acidic and sometimes pompous comments can be delightful and insightful, if one agrees with him, or dreary and dreadful and even tedious if one does not. A case in point is his critique of Oliver Stone's Nixon (1996) in which he chirps enthusiastically about Anthony Hopkins's performance while slyly denigrating what I think is one of Stone's finest works. Kaufmann writes, \\"...despite Stone's mercurial gifts, the film does not become an artistic whole; it remains an examination of characteristics.\\" He adds, \\"What's missing is what Stone's best films have had: a subtext, a large theme evoked by the action on the screen.\\" Without such a subtext, Kaufmann concludes, the film is \\"not much more than the series of events presented--thus, in any deep sense, purposeless.\\" (p. 54)It is good for a movie critic to read a somewhat dismissive review of a film that he the critic found outstanding, because now the critic knows how some readers of his reviews might feel when he disses one of their favs. But what I found annoying here is that in an addendum written a couple of weeks later, Kaufmann tells us that \\"Another visit to Nixon confirmed my admiration for it as filmmaking...\\" Well, what is it? I guess it's a \\"purposeless\\" exercise in admirable filmmaking! Personally I thought the examination of Nixon the man as opposed to Nixon the politician or Nixon the leader of the free world, was a fine subtext, if you will, with a clear purpose, allowing us to see how Nixon's personality shaped his governance.More to my liking is Kaufmann's review of Adrian Lyne's Lolita (1998), in which he notes that Lyne's film is truer to the novel than the celebrated Kubrick film from 1962, but not necessarily a better film, and in which he does a nice job of critiquing Jeremy Irons's interesting but melancholy performance. I also liked his review of Shakespeare in Love (1998) and the peripheral knowledge he brought to the review. Also excellent, insightful and interesting to read is his review of The Truman Show (1998). Most of the reviews are in fact interesting to read regardless of how one might feel about his proclivities or analyses.The most striking disagreement I have with Kaufmann concerns his review of Stanley Kubrick's last film Eyes Wide Shut (1999). I don't think Kaufmann understood the film and I was offended by the eagerness with which he disparages the work of a great artist. Kaufmann even gives us, in a long preamble to the actual review, the apparent reasons for his inability to appreciate what Kubrick was trying to do in his later years. Kaufmann implies simultaneously that he had a falling out with Kubrick over (1) Kaufmann's negative reviews of Kubrick's later films, and/or (2) because Kubrick disappointed Kaufmann on two occasions by not agreeing to some professional invitation that Kaufmann had extended. I find it surprising that Kaufmann could be so blatantly transparent, but maybe I should appreciate his candor.I was also not pleased with his review of American Beauty (1999). I don't think he understood this film either. He calls it a \\"supposedly realistic film\\" (p. 149), but it is not. It is a satire, almost a burlesque, and a very funny one at that. However if a viewer thinks (as did many viewers from middle America who also did not like the film) that it is some kind of attempted realism, then perhaps none of it is very funny.Curiously this book does not list the films reviewed in a table of contents. The titles appear in an index, but the reader is forced to flip through the book to see which titles are actually reviewed and which are merely mentioned.Kaufmann's erudition is not to be questioned. His scholar's knowledge of film is admirable and helps to make his reviews very much worthwhile; but his strength as a film critic may be in his understanding and appreciation of actors. I may find fault with his interpretation of a film or his appreciation of a director's artistry, but seldom do I differ with his discernment about the skill and the effort of the actors. As Shakespeare was an actor's writer, Kaufmann is an actor's critic--well, a good actor's critic. He can be quite short with what he sees as a sub par performance."},{"Title":"Addresses on the Gospel of Luke","review":"I was very pleased to receive this book as described. I always value H.A.

The reviewer did not like the DHCP Handbook, and preferred an O'Reilly book on DHCP for Windows 2000. I haven't read the O'Reilly book, so I can't really comment on its content, but I am guessing that if you are a Windows 2000 administrator, it's quite good.The Microsoft DHCP server addresses a fairly narrow marketplace, and lacks some features that are present in the leading commercial and non-commercial DHCP servers. The DHCP Handbook provides some coverage of the Microsoft DHCP server, but does not specialize on the Microsoft product, so it is undoubtedly much less complete from that particular perspective - instead, the DHCP Handbook tries to provide general coverage of the DHCP protocol in a way that will be useful across a broad range of DHCP servers.So if, for example, you want a detailed presentation on the DHCP failover protocol, particularly on how to administer it, you will probably have to find it in the DHCP Handbook. Also, there is some good coverage of DNS updates. And of course there is some very detailed coverage of the ISC DHCP server, which a Windows 2000 DHCP administrator will probably find useless, but a Linux administrator might consider helpful.If all else fails, it's fairly thick, and might be useful in propping up your desk table if the floors in your office aren't level. :')BTW, I gave the book four stars, because I think it covers the material well and is more complete than any competing book. I do not claim that our prose is the best, although any failings in that regard are probably mine and not Ralph's. As one of the authors I am obviously biased, so please take this rating with a grain of salt.I am also the author of the ISC DHCP server and a developer on a team at Nominum that has produced an excellent commercial DHCP server, so my views on the Microsoft server may not be entirely accurate and should also be taken with a grain of salt - in particular, I have not played with the server that comes with WinXP server which, for all I know, dances circles around my paltry offerings."},{"Title":"The DHCP Handbook (2nd Edition)","review":"If you have to design, configure, and manage a complex DHCP environment, this book is an outstanding resource. I've used the first edition (first printing ;-) for years, and am in the process of purchasing the second edition.In that time I've configured or set configuration standards for dozens of DHCP servers running the ISC DHCP server and dozens more managed by Lucent's VitalQIP DHCP service. I have not personally configured or managed a Microsoft DHCP server, but I've walked many consultants through setting up DHCP servers from Microsoft, Cisco, Linksys, etc.The value of this book is its depth. Protocols, design considerations, conditional leases, client identification, authentication, failover, client issues, OS considerations, Dynamic DNS integration, migration between static and dynamic environments, and just about everything else you'll run into are well covered.The authors are actively involved in the development of DHCP standards and the ISC DHCP reference implementation, so it's difficult to find a more authoritative source. If you can't find your answer in the book, the authors are active on the DHCP mailing lists (http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sw/dhcp/dhcp-lists.php).The wealth of information can be intimidating at first, but if you're dealing with a non-trivial environment it's worth it."},{"Title":"The DHCP Handbook (2nd Edition)","review":"The book is organized well, has an excellent index and provides detailed information from basic concepts through to advanced configurations, diagnostics and troubleshooting.

The author discusses Conrad's personal background as it relates to the story, and the characters, themes, plot elements, the social and cultural views and philosophy of the author, and many other aspects of the book in an easy to understand way.Conrad is one of the few novelists, which include Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevski, Lawrence Stern, and Jonathan Swift, whose work continues to impress me and has aged well as I've moved into my more mature years. Partly this is because of the dark themes he treats, such as the violence and cruelty and savagery lurking just below the thin veneer of civilization, the brooding and melancholy power of his prose, and partly because English wasn't even his native language--he even learned it as an adult on shipboard.Heart of Darkness is one Conrad's shortest but greatest works in this sense, and after having read it in high school, I recently reacquainted myself with it after 30 years. I was just as impressed as I was back then. Most readers and movie fans will know the story's influence on Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" which is many ways a tribute to the Conrad book. This is a great book by one of history's greatest authors whose themes continue to resonate today. All an observant and intelligent individual has to do today to realize that Conrad was right about man's innermost nature and that we have not progressed at all in the last 10,000 years of \\"civilized history\\" is to look at the current sad state of the world and of humanity in general."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Conrad's Heart of Darkness & The Secret Sharer","review":"This is a well written study guide to one of the greatest novels ever written.

In short, it means a good time.A couple of days spent reading this book means you will certainly lose a few brain cells thanks to the mindless plot and poor dialogue.The book sells itself as a fun, summer-type of read that details what happens when two couples head the Provincetown for a week of fun. During the first few obligatory \\"road trip\\" chapters, I think the foursome must deal with a flat tire, but the writing is so bland I cannot be sure.Once they hit Provincetown, the women begin drinking, arguing, flirting and drinking some more. Here's where the terrible dialogue hits its full stride. Every character speaks in the same voice, a voice that requires constant use of the phrase \\"you guys\\" (when referring to each other) and lots of (!!!!!!) exclamation points to make up for a lack of anything worth exclaiming over.Toward the end there is a drawn-out \\"mystery\\" plot about what happened to the group's supposedly-straight friend. I'm sure this storyline was needed because, like most people, I definitely start freaking out if a friend of mine disappears for a few hours while ON VACATION. Ludicrous.I couldn't actually bring myself to finish the book, it was that bad. Maybe the last 30 or so pages are brilliant, but I'm doubtful.I almost bought this book during a recent trip to Provincetown. Thankfully my girlfriend, who is not so prone to impulse-buying, read the first page and wisely cautioned me against it. I checked it out from the library instead. If you absolutely must read this book for some reason, I recommend doing the same. Save your $16.10 instead for dinner at Tofu-A-Go-Go, one of my favorite restaurants in Ptown.For a compelling, intelligent read, check out &quot;Light, Coming Back&quot; by Ann Wadsworth, or &quot;Fingersmith&quot; by Sarah Waters.If you need a dose of Provincetown during these cold winter months, read &quot;The Men From the Boys&quot; by William Mann or &quot;Land's End: A Walk in Provincetown&quot; by Michael Cunningham.&quot;The Big House: A Century of Life in an American Summer Home&quot; by George Howe Colt, is an outstanding nonfiction book about an old home on Cape Cod."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"I don't like to write bad reviews especially considering this is probably Ms. Stocker's passion but I would not suggest purchasing this book.After spending many a vacation in P-Town I was really looking forward to this read, but instead found a predictable drawn out storyline. The story revolved around having a drink every waking moment, constant cattiness, predictable hookups, and boring conversations. This may sound like interesting drama, but it wasn't. If it is at all possible to make drama drab, this book has accomplished such a thing. It just didn't seem real in any sense and that was not a good thing.Bottom line, I would not recommend buying this book. It's not as fun as you think it should/could be."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"Even a heterosexual should not waste their time on this book. The conversations are trite.These so called relationships are a farce.Was this book written by a lesbian or someone claiming to know anything about people of either gender? Read any book by RADCLYFFE and you will know about true lesbians."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"I was disappointed. The cover suggested a narrative of 4 mature, chic lesbians who mirror life, its challenges and its inherent fun. Instead I met 4 pre adolescents who lack depth of character and sincerity. So does the writing style of Ms. Stocker. This is a train wreck of a novel where words crash against each other and leave the passengers (in this case the reader)with weary eyes. I always hope for good quality writing when picking up a novel about lesbian life but this certainly does not even come close."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"Picked up &quot;P-TOWN SUMMER&quot; on a lark.

The descriptions of Providence are certainly full but the plot and characters get repetitive very quickly. I never got invested enough to care about Claire and Rita or Kit and Sabi to wonder if someone might cheat or with whom. I also didn't care much when their straight friend Diane experiences some orientation confusion. Everything in this story just seemed to be surface level with minor attempts to dig deeper that just are not enough to keep me interested."},{"Title":"P-Town Summer","review":"It was interesting to read this novel as a heterosexual. It represents the difficulties of all relationships, not just in the lesbian genre. The main characters are wonderfully written and I feel like they behold similarities to people in my life!

If there were only one AS/400 sys admin book you could own, this would be the one! Two years ago I was thrown into the fires of AS/400 System administration. This book was the water I needed to put out those fires and become a proactive system administrator. It sits on the corner of my desk and I still reference it all the time. The &quot;Primer&quot; explains the situation in simple enough terms that a beginner will become excited about setting up and working with the AS/400. Then it will take you to the next level so that you can become a proactive administrator rather than a reactive one. I have recommend the \\"Primer\\" to friends that are seasoned administrators and they reference it all the time too. I just can't say enough about this book."},{"Title":"Lost and Forgotten: A Visual Documentary of Bethlehem Steel","review":"I visited a book store in Bethlehem to take a look at this new book of photographs. As an amateur photographer who can recognize incredibly compelling subject material, but who is stymied by a 6 foot chain link fence around the entire Bethlehem Steel Property, I looked forward to this work with great interest. In a few words, I was disappointed and almost embarassed.The decaying remains of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Bethlehem Pennsylvania literally scream out for a black and white treatment, but of course, this is strictly bias on the writer's part. Passmore's choice of color is the photographer's creative decision, and must be respected as such.What I find most difficult to respect is the incredibly poor quality of the images and printing in general. Picture, if you will, a low quality middle school year book for a fair comparison.I suppose that if I followed my mother's maxim of not saying anything if I didn't have anything nice to say, I wouldn't have posted a negative review. Nevertheless, I felt compelled to give voice to my concerns.I sincerely hope that a competent photographer gets a chance to document this important passage. Bethlehem Steel was the heart and soul of thousands of hardworking Americans for several generations. Their legacy deserves better.In it's day, Bethlehem Steel had an exceptional photography department. It's safe to say that any of the Beth Steel photographers could have produced images worthy of several books. The only thing standing in the way of a proper documentation of the passing of this great industrial engine is age and tears.JohnBethlehem, PA"},{"Title":"Lost and Forgotten: A Visual Documentary of Bethlehem Steel","review":"This book by far contains the poorest quality photography I have ever seen printed in a \\"book.\\" Many images are overexposed and pixelated making this author and publisher duo nothing short of a hack team.

Just search the word on Amazon or try these books: Ruins by Michel Makarius and In Ruins: A Journey Through History, Art, and Literature . Images are typically created as to be atmospheric, and as such there are necessarily stylizations that some might think are distortions. That is definitely true here. The colors are intense but dark.This is a book for those who like big rusty machines and gloomy, empty machine shops. The past life of the mill haunts the pictures but is not the focus. It's all got a strange grandeur like looking at the ruins of ancient Greece and Rome, even though the plant only shut down 15 years ago.Before buying this book a customer should realize that the trim size is relatively small and the paper is not the usual heavy, glossy stock of art books but is more like high-quality printer paper. I applaud the photographer for finding a way to get his work out at an affordable price. I wish more photographers would publish a first book this way.I encourage the reader to visit the photographer's website at [...] There you will find numerous shots of the mill as well as some of his Gothic stylings.

Dr. Tart surveyed 150 users, most of them from California, back in 1970 or so. He clearly documents the most characteristic and common effects of the drug, providing clear, scientific evidence explained in an accessible way. He makes the emotional, perceptual, and social effects of the drug very clear, and makes reference to related material in the consciousness literature. The book also gives a great feel for its era. Questions concerning ESP, social 'games' and 'hang-ups', etc. give the reader a great feel for the counterculture of the late 60s and early 70s. A real find.

Look for yourself. Very few of the references are more recent than 1968-1970. If you are interested in marijuana smokers' personal experience or perceptions in the 1960's, this book is for you.It reflects opinions from the 1960's, not now. Remember though that personal testimony does not prove that the effects came from marijuana. So many other factors could have affected a users perceptions and experience. On the positive side, although it is not a scientific study,it provides good qualitative information from users at that time."},{"Title":"A Dollar the Hard Way: Growing Up in Tough Times in the Ozark Foothills","review":"This book is wonderful.

I should have looked elsewhere for reviews. This book is absolutely unreadable. The author jumps from topic to topic and then back that it makes my head spin. He refers to future chapters, future concepts, and external resources to distraction.Specifically, in the midst of discussing simple element constructions, Mr. Bradley includes a paragraph describing television stations in the UK that has no relevance to the examples given. I'm sure he's proud of his heritage and his expertise on television in England, but what does it have to do with XML Schemas or the current example????????I suspect that Mr. Bradley is a college professor. If he is, he should be forced to sit through recordings of his own lectures. Maybe that would cure him of his unbearable writing style.."},{"Title":"The XML Schema Companion","review":"You probably know that XML is descended from SGML, and it thus inherited DTDs, which were then the only means of specifying a document model. That proved adequate for SGML, but its limitations soon became clear in XML. Several alternatives were proposed, but XML Schema seems to be winning. Thus Bradley has delivered a timely exposition. He covers all the features clearly. A brief mention is made of its competitors, Relax NG and Schematron. But they do seem to be fading fast.The most interesting part of Bradley's text are the chapters on namespaces. Other aspects of Schema are lower level and, while useful, are frankly mundane. By contrast, namespaces are the critical feature of Schema. They let you build on pre-existing schemas that have been published on the web. And you can publish your schemas so that others might benefit. You and those in your field or industry can cooperatively derive a net gain by agreeing and publishing standard definitions. A Network effect.I assume that you are familiar with HTML. In that, the crucial element are the hyperlinks (the href and src attributes in certain tags). It is these that put the &quot;H&quot; in HTML. Without them, HTML just becomes a limited page markup language. It is that ability to link to arbitrary locations on the Internet which produced the Web. Likewise, in the much heralded Web Services, these exchange data via XML. Which in turn depends on XML Schema to build consistent hyperlinked semantics.You should read Bradley's chapters on namespaces thoroughly."},{"Title":"The XML Schema Companion","review":"I found this book is hard to follow for a beginner. Before one topic is fully explained, it jump to another, and then the topic will be repeated a few chapters later. I tried a few times to read it from beginning, but each time failed to continue after some pages. Is the XML schema itself too complicated or it's the problem of the book's organization?"},{"Title":"The XML Schema Companion","review":"This is a solid reference work on XML Schema. I wouldn't go looking to it for advice on how to solve particular problems with XML Schema. But if you are looking for a quick reference guide that covers all of the syntax with annotated examples then you have come to the right place. The graphics, which are light-weight and to the point help to illustrate the key points.Two minor complaints are that the structure of the book is odd (chapters at the end of the book which are clearly appendices are structured as chapters), and the index is also a little short.On the positive note, XML schema is not a particularly exciting topic and Neil's tone keeps it a light and interesting read.So far this is the best book I have read on the subject."},{"Title":"The XML Schema Companion","review":"Neil Bradley in his fourth book tells you everything you would ever want to know about XML Schemas or better knows as XSD for XML Schema Definition. With the popularity that various XML technologies are attracting these days, every developer, architect and designer needs to know what XML Schema is and how it used. This topic is covered in many other books, but Bradley's book has by far the most extensive, comprehensive and thorough coverage of the topic. It shows that author truly understand the topic at hand, and can convey the message clearly to the reader. The organization of the book starts with the author explaining how the XML Schema standard defines a template that documents created based on that template must conform to, followed by showing the reader how to define reusable data blocks based on the XML Schema language, and it finishes with XML Schema related topic such as namespaces and a rather complete overview what's out there and where to get more information.Schemas are in a whole different category all by themselves. Every XML document, standard, protocol - basically anything that has anything to do with XML needs to use or to interact with XML Schema in one or another. XML Schemas are used to model both data and narrative XML documents, which means that if you are ever planning on interacting with XML, you better understand XML schemas. I thought that this topic will be very easy, and there is nothing to it... I was wrong. There is a whole lot to cover and once you read Bradley's book you'll know what I am talking about. The standard for schemas is so extensive, that the first few chapters of his book are spent on what the different terminologies mean and how they interrelate. For example, the difference between narrative data (data where the sequence of events and representation matters greatly) and datacenteric documents (order of presenting the data does not matter), and the difference between the schema definition author (the person who creates the schemas) versus the document instance author (people who create well-formed documents) and many others alike. After talking about the basics, the author spends a great deal of time explaining the various components of the XML schema such as elements, attributes, simple data type, complex data types, etc... Understanding these topics is essential in reading the following chapters of the book.The author uses the same examples throughout the end, so the reader can follow the text and actually understand the topic while the author is presenting it. The code samples are just great. Since the topic is rather abstract, the author had spent a great deal of time using examples to demonstrate the topic at hand better. There were times that I read the example first, and then I went back to read the text, because the visualization is the key in this topic. As with any programming or technical book, the topic and examples start simple and they get much harder as you read the book. The same goes with this book, but the interesting thing is that if you don't know enough about namespaces, the author sends you off to one of the accompanying chapters to read to get ready. The chances are that you don't know enough about namespaces, and the \\"reference\\" topics included towards the end of the book become very valuable as you read this book. I thought that I knew namespaces rather well until I read the following:\\"... namespaces do not exist as physical entities. There is no namespace definition markup language and no namespace file, object, or interface. ... namespaces are just a concept. This fact alone has led to much unnecessary confusion...\\"In all the books and all the articles and the press and ... that I have read on XML, this little but rather important concept was left out. In one chapter the author has shed more light on a topic of namespaces than an entire book that one would find on the topic. The moral of the story is to read this book cover-to-cover. Even if you think you know it all, still spend the time to read this book. I was amazed at how complicated XML Schemas could get and how powerful they really are.Some of the advanced topics covered include inheritance and pattern recognition. Both topics are very well explained and covered well. If you know regular expression from Perl, then pattern recognition in schema world would look very familiar to you. The same regular expression rules that are covered in Perl, govern the patterns matching in XML Schemas. What the author adds is concrete examples of how this technique can be used to build powerful schemas. Inheritance is another interesting topic in schemas, as inheritance has made XML schemas very object oriented. Some of your favorite concepts in Java map directly into schemas, and the author actually made table cross referencing the various \\"key phrases\\" in Java versus XML Schemas. If you are coming from the OO world of C++ or Java, take a look at this table first. If you are at all familiar with the Eiffel language, you would have a greater appreciation for some of the features of XML Schemas such as the ability to redefine an element or to extend specific parts of a schema.In closing, if you think you know XML Schema's, think again. This book covers the topic in detail and does so very well. I would recommend this book to be read by any schema designer or a valuable reference for anyone interface with any XML technology."},{"Title":"Know Your Own I.Q.","review":"This was the first book, as far as I know, that allowed a layman to test and know his own I.Q. Written by the famous British psychologist, who worked in both the clinical psychology and personality and intelligence testing areas, it contains a series of tests that you can administer yourself to find out your own I.Q.The tests are what's known as multi-factor or omnibus tests in that your average score is comprised of the results of three subtests, which is a now familiar strategy for designing I.Q. tests. Most tests examine verbal, mathematical, and spatial abilities, and this one does too, using vocabulary, number series, and spatial matching of figures to test these abilities. Number series are regarded especially as a good culture-free way to get at mathematical intelligence, which is good, since the vocabulary area is so socio-economically influenced.That having been said, ironically, it has been shown that the most elaborate I.Q. test is only about 10-15% more accurate than a simple, forty-item, 20-30 minute vocabulary test. Why this is isn't that hard to fathom. Since language is the tool for thought, a command of one's language is a good proxy for one's level of cognitive sophistication in at least linguistic terms, and perhaps for intelligence, also. However, many psychologists aren't comfortable basing decisions on the results of a one-factor test. (Although verbal analogies are similarly good and would work pretty well too, and those tests can be made with very high ceilings, as well. One of them, the MAT, or Miller Analogies Test, is used to test graduate applicants).After I got this book, it was a few years before I saw another self-scoring I.Q. test, this one with a blue and white cover that I recall seeing at many bookstores back in the 70s. I thought this was a pretty good test too, and it had a fairly high ceiling, going up to 150 or so. I noticed there are a number of these out now, and there are even websites offering tests that you can take for a small fee, but this book started this mini-trend or was nevertheless the first.The book also contains 10 of these tests, so you can take all of them and average your scores together to get a more accurate number. I noticed I did do much better, by 10 or 15 points, on several of these than on the others, so they perhaps vary in difficulty somewhat.There's also a fine introduction by Eysenck on the history and theory of I.Q. testing that I enjoyed, although this area was an interest of mine in grad school (although I was mainly a neurobiologist), but someone not knowing anything about the field will learn a lot from it.I also have to pass on a funny quote from Eysenck. He was a speaker at a psychological conference once, and one of the seminars was on human s_xuality. I think this was back in the 70s. Anyway, mast_rbation was one of the topics that came up, and Eysenck said that he didn't know why it was such a maligned practice, as it enabled you to meet a better class of girls that way. :-)Overall, a fine book by an eminent psychologist that is now probably a classic in its field and worth picking up if you can find a used copy."},{"Title":"Know Your Own I.Q.","review":"This is an excellent work which provides some rough data onpersonal IQ measurement.

From the opening page to its abrupt conclusion, this novel is packed with scandal, infidelity and betrayal, all of the classic elements of a daytime soap opera but rarely seen as expertly crafted in black fiction.For these women, Lee, Barbara, Jolene, Pearl and Candice, their problems resolve around race and money.

County, however, racial identity and acceptance are just a backdrop to the core troublemaker, money.As the quote goes, \\"when money is seen as a solution for every problem, money itself becomes the problem,\\" by Richard Needham. From the enormous house, elaborate weddings, and expensive shopping tastes, the women in P.G. County raise excess to new heights. For most of the women in this story, money is used to console them, rather than working on resolving the relationship and self-identity issues they have. One of the relationships on the brink of ruin from the beginning of the story is Barbara and Bradford's.At times, the reader is led to hope for the couple believing the adage, \\"a successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person,\\" by Mignon McLaughlin. When Bradford makes an effort to rekindle his love with his wife, you almost believe their marriage and lives will turn around, but that wouldn't make a good soap opera, now would it?Mary J. Blige recently had a hit song called, \\"No More Drama,\\" with the Young & the Restless Soap Opera music playing in the background. If you're like me and have enough drama in your life, so you're trying to follow Ms. Blige's example, than I would stray away from this episode of \\"Days of Our Black Lives.\\" But, if you want some mindless fun, then travel on down to P.G. County and meet five ladies that will make you hope your friends are different and grateful if they are."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I read the books out of order. I read the sequel \\"Cant Get Enough\\" first. I must admit \\"Can't Get Enough\\" is much better.Barbara Bently is married to the worse kind of philanderer, Bradford Bentley. He can't seem to keep his extra marital affairs a secret. He doesn't seem to care how his affairs have embarrassed Barbara and their daughters. They are one of the wealthiest couples in the neighborhood. It's evident that money isn't the root of happiness but is (in the book) the root of all evil. After many years of marriage and dealing with his extra marital affairs, she still sticks around.Jolene is a very materialistic home-wrecker who is trying very hard to pretend to live a certain lifestyle just to impress her neighbors and family (mother and father). She doesn't care who she hurts, including her loving husband Patrick, to get what she wants. Jolene wants wealthy social elite. It doesn't matter who he is, just as long as he's rich and can afford the lavish lifestyle that she wants to have. In desperation, she tries to lure Bradford Bently in. She throws a huge house-warming party at her new million dollar home to impress her neighbors. She wants this party to be the party that everyone will remember and talk about for months. IT WILL BE!!!! All the things that she has done in the dark will come to light at this party.Pearl is the single mother and awesome cook/baker who own a beauty shop. She isn't comfortable with her son, Kenyatta, dating out side of his race. After a lot of convincing she tries to accept Kenyatta's girlfriend (Candice's daughter) but still isn't comfortable with their relationship. Patrick (Jolene's husband) is helping with a political campaign and decides to ask Pearl to bake one of her famous cakes for the campaign celebration. The attraction between the two of them is too strong to ignore.Candice is a mother of two teenage girls. One of her daughters is dating Pearl's son, Kenyatta. Candice has problems with her daughter dating outside their race. She soon realizes and appears traumatized to know that she and Kenyatta aren't much different at all.I am a life long Marylander and am very familiar with P.G. County. The book was entertaining. I must agree with some of the other reviews, the ending was rather rushed."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Excellent! Bravo! Well worth the wait for Connie Briscoe's return. With the introduction of the Bentley's(aptly titled) Jolene, Patrick, Candace(who really added nothing to the story), Lee, and Pearl, we are introduced to P. G. County, an affluent all Black suburb. The characters were lost in status and power measuring themselves against the stick of the Joneses...whose got the biggest Mercedes, the biggest house, and the best husband. It was a fast intriguing ride. This book comes with a guarantee that there is something for everyone in this story. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Initially I got into the book and began to enjoy it. HOwever, my stomach and enjoyment of the book began to take a serious nosedive as the character of Candice began to be revealed. All enjoyment of the storyline was removed once Candice found out one of her ancestors was black. The fact that she suddenly considered herself to be a black woman was beyond comprehension. I cannot fathom what Briscoe was doing in writing such a thing or where she felt that this was going. It is one thing to acknowledge that there was once a one drop rule, but to take it to this extent in a book written by a black woman no less was pretty disconcerting. Perhaps there is something deeper here that I am missing. I really hope so. Overall I would say the book was lacking in depth. It is one of those books that you might take along on vacation when you know you want something light to read, but not something heavy that is going to require lots of thought and analysis. Perhaps others will enjoy the soap opera style writing, but I did not."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I read a few of the comments before I set out to write my own, I see most people were like me in thinking...girlfriend must have needed to pay some bills with this one.You have got to be kidding me, a brother who wears dreadlocks, mother works in a majority black beauty shop come into his house, finds his, let me say this again,his black mother kissing a man and he says \\"she was necking\\" stop it, just stop the madness. What brother ya'll know calls kissing necking. (let me know)and let's not forget the white woman who finds out that her great great great grandfather was passing now, her mom and dad are both white, the father is a red neck kkk member (she didn't mention it in the book but you can tell), and she's tripping because she finds out she is black!!!!! Yo girl friend was tripping, you ain't black you are a white, white woman. \\"stop calling her that she's black\\" the woman yells. Not even! You can go to Barnes and Noble just to read that part of the book but I repeat just to read this part.I admire people who take the time to perfect their craft, I myself would like to enjoy the comments my reader will make when I write my first novel. However, If I ever write a book like this ya'll better holla at me. Pull my coat tails. do something to stop me.I read Big Girls Don't Cry and was won over. I read this book and could'nt wait to call my friend all the way in Chicago and tell her not to buy, or even read this book. (I live in New York)Come on Connie this book was like reading a Danielle Steel book and saying I will never do that again."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"This review is for the One World Paperback edition, September 2003, 324 pages. Two novels by Connie Briscoe, SISTERS & LOVERS (1995) and BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY (1996), made the USA Today top 150 best selling list, peaking at position 20 and 85, respectively. P.G. COUNTY however, didn't make it.P.G. COUNTY is set in Silver Lake, Maryland, a wealthy, predominately black community. The story is about blatant materialism, single women raising children from philandering ex-husbands, the \\"one drop rule,\\" torrid extramarital affairs and a redeemed hooker. Racy issues perhaps, but the plot and subplots, as delivered, are plastic and stereotyped.The writing in P.G. COUNTY is disappointing - very long on tell and skimpy on show. The author describes what her characters are thinking and feeling rather than let them speak and act for themselves. When they do speak, except for the young adult slang, the dialogue is stiff and lifeless. Even in scenes of high emotion, the author has to tell us how her characters feel because they speak like bad actors reading a lousy script."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. First of all, too much time was spent writing about people/things that you would never hear about again after the first few chapters (i.e. Terrence, Sabrina, Rebecca, etc.). Granted the author was setting the scene, but this book was not worth it. I couldn't relate to the characters in any way except for Pearl and Patrick. They seemed like the only normal and down to earth characters written. This book is an example of how the highest people up (even African Americans) have more problems/self esteem issues than people who don't live lavish lives. Barbara Bentley, an extremely passive woman when it came to her husband Bradford \\"The Rich Dog\\" Bentley, as I call him. There is no way I would have allowed him to continue to do the things that he did. Please don't say that she stayed for the money because as much dirt that she had on Bradford, she would have ended up with the house, a car, a resort/vacation home, and spousal or alimony support all at the voluntary expense of Bradford just to avoid humility. Jolene was a straight up you know what! This is a woman who would go to great lengths to live the life she never had, so she thought. Let me run across a man like Patrick, and he wouldn't have even thought about looking at Pearl. Although I did like that they hooked up, so I think.This book was so open ended that you don't know what happened to whom. It better be a sequel to this book, but unfortunately I not that interested in reading it.The only reason I read this was for a book club meeting. Being as though I live in P.G. County, it made me questions the author's motive. To me the book was written from a condescending point of view of people who live in P.G. County a.k.a. \\"inside the beltway\\" as she would put it. It's funny because even people who live in P.G. County don't refer to it in those terms, but then again maybe they do just not from the outside of the gated communities.** A note to all readers...This is a message from the avid readers association, DO NOT waste your time, unless you have time to kill and a book with no ending!**"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"This book is definitely a page-turner, and it gets your attention, but not in a good way. The author sensationalizes shallow, tawdry behavior in this tale of affluent Black folks who are little more than social climbers and adulterers. When I was a broke college student, books like this provided a break from my bleak reality. Now that I'm out of school, a litle older and a lot wiser, I find little value in books like this. Vapid plots, superficial characters and wildly unrealistic situations just don't do it for me anymore.I was looking for a trashy summer beach read, and this is definitely that book. If you're expecting anything more you will be quite disappointed."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"P.G. County initially engaged me -- I was looking for a quick read, nothing too heavy. About two-thirds of the way into the book, I was disappointed, but still hooked by Jolene's antics, so I pushed on! The Candice and Lee storylines added little to the story and the conclusion seemed abrupt. I'm glad I checked this book out from the library rather than purchasing it. Jolene was too funny, so one dimensional, but I couldn't stop laughing at her antics to get the right man, the right house, the right life. I'd recommend this as a read only when someone has exhausted all of the &quot;must reads&quot; stacked on the your home bookshelves -- or if you stumble across it at your public library!! Don't buy it!!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I have read all the other reviews that were listed here and I must say I agree with those who enjoyed the book. Was it different from all the others Connie wrote? Yes, but it was still a good book. I know we all like to read about the urban life and the \\"hood\\", but it is sometimes good to get away from all that and see our people in a different light. We are not only limited to living in the projects and the Ghetto. I think this book did a wonderful job at exploring the different aspects of us black folks. I also like how the author not only portrayed these characters as \\"ghetto fab\\" but make it certain to show her readers that problems and drama still arises no matter where your economic level may lay or the color of your skin. Truth be known I thought this was a very enjoyable book(and don't get me wrong I love my the coldest winter ever's, true to the Games, Friend & lovers.. just to name a few) but I thought this book was a great change, by far did it not take you out of character for blacks folks, I think the setting was just different. If you want have a few laughs,& to say a few curse words... I say read this book, its worth it."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"What a fun and drama filled read. I enjoyed reading about the ladies and their families of PG County.Barbara really begin to get on my last nerve early on because she allowed Bradford to control her happiness. Player, Player..right under her nose.Jolene tramp of the town. I figured out early on who fathered Lee. Pearl strived to grow her business while dealing with her son's new girlfriend. Candice is the white liberal who learns about her family tree.This book is filled with never ending drama. This is one that is sure to please and keep readers talking about PG County after the close of the last page.Best Wishes and Blessings to Connie."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I am a big Connie Briscoe fan (having read all her other work), but I was hugely disappointed with this one. I found the story line predictable, the characters not well-defined and unbelievable and the whole thing not worthy of Connie's talents or my time.I took it on vacation, read it in 2 days and was forced to find a Sue Grafton book in a public library to wipe its taste from my mouth. Sorry, Connie, but this one didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I have read all of Connie Biscoe's books. They were getting better and better and then came P. G. County. I hated the book. It had no &quot;meat&quot; to it. To me, it was not a story. It was a book of chapters of people. Out of all the characters, not one, who could be considered a strong Black woman or a strong Black man. When I finished the book, my question was &quot;....and.&quot; I believe P.G. County was a great disappointment to Connie Biscoe fan club, &quot;ME&quot;."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Although this book reads along well and has all the required plot elements, the some of the characters are not believable.I have met woman like Pearl and girls like Lee. Maybe even a toned down version of Jolene. But Barbara? And Candice? A black woman that overlooks what happens in her own bed? A white woman who lives and works with black people and then reacts as if she was from a small town in Idaho when she encounters them closer than she anticipated? In the author's words, &quot;Puh-leez.&quot;"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I was sadly disapointed in PG County by Connie Briscoe. I waited so long for her new book to come out. I had been reading excerpts on the book before the book actually came out. Ms. Briscoe, PLEASE. This was a nice attempt to come off as Dynasty, but it was also far fetched and her characters were totally unbelievable. They didn't even sound real. I like to read books that I can picture this story happening to me. I could not do that at all with PG County. And the sad part about the book is that even I could have written it. And I don't know the first thing about writing. I am a strong Connie Briscoe fan, but I think she needs to go back to the writing board with this one.One Disapointed Reader!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I cannot begin to tell you how many times the people in P.G. County &quot;scoffed.&quot; Briscoe or her editor should have used a thesaurus. This word had to literally appear on nearly ever page. After having read &quot;scoffed,&quot; for the fifth time, all times after that, I jerked because it was just getting on my nerves.Peyton Place and The Return of Peyton Place are classical stories written in the 60s and there is no story that can compare to it. Peyton Place, although, can be credited for such successful night time soaps such as &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; &quot;Falcon Crest,&quot; and &quot;Dynasty.&quot;P.G. County is just another drama filled story of not so &quot;every-day&quot; black folks. I thought the story was written nicely, and naturally, as with any novel, it has it's boring moments and starts out slow because the reader has to get to know the characters. It takes some time to get to know characters in books, unlike a movie, you can get to know them immediately. The end was somewhat outrageous. It seemed like the author wanted to bring closure on everything in her ending chapter which made it look &quot;rushed along.&quot; Actually, she should have brought closure about Candice during the moment when she called her family meeting. Barbara should have bought closure to her situation when she first suspected Jolene. The only situation that should have taken place in the last chapter should have been Lee's discovery of her dad. There were really no true &quot;heroins&quot; in the book. This is good because it lets you know that a sequel will follow.Overall, the story was written from a &quot;white&quot; perspective (i.e, &quot;wanna-be-white&quot;). Face it. Even highly successful black folks still talk and entertain in black fashion---not white."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I found Connie Briscoe's P.G. County to be a wild, outlandish script for a soap opera. This story easily could have played out on a daytime drama. In fact, it very much reminds me of Robert Townsend's parody \\"The Bold, The Black & The Beautiful\\" (remember that?).Ms. Briscoe's characters were in no way realistic depictions of any of the people I've encountered in P.G. County...and I've lived and worked in the Baltimore/Washington metro area my entire life. P.G. County's cast of characters were more like caricatures of people Ms. Briscoe probably encountered during her research. Jolene, the spoiled, rich wife with a promiscuous streak, was over the top, and Pearl, the working class single-mom, was a mere knock-off of Terry McMillan's Gloria from Waiting to Exhale. Perhaps Gloria went into the Literary Witness Protection Program, or maybe Ms. Briscoe won the right to use her at an auction. In any event Pearl and Gloria were one in the same.Ms. Briscoe does a fine job of sealing off the rest of P.G. County, with the exception of a disparaging remark or two about the communities beyond Silver Lake (which is actually the Lake Arbor development). Don't believe the hype; P.G. County is not all that Ms. Briscoe cracks it up to be. It's a great place to live, full of character and heritage. Now if Ms. Briscoe had titled her book Montgomery County (P.G. County's real-life snooty next-door neighbor), then I could have gone for that.Despite the stereotypical characters and predictable plot, Ms. Briscoe's writing style is, for the most part, fresh and breezy. However, her dialogue was rather stilted even for rich folk. It seems that Ms. Briscoe (or her editors) was more concerned with cramming key details into dialogue, rather than letting the conversations between characters flow. In one instance, one character is talking about a hair salon (or something of that nature), and states that it's in \\"Bowie, Maryland\\" as if her fellow P.G. County resident didn't know where the city of Bowie is! Whatever.P.G. County was a big letdown, compared to Ms. Briscoe's earlier novel, Sisters & Lovers, which I loved immensely."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I thought this book was &quot;okay&quot;. It would be more entertaining to the people of the DC metropolitan area because we can recognize the area and the descriptions. However, the story line was nothing more than you would see on the Young and the Restless or any other soap opera. I personally don't think that people of such wealth and power are so shallow. I understand that it was totally fiction, and for the sole purpose of entertainment, but it was nothing special. The story plots weren't exactly cliffhangers, but they did leave the reader hanging waiting for something good to happen. I felt the story of Lee and finding her father add absolutely nothing to the story. Jolene was a joke and Barbara was even more of a joke to put up with Bradford. Candace and her new revealation could have been really good and the relationship between Ashley and Kenyatta, but that didn't amount to much. I actually got excited about Patrick and Pearl and that didn't really fold out too much. Basically, no one had much self-esteem and hid their lives behind the walls of Silver Lakes. Many of the plots could have been better developed, but they weren't. Expected so much mored. I am also proud to say that the people of P.G. County and the community being discussed in this book are very noble and decent people."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"The book was poorly developed throughout. The characters weren't fleshed out fully, but the kicker was that horrific ending. How can a book so deep in details and drama end like this one did? Ms. Briscoe, I have read all your books, but this one is the most disappointing."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I've read all of Connie Brisco's books and was especially exited to read PG County, since this is where I've lived for over 25 years after moving from Washington DC. The book kept my interest and I'd consider it a page turner since I wanted to know what was going to happen next. However, I was very disappointed with the ending and felt like it just died after the climax. I would liked to have known how the characters made out after the peak of the story. But after the most exciting moment occurred in the book, it was all over in less than 5 pages. This disappointed me."},{"Title":"P.G.

Country","review":"Okay, I borrowed the audio version from the library and for the first 75% of the story it served its purpose of being a lightweight on the road fiction. However, like others have stated the story made two huge mountains out of molehills at the end.First, the Candice character way overreacted to finding out she had a black relative in her lineage. Did she know anything about America's history? Apparently not. Yea, it may have been surprising to find out but would it really turn your life upside down. I doubt it.Secondly, even though I found the Lee storyline to be the least interesting it was tolerable. However, in the end after showing the picture of her father to everyone and their mother she pulls out a gun on one of the party guests and does the tired old \\"if you move, I'll shoot\\" routine. The thing is the story would have been written just a well if she had pulled out the photo one last time, especially when the wife, Jolene, confronted her.I never lived in P.G. County but I visited friends there all the time (Bowie, Md). The character Jolene reminded me of my friends' neighbor, she would constantly harp about the \\"ghetto\\" areas and people in P.G. county. So while listening to the story I enjoyed the Jolene arc the best because I had a perfect visual of who she could be.Overall, a good read or listen that ended very badly."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Ironically, this is the first novel I read by Connie Briscoe, and the title of this book is where I have spent my entire life: P.G. County (Prince George's County.) It was fairly difficult for me to really take an interest in this book. It wasn't until the latter middle that I found myself remotely intrigued.Jolene, Barbara, Pearl, Candice and Lee are this fictional novel's leading ladies. Jolene is not a very likable character for she is superficial, haughty and has no real regard for her marriage because she has several affairs and doesn't show an iota of remorse. She is married to Patrick, who sees more than she thinks he does throughout the book. Barbara struggles with her marriage and her substance addiction. Her husband, Bradford, is a shameless philanderer, yet filthy rich. Perhaps the reason that he doesn't really hide his affairs from his wife is because he knows that he is the bread winner and she hasn't contributed much financially to their marriage and household. Pearl is a full-figured hairdresser who revolves her life around her son, Kenyetta. She has high hopes for Kenyetta but is disappointed to find that he is dating a white woman, Ashley. She also is a bit self-conscious because she is heavyset. Candice is Ashley's mother. She, like Pearl, is upset because Ashley is dating outside of her race. Later in the book, though, we find that she and her children are part black and they all seem to have a gripe with that. Finally the author brings us Lee, a character who was seemingly attached to the story at the eleventh hour and seemed to bring the story down a bit because of her redundancy. She was molested as an adolescent, and because of that and the fact that she cannot find her father, she is a menace to society, committing several crimes.When so many characters are within a novel, it is imperative that the author keeps his/her reader entertained somehow because keeping up with each character isn't an easy task. In reading this book, I had a hard time distinguishing the characters because of my lack of interest. Not only that, but the book has an abrupt and sudden ending which left much to be desired.Potential buyers, it's alright to pass this book up. The only thing you would be missing is a whole bunch of women with a whole bunch of problems, and I'm sure the majority of you can find that in your realities."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"always love reading anything from this author, hoping to read something more from her soon."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Ordinarily, I am a die-hard Connie Briscoe fan. I loved all of her previous novels and found her to be a wonderful storyteller who educates as much as she entertains. I was somewhat disappointed in this latest work, however--not because the plot was not intriguing, but because the depth and focus of the primary characters were not in keeping with what I have come to expect from this author. With possibly two exceptions, the principal characters were shallow, self-absorbed, and possessed few redeeming qualities. The fact that they were supposed to be illustrative of the more elite, intelligent, and prosperous elements of African-American society made their antics all the more disturbing and embarrassing. The climax was particularly outrageous for its lack of believability, and detracted from the more credible aspects of the story--including the promising genealogy angle. To its credit, though, the book is a quick read and, in all likelihood, will hold the interest and attention of most readers who have experienced Ms. Briscoe's past literary successes."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I really liked the book, but thought it was too short. Ms. Briscoe didn't go into enough depth with the characters.I don't think this was the intention, but the character I liked most was Jolene, because it was obvious how lost she was. All of us have seen the arch-type Black Sheep in books/movies/tv drama, and Jolene got to me. She has been having a hard time being the 'other one' in her family, who are as cold as ice. Jolene needed therapy years ago. I don't know what it is, but I totally felt for Jolene. It's obvious that she was nothing to her family, and it's hard being nothing in a family.Therapy is what she needs.I loved Barbara too, and good for her, finally finding her self-respect.This was a fun summer read."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"PG County is the first book I've read by Connie Briscoe and I'm pleased with her writing style. She has an incredible way of describing the minute detail of each character to the point that you can see their physical flaws as well as feel their emotions. She allows you to be a fly on the wall in each of the character's homes and watch them deal with their daily lives.The storyline is about several women residing in a predominantly black upper class neighborhood in Prince George County, Maryland. Briscoe introduces each woman in her own story line to establish the character's past mishaps, current situation, and future dreams. Throughout the book we see the women interacting (sometimes in catty manner), but there's 2 parties that truly provide the drama for the book.The only negative aspect of PG County is the number of issues Briscoe attempts to address in one book. Barbara already has an adulterous husband, but Briscoe also gives her a reoccurring alcohol problem - simply drama overkill. The interracial dating between Pearl's son and Candice's daughter is needless if it's meant only to force Candice to search her family tree. At the end, the couple are excess characters. Finally, Lee's poverty stricken storyline just doesn't have a place in PG County."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was well written and entertaining. It was a definite pick me up - with a good sound message. This is the second Connie Briscoe novel and I have not been disappointed yet. I read this in one day - Could not put it down. The characters were weel defined and described. Waiting for the next one"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"PG County is a book that reveals how the lives of people living in a small geographical area can be very different. It is a story of \\"haves\\" and \\"have nots\\" and portrays two very different perspectives on African American life. Through the course of a series of events, the lives of these very different characters almost explosively intersect.Barbara Bentley has it all, or so it seems from the outside. She lives in one of the nicest homes in an affluent area of PG County and is preparing for her daughter's wedding. However, she is struggling to maintain her sobriety while dealing with a marriage that is falling apart. Jolene works day and night to keep up with the elite of PG County but her husband seems to have different priorities. Jolene's ongoing struggle to keep up with the \\"haves\\" along with her general selfish attitude, are beginning to put a strain on her marriage. Pearl has worked hard all of her life. After years of struggling to raise her son on her own, he is finally grown and she has been able to realize her dream of owning a hair salon. Candice is a liberal minded White woman who has always taught her children to be colorblind. But when she learns that her daughter is in a relationship with a Black man, her liberal views and indeed her own identity come into question. Finally there is Lee, a young teenage girl who has taken all the abuse she can handle from her mother's boyfriend. As she flees from this awful existence, she begins the search for the father she doesn't know but dreams about.Connie Briscoe has done it again with her most recent tale which reminds us all that \\"all that glitters is not gold.\\" With lots of secrets divulged and plenty of twists and turns in the plot, this is a book that is hard to put down. Strong character development helps the reader relate to and feel for even the most despicable characters in this book. The passion, drama, and heartfelt emotion will quickly draw readers into the lives of the characters of this enjoyable book.Reviewed by Stacey Seay"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"OK, how do I start this? Well,let's start at the top. You got Barbara and her husband Bradford. Bradford is a dog, but a rich and influential rich dog nevertheless. So much so, his mistress shows up at his house on the day of his daughter's wedding asking why SHE didn't get an invitation to the wedding? Barbara copes by packing the liquor away internally and silently brooding. Then you have Jolene, the book's tramp, who although is married, screws around with her architect and her husband's boss(which is Bradford). Although she comes from an influential family, she is the black sheep of the family hence her scandalous behavior. Then you have Pearl,who owns the local beauty shop and has a son who is interested in a nice girl,Ashley, who is \\"white\\". But that's not all about her. Guess I best bring up her mom Candice, who is once of those liberal white women who dresses as a flower child,and finds out some things that might affect her whole life. Last but not least, you have Lee on the lam looking for a man who may be her father. Things come to a serious head at a housewarming party at Jolene's new house.Which ties all these folks in. Anyhow, the book flows, you stay interested, and it is worth your time. My only thing is that Barbara should have left, that Bradford ain't no good. And he knew he would have to give up some serious dough if she did. Good reading. You also get some info on the county that bears its name on the book. Been there before due to family living there."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"This book to me was a soap oprah in a book. Unpredictable, I never knew what would happen on the next page or in the next chapter. This book was a departure from the books I've been reading and was a great escaped. It was fun to read."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I simply loved this book! This was my first time reading something from this author and I must say I really enjoyed it.From this first page of this book I knew it was gonna be good! Bradford and Barbara Bently lives were very interesting! A rich man that can't get his pants zipped and a rich woman that is trying to kick a cigarette and alcohol habit. But it's hard when your husband keeps cheating on you. To top it off one of his mistresses shows up at their daughter's wedding!My favorite character was Jolene. Mrs. Pefect-I'm the bomb and you're nothing compared to me! This lady was a trip and a half. She always was cooking up some crazy plan to make herself wealthy! But the in the end she will be the laughing stock of her community. Read and see why?This book gets FIVE stars easily and deserves MORE! Good job Connie Briscoe. Look forward to reading more of your work in the near future!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"First let us remember this book is fiction not fact. I found this book to be very engaging and well written. Briscoe uses her writing skills to remind us that money doesn't equal no problems. The characters in the book represent everyday people they cheat, they lie, they steal, they hide their true problems and feelings. For this reason I found it a very good read. Keep up the good work Connie."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I read this book when it was first published. I thought it was a very good book. The end left me wondering if there is going to be a sequel. I hope so. There are some loose ends at the end of the story that should be tied up. Overall, it was a great read."},{"Title":"P.G.

It was a fast read and I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.I enjoy reading books where the settings are familiar to me. It's nice to say &quot;Been there&quot; or &quot;I know where that is&quot;.I believe that Lee's character/storyline could have been a bit better or just flat out eliminated.I was also a little disappointed in the ending of the book. I felt like there was more I needed to know before it actually ended."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"The book was filled with &quot;clutch the pearls&quot; drama from beginning to end.

Country","review":"I'm another reviewer who actually resides in P.G. County (but I live &quot;inside the beltway&quot;... learn about that in the book). I'm not originally from P.G. and have only lived here for a year, but I picked up the book because I was intrigued to learn how an author portrayed the place I now call home, since I had heard so much about the legendary black bourgeoise in the area.Briscoe is a good writer. She had me really getting into the characters and the book is definitely a page turner. I was a bit frustrated that the story did not get very deep, since she had about five main characters. Instead she skimmed over a short period of time and all of the issues faced by these people. I understand that she put in a lot of characters to represent the different &quot;types&quot; of people who reside in P.G. County, but I found myself wanting to concentrate on one, only to have her switch to someone else.Overall, I highly recommend this book, especially for your summer or vacation reading. It's not that deep, but it does bring up some real-life issues (although they are of course wrapped up in soap opera-style drama)."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's been a while since I've read a book that I absolutely could not put down. If I did not have children, I would have read it in one sitting.

I would certainly read more of her books but not the first choice at this time. Since I live near PG County is was interesting to see how she represented it. And the \\"explicit sex\\" wasn't as explicit as some romance novels I have read. Good book but definately library material."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I read this book in one afternoon! I enjoyed all the characters, I would like to read a follow-up on what happened with all of the characters. Well developed story line and a great read!!! I recommend this to EVERYONE!

Country","review":"Best-selling author Connie Briscoe (Sisters and Lovers, Big Girls Don't Cry, The Long Way Home) is back on the scene after a lengthy hiatus. We find her telling the tale of life in an affluent suburban community of five women who distinctly show differences for who they are, what class of society they belong, and how much lust, love, and dirty secrets they manage to whip up. The word drama takes on a new meaning once Barbara, Jolene, Candice, Pearl, and Lee get through their complex machinations.Barbara is a prima donna recovering from alcoholism dealing with a rich philandering husband; Jolene is slick and conniving, intent on stealing Bradford (Barbara's husband) and moving up the social strata. Adding to her situation is Patrick her husband who has decided that two can play that game. He has his eyes on Pearl, who is Barbara's hairdresser and the mother of Kenyatta. Kenyatta is in love with a white girl by the name of Ashley who is the daughter of Candice. Candice on her part, is white and outspoken, but her true colors show when she tries to deal a problem too close for comfort. Last but certainly not least, is Lee an adolescent running away from life, and the uncanny ability to find trouble in the wrong places.Having read any of Ms Briscoe's previous novels would make you feel at home with a style reminiscent of Terry McMillan's penchant for weaving intricate plots with subplots that keep the characters jumping. But what happens when there's all action but no meaningful filler to flesh the story? Most of the sista girl novels of this type seem to be predictable and a sameness that hollers for a different beat, which makes you feel that you've been there and done that.For pure entertainment though, and if you're really a Briscoe fan, you'd want to read this book to the end, for it doesn't disappoint in making it like the rest of them cut from the same mold. With the diverse characters, and the author's skill at making five women know that they are truly different flavors, may prove to be the type of fluff par for this course. While reading the book I was waiting for any degree of separation to give it the final push over the hump to justify the hype. If the ending was more than enough to make up for all of the bickering and backstabbing in lieu of adequate pacing, perhaps we'd be privy to a much better story indicative of what I know she can write. Out of five stars, I give it 3 ."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Where's the other dimension of these two-dimensional characters?? Where's the rest of the book? It ended so abruptly. Where's the logic behind the actions of these people?As you can see, I did not enjoy this book. Connie Briscoe truly dropped the ball with this one. The only reason I had for reading it was that I reside in PG County. Have for my entire 22 years. I found the characters in this book to be horrible representations of the people here. Yes, I know, it's a book meant for entertainment, but come on! I've noticed that a few reviewers live in the County with me, so I know I do not have this opinion on my own.1.Every single woman in this book had serious self-esteem issues: 1)Barbara--staying with a man that cheated on her repeatedly, 2)Jolene--money grubber...adulterer...skank, shall I go on? Cheated on her husband with 2 men (1 was Barb's hub) and felt that a man was only worth something if he had $$. What type of example was she setting for her young daughter? 3)Candice--main Caucasian woman in the book. Disturbed that her daughter, Ashley, whom she has encouraged to accept people regardless of race, status, etc, is dating a black man. 4)Pearl--disturbed that her son is dating the said white daughter. By far, the most racist person in the book as far as I was concerned. 5)Lee--some random character that popped up every five chapters or more. Added nothing to the book except for a overly dramatic ending.This book did nothing for me. Pearl and Candice's resistance to their children dating was ridiculous. Somehow though, when Candice found out she was black (according to the ridiculous 1 drop rule), their relationship is all of a sudden something that is accepted! And what was the purpose of pointing that out to Lee? No sense at all. Lee's popping up added ZIP, NIL, NADA to the story!I could write more, but I really don't feel like it. Do like I did. Buy this book for no more than $1.50. Or rent it from the library."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I like this novel but, not as much I liked \\"Can't Get Enough\\".I would had to hurt that great Bradford Bentley .I would had enough of him long time ago.Jolene what a character! All that money and still no happiness til Pearl came along with good looking brother Patrick to show happiness and little bit love.Candace I guess was side kick in story showed no relative importance to me.GOOD BOOK!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Remember Robert Townsend's spoof soap opera skit entitled, &quot;The Bold, The Black, and The Beautiful&quot;? Well, P.G. County is a longer version of that skit in written form. Though not the most noteworthy book from a pure literary perspective, the novel is very entertaining and would be good for anyone looking for something a little lighter in between more serious reads. The storyline and characters are 1 part Jerry Springer, 1 part Young and the Restless, with a dash of black bourgeoisie that make the book a page-turner and should spark some interesting discussions within your reading circle."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Open P.G. County by Connie Briscoe and step inside the world of the affluent, mostly African American community of Silver Lake, Maryland. Meet Bradford and Barbara, a philanderer and the woman who turns to cigarettes and alcohol to cover the pain. Meet Patrick and Jolene, a hard-working man trying to earn a living while his wife tries to find a better life with someone else.Meet Pearl, a single mom who own her own hair salon and attempts to come to terms with her only son, Kenyatta, dating a white girl. Meet Candice, the mother of that white girl, a recently remarried woman dealing with the biggest secret of her life.And meet Lee, a teenager from the streets, who is in trouble who wants to find her daddy, but all she knows about him is that his name is Smokey and he lives in Silver Lake.Learn more about these characters, and their views on each other, through chapters devoted to each individual. Watch Barbara struggle with her husband's affairs, and how to kick-start her own life.Watch Patrick begin his career in politics and see Jolene as she tries to find the man capable of keeping her in the lifestyle she dreams of.Watch Pearl and Candice come to terms with their children dating outside their race. And watch Lee as she stumbles her way into the Silver Lake enclave.By revealing key events in the characters' pasts, Briscoe helps the reader understand why they act the way the do. She does an excellent job of bringing them to life in this book.The method of alternating chapters dealing with a person's private life and chapters dealing with how this person interacts with the other characters in a group situation, is what makes this book work. There is a sense of completeness at the end of the book, however, the reader would like to continue to follow them along their life's path."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"After having enjoyed Briscoe's &quot;Sisters &amp; Lovers&quot; and living in PG County for several years, I was eager to read this book. However, I found the book rather disappointing. Although it was an easy-read (about 1 1/2 days), I thought that the story lines were a bit far-fetched. Don't get me wrong - I acknowledge and celebrate the fact that there are these types of affluent black neighborhoods across the US. But, I was disheartened that such Jackie Collins-esque dramatics were associated with the characters. None of the characters had any true depth or over-arching purpose. In addition, as I read the book, I kept giving the author the benefit of the doubt by imagining that all of the subplots could actually occur in real life. However, when all of these mini-dramas climaxed together in the end, I felt as though my intelligence had been insulted. Not only did the ending seem ridiculously unlikely, there was no resolution to any of the stories.Overall, a very surface level book. If you are intent on reading this, go into it with moderate expectations. Better yet, just use it as a &quot;filler&quot; read between two more substantial and/or complex books."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I am a true Connie Briscoe reader, read everything I've seen her publish. I really enjoy her work. P.G. County was a fun read!!! The other reviews are fairly accurate with the fact that some of the storylines could've been developed more. I agree. A total Black (bourgeoisie) soap opera drama. Yes and ... Don't know much about P.G. County but the descriptions were very vivid. If you're not looking for depth but would really love to enjoy a book. Choose P.G. County. A page turner !!! Vacation must read !!! I think the other reviews will help you understand the characters .. but a good life lesson in \\"Everybody plays the Fool Sometimes\\" but when is enough enough?

As you turn into the entrance, you'll need to stop at the gate and speak to the guard. Traveling along the tree-lined main road, you'll pass large, Tudor and Colonial-style homes with flawlessly manicured lawns, tennis courts, and swimming pools.You should meet some of the neighbors. They are a very interesting bunch. On the northern side of Silver Lake, you'll find the Bentley's lavish estate. Barbara is the elegant wife of gorgeous multimillionaire Bradford Bentley. One of those women who seems to have it all, Barbara is struggling to keep from self-medicating the fury within her, caused by her husband's acute philandering.Also in the northern portion of Silver Lake, you will find the large contemporary house that Jolene Brown and her family are building. Jolene, her daughter Juliette, and her husband Patrick live on the southern side of Silver Lake, where the more modest family homes are. Jolene is obsessed with keeping up appearances, but only succeeds in looking cheap. Oh, and she has a slight problem keeping her skirt down when in the presence of rich and powerful men.Next door to the Browns resides Candice Jones and her family. Although they are one of the only families in Silver Lake that is not of color, they have never felt out of place. However, when her daughter, Ashley, tells her of a new romantic interest, Candice becomes concerned. But after a little venture into family history, Candice has a bit of an identity crisis of her own.On the southern edge of Silver Lake are the townhouses, which some residents feel are beneath the exclusive neighborhood. This is where hairstylist Pearl Jackson lives with her son Kenyatta. Pearl owns the local beauty parlor, with clients such as Barbara Bentley and Jolene Brown. She's worked harder than she'd care to mention to make sure her son had a chance when so many young, African-American males do not. That is why she is so disturbed when she meets her son's new love interest, Ashley Jones.And then there's Lee, the streetwise and street weary teen whose search for her father leads her to the gates of Silver Lake.P. G. COUNTY serves the reader a delectable buffet of the struggles and triumphs of Maryland's African-American elite. Connie Briscoe creates several strikingly different families, and shows how their stories intertwine. She breaks them down to the reader to reveal core beliefs and desires that lurk in all of us. But Briscoe doesn't present it in a preachy manner. She hands us a platter and heaps on piles of lust, greed, heartache, love, and money until your plate is heavy with dishy dialogue, lush settings, and scandalous characters.No review or synopsis of this book will prepare you for the wacky, heinous capers of the women of P.

I love books about multiple female characters, and it's been a while since the last time I read a good one. P.G. County is a chatty, gossipy book all about life in an exclusive Maryland enclave, and I loved every minute. I think the book could have been better if it had had an epilogue, for the ending seemed a bit abrupt. While I was satisfied with where Briscoe left off with Barbara, Candice, and Lee (and I had a feeling Daddy was who he turned out to be), I wanted to see the bad-girl character get her comeuppance, and see what happened with the developing romance, and with Bradford. Oh, well. I guess it's up to us to figure it out.This book was a ton of fun, and I liked that the characters weren't young folks in their 20s, but instead late 30s to early 50s. Somebody needs to snap this one up and make a movie! Let's see . . . Sheryl Lee Ralph as Jolene, the newly slimmed-down Yvette Freeman (the nurse on E.R.) as Pearl (only because Loretta Devine already played an overweight hairdresser in Waiting to Exhale,) Lonette McKee as Barbara, Clark Johnson as Bradford, Phil Morris as Patrick . . .

I must say that Big Girls Don't Cry was one of my favorite books of all time and had me praising Connie as one of the premier African American female writers. Sisters and Lovers and A Long Way from Home were also well written. Having lived in Prince George's County for my entire life, I was only too excited to read this book. I knew it HAD to be good because every single copy of the book in our public library system was either checked out or on hold. When I first started reading the book, I could not stop. However, I could not have been more disappointed with the ending. She gets two stars for the book being a real page turner. But the end left much to be desired. I found myself laughing and saying 'No Connie...you've got to be kidding me.' She could have done so much more with the conclusion of the book.And I must say, that the entire Lee story was a complete waste of time and out of place. It added nothing to the story.I believe Connie Briscoe is a gifted story teller, however, I don't believe this book demonstrates that at all. I'm hoping that the next one will show a little more of her talent."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I was sadly disapointed in PG County by Connie Briscoe. I waited so long for her new book to come out. I had been reading excerpts on the book before the book actually came out. Ms. Briscoe, PLEASE. This was a nice attempt to come off as Dynasty, but it was also far fetched and her characters were totally unbelievable. They didn't even sound real. I like to read books that I can picture this story happening to me. I could not do that at all with PG County. And the sad part about the book is that even I could have written it. And I don't know the first thing about writing. I am a strong Connie Briscoe fan, but I think she needs to go back to the writing board with this one.One Disapointed Reader!"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"P.G. County is an awesome read, this book has everything that isrequired to be a best-seller. It has well-developedcharacters you love and some you hate. Connie Briscoe does such awonderful job of giving the characters life they all become primary at some point in the book. The storylines draw you and your emotions,whether you want to be in that scene or not.Stereotypes and social issues are in abundance in this book. They are so expertly placed instead of feeding into it, you identify with it and move on. I believe the message in PG County was to make us all connect with race and class so we can begin to build social change.PG County is about many of the ism's; socialism, racism, classcism and materialism, which are the things we allow to limit our relationships and interactions with others. It is about the material things that can get in the way of relationships and family. It is about secrets, historystereotypes and four wonderful characters that only Connie Briscoe could have created with such life. As I read this book, I was right there at the parties eating all the good food and walking around choosing sides throughout the story when needed.Jolene thought if she had enough money it would wash away her childhood teasing, but not all the money in the world could remove the pain in her heart. Pearl's character had it all and was too modest to know it.She struggled with her self worth as did Barbara, her self worth was found in a bottle of vodka and Candice's quest for the truth regarding her heritage brought her more than she bargained for. As you read each character story you are find yourself on a emotional roller coaster, but it is all good. All people of all ethnic backgrounds should read PG County.MissyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I happened to pick up \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" in the library recently and couldn't believe my luck. What a wonderful, rich, well-written book. The characters were complex and full of life. The story was detailed and descriptive. I couldn't wait to read another one of Ms. Briscoe's books, so I went back to the library and checked out \\"P.G. County.\\" What a mistake! I cannot even believe this is the same author. This book is a mess. None of the characters are interesting or have any dimension at all. And the character of Lee - why even throw her in? A character like that should make you feel sympathetic, but the way she is thrown in there, she is just an annoyance. And the way it finally ties in at the end is completely ridiculous! All it does is make one of the only decent characters in the book, Patrick, a dog like all the rest of the men. Throughout the book you felt bad that Jolene was cheating on him so much because he seemed like a decent guy and it should have stayed that way. Because by the end you cared even less about any of them, if that is possible.I also have to comment on the character of Candice finding out that one of her ancestors was black. I cannot believe what a HUGE deal was made out of this. Then in the end, everyone was talking like this made the family a black family. They even mention the one-drop rule, as it that means anything. A rule made up by a bunch of racists is being taken seriously by the characters in the book. The way the daughter Ashley and the rest of the family was in shock over finding out they are \\"really black\\" is laughable.All in all, this is a really bad soap opera that I recommend staying away from."},{"Title":"P.G.

I just knew one of the black characters, Pearl maybe, would inform Candice that just because some great-great grandfather was half-black, it did not make her black. The one-drop rule was something white, racist slave owners did to divide us so that they can feel superior. I wonder if Ms. Briscoe realizes the amount of white people that would, by her definition, be black, because of black ancestors. Surely most of them would, especially if they have roots in the U.S. No one is going to look at Candice and her family as black people ever. So, I found that extremely appalling that a black writer would perpetuate such a racist myth. The only reason that I could think of that she would do that was out of ignorance.The book gets a single star from me because Jolene got what she deserved in the end."},{"Title":"P.G.

Save your time and your money..Try reading Pearl Cleage.."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"Connie Briscoe creates a soap opera-like melodrama in her latest release entitled P.G. County. The novel takes place in the posh Silver Lake community of Prince George's County, Maryland where we enter a world filled with a host of characters representing the various socio-economic classes. We meet the black elite represented by Bradford Bentley, a self-made, philandering millionaire and his wife, Barbara, a woman who hides her pain in the bottle. There is a \\"BUPPIE\\" couple represented by Patrick and his wife, Jolene who has an insatiable, materialistic desire to supercede Barbara regardless of the costs. The upper-middle class white matriarch, Candice, is comfortable living in a black world until her teenaged daughter begins dating a black man (Pearl's son). Pearl owns the local beauty salon and lives in the much frowned upon townhouse development on the outskirts of Silver Lake. We are also shown the impoverished suburb of Seat Pleasant and meet Lee, a young victim of child abuse in search of her real father.Briscoe builds excitement with Bradford's extramarital affairs, mystery with Lee's search for her father, and suspense with Candice's genealogical search for the truth. Unfortunately this reader found that some of the story's climaxes fell short which made for slow reading at times. Nonetheless, Briscoe does a great job with character development. She provides a solid background for each of the characters so the reader has a clear understanding of their behavior, fears, and motives. The author ends the story in such a way that the reader suspects a sequel may be needed to obtain closure on some open issues and deferred dreams. I believe most Briscoe fans will not be disappointed with this novel because despite the intermittent lags P.G. County is a light, easy, entertaining summer read. Briscoe remains on my favorite author list and will no doubt win more fans with this new release.PhyllisAPOOO Bookclub"},{"Title":"P.G.

Both books were exciting & unpredictable."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"P G County was indeed a black soap opera. I found it intriguing to read about these people of \\"higher status\\". Funny how they are people too. Poor Barbara, oh so country that she could not figure out that she could have left that dog and taken just about everything he owned with her. I loved how Jolene ended up. She is the kind of chick I hate. Has so many self esteem issues developed from teenage years, now in her thirties with a mind to steal anybody's husband because of her own insecurities about herself. And had a good husband. She got exactly what she deserved. A big fabulous house and no man in it. And she can hardly afford it by herself--oh what a pity. And that story of the white woman trippin because she is 1/8th black. Good for her too!I read it very fast because I felt it was entertaining. Hopefully the sequel is even more dramatizing!!!"},{"Title":"P.G.

PG County lacked that attention grabbing quality that you need when writing a novel.

The book was a good read and I recommend it to readers who like to read to kill time.I still love you Connie B."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I couldn't put the book down. I really rooted for Lee. The rest of the characters were merely backdrop to what happened to her, but interesting nonetheless."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"I am so disappointed with Connie Briscoe's latest book. Miss Briscoe should be ashamed of herself. She only wrote about the negative people, images and events in the county. As a 10 year resident of the county and lifelong Marylander, I am deeply disturbed that Miss Briscoe's 6 months spent in the county doing research resulted in such a piece of garbage in print. One thing is for sure, Miss Briscoe is only concerned with making money for herself. I am sure people of the county and beyond will read the book out of curiosity. It is so unfortunate that they will walk away with such a slanted and not completely accurate story to read. While I know this is fiction, she could have made some of the storyline a little more positive, which I might add would not have been a ficticous portrayal of the county. I also have to add that she spent way too much time on the Candice storyline and I really don't think she handled her reaction well. I stood in line at a book signing to purchase this book with great excitement and anticipation, only to end up wishing I had never read a word of P.G. County!"},{"Title":"P.G.

I did like some of the characters a lot, but there are other characters I wanted to just be abducted by aliens and disappear. The author lost me when she started making mountains out of mole hills. Candace's character was so over developed in my opinion. She was soooooooooo boring!!!! I did not understand why she was a main character. I also did not like the constant bickering about the interracial relationship. What year is it? Who cares this much? Obviously these characters cared enough to talk about it every other page. I do not read a book to identify with every single character, but these people made the biggest deals over absolutely nothing. Now the only reason the book received the two stars instead of one was because of three characters Jolene Barbara and Bradford. Their parts made the book worth reading and prompted me to order part two \\"Can't Get Enough\\" that and I am a sucker for a sequel. I just hope that Mrs.Briscoe dumps the unneeded people in part two."},{"Title":"P.G. Country","review":"If you don't have anything nice to say keep your comments to yourself. But then who really listens to mama. This book had too much drama, I liked the author's style of writing but this book was a demoralizer for black women. The basis of the book was that you needed to stay with a man who treated you like crap to make it. Or sleep with whom ever you can to make it to the top. And spend well beyond your means. Not a book for someone with low self esteem. But plenty of drama for the soap opera fanatic."},{"Title":"P.G.

It was interesting that the things that happened to you in your childhood were some of the very same things that troubled you in your adult life.Barbara and Bradford Bentley were the envy of the neighborhood. They looked like everything was so together on the outside. But, what you see is not what you get.Candice and Jim were a genuinely happy couple until Candice decided to start searching for unknown trouble.Jolene and Patrick were your average couple. Jolene wanted the limelight Patrick didn't. Patrick was a devoted husband and father but Jolene wasn't satisfied she always wanted more. It's amazing how Jolene thought she deserved so much but did so little.This is one of the best books I have read in 2002.If you are interested in a fast read this is the book for you.

I was somewhat curious since I am from P.G. County. I flipped through the first few chapters and I was hooked. I finished it in 3 days. This is the funniest book I have read in a long time. I am originally from Seat Pleasant and lived as an adult near Woodmore/Lake Arbor(Silver Lake). Therefore, it was fun to see places in the book that I am familar with. I didn't appreciate how Seat Pleasant was depicted however. It's not that bad. My favorite character was &quot;all of them as a whole&quot;. I esp. liked them because I see each one of the characters not only in P.G. County, but also in counties ajacent to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, and Chicago.

Country","review":"Connie Briscoe put together a black-a-drama that was fun to read. Certain aspects of the story were predictable, but she was able to couch the predictable in such exciting, stimulating characters that the reader is pretty much able to overlook these minor flaws. Perhaps my only major disappointment about the book was that the hairdresser, Pearl, too closely resembles the hairdresser in Terry McMillan's book, WAITING TO EXHALE. But overall, the book is just the type of read you want if you just want to be entertained and get to see how the other half lives.The character of Barbara is the quentissential grand dame. Too much money and too little self-esteem. Her whole life revolves around her husband Bradford, a man who has been told just a few times too many how fine he is.Pearl, as I stated before, resembles the hairdresser in WAITING TO EXHALE a little too much. In fact, too much, but like in EXHALE, she is one of few redeemable characters in the story, and you can't help but to root for her.Jolene is the female equivalent of Bradford minus the fat bank account. According to the story, she worked but the only working the reader got to see was her &quot;working over&quot; other womens' husbands. It is clear where her low self-esteem and self-deprecating behavior came from, but it was difficult to read her chapters. You just wanted to slap some sense in her and challenge her to get a life.Candice, Candice, Candice. She definitely got the rug pulled out from under her, and the beauty of it was, even though I saw it coming, it was still beautiful to watch. I won't ruin it for you, but the storyline is priceless. Briscoe deals with a Pandora's box that a lot of folks like Candice should rummage through. The ending chapter with she and her family was a little weak, but everything up until that point was solidly written.Lee needed more development, or just not be a part of the story. Her storyline was so complex that it was more of a distraction for me than an added bonus, but that is just one reader's opinion.Bottom line, this is a book that will keep the reader flipping the pages.

Candace and that story line was contrived and lame. Lee - whatever. I could tell where both those lines were headed almost right away. You knew Lee would end up in silver lake somehow. The inscription on the photo wrapped that up for me quick. I can't even convey how stupid I found the saga of Candace. Jolene had the most to offer, if anything. Not saying much there, though. And did these people ever go to the grocery store or their kids' schools? Sorry. I gave Ms. Briscoe a try. Will pass next time. Guess I'll go back to legal thrillers and murder mysteries.

His earlier works (Wood Beyond the World, Well at the World's End, etc.) are modelled after the romances of the high Middle Ages and late medieval/renaissance works. In The Sundering Flood, Moris looks back further in time, and incorporates thematic and stylistic elements of the Norse sagas. This is particularly evident in the first part of this work. The overall structure does resemble Well at the World's End, but this work is not derivative. The action is tighter, more varied, and more detailed. It is the closest of Morris's fantasies to a modern novel. The language remains archaic, and might put off some readers; but if you persevere you will adjust to it, and find this a great story."},{"Title":"Sundering Flood","review":"Morris devotees will find it well worth reading (and the four stars are for benefit of those readers). Others may find it impenetrable. Those who have never read any of Morris' works absolutely should start with The Well at the World's End, which is his masterwork, and I'd hate for anyone to be discouraged from that experience."},{"Title":"Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality","review":"Interesting in parts, but it didn't live up to the title. I found it to be more of an exploration of how dogs became domesticated over thousands of years, and the ways in which they differ from their wild brethren. There were some good insights, but overall I felt it was too \\"clinical\\", for lack of a better word. I much preferred the author's How To Speak Dog."},{"Title":"Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality","review":"This book was a very interesting and informative read. Although it was not what I expected, I was pleasantly pleased with what I did get from the book. The book deals with how and why dogs came to be, over evolution, the great companions they are now. Along with a general guidelines of what personality to expect from a breed. However it does go into detail of how it is genetics more than breed that can play huge impact on a dogs personality. There is also a heartbreaking section about dogs used in illegal fighting, as well as inspiring tales of heroic dogs. I think this book is a good read for the anyone who just loves dogs and wants to understand more about them."},{"Title":"Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality","review":"This was a fun and rather fascinating study of dogs. I especially enjoyed the personality quiz that was included in the book. The anecdotes ranged from amusing to heart-breaking. The chapter on heroic dogs especially stood out. I thought it was a good balance between science and entertainment. There was a good deal on the domestication of dogs, which I think is interesting, though Coren did not mention co-evolution, which I found to be rather surprising. Still, I really enjoyed this!"},{"Title":"Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality","review":"I read this book because it was mentioned favorably by Cesar Milan in his books. However, this book is not nearly as readable or informative as Milan's books so if you prefer simplicity and direct information rather than high handed, lofty academic writing, you will not like this book.Mr. Coren first of all, talks down to his audience and treats dogs more like scientific experiments than beloved pets and companions. A typical sentence by Croren may start out like this \\"John Deefledorph, professor of psycopsychologyd boo-bahness at the University of the Grand Poobah and author of the Book \\"His Grandness Load of BS\\" and . .. . . \\" On and on like that. It takes a paragraph sometimes for Coren to get to the part where the grand pooh bah conducted a study of some sort. I've always wondered why academics rely on studies to the exclusion of plain common sense. Guys like this will cite to a study before they go the bathroom.Moreover, Coren has a very high handed arrogant and smug writing style I don't particularly care for. In fact, I got little from this book except a lot of information about a lot of studies and truthfully, it was upsetting reading about heartless studies done on dogs by the military.If you are a fan of tedious academic writing and studies and clinical writing that lacks warmth and insight, you will like this book. I myself got nothing out of it and that is purely my fault I'm sure. Coren keeps himself and his subject at a distance and lacks a real warmth both towards dogs and dog owners.This is a soulless book on a soulful subject."},{"Title":"Why Does My Dog Act That Way?: A Complete Guide to Your Dog's Personality","review":"Stanley Coren is aparently an \\"expert\\" on dog behavior, but I think he's the only one calling himself that, particluarly when it comes to discussing the history and behavior of \\"bull and terrier\\" breeds.Coren states in the early parts of his book that any dog (of any breed) that exhibited aggressiveness towards humans were culled, which is correct. Later in the book, in a chapter titled \\"Creating Monsters\\", he discusses how \\"pit bull\\" type dogs were developed, and how selective breeding has created dogs that are more aggressive. And this is where things go south.Coren goes into great detail about how dogs - specifically American Pit Bull Terriers and \\"American Staffordshire bull terriers\\", along with Staffordshire Bull Terriers and any other bully breed - bred to fight other dogs are also inherently aggressive towards humans. Not only is this a damaging assumption on Coren' part, but it is also very incorrect - bully breeds were bred to be DOG aggressive, and any dog that showed unacceptable behavior towards people was immediately killed. \\"Bull and Terrier\\" type dogs were - and remain - very intelligent, very stable, and very people-friendly. It takes a great deal of painful, fear-inducing \\"training\\" to cause a bully breed to be aggressive towards humans. Think something along the lines of inserting gun powder into a dog's anus just as a stranger approaches.His anecdotes are irrelevant - like the one about the woman who slipped and fell, only to be attacked by her Staffie while trying to get up - and since they cannot be proven or disproven, they only provide more of a misunderstanding, fueling the general public's hysteria.He even provides a handy chart at the end of the book, letting readers know which dogs are \\"dominant\\" (suggestive the possibility for aggressiveness), which have a high \\"Intelligence/learning ability\\" (suggesting that some breeds a \\"stupid\\"), which are \\"emotionally reactive\\" or \\"social\\", and what each breed's energy levels are. The information contained in this chart is completely incorrect, and anyone who has ever owned a dog will be able to tell you that.I have been studying dogs for over a decade. I have spent the last 10 years of my life studying behavior, learning throries, intelligence, social structures, and training methods. At the end of the day, Stanley Coren is human psychologist, and spends most of this book discussing human psychology and how it might apply to dogs, but probably doesn't.I found this book to be a confusing, dull read - there is a lot of personal stories, anecdotes, and mis-used information (any dog \\"expert\\" knows that CDC dog bite statistics aren't accurate or unbiased), and Coren contradicts himself more than a few times. The only thing worse than Coren is Millan!There are other, better books available on dog behavior. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"Title":"Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy","review":"The author has written the most lucid and powerful treatise dealing with the field of cognitive-behavior therapy in his work, &quot;Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy&quot;.

As the premier figure among the Western Allies, his story and observations are crucial to an understanding of the Great Crusade.Ike takes the reader along with him through each stage of the Crusade. We view events from a perspective which lets us see aspects which we otherwise might have missed. Having attracted attention for his performance in Army maneuvers in Louisiana in 1940, Ike was called to Washington immediately after Pearl Harbor because of his recent experience in the Philippines. He was immediately assigned to work on plans for the Pacific. At this point the reader is reminded that, in contrast to the later Germany First Policy, the American public, for a time, screamed for revenge on Japan before dealing with Germany.Assigned to command Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa in 1942, Ike was charged with obtaining Allied Cooperation and was plunged into the morass of French politics. The disappointing involvement with Gen. Giraud presented an intra-allied problem, as did cooperation of Adm. Darlan, who while too helpful to rebuff, brought with him the stigma of association with a collaborator. The age-old Arab-Jewish hostility further complicated the administration of the liberated territory.With North Africa cleared out, Ike was charged with the conquest of Sicily. Management of the Patton-Montgomery rivalry was a major challenge of the campaign. Success having been achieved, the Patton slapping incident forced Ike to reprimand a close friend while threatening to deprive him of one of his most effective Army commanders.Speculation that Ike would return to the Washington as Chief Of Staff while Gen. Marshall commanded Overlord, the invasion of Europe, distracted Ike's attention from problems at hand. Ike's eventual appointment to command Overlord forced him to leave the Mediterranean while the Italian campaign was still in doubt. Upon arrival in England he immediately switched gears to plan the size, timing, supply and location of the invasion of France.With the invasion ashore, Ike skillfully managed his coalition of impetuous commanders in their march across Europe. Ike brings the reader into the thought processes and conferences leading to decisions on the liberation of Paris, Operation Market-Garden (\\"A Bridge Too Far\\") and the Battle of The Bulge.Americans are familiar with Patton's claim that, with supplies, he could capture Berlin and win the war. Ike relates that Monty bothered him with similarly impractical suggestions. He then explains why the proposals were doomed to failure. Spirited arguments with the British over Project Anvil (Invasion of Southern France) come within the reader's vision through Ike's eyes.The greatest criticism of Ike's wartime leadership is reserved for questions about whether the Western Allies should have advanced further to limit the Red Army's area of occupation. Ike assesses the claims and presents support for his decisions.After V-E Day, Ike's role shifted more into that of a statesman as he attempted to obtain cooperation with the Russians over the administration of occupied Germany.Some things come clearly through the pages of this book. The reader is constantly impressed with the importance of supplies, bringing to mind the adage that \\"Amateurs speak of tactics, professionals speak of logistics.\\" Despite later controversies, Ike's admiration for Gen. George Marshall is made clear on the pages of this book. Written in 1948, I find the statement that Ike disagreed with many of FDR's domestic policies to be surprising and a hint of his later political initiatives. \\"Crusade In Europe\\" is written in a very clear, easy to read and follow, style. It never becomes bogged down in boring details. Among memoirs, this is a gem."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Eisenhower quickly brings us up to speed with the US armed forced when Germany overruns Poland and later when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor. He gives the state of our preparedness, discusses the able officers who were headed to develop our forces, and describes episodes that changed our training and effectiveness. He meets daily with the major players and heads of state and gives glimpses of their personalities as well as their views. He discusses where politics and the military overlap and where damages might occur. He discusses strategy and tactics and carefully distinguishes for the reader the differences. He clearly demonstrates pitfalls and purposes in the practice and preparation and execution of a successful war. From top to bottom along the line, he explains stresses on commander as well as enlisted troops, such as confidence and morale among other aspects. Throughout the book we gain confidence in Eisenhower's easy, open style, his sincerity and his trustworthiness. A remarkable man makes clear and plain a very complex time in our country's history, including his own views on the aftermath of WWII and the growing tensions between ourselves and Russia.A wonderful book for veterans and non-veterans alike."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"There is no one more in American history whom I admire more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. Unfortunately, when he wrote this book, many important things were still classified and he could not go into them. Good starting point if you're just getting interested in World War Two, but for much more detail (perhaps too much detail), there's &quot;Eisenhower at War&quot; by David Eisenhower. &quot;Eisenhower&quot; by Stephen Ambrose (Volume One and NOT the abridged version combining Volumes One and Two) is also good. Probably the most interesting book on Eisenhower during World War Two and his entire life prior to the Presidency is Merle Miller's &quot;Ike the Soldier.&quot; Each of these books delves into the same subject matter and is able to do so without having key areas (like ULTRA) still kept confidential."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"General Eisenhower, contrary to press reports and revisionist historians, was a man of great intelligence, strength, and discipline. He wrote this book in 1948 without ghost-writers, and his wit and wisdom are stunning. Everyone needs to read this to understand the issues that face us in Iraq and elsewhere today. The general explains how the real work of the military is developing strategy, drawing up plans, building relationships with governments and civilians, and quickly implementing and changing the plans as required. Only criticism is his tencency to dismiss the inappropriate behavior of Patton, but keep in mind that Patton was already dead when this book was written and Eisenhower would not criticize those who were not positioned to defend themselves. He is critical of others, especially Montgomery for his foolish proposal of launching a blitz on Berlin to bring the war to an early end. Another lesson for our time is the treachery of the French troops both in Vichy and Algeria, who fight the Allied invasion and put personal objectives above military and political goals. Unbelievable candor throughout such as when Eisenhower reports that an obviously overwhelmed Truman offers to help Eisenhower in any way that he can, including supporting him for the Presidency in 1948. Important career lesson: Eisenhower did not receive any significant promotions in the 20 years after WWI and was doing staff work under McArthur for 5 years, building up the Filipino military, yet became the highest rank allied commander, through hard work, dedication, and leadership."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Since nobody has yet reviewed this, I thought I'd take a shot, even though it's been about 27 years or so since I read the book.This is Eisenhower's own story from the early days when he was called by Marshall to Washington to analyze propects for the war in the Pacific, to his being Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe.As most everyone knows, once the US was involved in a serious war, Eisenhower jumped in promotion over many others. After reading this book it's easy to see why.This book is not as frank as we would expect today, and some of incidents are presented as if written by Norman Rockwell. Yet this book is excellent in presenting Eisenhower's view of the war. It is a view from on high, and it is best contrasted with Bradley's book, _A Soldier's Story_, which is much more emotional, direct and forthright.But it's easy to see Eisenhower's much broader perspective. He's much more concerned with the issues of organizing and prosecuting the war from the questions of where are we going to get the materials, the ships, the troops, the ammunition, the landing craft, etc., than is Bradley, who is almost completely--again remembering from 27 years ago--involved only with the battles and which division is where.Also, it's often not hard to read between the lines on those occassions when Eisenhower retreats into puff prose, to know what he was really thinking.5 stars, because I don't see how one can understand the military aspect of WWII in western Europe without having read this book."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Eisenhower's \\"Crusade in Europe\\" is a must read for anyone with an interest in WWII. In this book, you can see the European war from the perspective of the man who led the war. What many considered Eisenhower's greatest asset, the diplomatic manner that helped the Americans and British function as one Allied team, is also very apparent in this book.Eisenhower's story, written just a few years after the war ended, gives the reader a great high-level perspective on the war. He mentions his staff work with the War Department at the beginning of the war before being posted to Europe, and then the balance of the book covers the Mediterranean and European campaigns against the Germans. This isn't a comprehensive history of the war in Europe (for example, he covers Operation Market-Garden in three paragraphs), but instead more of a general overview from Eisenhower's perspective.Many consider Eisenhower's diplomatic skills - his ability to lead a multi-national organization - as his greatest asset and the reason he was chosen to lead the Allied Armies in Europe. Eisenhower carried this over into his book: he is never critical of any of his subordinates, defends all of their actions and beliefs (even when Eisenhower disagreed or overruled them), and never even mentions specific names in the couple of instances where he says that commanders were relieved. While this is certainly a laudable trait in a leader, it doesn't make this a particularly insightful book.Although \\"Crusade in Europe\\" lacks that hard-hitting punch, Eisenhower does tell some entertaining and fun personal stories. Because of these stories and Eisenhower's unique perspective on the war, I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in World War II."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"General Eisenhower presents a very unique perspective on the ETO throughout Crusade in Europe since he was the one and only Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre. In his role as Commander, he was privy to a vast array of the decision making discussions that took place to create the Allied strategy against Nazi Germany. In this book, he brings to light a lot of the strategic thinking and planning that went into the Allied victory in WWII. Therefore, I would consider this book required reading for anyone interested in WWII history.Having said that, I think that the book does fall short of its objective for two main reasons. First, Ike is hesitant to criticize other leaders for bad decisions, and tactical mistakes. For instance, Ike blames the lack of success in Operation Market Garden more on the weather than the ill conceived plan that Monty used to execute this daring mission. Secondly, Ike does not display much emotion when telling the tale. For example, when Ike talks about the Battle of the Bulge, he infurs that the Allies expected the attack, and felt almost no panic when it came. If you look at books from others involved in the fighting, you get a much different perspective.Overall, I enjoyed this book and wished I could give it 5 stars. It should be a 5-star book, because of the unique position that Ike fulfilled in the ETO. Instead, I give it 4 stars, but highly recommend it to anyone interested in WWII history."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Very good book for someone seeking the view of the War in Europe from Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, essentially the CEO of the war in the west. Not a ghostwritten account, and at times it's difficult to keep straight the one-star and two-star generals, as Ike mentions the name, what he did, and whether he was British, Canadian, or American. A professionial writer (although this is still a very readable book) would add a physical desription, and when the name comes up again, that writer would refer to him as \\"the British general.\\"I read Churchill's \\"Second World War\\" before this, and it's interesting to see Churchill's various rebuttals to criticisms by Ike of the Prime Minister. (There weren't that many of them).One almost comical account was Churchill's insistance that he visit the Normandy beaches--on D-Day! Luckily, King George stepped in and resolved the situation and kept the 69 year-old Prime Minister in London on June 6.Ike does a pretty good job of keeping the Zeus-like egos of Montgomery, Patton and DeGaulle in check, too.In my opinion, Eisenhower doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, as just getting a force of the size of the Allied Expeditionary Force supplied with ammnuniton, fuel, food and the like was a monumental task."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This should be required reading in high schools and universities. The description of battles is not the primary focus. The book is about the political and military personalities, the political and economic considerations, the benefits and problems of press coverage, risk management, planning and preparation, limitations of material and transportation, the justification of risking lives, military vs. social issues, the impossibility of knowing everything and always being right, individual efforts (from generals to troops), the consequences of weather, seasonal considerations, the importance of unified command, team building, and morale. Morale is critical, requiring many factors and constant effort.It is the fleshed out, rounded picture of war and people that makes it interesting. Of course, he is an politically astute, or he would not have been able to do the job; so, he doesn't really give the dirt on people even while indicating problems.He fully understands the critical issues of logistics and the productive capacity of a nation at war. (For an even deeper understanding of this, and how it fails under dictatorships from ancient Sparta and Rome to modern Germany and Japan, see the chapter, \\"The Energy Circuit in Wartime,\\" in Paterson's \\"The God of the Machine.\\")Given the various failures and miscalculations of large operations, the reader can easily imagine that given the attitudes of modern press coverage of Iraq by shallow minded news anchors and politicians, neither Eisenhower, nor Bradly, nor Montgomery, nor Patton would have been able to keep their jobs.One lesson: It takes months, even years to properly plan and prepare for major military operations, depending on the strength of the enemy. In this case, from the need to design and build new types of landing craft to the need for feeding the civilians of Europe."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I inherited this book from my father-in-law. I did not expect to read it, but once I began, the book is so absorbing I had to finish it. In addition to a rigorous history book (it has detailed footnotes, glossary and appendices), I felt I began to know Dwight Eisenhower as a person. I ordered another book to learn more about him. A very personal account of his experiences as Supreme Allied Commander. If you are completely unfamiliar with military maneuvers and strategy, the book may seem a little dry at times. The glossary and appendices will help to understand the war strategy. Nonetheless, if you are a student of history and WWII in particular, this book is a 'must-read' in my opinion."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I'm a lover of history. To make it short, any one who enjoys history must read this book. This book is over 60 years old as I am. I'm sure glad I bought the book. There are great maps to look at while your reading it and answers to many questions that I always wondered about. Such as the daylight bombings and why the americans did it and the english did the night bombings, etc. I always wondered what Gen. Eisenhower's thoughts were about Mr. Churchill and especially Montgomery and De Gaulle. It's all in the book. It's a must read."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This memoir is a must-read for anyone interested in the ETO. It elucidates Ike's thought process that went into planning Allied operations and demonstrates just how delicately all the personality and diplomatic issues had to be handled, such as the French government in North Africa, the unpredictable but indispensable Patton, and the British allies.Unlike other high ranking generals' memoirs, Ike does little here to glorify himself. He candidly admits that the only time during the war that he donned his steel helmet was in February, 1945, when a German jet fighter appeared overhead. He also modestly blames himself for early setbacks in North Africa, when he pushed too quickly for the capture of Tunis, and he states that the decision to leave only four divisions along the Ardennes front was his alone.There are many memorable anecdotes, not the least of which is Marshal Zhukov's explanation of Red Army tactics in dealing with minefields.The only real disingenuous episode I found was Ike's refusal to meet with Von Armin after the Germans' surrender in North Africa. He says that the war was too personal for him to honor the old tradition of the defeated general calling on the victorious general. One must believe that Patton would have leapt at the chance to meet with his vanquished counterpart. Ike also says that Rommel left North Africa before the surrender to \\"save his own skin,\\" when Rommel left the same way Macarthur, Ike's old boss, left the Philippines."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"A very exciting tale of how America came to help Europe winning the world war II, starting from very limited armed forces in 1940 (something not so much known), then becoming the giant which destroyed the Nazi armies.This is really a book of reference, together with W.Churchill memories where we see most great actors grow up and act: Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, etc...The successive battles and the problematics (for example logistical problems) are described very well, many maps help to understand - Thank you Ike !"},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"It's funny how Republicans keep finding Presidents that contemporaries mock for their apparent lack of depth. Ike was saddled with an image not all that different from Reagan's: the amiable simpleton. Then there's \\"W\\". If anyone still thinks that way about Ike, they should read this book. General Eisenhower's account goes a long way toward explaining the post-war world, how Europe was left in its divided state by facts on the ground and not by timidity or naivete on the allies' part. Ike's version of the European war helps us understand how the USSR would inevitably establish hegemony in eastern/central Europe. I would recommend buying an old copy even though it will be in shabby condition. The maps in my 1948 edition are beautiful."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Maybe someone would correct me, but it is my impression that he really wrote this - it does not have the feel of the ghost writer that often comes in to provide the voice-over for the great man.The personality that comes through is quite similar to that which Eisenhower conveyed in public. Able. Able to create consensus. A listener. Casual. Hands in back pockets. Stern if need be. Analytical. Concerned for his troops.But most of all the sense emerges of Eisenhower being a modern organization man.The job for America beginning in 1940 [when Eisenhower is still a colonel] was to mobilize. Eisenhower proved adept at understanding this, and gradually - but not too gradually - bringing the forces to bear. He appreciated amphibious war, tank war, and air war. He came to appreciate all these over many years of basically boring assignments. He also was dedicated to the notion of an allied force, and ready to negotiate through fields of politic and diplomacy to make that work, while enforcing a system of single command in Europe. He worked well with George Marshal [his mentor and patron], Winston Churchill, Bernard Montgomery, George Patton, and Omar Bradley.And all these things come through crystal clear in Crusade in Europe like a memo from one same man in a mad battlefield.There is a style of work that culls general's writings, histories, and biographies to find wisdom of war that can be useful today for business leaders. Gee, I wonder why. Somehow, as far as I know, the great World War II leader Eisenhower has not been identified for this treatment. Which is kind of funny. Lee and Patton have been cited so, almost unto nausea. But neither of them have the traits of the modern organization man.Eisenhower was asked to create a general line of action mere days after Pearl Harbor.Not brazen was Ike. Looking at the charter to lead. \\"The question before me was unlimited in its implications and my qualifications for approaching it were probably those of the average hard-working Army officer of my age.\\"He'd gained over years of staff work an understanding of technology as applied to war making. \\"..I had been forced to examine world-wide military matters and to study concretely such subjects as the mobilization and composition of armies, the role of air forces and navies in war, tendencies toward mechanization, an the acute dependence of all elements of military life upon the industrial capacity of the nation. This last was to me of especial importance because of my intense belief that the large-scale motorization and mechanization and the development of air forces in unprecedented strength would characterize successful military forces of the future. ... I knew that any sane preparation for war involved also sound plans for the prompt mobilization of industry. The years devoted to work of this kind opened up to me an almost new world.\\" P.19This is where the story gets going. And he carries the narrative steadily until Hitler's final defeat."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This book is required reading for those interested in World War II history, it took me 20 years to get around to it and am glad I did. Written when most of the principles were still alive (Monty, Clark, Bradley), it is less than frank and open. However, it is an interesting compendium of WWII history as told from the Cat Bird's Seat. Ike was not a great general, but he was a hell of a manager of men and logistics. This is a very good book and all folks interested in WWII need to read it."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"While I can certainly appreciate the political problems Dwight David Eisenhower had to deal with while executing the liberation of Europe, I find this, his own description of D-DAY to VE-DAY quite wanting in the historical perspective.There is little doubt that being between FDR, Marshall and Churchill was quite a daunting assignment. What is most intriguing about Ike's account of the lengths The US War Department went to help Bataan is just how many pages Ike devotes to apologizing for virtually abandoning it. Is there a new study on why the US Defense Department abandoned Bataan here?Are the facts as Ike spelled them out, a coverup?Much of this book has been repeatedly cited in the numerous WWIIEuropean war studies that have come out since its initial publication. Ike's prose is elegant and witty. It is a good read if you are interested in Ike's opinions on his military staff and his personal war experiences. But as a study on the European and African theatres of WWII it lacks scholarship.But, if you were going to run as a candidate for President of the United States(or was being drafted by the Republicans and Democrats at the time), this is sure a nice book to base a Presidential campaign on."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I grew up believing in a caricature of President Eisenhower as the emblem of conservative Republicanism. That caricature may or may not have been true, but the last chapter of Eisenhower's \\"Crusade in Europe\\" is a far cry from the conservatism of today.In it, Eisenhower notes that applying Allied battlefield concepts of unity of purpose and execution to the United Nations would result in a form of federated world government. Recognizing that this was unacceptable to the Allies, he seems to regretfully note that the next best thing was mutual understanding and cooperation for the common good in the administration of Berlin. Throughout this final chapter, titled \\"Russia,\\" Eisenhower discusses international cooperation and coexistence with communism in the words of a statesman steeped in wisdom, experience, and foresight.No sharper contrast could be drawn with Eisenhower's world view, one in which adversaries competed and cooperated in a sphere of mutual respect, than with the Republican orthodoxy of 2008. This book reveals Eisenhower's great contempt for war as a political means, and there is only one point in more than 500 pages where he expresses \\"glee\\" at winning a battle. The strong tinge of liberal idealism that streaks many pages of this book make Eisenhower's appointment of Earl Warren to the Supreme Court and his defense of desegregation by calling out the National Guard much more understandable.The next to last chapter, \\"Operation Study,\\" is an extraordinary summation of Eisenhower's appreciation for combat trauma and caring for the individual soldier. His understanding of PTSD when it was still called \\"nerves,\\" \\"shell shock,\\" and \\"cowardice\\" reveals a commander who truly believed that battlefield success depended on constant attention to the mental health of the soldier. Eisenhower's treatment of Patton's \\"slapping incident\\" lays the groundwork early on for this prescient and insightful chapter. Throughout the book Eisenhower remarks on his interaction with the troops, and his understanding of morale is 21st Century in its emphasis on positive psychology rather than terror and the discipline of fear.Unfortunately for the reader, President Eisenhower was a logistical writer, stolidly building sentences with workmanlike, effective, and predictable ideas. This makes for a kind of infantry slog across a soggy beachhead of text, but the path that's laid out never breaks down and takes you to a very satisfying end.While failing to draw attention to himself as he methodically recognizes all those upon whom he depended, he nevertheless leaves the reader with the image of a logistical, organizational, and diplomatic genius, a leader who worked tirelessly to build consensus but who could ram through his own conclusion when the situation required it."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book was writen by american, general and later president Dwight Eisenhower.This book is at least regular, for today's standards, because it doesn't talks nothing, about some things linked to World War II:1-Has nothing about the computers that broked the Enigma code machine.Yes, ultra was classified, but we aren't in 1948.2-The terrible treatment to german POWs by Eisenhower's men, has no place in this book.Also this book has nothing about terrible famine imposed in Germany by USA,England,etc.3-The giving of hundreds of thousands of german POWs to Soviet Union, for slave labor has no place in this book.4-The failures of americans also, has no place in this book.Even so, this book remains at least regular, 60 years after to be published."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This was certainly an interesting read in 1948 when published, it must be taken with circumspection anytime afterward. It should be remembered that when the book was written many facts about World War II were still classified and Crusade in Europe can only be read with that in mind.Eisenhower outright lies when he denies any 'friendly fire' deaths due to the bombing and sinking of the Liberty ship SS John Harvey, at Bari, Italy, in December 1943.Eisenhower says on page 204: \\"One of the ships was loaded with mustard gas, which we were always forced to carry with us because of uncertainty of German intentions in the use of this weapon. Fortunately the wind was offshore and the escaping gas caused no casualties.\\"According to Rick Atkinson, in his book,The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944 (Liberation Trilogy)there were 617 deaths due to the US mustard gas being released, including 83 allied troops who died, and Eisenhower knew this was true in 1944. The harbor was turned into an inferno of exploding ships, 17 were sunk, and the 1,350 tons of bombs filled with mustard gas on the John Harvey, blew up and sank into the harbor creating a poisonous stew in the air and water. Seamen thrown into the water had their clothes and skin covered with the oily poison. Many with no visible wounds starting dying suddenly starting 18 hours after the attack. To maintain secrecy, doctors were not told about the presence of the gas and the necessity to remove contaminated clothes and wash the skin of the men to prevent them breathing the fumes from their saturated garments. Atkinson mentions that the secrecy surrounding the incident was futile, except to cover the behinds of Allied commanders, because the Germans soon knew what the American public did not know, that Eisenhower was ready to counter in kind any Nazi use of chemicals.A secret board appointed by Eisenhower to investigate the incident in March 1944 confirmed that the mustard gas that had killed hundreds was of US origin. You will find no mention of this by Eisenhower in Crusade in Europe."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This was book I couldn't put down. Yes, I agree with some of the comments by the other two reviewers. It does have a &quot;Norman Rockwell&quot; feel to it but that's Ike; what are you going to do about that? No, it wasn't written too soon. Sure, it can't draw upon tons of declassified material but it's so fresh it more than compensates.Ike also has the unique position of being between the military and the political and of discussing that quite nicely. My one criticism is that at the end Ike gets a little preachy in the &quot;Russia&quot; chapter. But, who cares? It's a great book!"},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This is a straight-forward and honest account of the American build-up and attack on Nazi-occupied Africa and Europe by one of the main military organizers and planners. It is certainly not as exhilarating and inspiring as Winston Churchill's memoirs, but it does rank among one of the major works on World War II by one who was directly involved during those tumultuous years.Eisenhower does come across as one who disdained pomp and ceremony - witness his signing of the surrender by Jodl or his refusal to honour or even partake of coffee with captured enemy officers.At times he does seem to gloss over military blunders, like at Kasserine, but perhaps that is why he was so popular with his colleagues by refusing to dwell and lay blame or assign mistakes. However he does focus more on the prestige of American forces than on the British - and even less on the Canadians.His conversations with Marshall Zhukov at wars end are illuminating in the distinction of human values between these two alleged allies. Zhukov had absolutely no quibbles of sending his own infantry troops to walk through mine fields with no concern as to the human loss. As a contrast, General Patton was humbled for slapping a soldier which Eisenhower discusses.Eisenhower's descriptions of the supply problems after Normandy were indeed interesting. All and all this is a very good read."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This book written by the great man himself was written in 1948 and covers Eisenhower's time from being assigned the invasion known as Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa) to the liberation of Europe.For those interested in WWII, this is a great book to read and compare with Winston Churchill's WWII history for a command eye view of WWII. Unlike the contemporary view of Ike as a man of lesser intelligence, on the contrary, this book was written without the assistance of ghost-writers. Simply said, this book is very enjoyable to read. Clearly, Ike was a man of great intelligence and ability. That fact ought to have been demonstrated with his management of the European War, and the fact that he leapfrogged many other notable staff officers in the pre-war period. Moreover, Ike commanded the greatest army and most complex coalition in history. Furthermore, interestingly, he was the President of Columbia University for two years before running for president! It is interesting how after all those accomplishments, he was labeled a dunce by the contemporary media.At any rate, this book is full of great observations and interesting tidbits about the leaders who commanded the liberation army of Europe and Africa. This is more than a pure military history. For my taste, this book is more interesting because it discusses the problems of command, the logistics of war, and also, and more interestingly, the personalities behind some of the momentous events of the 20th Century.An interesting read by one of the great figures of the 20th Century. The book is a model of writing and circumspection. Truly enjoyable, I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in how complex events are managed and thought of by those partaking in the event."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Eisenhower, contrary to many beliefs, was one of the greatest conquerors of all time. He was a warrior and a national leader. Books about him, like the Ambrose ones, are very interesting and present a good view of the war, yet I have always believed that seeing the war through the eyes of the warrior is the best way. Personally, I don't believe that Ike wanted this book to show emotion, it was meant as a book on the broad picture of the war in Europe. He did a fabulous job of presenting it from the perspective, as he did a fabulous job making decisions during the course of the war. This book is as good, if not better, than Ambrose's works."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Following a visit to the Normandy battlefields, I was drawn to read Eisenhower's memoir, giving his first-hand account of the toimes and events.

A must read for any historian of the twentith century."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Any \\"amateur\\" historian of WWII must read this book by the Commander in Chief of Allied forces. Although Ike isn't a professional writer, the narrative is comprehensive, effortless to read and easy to follow."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I had high hopes for this book but was a bit disappointed. I found the reading to be bland. I had trouble getting motivated to read the book quickly. I found only two chapters to be good reading - the one on planning Overlord; and the chapter about the Russian culture and mentality (and his dealings with the Russians after the war). The book is really about the logistics of running a war; planning invasions; dealing with prima donna personalities; and working around politics (with respect to how certain decisions/events will affect a country's policies/leadership). I think it's worth one read but I would not read it again."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"This is an excellent book, one for all historians and people who have an interest in people who have shaped the World.The book arrived promptly, well packaged and in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"I bought this book to learn about Dwight D. Eisenhower the man, his character, and leadership style. I wanted to understand how a 5 Star General and President rose to success. In this case, the book delivered quite well. The majority of the book is basically a sequenced, somewhat mechanical account of how the Allies rolled back the German forces in Northern Africa, and later, Europe.What I learned about Eisenhower is that the man was an astute judge of others' character. Eisenhower described in his book his dealings with officers and heads of state of various Allied nations and demonstrated, in his insights, how to appropriately deal with controversies. For example, Eisenhower recounts how the British (including Churchill) and French officers (de Gaulle) asserted their national interests more than once, at various stages of the war, which were in conflict with the overall allied war efforts and strategies. Eisenhower demonstrated why he was chosen for Supreme Allied Commander for the war in Europe, by sticking to the overall plans for the war, regardless of other's national interests, but not in spite of them.One of the insights I gained was why Eisenhower was appointed the Supreme Allied Commander over General Patton. My impression of Eisenhower as choice for the head of SHAEF is that this decision was based upon his intellect, his sensivity to allied interests, his ability to select the right men for specific tasks, and his ability to focus on achieving a total victory over the German military. Simply put, Eisenhower thought before he spoke, and was more politically sensible than the hard-driving Patton.Another impression I gained of Eisenhower is that the General was a man of strategy, unlike his chief opponent, Hitler, who wasted his resources and armies in a haphazard way.The last couple of chapters of the book logically conclude with the General's account of how the Germans surrended and the war ended. Interesting are the General's accounts of dealings with the Russian Marshall Zhukov at Berlin and Generalissimo Stalin on a visit to the Soviet Union, after the war. Eisenhower describes the Russian suspicions of the West and its intentions. Eisenhower interestingly relates a two hour private debate with Marshall Zhukov over the merits of American values and communist values.An interesting read and instructional on the proper use of political and military power. I recommend the book on the basis of understanding moral action and leadership in an environment of conflicting interests."},{"Title":"Crusade in Europe","review":"Recommended reading for all individuals who have a stirring passion of the history of World War II and the legends who steared this country to freedom and peace both in the European and Pacific theaters."},{"Title":"Spiritual Properties of Herbs","review":"I originally wanted to give this book three and a half stars, but this is because I was spoiled by the authors other books on gem elixirs and flower essences.

Here is just one quote page 11, \\"Many individuals now on the Earth are coming to know this joy in working with plants, especially through working with herbs. As the spiritual properties of an herb are better known by an individual, that person may decide there is something particularly entrancing and JOYOUS about those properties, about what they are learning from the plant. That is because there is a part of them that is joyous about existence on the Earth. Ultimately, this joyousness is resolved by how the Earth is known more fully. There is always some component of the spiritual side of each herb relating to joyousness of the Earth and acknowledgment of the Earth being.\\"Of course he goes deeply into specific herbs for the healing processes and what we can gain by merging with those specific characteristics.

A typical libertarian science fiction fantasy about a space prison filled with political thought-criminals taking over a luxury space hotel and declaring a new space-republic. Total one-dimensional goofball writing. I can't say it was a guilty pleasure, as it was sort of painful to read something that bad.

Mildly interesting to see how well Evans did.The book is not very satisfactory, though it's not easy to state quite why. I *think* it's because Evans has no real methodology or approach; he just chucks in a collection of items which don't have any logical coherence.He gives a history, such as it is, with the usual suspects, including Turing. (I've been told that none of these pioneering engineer types had ever heard of Turing). He has short term 1980-82, middle term 83-90, and long term (-2000) in three chapters.Remember at the time he wrote, pocket calculators had only just ousted slide rules; and quartz watches were new. Displays were those glowing red things. Liquid crystals weren't invented. Microsoft isn't mentioned - their software in the Apple II (and III) was high tech. Electronic mail existed, but not Internet- though he got keyboard and TV. Evans thought this could be used for voting - as it can, but not for elections.Evans considered the Soviet Union (ceased 1991) might be unstable. (When 20% of a population have phones, they can't be kept down, he quotes - he doesn't consider they might assist civil war or invasion). He assumed the US had immense wealth; also that US technology was far ahead - after all, they got to the moon!I was slightly impressed that he predicted emotional attachment to computers though of programmers - a relatively rare breed. He didn't predict chatrooms, but, influenced by Eliza, thought therapy by program might work.Some of his guesses seem based on other popular books: he thought 'ultra intelligent machines could prolong life to age 1000' - ie things which might measure blood or neoplasms, and even repair them. I just spent about half an hour trying to connect my PC - the idea of Ultra Intelligent Machines can seem a joke.He thought self-diagnosis by machine would be easy; I suspect he underestimated the cavernous ignorance of most people, He thought legal decisions might be computerisable and, though Chomsky isn't mentioned, 'natural language' is. Of course, he had no way of estimating 'complexity' or 'interconnectedness' - if he, or anyone else, had, they might guess quite accurately whether such things could happen, and guess when.Evans thought the working week would reduce, further education would go further, to, say, 25, and retirement ages drop. This seems a middle class view unmediated by awareness of jobs which are not easily mechanisable. (Quite apart from oil shortages etc). He thinks the third world needs education - 'affluence has only sprung up when ignorance has been conquered' - though he only seems to come up with tourism and 'exchange of information' to help them. Education, agriculture, economic planning, and 'climate control' should all help the third world.So - a mixed bag. Not very impressive! Recommended to anyone trying to predict - this book will give you a feel of where you may well go wrong though conscious or unconscious bias - or simple ignorance."},{"Title":"The Baby Dilemma (Harlequin Romance)","review":"I know Harlequin romances are not great literary works but COME ON,at least make an effort. I think the author just ran out of ideas with this one.So the general premise is that the heroine is told by her husband that a woman has popped up and is claiming that he is the father of her child. The heroine (hear by known as Witless) decides to leave her new husband (in the hospital since he's just been in an accident) and divorce him so that he can take care of baby and Baby's Momma. Witless's reasoning for this is that she grew up without a father and didn't want that to happen to the upcoming baby. Of course she makes all these decisions without discussing anything with anyone.So Witless finds out later that Baby's Momma died in the hospital on the delivery table and the Grand momma has taken the child and will not let Daddy see it. Although he doesn't really know if he is the daddy since he only slept with B.M. briefly 8 months prior. Witless rushes back to try to get back together with her soon to be Ex-husband with the lame brain idea of taking the baby away from the Granny (without even actually confirming if the child is her husbands or not) and raising the child together.I do not need to go into why this story is a brainless cop out for someone who probably had a timeline to meet and just puked up on a sheet of paper and sent it into the editor. I've never written a review so mean before but I've also never read anything so infuriating before and that's saying A LOT since I've read a CRAP TON of Harlequins. I'd rather read some tired old trope (since that what this publisher likes to print) written well than some new twist on old premise done horribly.I'm sorry if I've been unnecessarily harsh but *sigh* it's really unbelievable.

This is the best way in my opinion of learning history, by reading about it as a novel and a character that intertwines with the leading movers and shakers of the time.Having run away from England to escape being commissioned in the Navy by his father Christopher, Roger runs away to France rather than face the harsh life of a Royal Navy Midshipman. He takes up life in France with little knowledge of French, but then works his way up the influential and political ladder. The launching of Roger Brook essentially establishes the character and starts off his life in France for the forthcoming novels that will leave you wanting to read them all.Wheatley has a fascinating style of leading you down a path of suspense only to keep you hanging until you think all is lost, only to \\"reel you back in\\".

They all are a fabulous blends of History and Arthurian legend. In this particular book gives a detailed account of Merlyn's life and how he became the wizard we all think of him as. It is a new look at an old legend from a point of view that should have been put to use long before Whyte came along. The change in Merlyn from man of myth and legend like other Arthurian novels to a man of arms with problems and sorrows just like anyone else places this book on a level of its own. Although it is a very long book it is worth nearly every minute. It is a fantasy book, history lesson, and a great way to spend a rainy day all put into one. If you have every fell in love with knights, chivalry, or kings this book will restore that childhood dream or if it never left keep it burning bright. I know it has done so for me. If you ever just want to get away form life and find like me that a book helps this one is great for just that purpose.

This is a very good attempt by the author, Jack Whyte, to describe the possible ancestors, characters, and relationships involved in this enduring story.\\"The Saxon Shore\\" covers the the time period shortly after the birth of Arthur and up to the time when he was approximately 10 years old. The era of history covered by the books has been throughly researched by the author and retains a tone of authenticity as regards the daily life and times of it's many and varied characters. The characters are carefully fleshed-out and if the 'legends' were actually real, this series does a great job in it's speculations as to how and why this story continues to fascinate readers 1,500 years after it's time period.I highly recommend both the series and this particular installment of it to anyone who enjoys a good historical-fiction read.

He is the author of the Camulod series of books and has just had published the first in a trilogy about probably the most famous Order of knights, ever to come through the pages of history, the Knights Templar.This is the fourth volume in the continuation of the Camulod Chronicles a series of novels about the Arthurian legends. But anyone expecting the conventional, or Hollywood slant on the legend of Arthur, i.e. knights riding around on destriers in full body armour, something invented several hundred years after Arthur had gone to his grave, if he ever existed at all, will be in for a sharp shock.The books are set in the 5th century AD a much more likely time for Arthur to have existed, a time when Britain, although free of the Romans, who had gone back across the channel to Rome, was still very much influenced by their occupation.Camulod, a settlement founded by the descendants of both Roman and Celt continues in its development. Arthur has been born and orphaned and is in the care of Merlyn. It is in Camulod that Arthur's mind is fashioned under the teachings of Merlyn.

Whyte has created an interesting approach to the Arthurian legend in placing it within a remnant of Roman Britain but the writing is at best ordinary and, at least this particular book, needs significant editing. (At over 700 pages this one just drags on and on.)I keep reading the series because I enjoy variations on the legend and Whyte may have created something more historically &quot;accurate&quot; than any of the other authors but I don't recommend The Saxon Shore to anyone other than Arthur junkies.

It seems to me childish and petty to attack an author's work simply because you don't like it. I usually don't bother to finish books I don't like, let alone waste time reviewing them. Why would anyone continue to read a book that bores them?I have bought and read all six of Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles: The Skystone; The Singing Sword; Eagle's Brood; The Saxon Shore; Fort at River's Bend and The Sorcerer. It is a great series, and I enjoyed each one of them.It is to be expected that Whyte departs from the (rather sketchy) history Aavailable of the period, in a fiction series. And yet he has done his research, obviously, which is important to me in historical novels.There have been several very good books written about the pre-Arthurian period in England, many of which I've read. Jack Whyte's worked ranks right at the top, with me. I am familiar with what history is available, having read much of the period, and his research effort is obvious.He begins with a couple of Roman legionaires as his protagonists, before the Legions pulled out of England: Publius Varrus and Caius Brittanicus. The series then follows their lives and their family's lives through a series of gripping adventures, as they strive to maintain order and peace on the colony they have created in the South of England.Publius Varrus, a blacksmith, creates a great and beautiful sword from a meteorite before he dies, which he names Excalibur, King Arthur's famous blade. Of course, eventually the series chronicles the lives of Merlyn (Merlin) and Arthur.I was caught up in the story, and I strongly recommend it. It is entertaining and a delightful way to learn a bit of history.

Anyone who is addicted to the Arthur / Merlin stories might enjoy these as well. They do offer another [yet] perspective on that great enigma. That probably won't deter anyone who is a junkie. What is it lacking ? A little of the Magic I think so it doesn't rate as highly as the Cornwall stories nor some of the others. On the other hand it tries to give one a sense of the times as they actually were and does that reasonably well."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Incredibly padded. Every conversation begins with 'what's up?' and the story is in a perspective that is unecessary. Even in the first person, it's impossible to have a full grasp of the character of Merlin.There's nothing to really offer, and any potentially intense moment is overlapped by quick descriptions. Ie. Clear the burburs from the so-and-so town is just 'there were some street fights and two of my guys were wounded and one dead, but all of the enemy was slaughtered, so I recorded it as a victory and then mailed the report to accounting'. It's like listening to somebody's recollection of a videogame. For 'realism' the author picks and chooses which events to describe in greater detail (usually if the protagonist's life is at stake) and the rest is just endless conversations about marriage and the protagonist's sexual feelings for Shelague, which he says he shouldn't feel because he's trying to be celibate because he is lord reagent of camelot and...It gets really tedious and there's a lot of stuff that mostly amounts to nothing. Again, there's hardly any character development except a few social difficulties merlin has to go over (pendragon whathisname says merlin's egotistical and oh no!), his fear of his own sorcerous ways (basically covered with what amounts to 'I'm afraid! Okay? Got it? Cool.'). So from that, the only moral lessons are basically, don't be egotistical, and if you have freaky vision of the future powers, don't announce them to the locals, because they'll lynch you... if you happen to live in 500 AD dark ages.The entire book is filled with bland and emotionless padding. Like was already mentioned by somebody else, if it were shortened 500 pages, it'd be somewhat enjoyable, but it isn't. I'm only continuing to read this because I'm a masochist I guess.5 star reviews of this?

Every time the action and plot seem to be about to catch their groove, instead we get...nothing. Lots of ideas that lead nowhere in particular. And I know Whyte is keeping it readable, but do we really need Arthurian characters approaching each other with a \\"What's up?\\" Bleh.This one was certainly the dullest by far, with little payoff.

( )"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Although this is ostensibly a review of \\"The Saxon Shore\\", it in actuality covers all four books of the series to date (\\"The Skystone\\", \\"The Singing Sword\\", \\"The Eagles' Brood\\", and \\"The Saxon Shore\\"), primarily focusing on the last two, since I've already written a review of the first two. Now, that I've totally lost you, I'll begin again. . .This series, The Camulod Chronicles, outlines the story of King Arthur as it might have been in a historical perspective, beginning with the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If there were such a person as Arthur, he would have lived during this time. Most likely, he was a composite character, based on some of the more influential warlords and petty kings of the day. As an aside, I am reminded of a vacation in southern England that my family took in 1995. My sons, who were 11 and 13 at the time, could not understand my excitement in viewing the ruins of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, asking \\"How can this be the birthplace of someone who never was?\\" But, that's a different story. . .The first two books of the series, which outlined the founding of Camulod (or Camelot) and Avalon and the forging of the sword Excalibur, were told from the viewpoint of an old Roman soldier. These last two books, which detail the birth of Arthur and his early boyhood years, are told from the viewpoint of Merlin, or, \\"Merlyn\\" in the Chronicles. As an avid reader of Arthurian legend and all its various retellings, let me tell you that the character of Merlin is probably one of the most varied of them all, probably due to the fact that he was actually a minor character in Mallory. Hence, the details are free to be filled in by the current chronicler. Merlin ranges from an evil wizard living backward in time to a benevolent sorcerer to merely a human being who is just a little smarter than most. The most esoteric version of Merlin can be found in Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle in which Merlin is the son of Charis, the last princess of Atlantis, and Taliesen, the greatest of the Celtic Bards. Except for the exotic birth, Jack Whyte's Merlyn has much in common with Lawhead's Merlin in that both were mortal men, though a little larger than life in that they were fierce warriors, outstanding field generals, and outstanding scholars. Also, neither possessed the true gift of magic, though they were believed to by the masses of humanity.The Camulod Chronicles begin earlier than Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\", in a time that historically did occur, hence the tales carry an air of realism. The descriptions of the Roman influence on Britain in the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries are fascinating. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, but the pages just keep on turning. The story is easy to follow as well as fun. There are those critics who complain that some of the dates given are inaccurate, as well as some of the situations. As Don Henley sang, \\"Get over it.\\" This is historical *fiction* at it's finest, with the emphasis on *fiction*. Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is. The only \\"disconcerting\\" thing I've found so far is that the character of Vortigern (who was an actual person, by the way) is far more sympathetic in these tales than in others I've read. But, then, Jack Whyte has turned out such a magnum opus that I can only admire and respect his poetic license.I have begun the fifth book of the series, \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\" and the level has not dropped. I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them (book 6 is in print and book 7 is due to be published later this year). So far, I consider this to be among the best Arthurian series' I have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone who has an interest in the Arthurian legend, anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, or both. As a bonus, anyone who likes these books would most likely like Stephen Lawhaead's Pendragon Cycle and Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy. The order you read them in is not important, though somewhere in the mix you should read Mallory to see where it all began. I love Arthurian fiction and fact, and, after reading these books, I'm sure a lot of the rest of you will, too."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"While I enjoyed book 4 in this series,I can't help but feel that this is just a bridge between the days of the colony and what is obviously about to follow in book 5.The scenes are graphic and very well written and I have never before read historical works which spring to life in such reality.Mr Whyte is without doubt a master story teller but I just wanted to hurry through this one to get to &quot;The Fort at River Bend&quot; (which fortunately,I already possessed)"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend.

I had to write a whole new one when I realized my mistake. Oops!* The hardest part for me, in this novel, was the complete character change-over from the earlier books in the Camulod Chronicles series. In the previous book, &quot;The Eagle's Brood&quot;, many of the older characters from &quot;Skystone&quot; and &quot;Singing Sword&quot; still lived on, and played an important role. In this book however, the reader must get used to a complete lack of our old favorites. While good, this book is a slower read then the rest, while by no means boring. Merlyn and Uther prove very fascinating characters, full of grit and integrity, but flawed, like all of Whyte's characters. This is part of what makes his books so orginal, fresh, and delicious.

Jack provides a feeling of plausibility that makes me feel that I am not merely letting imagination fly, but rather exercising my imagination, to explore the possibility that legends could be based on a foundation of some factual events.Any criticism as you have vented here, is no more than weak verbal attack as would be made in a school yard spat. True constructive criticism requires a strong backing of counter evidence to show why and how the failings have occurred. To simply state that one is wrong or inadequate, without providing substantiated reasoning, places the accuser in the position of fighting with emotion rather than fact.Jack has opened our minds to the fact that entertainment can also be a learning experience. One can challenge our selves to believe without straying to fantasy or far out science fiction. We can question the dismissal of old legends as pure fantasy. If in fact we can once again believe in that fact that the heros of legend might have been real people, maybe their virtues could also have been real. These virtues are something that all of us need an ability to revive once again."},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"I have read many books about Arthurian lore. The Camulod chronicles are by far the quintesential embodiment of a truly page-turning series. Realistic characters unencumbered by aimless fantasy and unrealistic sorcerey give The Camulod Chronicles what the Arthurian legend has been lacking for centuries;Humanity,and believable plot progression. Caius Merlyn Brittanicus is to be praised as the most respectable and admirable embodiment of young Arthur's guardian ever. Whyte's books have explained in a clever and plausible fashion many of the confusing mysteries of the Arthurian realm, such as the connection between Excalibur and the mysterious Lady of the Lake. Magnificent! Our only hope is that Jack Whyte will grace us with more installments of the Arthurian legacy. Three cheers for Jack Whyte!"},{"Title":"The Saxon Shore (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 4)","review":"I have to wonder to myself why I even bother to continue reading this man's work (see my previous reviews of the earlier volumes). If he wrote purely as fantasy the world would pass him off as a hack, but as a writer of historical fiction he should be drummed out of the club. Has the man never read even the basics of Celtic culture? Surely with all the hundreds of books available on the subject he should be able to find something! His knowledge of the era is fascinatingly scanty and he fills it in with such wild speculation that one is tempted to believe tha aliens are at work. The plot, once again, happens -- there is no reason for anything to happen, but it happens anyway. The characters are caricatures. The relation to the Arthurian legends is even scantier then the relation to history. This man is an awful writer.

In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler: in no real way does the story get advanced. Arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy. There are adventures, but nothing important happens. As usual, in Whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters. With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in Camelot. Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship. So go for it. But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A.

I am a teacher of 3 year olds, and my class truly loved the book. I wanted to give them all a copy. Everyday during reading time, they would race to get one of the copies off of the shelf. They would read to one another. Most importantly they were reading, at least they thought they were, and that is a big step in teaching reading. I have been searching high and low for this book, for my own child. I was very happy to see, you have it in the big book version also. Each page add a new animal, which the children usually know by this age. Each animal is a different color. The color name and the animal name are written in the same color as the animal, so you can easily look at the words and know the color and then look at the animals and know the word for the animal. The story is very sweet. We talk about the picture and what the animals are doing. You think for a minute the ending will be sad, but it turns out to be happy. Giving a somewhat surprise.

This theodicy is essential for defending the Christian faith and theism.Merton Lee highlights that God is all-knowing, all-good and all-powerful. His Omniscience (Supreme Wisdom) and Omnipotence (Supreme Power) are infinite. They do not need to be supplemented by the existence of the visible world and human beings.But God is also the divine timeless Dimension. In the timeless non-manifest Dimension, God does not have the opportunity to experience the dynamic moral experiences which require the interactions of individual embodied beings in a visible world where they can make moral decisions and perform morally good deeds. Thus, God's purity and moral excellence are non-dynamic in the timeless dimension. This is God's natural ontological attribute and not a shortcoming.Thus God decided to create this visible world and individuate His cosmic consciousness into small units and live in each human being to undergo trials, suffering and spiritual cultivation. This is to enable God to experience and acquire dynamic moral goodness and excellence in the visible world."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"c.s. lewis answers some of the hardest/most troubling questions of life herein.I would recommend for anyone dealing with lose or hardship (which of course is universal and unavoidable)"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"A virtual classic.

Lewis is one of the top two Christian authors of the last two hundred years (the other is Francis Schaeffer). His book, Mere Christianity, is perhaps the leading classic book stating the case for the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and what it means to those who believe and sincerely invite the living Christ into their hearts. In the Problem of Pain, this great author, inspired by the Holy Spirit, tackles the question which has caused doubt among Believers, and is used by opponents of the Gospel to argue against its truth and credibility. Why do apparently &#34;good&#34; people get cancer, are victims of horribly violent crimes, and suffer from all kinds of other tragedy? How could a good and loving God allow the Holocaust to occur to his &#34;chosen people&#34;? How could God allow babies or infants to die before old enough to commit conscious sin, or even make an intelligent decision to believe in Christ as one's personal Lord and Savior? This book, with Lewis' prose and profound writing, explains the answers to these questions in a logical fashion, but one which will resonate with your heart and the Holy Spirit who dwells in all Believers. It is too profound and inspired of God to review. But in the opinion of this avid reader and Christian, Jewish lawyer, The Problem of Pain represents the finest work on this difficult topic. It is deep as C.S. Lewis is not a sports writer (and I love sports). But if you allow yourself to fully immerse yourself in the depths of this God inspired, great book, you will draw closer to God, and at least have some ability to understand one of life's great mysteries."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis at his best, tackling the issue of pain and Christianity and why the two must co-exist.

It helps to know some of the things disclosed. I know that I am not alone but it is important to know that there is not only reason for pain but that there will one day be an end to it. C. S. Lewis writes clearly but sometimes I have to reread portions because he is better educated and speaks a bit above me. He is well worth the time invested in rereading.Thank you,Sals"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"CS Lewis was a master at making complicated theological questions make sense. In this short work, he tackles what is perhaps one of his most difficult subjects yet. Why does pain exist? If there is a God, and he is benevolent, why does he allow his creatures to feel both physical and mental anguish? The answer, as Lewis sees it, is simple, though the explanation for it may not be. Because he loves us.In this book, Lewis shows how God molds us through our afflictions, and how he actually works toward our greater good by allowing us to experience pain and misfortune, that we may be more willing to give of our own free will back to him. It is through pain, says Lewis, that God can guide us back to Heaven.Lewis continues the argument made in many others of his books: that no one goes to Heaven or Hell without choosing to. God guides us by allowing us to experience pain, but it is our choice whether we choose to submit to His will or not. And no one will go to Hell without having first refused the helping hand. As Lewis says, the gates of Hell will be locked from the inside.This is some of the simplest, yet most beautiful theology around, expounded by a man who's humility made him always refer to himself as a \`layman.' If you're a fan of other Lewis works, pick this one up--you won't be disappointed. And if you're just looking for some good Christian reading material, with great insight, then you won't want to miss CS Lewis's the Problem of Pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"&quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; contains such extraordinary spiritual nourishment. Through the process of wrestling with the role of pain, Lewis gives a truly inspirational explanation of the interaction between God and humans (while also giving wonderfully realistic descriptions of most Christians' struggles!) That said, I would agree with reviewers who said that this book in *not* particularly comforting for those suffering from great grief (Lewis himself said much the same, late in his life.)This book has given me so much encouragement and, at the same time, challenged me greatly. I am a better Christian for having read it. My copy is underlined, often quoted, and much loved."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis offers a brilliant defense of Christian theism despite the pain in the world in this brief book. Combining sharp thinking and excellent prose, this book is highly recommended for Christians and non-Christians alike.Lewis's arguments are similar to many theodicies (defenses of God's existence despite suffering) developed by great Christian thinkers past and present. Man's suffering is in fact a result of free will, not an original creation of God. And suffering continues to result due to the evil wills and deeds of men. As Lewis observes, \\"When souls become wicked they will certainly use this possibility to hurt one another; and this, perhaps, accounts for four-fifths of the sufferings of men.\\" If men are to have any significant free will at all, the bad consequences of evil deeds must be allowed.This, of course, leaves the problem of so-called natural evil. Lewis contends that such evil and pain are necessary for our own repentance. In order to recognize our sins and ask God for forgiveness (and thus restore the proper relationship between created and Creator) we humans must be awoken with pain and suffering. Pain shatters the notion that what we have is ours and is good enough.The Problem of Pain, despite its brevity, covers a great deal of ground, including a defense of the doctrine of the fall and the doctrines of heaven and hell. All throughout, Lewis's writing style is accessible and convincing. For a powerful defense of Christian theism in the face of a cruel world, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This beautiful little book is on a par with the author's well-known classic Mere Christianity, as it addresses many profound questions that those in search of truth must have grappled with. Lewis was not an academic theologian so he writes for the ordinary person, which makes his words easy to understand.The introduction deals with the 3 elements found in all developed religions: The experience of the Numinous (A sense of awe), the Sense of Morality, and the Numinous as the Guardian of Morality. Christianity contains a fourth element: A Redeemer who reconciles fallen mankind to the Righteous God.The chapter Divine Omnipotence places the problem in context: God's goodness against the problem of suffering. How can a loving God allow this? Here Lewis discusses the implications of free will and co-existence in a common medium or external world. The next chapter, Divine Goodness, deals with the nature of divine love. Love is sterner and more splendid than mere kindness. Simple happiness in the here and now is not what God has in mind. Love may cause pain but only in order to alter and improve the object of love.The chapter Human Wickedness looks at the state of the human psyche. Our character is, in its current state, not well. Lewis discusses our problems by examining a set of 8 very prevalent illusions. Following from this, The Fall Of Man investigates the abuse of free will while at the same time refuting Monism and Dualism. He suggests that the fall represented humanity's loss of status as a species, and that a new species had then willed itself into existence. But remedial or corrective good exists even in our present debased condition.The next two chapters deal with Human Pain. When souls become wicked they will use free will to harm one another. The human will becomes truly creative only when it aligns itself with the will of God. Christianity demands that we correct a misdirection of our nature. The author advances 6 propositions that are necessary to complete the understanding of human suffering.The chapter titled Hell addresses the seemingly cruel doctrine of hell. Pain mostly leads to redemption but may unfortunately also lead to unrepentant rebellion. This means that some individuals will ultimately prefer darkness to light. The author also discusses the apparent disproportion between eternal damnation and transitory sin, pointing out that some souls do not want to be forgiven.The chapter Animal Pain is speculation as Lewis admits, but such fascinating and plausible possibilities are presented here. If you love your pets and animals in general, be sure to read it! It will give you hope and peace of mind as to the mercy and justice of a righteous God.The chapter titled Heaven contains more speculation but of a most awesome, gripping and mind expanding nature. Lewis explores the idea of an eternal special relationship of each individual soul with the Divine Majesty, an eternal dance of joy in splendid diversity. This is not the unconscious nirvana of Pantheism but a condition of maximum distinctiveness of the individual in a higher form reunited with God.The Appendix is a note on the observed effects of mental and physical pain, supplied by R Havard, MD, from clinical experience. The Problem Of Pain is filled with compassion and illuminating insight. It is highly instructive and edifying, making a convincing case for the profound meaning of life. In addition, it is the perfect antidote for the hedonism and nihilism that are running rampant in the world today."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I would love this book, but the Kindle edition is horrible! It's like they did a global search for \\"its\\" and replaced it with \\"it's\\" throughout the whole thing. \\"It's\\" unbelievably annoying."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The first book of CS Lewis I read was \\"Mere Christianity\\" and I was profoundly stunned by how effective and witty he could be in his explanation of Christianity and Christian doctrine. So it was with eagerness that I devoted myself to the reading of this book.And I was not disappointed in the least. The problem of pain is tightly linked with that of evil, in a world supposedly created and led by God. This is one of the most common, and most important, issues in theology, and I dare say, in everybody's life, provided they're somewhat curious about the world they live in. Justifying God on the counts of evil and pain is called theodicy, if I'm not mistaken, and that is what Lewis does in this book, but he does much more.He deals with the basic problem I just mentioned, how could there be a good God when we live in such a wretched world, but he goes further and treats the human nature as \\"fallen\\", and that in a very interesting manner, not your silly Adam & Eve story taken literally (and by \\"silly\\" I don't mean the actual myth of Adam & Eve, just the literal taking of it).Lewis tackles even such a complicated issue as animal pain and the condition of animals in Christianity. That shows quite some bravery.One chapter is devoted to Hell, and another to Heaven, and either are really amazing prowess of theology. I'm no specialist of theology, but Lewis has a true gift in explaining of all this in a very clear fashion. He truly makes theology a thrilling matter!After having read \\"Mere Christianity\\" and \\"The Problem of Pain\\", I'm absolutely convinced that I will get to read everything he wrote on theology, Christianity, and the likes. Regardless of your actual faith or lack thereof, you will find this book (or these books) worth your while. If you're interested in such things, please do yourself a favour and purchase those profoundly marvelous books."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This is one of Lewis's landmark books that should be read by anyone who ever has difficulty of coming to terms with a loving God who allows/initiates pain in the lives of the ones He lovesNeedless to say, this book does a wonderful job of shifting the perspective off of pain as something that hurts us and has absolutely no value whatsoever to the reality that we experience pain for a reason. Physically, we experience pain in order to prevent us from repeating a mistake. Like the example of leaving your hand on a hot pan; the heat and pain you experience is your body's way of telling you that if you leave it there longer it might result in irreparable harm. Thus, what value might emotional or spiritual pain have for us as well? This is where Lewis examines thoroughly.I love the fact that despite proving a very rational and profound point about pain that Lewis, still, basically says that some pain...just hurts, which is life. But that there is always an opportunity for growth whenever, if not because, pain is present in our lives.This can honestly open up your eyes and possibly shift your thinking or way of seeing things if you really read it as it is intended to be read. Though, Lewis is one of those writers that you either get or don't get.Much like J.G. Marking's \\"A Voice Is Calling,\\" however much you put into this book is how much you will get out of it because the sheer depth and power of \\"Problem of Pain\\" is in its intimacy with the reader and its ability to express a cathartic exhale for the reader.With his influence on new, contemporary writers, many of which draw comparisons to Lewis because of style or ability, see J.G. Marking above, it is not difficult to see why Lewis was labeled as the most influential thinker/writer of the 20th century and why he will continue into the 21st as well."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Not the best place to start if you want to see the strongest logical underpinnings of Christianity (_Miracles: A Preliminary Study_, post-1960 edition, would be the best; _Mere Christianity_ would be the most popular and easiest to digest). However, _The Problem of Pain_ (TPoP) does fully address the most popular theological question of all: if there's a good God, then why do we suffer? The question is deep, and the answers here are logically strong (although any serious sceptic of Christianity will probably rankle at them... go read one of the other two books, first!&lt;g&gt;) This is not a book to read if you've just suffered a personal disaster and want to be comforted (although Lewis himself published the final edition of the book just after his wife's death from bone cancer.) It is, however, an essential book for Christians who want to be forearmed in advance when tragedy strikes: remember that strength of will is an intellectual asset that must be developed unless you're a prodigy, and that our reason is our prime (perhaps only) defense against the overwhelming sorrow of our personal tragedies. Lewis' book places the answers squarely within Christian perceptions, and any ideas in the book should be acceptable to members of any denomination. I'll gladly field any questions or comments (or corrections&lt;g&gt;) at the above address, but take note: hatemail will be immediately deleted (so be polite!&lt;G&gt;), and sceptical non-Christians will probably be referred back to one of the earlier books (which I'll also gladly help out on.)

Not, perhaps, since St. Augustine has there been so approachable a writer coupled with such a penetrating intellect.And both Augustine and Lewis share the common trait of reaching, perhaps, too far. In Augustine's case, it was over-reliance on questionable data, such as the reports of the pheonix and the fire-salamander, or the sybillene prophecies. For Lewis, it is a tendency to get stuck in arguing from the general to the specific, on those particularly thorny issues.In \\"The Problem of Pain\\", Lewis takes on one of the thorniest issues possible, and the one on which the Judeo-Christian religions are most often attacked: the reconciliation of a loving, all-powerful God with suffering. As he states in chapter four, this is a daunting problem, particularly for modern man and his predisposition to EXPECT salvation: \\"It was against [a background of fear] that the Gospel appeared as good news... Christianity now has to preach the diagnosis - in itself very bad news - before it can win a hearing for the cure.\\"Lewis' apologetic can hardly be termed a \\"defense\\" of the faith. Rather, he sets out not to solve the problem of pain, but to frame pain and suffering the larger picture of existence. As Lewis repeatedly points out, if you're going to accept certain realities about the world, including our own sensation and reason, then you're going to have to recognize that pain is a necessity. It is part of the system and intrinsically tied to free will and human choice.In butressing this argument, Lewis does an admirable job envisioning \\"paradisal man\\", while freely admitting that his view of it is a construction. Later, he extends his imagery to Hell, and that most bitter of problems (with which Augustine also struggled) of salvation that is not extended to all. Lewis argues around the issue of annihlation vs. eternal torment, and comes off rather well (I think).The only really disappointing part of his analysis is when he addresses pain in animals. In having mastered the general problem of pain, he begins to extend his model to individual cases. And while I am sure that the solution to suffering in animals is consistent with his model, I am also unconvinced that Lewis applies his own model effectively to the animal case. This chapter is clearly the weakest of the book.It also puts one in mind that Lewis rarely addresses the specific problem of Children, a case on which many a good theory has been wrecked. While it is fair to say that the lack of a fully developed intellect should have little bearing on grace and salvation, I'm afraid that the issues of infant vs. adult baptism, heaven, hell, purgatory and limbo all make unwelcome intrusions into the problem of pain. Still, I'm rather glad that Lewis avoided this question (whether intentionally or not), since the analysis of animal suffering was so unsatisfying.But I have spent too much time on very minor complaints. I cannot say that there were great revelations in \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" but at the same time, Lewis' writing is so cohesive and convincing that he helps establish a Christian \\"world-view\\" that the modern world seeks to root out.I couldn't help thinking of the Indonesian Tsunami and the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans as I read The Problem of Pain. It seemed clear to me that 98% of the pundits and commentators who have wrung their hands over these disasters have given virtually no thought to this problem, or the solution offered by Lewis on behalf of Christian theology. This is unfortunate, because pain (suffering) is one of the most intrinsic, inescapable, and anentropic aspects of life.I offer here the platitude that \\"suffering is the most valuable thing that nobody wants\\" (myself and Lewis included)."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In an earlier review of this work, I noted that the material should be acceptable to any Christian denomination. This is not exactly true, as there are a few denominations which deny the existence of free will... a main staple of Lewis' apologetica. A member of these congregations reading any of Lewis' work will either reject his conclusions, or be convinced by him that free will actually exists in a Christian context (thus probably removing the reader from that congregation.) TPoP does not bother arguing in favor of free will; so members of these congregations will not be likely to get anything useful out of it. (Lewis' best treatment of the free will issue is probably in the 2nd edition of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_.)On the related issue of predestination: Lewis uses a modified version of this theory which transcends the limitations of predestination (ie, providing for free will) while concurrently keeping the idea of God as omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent. Denominations where predestination is not an issue will find Lewis easy to deal with. Denominations where predestination is definitely an issue will have a tougher time, as Lewis' ideas on the matter are very complicated. As someone who has believed in predestination, I can vouch that Lewis' work keeps the essentials while solving most (perhaps all) of the philosophical problems... it has worked for me.&lt;g&gt;Finally, Lewis' major work does not largely reflect his Anglicanism; in fact, he caught a lot of heat from some Anglican clergy because of this. M:aPS, MC and TPoP are written from a non-denominational standpoint, which is why I wrote that any denomination will find them useful, and which is what Lewis specifically intended. However, there are very many Christian denominations in the world--every Baptist church, for instance, has the potential to be its own 'denomination' if it wishes--so please take this recommendation as the generalization it was intended to be, not in a rigorous sense."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book is a well-reasoned and beautifully-written explanation of the nature of God; the nature of humans and the role of pain and suffering in the relationship between God and humans. Although it lacks feeling, this is not a flaw. Its purpose is to touch the mind, not the heart. And this C.S. Lewis does brilliantly.Lewis' begins by giving us a context on the nature of both God and humans. In brief, he says that what we know as \\"human\\" is not really human at all--at least not the \\"human\\" God originally intended. And that's because of sin. According to Lewis: \\". . . it was the emergence of a new kind of man--a new species, never made by God, had sinned itself into existence.\\" (p. 79)And it's not just human nature that's been corrupted; it's our entire reality. \\"My own experience,\\" writes Lewis, \\"is something like this. I am progressing along the path of life in my ordinary contentedly fallen and godless condition, absorbed in a merry meeting with my friends for the morrow or a bit of work that tickles my vanity today, a holiday or a new book, when suddenly a stab of abdominal pain that threatens serious disease, or a headline in the newspapers that threatens us all with destruction, sends this whole pack of cards tumbling down.\\" (p.106)The end result? God uses pain to make us fully human and jolt us into reality.\\"The Problem of Pain\\" is an excellent book to uncover the intellectual underpinnings of these topics and their relation to us; however, if you are seeking emotional comfort in your pain, this book is not for you.Sandra EggersAuthor\\"Dying Body, Growing Faith\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In the past, I've said that in some of his works, C.S. Lewis almost seems like a professional philosopher, while in others, he clearly comes across as more of a popularizer. This book, I'm afraid, is of the latter type. I say this, not because it's a bad book (it deals quite well with all the major problems people have concerning pain,) but because it's non-technical.There's nothing wrong with using a book to popularize very basic responses to very basic arguments (rest assured, this kind of content is as much as [perhaps more than] most internet atheists will be able to grasp on these issues,) but if you're a really educated seeker, really looking for answers to life's tough questions, or a theology student who wants to know the truth, or even just a philosophically-minded person who's not entirely on board with Christianity yet, put this book down. In fact, even if you -are- entirely on board with Christianity, there's a chance this book might damage your faith.Now, as I said, this book is a good book. Rest assured, I got just as many really good quotes from it as I did bad ones. That said, there were bad ones, and they came in two varieties. The first variety was weak and illogical arguments in favor of true positions. The second was defending very questionable, or even clearly-false positions.At this point, I feel the need to remind you that I am not an atheist. I'm an orthodox Roman Catholic, so when I say a position is questionable, I mean either that it has been denounced by the church, or else not affirmed by them in any way (not respected in doctrine, discipline, practice, creed or prayers.) However, my objections to some of Lewis' conclusions will not exist in a vacuum. I will back up my position with evidence, and a noteworthy, talented apologist like C.S. Lewis deserves, I feel, no less.First, however, let me cover the weak defenses of true positions. Fortunately, I only spotted two of these.Firstly, in chapter 6, paragraph 12, he responds to the well-known Euthyphro dilemma. The dilemma is \\"does God command things because they're right, or are they right because he commands them. If he commands them because they're right, then that 'rightness' must have a source other than God. If they're right because he commands them, then 'right' and 'wrong' are arbitrarily dependant on the will of God.\\"Lewis' response to this dilemma is correct. He says that God commands things -because- they're right. What he does not do is explain how this can happen without \\"rightness\\" originating outside of God; namely, that it is God's nature, not his will, where right and wrong originate, and his will obeys his nature in commanding right things.Chapter 6, paragraph 18; Lewis wants to prove that pain can be good for people, and cites the claim that old people generally, in his experience, grow better with age, not worse. However, age is not pain, and it brings many things with it other than pain. Sometimes, for example, it brings wisdom, which is much more likely than pain alone to improve a person's character. I think his claim that pain can be good for people is spot-on, but this argument is horribly wanting.More importantly, however, he makes a number of claims which I think are simply wrong, and which certainly aren't required for Catholics (or indeed, Christians of any sort) to believe. He keeps going back to these too, so I'll describe these faulty teachings first, then point out where I saw them surfacing.1. Competition is a form of evil.This may not be intentional, but in Ch2Par14, he says that \\"hostility and competition\\" are a \\"grave evil.\\" Gee. Should I have confessed my last game of chess to a priest?I'm sorry. I don't mean to be snide about this, but only one kind of competition is evil; the hostile kind. If C.S. Lewis believes this (and I have no reason to think he does not,) the word \\"hostility\\" need not have been followed by anything.2. The self-depreciation of the saints is \\"scientifically\\" accurate.Ch4Par15. No, it's not. Science is about measurements, and how rotten you are is not measurable by any method of which we are aware.3. God -causes- evil and suffering efficiently.He doesn't use these precise words, but he does seem to imply that God is the cause of evil in Ch6Par8. He also, in the same place, implies that the human will is evil, but that's a separate problem.4. The human will is evil, just by being a will.I really don't know why he would say this, since he elsewhere rejects Total Depravity (which I also reject.) However, he seems to repeatedly confuse -evil- will with any kind of human will considered as a whole. In Ch6Par3, he rails at the very idea of desiring anything for the self, and advocates ruthlessly shattering such desires by force. However, the problem is that a person who -really- desired nothing for the self would also have no reason to associate with other human beings, since they wouldn't desire to be noble or virtuous, which is absurd. Of course these desires are valid. So are many other desires, provided they're kept in the proper order.In Ch7Par3, he again demonstrates a fundamental confusion between the will, considered absolutely, and the will to do diabolical things.This Error seems to feed into another one; his incorrect understanding of Heaven, which I will deal with in a moment.5. Free will and its associated dangers are needed in order for people to live.Ch2Par15. I agree that free will is needed in order for people to live, but its dangers are not required, or else, it would be impossible for Heaven to exist, since people clearly live there, yet, without danger.6. Even if there were pains in Heaven, those in the know would desire them.Ch8Par9. I don't think he quite understands the purpose of Heaven in saying this. The purpose of Heaven is to be in the closest possible proximity to God. To be in the closest possible proximity to God is to have all good things, and no evil things. However, pain is an evil thing, in and of itself (which I think may be another point of confusion for him.) Therefore, merely having pain proves that one is not in the closest possible proximity to God, and therefore, not in Heaven.Believe me, after all we humans have suffered (self-inflicted or no,) a partial victory on an -eternal- scale would never be sufficient, and God knows this. That's why Purgatory doesn't last forever.7. In Heaven, there is no beer.More or less. He claims that no one can possess anything in Heaven. Then what, may I ask, is the point of giving up the things that we clearly -do- possess? This is a poor substitute, if true, and I'm fully convinced that it's false on that basis alone.Still, I want to fully examine the points he makes on the subject.Ch10Par5; he seems to recognize that this claim imperils the parable of the pearl of great price (the first objection I would have brought up,) but doesn't really deal with the issue, except to assert that what he's speaking of is \\"not an experience.\\"This requires an analysis of what the word \\"experience\\" means. An experience, in a broad sense, is anything which is perceptible, but is still a particular instance, and is therefore not obtainable, since it ceases to occur once the experience is past. However, a \\"particular instance\\" could, in theory, be stretched out into eternity, and therefore remain an experience, while still being imperishable. However, it would not be obtainable. This seems to be the common thread. Experiences are not obtainable things, and obtainable things are more than mere experiences.Now, rewards come in two types; either obtainable rewards, such as money or candy, or else experiences, such as a vacation, or a trip to the fair. By merely saying that something is \\"not an experience,\\" we imply that it is more than a mere perceptible, or even participative occurrance, whether or not it is experienced. We therefore imply that it is something which can be possessed. In other words, this paragraph contains a self-contradiction which disproves his claim.Ch10Pars7, 9 and 10. Lewis quotes the theologia germanica, which is not doctrine, and heavily inspired Martin Luther, to try to support his claim that not only is there no ownership in Heaven, but no human will either. This, I think, ties into error #4. The theologia germanica contained several questionable claims, and this; the denial of the will of the saints, was one of the big ones. It said outright that the saints in Heaven have no will except for the will of God, but I reject this claim for one simple reason.If this were true, asking the saints to intercede for us at the throne of God would be a wasted effort, since they would have no will to respond with. Now, you could say that the will of the saints does not -conflict- with the will of God, but that's not the claim that C.S. Lewis makes. He seems to have something of a mad-on for human wills and human selves, since he apparently wants both to be annihilated (the will being the highest function of the soul.) He even claims that human beings can only fulfill themselves completely by repeatedly giving up everything they are. I assume I don't need to point out that this is a self-contradiction, and therefore, necessarily false.But the real question is why? Why hold onto this notion of the self and the will being evil in and of themselves? Why claim that anything which God made is evil? Why not claim, with the Church, Saint Thomas Aquinas, myself, and others, that everything which God made is essentially good, but tainted by sin? Well, it seems to me that Lewis' reason is somewhat evident...Ch10Par1: \\"Heaven offers nothing that a mercenary soul can desire.\\"C.S. Lewis, it seems, either does not believe, or does not want people in Heaven who are only -imperfectly- penitent for their sins.Let me explain what this means. In Catholic doctrine, we define two types of penitence. -Perfect- penitence, in which you're sorry for your sins because you know you've offended God, and don't wish to, and -imperfect- penitence, in which you're sorry for your sins because you're afraid of being punished (like, with the loss of goods or rewards.)It seems that Mr. Lewis wants to make the point that the Christian God is not morally-inferior to anyone, because he rejects those who do his will out of ulterior motives, but this is problematic for four main reasons.1. It's contrary to Church teaching, and therefore false.2. It's contrary to the words of the apostle Paul, who said, in his letter to the Romans, that God will give to each person according to what he has -done.- Not according to his motives for doing it.3. It does not, in fact, make God seem morally-superior, but rather, morally-inferior for not showing mercy on those who tried to please him, without really understanding the best reasons why they should.4. I can only imagine how many modern men may have read these words and said to themselves \\"forget this. If this is the best deal I can get out of Christianity, I'm better off being an atheist.\\" A mere two years ago, I'd have said the same.The fact is that no matter how much certain Christians may want to thumb their noses at regular Joe Christian for following God, not out of selflessness, but because he wants a happy ending, you're much, much, -much,- better off not doing so. Jesus didn't say that people needed perfect contrition in order to enter Heaven. He said people needed faith and humility, and that they needed to be baptised, eat his body, drink his blood, take up their cross... You know... Catholic stuff.Just living this way involves a massive degree of sacrifice, to the point where there are days that only the promise of that happy ending gets us through. This is the kind of understanding of the relationship between this life and the next that Jesus preached. He didn't claim that God would force people out for not having a perfect motive, or that dangers and life were one and the same, or that God would lobotomize the saints of their human will. Our Lord wasn't nearly so grim as all that.He said that any man who has given up lands/cattle/wife/mother/father/etc... for his sake would receive (implying ownership) much more in the age to come.When you think about it, that's a darn good deal, and I wonder why so many otherwise-holy people want to spoil that.Again, this review may have come across as just a load of griping. I'm sorry if it seemed that way. It's only because these are complex issues, and they take a while to explain. As I said at the beginning, this book is more than half right. Its missteps are few and far between, but they do exist. Just keep your eyes open and proceed with caution, and you'll do just fine. You might even learn a thing or two about the problem of evil and how to approach it. Just don't take all of it at face value."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Jack wrote this toward the beginning of WWII, and it was sort of the beginning of quite a bit of attention focused on the problem of suffering. This problem was particularly something that he had to deal with before his conversion to Christianity, so you find a tincture of his theodicy in many of his fictional works.What is particularly fascinating about this work is the way he used myth to handle the unknowns of Christianity (Eden, Heaven, Hell). When you read this book and all of his books regarding theology, keep in mind that he is not a theologian, as he admits himself. What he writes about suffering is not even how he actually believed it was, it was what could have been.I suggest reading this work along the side of the Space Trilogy or The Great Divorce. He incorperates much of his own theology presented here with these pieces. I've focused a bit of study on Lewis' handling of suffering, though I'm not a scholar by any stretch. If you would like to read a little I've written on the subject, let me know.All in all, what Jack wanted to do with this book was to take the reader's mind's eye on a pilgrimage to the gateway of possibilities that lie within God's own imagination. Although we may certainly never be able to totally conceive the mind of the Lord, Lewis does the best he can to take us to the edge of knowing Him as we are known."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Out of all Lewis' books I have read this is the one I dislike and disagree with him the most. I will start out by saying that Lewis builds up to his points on this subject whereas in, say, \\"Miracle\\" he gets right to the point and then builds up his thesis. Also, with most of Lewis' books, this one will require another read through. Before I list my main contentions with this book, I am not aware if Lewis ever revised his thoughts on the subject or the particular claims which I take note with. I think he is dead wrong on certain principles of Christology - mainly the ability of God-knowledge to reside in Jesus. To say that God is incapable of this is to say that God is not all-powerful. I will say that Jesus gave up certain aspects of His Godhood to become human (for example, omnipresence). I also disagree with his assessment of where goodness comes from. With the statement of the Euthyphro dilemma, Lewis chooses to say that goodness is subjectively dictated by God, if there is a way God can be subjective - but I digress. I'm not sure why he doesn't make mention that the Euthyphro dilemma is a false dilemma and goodness arised out of God's character so God appeals to Himself. So what is good is of God and not just commanded by Him or He appeals to a status of goodness above God. The false dilemma answer has been around since Aquinas so I'm not sure why he doesn't comment on that. Another problem he spends too much time on because of the philisophical gymnastics he has to go through is the doctrine of Creation. Lewis comments on man existing before Genesis 1 and appealing to evolution to get to Adam. Adam arrises out of animalism. I'm not sure why Lewis doesn't take the Bible for what it says and it clearly leads to some murky backbending that Lewis isn't quite sure of himself what to do with it. This leads to my last negative point which is his theory on animal pain. He leaps way too far out from his main point and appeals to \\"mights\\" and \\"maybes\\" and \\"hopes\\" of God's character not stated in the Bible. Thus Lewis' basis for such claims are just as good as those wishes made on falling rocks from space. He agains lands in murky waters in stating that animals arrived not from Creation week but on the building upon death that evolution requires. Lewis reckognizes the problem with saying this and assumes a multitude of conclusions that have no biblical basis and are very, very weak - even in his own arguements.I do not wish to say there is nothing good about this book, because his formation of his main thought is decent. I have no issues with it in general but he does make some really great points. Another reading might pull my grade down farther or it might build it up. However, I think Lewis is way off in many parts here.

God sees all things in light of eternity and in light of the eternal destinations of heaven and hell. His goal, beyond pain and pleasure, is to have people with him in heaven for eternity.

As to some the replies from struggling Christians to the negative reviews, particularly regarding God's reasons for allowing the suffering of \\"innocents\\", here is just one of many possible explanations, directly from the His word.Exodus 20:5 \\"You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me\\"A worldview where the suffering of a child is meaningless is easier for many people to deal with than one where the meaning may be difficult to understand or accept."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The Problem of Pain is C. S. Lewis's theodicy - his attempt to explain why, if God is omnipotent and good, bad things happen in the world and people suffer. His target audience is Christians; non-Christians are likely to dismiss this work out of hand.In this book, Lewis addresses the goodness and omnipotence of God, the fall of man and human wickedness, human and animal pain, and heaven and hell. In doing so, he gives a strong case for the free will of humanity (stronger even, perhaps, than might be biblically defensible).As per usual, most of Lewis's arguments are logically rather than theologically based. The problem is, in this book, his logic is noticeably faulty. It does often tend to be \\"either/or\\" - Lewis will say, \\"this must be X or Y\\", almost arbitrarily, and will not leave room for other options. Much of Lewis's logic here is based on the rampant speculation he makes without theological or biblical support, particularly in his chapters on hell and animal suffering. The illustrations Lewis uses in this book tend to be general and academic, and he qualifies many of the things he says.At one point, Lewis breaks from his own argument to embrace a personal position in direct opposition to the case he has been making. Lewis says that he presupposes that \\"the good man ordinarily continues to seek simple good. I say \`ordinarily' because a man is sometimes entitled to hurt (or even, in my opinion, to kill) his fellow, but only where the necessity is urgent and the good to be attained obvious...\\" The reader familiar with Lewis knows that his position here is strongly rooted in the time he spent in the military and fighting in World War I. But here he has contradicted things he's said earlier in the book, and in other books, about love and good. Obviously the urgency of necessity and the obviousness of good are often completely subjective. Lewis really dropped the ball here.It is interesting to note (although it really has little to do with the quality of the work) that Lewis here both embraces evolution and says quite clearly that he believes that the creation accounts in Genesis are myths. Neither of these cause any problem for his faith.The Problem of Pain is hardly Lewis's finest work. The logic is often faulty and the illustrations he uses are too hypothetical and vague. There is some good here also, particularly the message that God can use pain to reach and change people. But this is far from being the definitive work on pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book predates Lewis' _Mere Christianity_ (collected as such, anyway) and the first edition of _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_. It is, in fact, the first 'religious' book he ever wrote, aside from his semi-autobiographical allegory _The Pilgrim's Regress_.As such, the reader (pro or con) should be prepared to keep in mind a caveat or two. For instance, Lewis rightly notes that pain and evil only become problems for Christianity once certain relevant Christian doctrines have been established (or at least are on the table). In order to be consistent to this precept, Lewis must begin the book by making an argument for the acceptance of some of these doctrines being true.It is hardly a comprehensive or solid argument, although it is a novel one. It is also one Lewis doesn't seem to have bothered to ever use again--which should alert critics to what his own opinion of its merits ended up being! (This is why I am not bothering to summarize it here; read the book. |g|) The weight of his main argument, however, does not rest strictly on the argument from his Introduction: if on these grounds _or better_, he says (and he had better ones in development), we accept certain truths about Christianity, then the problem of pain arises. And that is what TPoP is about.This puts TPoP in a curious place among Lewis' books. In effect, it should be read as a sequel to his final, best Christian apologetic (MaPS, the 1960 revised edition): although, again, I don't think any of the TPoP argument necessarily requires (or is thrown out by) the _specific_ arguments of MaPS. This keeps it useful for (most?) other methods of proposing or arguing in favor of Christian doctrines.(Most, maybe not all. The first time I reviewed this book, I was reminded that any Christian denomination which denies human free will--or is heavily into theistic predestination, which amounts to the same thing in my opinion--is not likely to find this book very useful, since Lewis _does_ rely on the existence of human free will. I accept the qualification; with the further observation that most Christians in most times have accepted and relied upon the existence of human free will--including, in my experience, those who attempt to deny human free will.)I wish oppositional critics to Christian (or any mono)theism were more familiar with the principles discussed in this book. I believe Lewis is entirely correct to notice, for instance, that the power of an anti-theistic Argument from Evil (not necessarily from Pain, though), requires the presupposed existence of the objective personal ethical source which the anti-theistic argument is attempting to deny.Still, the book does have some weaknesses (partly due to its early authorship). Lewis mentions that he has grounds for believing God to be good, for instance, yet I don't think he actually presents the best grounds in this book. The closest he comes is, I think, the aforementioned point that if he tries to argue against God's existence and character via the subject of 'evil', he finds he must presuppose the very properties of existence and characteristc which he wished to attack. This is an important point, worth keeping in mind, but isn't a positive argument for those characteristics.He does mention the Euthyprho dilemma explicitly in a later chapter (although he doesn't credit it to Socrates via Plato here--apologies in advance for possible misspelling |g|); but while he comes down in favor of one side (God is following a standard) he doesn't explain in TPoP why this standard isn't above God.There _is_ a proper answer to the Euthyphro dilemma (do we say God is good because He holds to a standard? Then the standard is above Him and He is not God. Do we say God is good because He is the most powerful? Then His standard is arbitrary and not objective goodness). And Lewis did touch on it elsewhere (I know ,because I learned it from one of his works--I just don't remember which |g|). However, since he didn't do it in _this_ book (I believe it may be in _Mere Christianity_), it wouldn't be proper to comment on it here.(He does partly address a somewhat different dilemma, regarding the question of how we could possibly be in a position to perceive God's goodness if His omniscient wisdom is so superior to ours. Again, it isn't the most technically accurate solution, but it does have strong practical value, coming as it does from Lewis' own experience as a former atheist and moral relativist.)Be that as it may: TPoP does offer considerable resources and principles for springboarding disputes past the typical deadlocks of religio-philosophical debate on this subject. For instance, his discussion of hell is highly worth keeping in mind; as well as his discussion of the implications of omnipotence.The collection of Lewis essays _God in the Dock_ features a reply from Lewis to some criticisms of the speculative chapter on animal pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In the Problem of Pain Lewis tackles a question that has morally plagued society for centuries, &quot;Why does bad things happen to good people?&quot;Lewis using his logic to answer this question rewrites alot of things modern man thinks he already knows!He does a fine job of answering this question, and explaining why a loving God would allow people to suffer, though the first few chapters come accross wordy, and the obviousness that Lewis wasn't up for the battle of this book is prevelant in the first chapter."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Hello,I am searching for answers for my grief.

Indeed, as a Christian, since I am identified with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection, I have no right to demand that I be spared the pain that is prevalent in this world.I like Lewis' assertion that perhaps God would not love us any more if we did not experience pain. I submit that the times when I and countless other Christians most experienced God's presence and comfort was during times of pain and trials. Readers will note that Lewis himself experienced the loss of a wife through illness.Lewis will challenge you to think through why you beleive what you believe and this book is no exception. This is not an easy read and you will have to concentrate on this one! Lewis touches on the following areas in The Problem of Pain:1. God's Omnipotence2. Heaven and Hell3. Human Wickedness and Pain4.

This doesn't address that aspect. More of a societal view of pain and those in pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C. S. Lewis, the late professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge University, was one of the most popular, thought-provoking Christian apologists of the Twentieth Century. In his book on the problem of pain, he acknowledges in his Introduction that Christianity actually \\"creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain would be no problem unless...we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving.\\" On the other hand, as he also points out, merely discarding Christianity creates the problem of explaining why, if \\"the universe is so bad...humans ever came to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" He then follows this statement with a mini case for Christianity, discussing four religious elements.The first three elements are: (1) experience of numinous awe, (2) consciousness of a moral law which we both approve and yet disobey, and (3) identification of the \\"Numinous Power of which we feel awe\\" as also being \\"the guardian of the morality to which [we] feel ablation.\\" Lewis perhaps rightly contends that these experieces are neither \\"the result of an inference from the visible universe\\" nor a logical deduction \\"from the environment and [our] physical experiences.\\" He then contends that our religious experience must be either \\"a mere twist in the human mind, corresponding to nothing objective and serving no bioligical function...or else it is a direct experience of the really supernatural.\\" Religious experience and thought may indeed be a \\"twist in the human mind\\" that nevertheless has a useful function without necessarily being an actual experience of the supernatural. Anyone interested in finding out more about how religious thought may have developed without invoking the supernatural may consult Pascal Boyer's excellent book, Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought (New York: Basic Books, 2001).The fourth religious element Lewis discusses is the Incarnation as follows:\\"Either he [Jesus Christ] was a raving lunatic of an unusually abominable type, or else he was, and is, precisely what He said. There is no middle way. If the records make the first hypothesis unacceptable, you must submit to the second.\\"Far from being cogent, this argument would make an excellent example of an either/or fallacy for textbooks on logic. It is also called the fallacy of \\"incomplete enumeration.\\" Christ could have been mistaken about himself without necessarily having to be designated an \\"abominable lunatic,\\" and he could be misrepresented in the Gospels. These rational alternatives show that the dilemma presented by Lewis for the unbeliever is false. Having introduced how Christianity causes the problem of pain, Lewis then proceeds to deal with it via the free-will defense.In his chapter on \\"Divine Omnipotence,\\" Lewis states the following:\\"We can...conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will...at every moment...But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void.\\"However, the contention that free will necessarily includes the option to commit wrong actions is erroneous. Am I less morally free if I am only able to care lovingly for my little dog and incapable of choosing to abuse him? Is my moral freedom diminished in the least by my incapacity to terrorize mentally and abuse physically the woman I love? Are persons capable of choosing to do evil as morally free as those capable of only choosing good? Free will is always limited by the capacities and opportunities of any moral agent. Hence, there is no logical contradiction in conceiving of a limited moral freedom to choose only from among various good actions.Furthermore, free will limited to choosing only good options need not diminish the total amount of free will. God creating greater capacities and opportunities for choosing good could replace the loss of the capacity to do evil. Consequently, since even Christian apologists acknowledge that free will is never absolutely free and since the option to do evil is unnecessary to possess limited free will, the free-will apologetic attempting to rationally explain evil in a world created by an omnipotent, loving God is fallacious. Another of the problems for Christian theology concerns a doctrine Lewis discusses in his chapter, \\"The Fall of Man.\\"Lewis says that, in the developed doctrine of the Fall, \\"Man, as God made him, was completely good and completely happy, but...he disobeyed God and became what we now see.\\" This doctrine creates another problem, which Lewis states as follows:\\"For the difficulty about the first sin is that it must be very heinous, or its consequences would not be so terrible, and yet it must be something which a being free from the temptations of fallen man could conceivably have committed.\\"The sin that Lewis suggests as being possible to someone completely good is \\"turning from God to self\\" or \\"self-idolatry.\\" However, the notion that enyone completely good would commit \\"self-idolatry\\" or any other sin is self-contradictory. If turning to God and not to self is essential to being good, then a morally perfect agent ipso facto could never turn from God.Near the close of his chapter, \\"The Fall of Man,\\" Lewis suggests that \\"it would be futile to attempt to solve the problem of pain by producing another problem.\\" However, this is just what Christian apologetics does with the problem of pain and evil. It introduces \\"solutions\\" that both fail as solutions and actually produce more problems--even when authored by C. S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Sometimes there are just things that we'd just as soon avoid. Pain can probably be one of those subjects. Take the advice of the spotlight reviewer, because if you aren't a Christian, then you aren't who Lewis is talking to. No offense to ANYBODY, but that's just the simple truth. I think only C.S. Lewis could make sense out of something such as pain. How could he pull stuff like this off? Like he always does, and he certainly does it better than I do! What's this about? Read on.In classic Lewis form, he concludes his \\"Introductory\\" (which is the title of the first chapter) by saying, \\"If, on such grounds, or on better ones, we follow the course on which humanity has been led, and become Christians, we then have the 'problem' of pain.\\" I guess that's a good thing, right? Uh, yeah. Hey, if we know about how God molds our lives, the Great Potter has to shape us as clay, and He has to chip away at the rough edges in order to have that perfect creation in the end. The thing you can't exactly get around in this is that there are no easy answers. You ever hear somebody say, \\"Either you're a Christian, or you're not. Either you are for Jesus Christ, or against Jesus Christ.\\"? That's not an easy answer, its reality because there is no Purgatory! Like it or not, you better believe it. I've never known Lewis to offer the easy answer, and in this case, it shouldn't be watered down. And for an added bonus, (at least I saw this a few times) he basically blows that whole Evolution theory right out of the water with some of this! I'm thinking to myself, \\"Hey Darwin! EVO-WHAT?!!?\\" I do believe that with a lot this, despite the subject, that Lewis had a lot of fun with this work. He was also very down to earth. There is pain in this life, and if you think that it is just some carnival where you always get hot dogs, cotton candy and carmel apples... THINK AGAIN! Sometimes life just plain sucks, and sometimes it just gets plain tough. But there's more to this, as there always is to Lewis. There was chapter on Hell, straight up and to the point. Basically, just mark it down that there IS a Hell, and we really don't want to go there. A few of his other remarks in that chapter threw me for a loop at first, and made perfect sense in the end. And hey, what would a book with a chapter on Hell be if it weren't followed up (and ends the book) with a chapter on Heaven! Hey, that's awesome!Hey, if you don't want to read about The Fall, human pain, or even about human wickedness, then go find Dr. Suess and read about how people fight about buttering bread. If you are looking for something real, and we ALL have it, people, then give this a shot. Because as far as I'm concerned, there's no problem with C.S. Lewis!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The question or 'problem' that C.S. Lewis sets out to answer in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is one that has confounded believers and non-believers alike: if God is good and loves his creation, why does he allow such pain and suffering to exist? How can that be good and exist within his creation? While Lewis' ponderings may not seem like straightforward answers to those questions, he paints a picture of a God revealed through his creation where even pain and evil can exist.C.S. Lewis is perhaps the best person to examine this topic: a former atheist, he commences the book by speaking of what his former answer to that question would've been. It is only through his eventual conversion to a belief in Christ that he is able to see the order behind the seeming chaos. Lewis examines an array of issues, covering commonalities between religions but what sets Christianity apart, the Fall of Man, and why Heaven and Hell must exist. Moreover, he examines the distinct individuality that plays a role in our relation to our Creator.Lewis' prose has the contradiction of being both dense and enlightening. His examinations are not necessarily for the ordinary reader, nor are they too lofty either, but they require a great deal of thoght and reflection. Therefore, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is best read perhaps a chapter at a time, allowing the reader to meditate on what has been presented. The ultimate irony of human suffering might be that as believers, we have had every opportunity to not experience suffering, since Christ has already suffered supreme - but because of how God created us, we have the will to choose, no matter what that choice might be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Punctuated with a thin veil of lyricism and argued from a Christian perspective, C. S. Lewis' book does not only explore the psychological ramifications of suffering in our lives. It also provides an intellectual discussion that aims at reconciling theological tenets concerning the role of God's love in human sorrow. Written many years before his beloved wife's death, the book is far from offering merely theoretical comments on suffering. In fact, it addresses common misconceptions about happiness and love, still within the parameters of deep empathy for the human condition in a world plagued with grief."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis believed we should try to enter into the meaning, the intent of the authors we read, instead of bringing our own biases and immediately subjecting them to our own categories of thought. We cannot help but enrich our minds if \\"in reading great literature I become a thousand men and yet remain myself.\\" Therefore, if you've stumbled upon this book for whatever reason and feel inclined to read it then I'd urge -- pay no attention to the humbug critics, at least until after you've read what could be a life enriching book, as this was for me.Ten years ago I began reading Lewis; the Problem of Pain was one of the first of his works, after Mere Christianity, I picked up. It wasn't long after I read PoP that I was watching Schindler's List. Scene by scene, the dilemma of evil in the face of a good God assaulted me till I was overcome with intense and sickening violence. I ended up falling to the ground, in anguish, crying \\"how\\"? I received no blinding insight, I'm sorry to say, into the mystery of evil; but Lewis' logic had infected me, and suddenly an argument took hold of my mind, checked my despair, and gave me something to hold onto (incidentally, those critics who, in reading Lewis have immediately subjected him to their atheist framework have a-priori cut themselves off from understanding the ultimate logic of their own position - or they just don't care, which is far worse).The argument, in so many words, ran something like this: the proposition that God doesn't exist amounts, at the same time, to the proposition that all this anguish at the injustice unfolding before me on my TV screen is not rooted in reality, that it's all a purely subjective illusion, which reflects no eternal value, goodness or justice, and, logically, could just as well be delight and approval. In other words, the extent I thought evil truly evil and wrong - that was the extent to which I had to believe in a good God; to deny Him would be, at the same time, a denial of the reality of evil, which was driving me to deny Him in the first place. I simply refused to concede that the Nazis, slaughtering Jews, were no more morally culpable than if they were involuntarily swatting mosquitoes.Many people are keen to respond something along these lines, \\"well, I personally feel this or that is wrong,\\" and seriously think they've resolved the matter. However, this \\"line\\" has a shocking corollary, which runs thusly: \\"...but it is not really wrong\\". In it's blunt, down to earth form, and applied to my experience above, it looks like this: \\"I feel the Nazi's were wrong, but I cannot speak for them and say they were wrong, because they were not REALLY wrong.\\" When the mind reflects objective reality it has truth; if my mind isn't reflecting the eternal reality of value, goodness, and justice, then my gut reactions and intense emotions are a response to nothing in reality, to no quality innate to human beings, which categorically warrants such a reaction - they're a fictional response, a response to a pretended reality. We all know, deep down inside, that this cannot be true, and that evil really exists because there's an eternal standard of goodness (God) by which to identify evil as evil...Read this book - make your own judgments..."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book is a theological and logical argument why God can be all loving and yet there can be such awful pain in the world. The initial argument that \\"If God is loving and there is evil in the world implies that something is wrong with God\\", is methodically and logically taken apart. There are arguments for the Christian about how they should live given this logical argument, but the non believer or searcher can take the arguments and come to a very balanced view of God Almighty."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"the problem of pain is classic lewis: an inimitable combination of deep philosophical thought, razor-sharp wit, the ability to poke fun at himself and a heart that is truly amazed by his God.his premise is not to make pain or suffering any less distasteful, but to show that back of it all is the love of God. the book can really be broken into three sections. 1) the divine heart 2) human suffering 3) speculative ponderings.the first section (ch. 1-3) gives the basis for all of lewis' further thoughts and arguments: the ultimate goodness and omnipotence of God. this section defines what true goodness and benefit are in the light God's being. lewis shows that our common conceptions of \\"happiness\\" and \\"what is good\\" may be less accurate than we think. he distinguishes true kindness from what may be called mere pity.some highlights from the first couple chapters:-\\"love is something more stern and splendid than mere kindness\\" - the idea in context being that God loves us too much to simply give us everything we think we want. (anyone with children ought to be able to understand the truth of that statement).- \\"try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free will involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself.\\"- \\"the election of man, from nonentity, to be the beloved of God, and therefore (in some sense) the needed and desired of God, who but for that act needs and desires nothing, since He eternally has, ans is, all goodness.\\"the second section (ch. 4-7) is about the actual suffering of humans and how that plays out against divine goodness. lewis discusses the fall of adam with a lot of poetic license and conjecture on the way things were before the fall... can't be taken as fact, but some very provocative ideas. also there is a fascinating discussion on the humility of God in receiving us even when we come to Him only as a last resort; He will have us on any terms.here are a handful of quotes from this section:- \\"all sadness which is not either arising from the repentance of a concrete sin and hastening towards concrete amendment or restitution, or else arising from pity and hastening to active assistance, is simply bad.\\"- \\"the proper good of a creature is to surrender itself to its Creator - to enact intellectually, volitionally, and emotionally, that relationship which is given in the mere fact of its being a creature. when it does so, it is good and happy.\\"- \\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\"- \\"the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it.\\"the third section (ch. 8-10) is very speculative, as all the chapters concern things which no human living on earth has had actual experience of: heaven, hell, and pain in animals. lewis' thoughts on hell are excellent, revolving around the idea that if the fulfillment of our humanity is in submitting to our Creator, then entering hell is ceasing to be human, but continuing existence in some more wretched state. the thoughts on heaven are equally as fascinating. the chapter on animal pain is a unique discussion in Christian theology (i can't remember ever hearing someone talk about it as a theological issue). there are also, albeit highly speculative, great possibilities suggested for what animal pain can and can't mean. also the thesis of humans \\"transforming\\" animals in a way vaguely similar to how God transforms man will at least set your gray matter in motion. however, where lewis really falls short in this section is his upholding of \\"theistic evolution\\". sadly, lewis believed that God used evolution to create the world and the species. this belief, however, skews the whole understanding of goodness and pain. if pain was part of God's creative process, it is not an evil or a temporary necessity in a fallen world, but rather death is a manifestation of the divine being, part of God's essential nature: clearly a problem for all the rest of the ideas in the book.some excerpts from section 3:- \\"to enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.\\"- \\"the demand that God should forgive such a [wicked] man while he remains what he is, is based on a confusion between condoning and forgiving. to condone and evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good.\\"-\\"there are rewards that do not sully motives. a man's love for a woman is not mercenary because he wants to marry her, nor his love for poetry mercenary because he wants to read it, nor his love of exercise, less disinterested because he wants to run and leap and walk. love by definition, seeks to enjoy its object.\\"aside from the theistic evolution, a wonderful book. lot's of food for thought. chew away!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"It says something that after so many years C. S. Lewis is still one of the foremost Christian apologists of our time. The Problem of Pain is a difficult question every religion has to deal with, and one which has been especially difficult for Christianity. Some religions have the luxury of explaining pain as something deserved - a result of bad behavior from a previous life, or perhaps pain and suffering are caused by a malevolent deity in opposition to a good and loving God. Christianity has no such option.\\"If God were good, he would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\"Lewis presents a very readable and widely accessible solution to this problem, covering the origins of human suffering, incurred in the fall, what divine omnipotence and goodness really mean, and why they allow for the existence of pain in creation, heaven and hell, and a topic not often treated but important - the existence of pain in animals who are in every sense innocent.Particularly useful is Lewis' distinction between kindness and love. Lewis reminds us that real love, a love that looks out for the best interests of the beloved, sometimes requires the inflicting of painful experience. From the perspective of the one undergoing the experience, this may not seem like love, but any parent, teacher, or anyone tasked with the guidance of the young will understand that this sort of \\"tough love\\" is often necessary if one does not want a spoiled child to grow into a spoiled adult."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"First Reading-What is truly amazing is the timeless nature of C.S. Lewis' work. The Problem of Pain was written decades ago yet is still just as pertinent as the day it was written. The Problem of Pain, not unlike Mere Christianity, reveals concepts that are not always the easiest to wrap one's mind around in such a light as to allow the reader to feel as if they have been studying the issue for years. With a little help from some poignant imagery, Lewis manages to depict unfathomable concepts in a very human manner. It is with his literary gift that C.S. Lewis, once again, passes on a glimpse of deeper understanding to the laypeople of the world.The Problem of Pain is written about exactly what the title suggests. How could a loving and merciful God allow so much pain to occur in a world that He created? This, of course, is not an unfamiliar topic of debate for Christians and atheists alike. It appears that Lewis realized the popularity of this question and, as such, touched on questions that are raised from both sides of the fence. As exquisitely as Lewis transfers his logical reasoning onto paper he still, throughout the book, maintains his humble demeanor by giving credit to what, he considers, true theologians.I have seen it written that this book is only relevant to Christian believers, yet as a recent convert, I would have to disagree. While it would certainly provide some bearing to have done some reading on similar topics before reading The Problem of Pain, the manner in which Lewis vividly explains his thoughts creates relevance for any reader who has ever wondered why pain exists and if there is a God, what sort of being would establish such a thing. In my opinion, Lewis has created another beautiful masterpiece in The Problem of Pain and has provided me with, at least, a general idea to answer one of the hardest questions I have ever asked. This book is a must for any Christian and just might offer some insight for those who have not quite made up their minds yet.Second Reading-The Problem of Pain is one of Lewis' several timeless contributions to Christian apologetics. With regard to the problem of pain in the context of Christian theology, it would be difficult to find a work that approaches the apparent issue with such precision and efficiency. Lewis presents popular questions while offering situational examples for clarity's sake and follows with accurate explanations based upon Christian doctrine. To leave few questions in the reader's mind, Lewis also offers his opinion about animal suffering; although he states within this work and in others that presenting such a question is a distraction from the truth that has been provided and can be known about human suffering. In its entirety, The Problem of Pain clarifies how and why pain and suffering is not a problem that should in any way hamper one's faith while outlining where and how Christian doctrine presents why suffering is a perceivable reality.The Problem of Pain certainly pertains to its title by tackling the issue head on. Within this work, however, Lewis also decided to dedicate the final chapter to what he believed to be a glimpse of heaven. After presenting his standard disclaimer about his lack of authority on the matter, Lewis justifies the inclusion of this chapter on the grounds that its exclusion would result in the absence of one half of the whole account. This chapter seems to disrupt the established flow, almost to the point of being out of place. Nonetheless, in this short and perhaps unnecessary chapter Lewis might have most clearly conveyed the message he dedicated an entire book to withThe Great Divorce, focused on as a key concept inSurprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life, and mentioned in many other works. As is the case so often in Lewis' writings, it was when he asked the reader for and granted himself permission to speak freely that he presented the concepts that were abstract even in his own mind with the greatest clarity. The Problem of Pain is worth the effort if one struggles with similar questions. However, even if one has little interest in the seemingly problematic nature of pain in Creation, the last chapter alone is worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Reading anything by C.S. Lewis is an uplifting experience because it gives one a chance to witness a great intellect at work. In this book he explains why there is pain in the world in spite of a loving and all-powerful God. C.S. Lewis can be very helpful to anyone who is seriously seeking Christ and answers to some of the biggest questions."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Hello,I am searching for answers for my grief.

In the journal I have the opportunity create a memory book while at the same time I am working through my grief using the daily prompts, Bible verses, and quotes.It is helping."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis' work audaciously attempts to conquer the issues surrounding the most touchy subject of pain. His boldness pays off, as he presents a clear view of the place of pain with respect to God and man.The greatest strength in this work is the fact that it addresses the place of pain with respect to God first. It discusses those attributes of God such as goodness and omnipotence in such a way that they are ultimately related to the question of the nature and end of pain. This foundation provides a stable foundation for considering the fall and turnaround of redemption with respect to pain in the world and its relationship to Heaven and Hell.Lewis is well versed in philosophy and theology and presents his considerations in an accessible but also academic fashion. While I have a few qualms about some of his conclusions, they are not enough to utterly \\"rock the boat\\" and tip his arguments overboard. There are a few minor points with respect to the character of man as a relational being and the implications thereof for the subject at hand. Nonetheless, I highly suggest this text."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis here takes on the knotty question of the role of pain and evil in the world for a Christian. I am a former Christian and an atheist. I had heard Lewis was the best Christian apologist there is. If these arguments are the best Christianity can come up with, atheism doesn't have much to worry about.Lewis seems to think that the universal human sense of guilt when one has done something wrong is evidence of God. I disagree. I don't see any reason why evolution could not produce human beings having a sense of right and wrong. To some extent, a sense of right and wrong is a necessity for social animals. Chimpanzees complain when something they have worked to get is stolen from them. Wolves reject another wolf from the pack if he doesn't behave as a wolf should. Why would human beings be different?Lewis has a reputation for being a logician. In my opinion, much of his \\"logic\\" is absurd. For example, Lewis spends a lot of time on how God can be omnipotent and omnibenevolent. After all, how can a merciful God love all his children but send some of them to Hell? Why is there so much pointless suffering? Fortunately for me, atheism doesn't have to twist itself into knots over questions like this. After all, if pain is simply an evolved signal which proved useful to our ancestors, there's no particular reason why there shouldn't be a lot of it around. We can spend our time thinking about the best way to arrange our society to keep pain to the minimum necessary, not worrying about why pain exists in the first place. Atheism has intellectual coherence in this respect which is totally lacking in Christianity. What evidence is there that God is really omniscient or omnipotent or omnibenevolent, anyway? Just because someone said so thousands of years ago? I sometimes get the feeling that Christians choose paradoxical terms to describe God to make him as difficult to understand as possible. I suppose this makes God seem grander.Lewis also gives a lot of attention to the question of whether animals are immortal. Lewis thinks animal pain is quite different in quality from human pain, since he believes animals lack souls. Lewis discusses the question of what people will do in Heaven, why it is so wonderful there, and what makes Hell so awful. Honestly, I know of no better evidence for atheism than the need for serious Christians to consider the sorts of absurd questions Lewis discusses here. Lewis tries his best to come up with sensible answers, without much success.Lewis wants Christianity judged by its fruits. If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.As far as the book \\"The Problem of Pain\\" itself, Lewis is a fine writer who is never boring. For that reason I give the book two stars. If you're interested in basic Christian doctrine on some thorny theological subjects, this is a good introduction. Before taking it too seriously, however, I would strongly recommend reading other points of view. As far as the major problems of our times, I would suggest Kunstler's \\"The Long Emergency.\\" For a defense of atheism and the naturalistic worldview,I would suggest Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" or Taner Edis' \\"The Ghost in the Universe.\\"I read \\"The Problem of Pain\\" because I feel as a scientist that it is important not to simply dismiss religion as silly, but to give Christians their chance to convince me. If you're a Christian, are you willing to do the same for the other side?"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"If you are suffering from chronic disease and want some theory why a good God would allow such a thing, you will be greatly disappointed in this book. Mostly, there is only intellectual gobbledygook here; at no time does Lewis address this important issue. To the contrary, he spends all his time dancing around it and bogging himself down in meaningless, often totally unrelated or incredibly superficial issues. For example: he spends a few pages talking about the simple and useful reflex-type pain, but he later apologizes for it, because it is obvious, even to the author, that no picks up a Christian book to read about that. He also goes into much detail about his unique, metaphysical view of \\"Adam and Eve.\\" Likewise, his metaphysical view of Jesus Christ. His closest approach to the issue of chronic pain is a rather weak reference to the Devil.I am not an atheist, but this book is mistitled. Not only did he not answer my existential question, he made no attempt whatsoever.What a letdown! He could have said \\"Christ wore a crown of thorns\\", but he did not. He could have spoke more about the cross and how it makes Christianity unique, but he did not.Instead, there was a short appendix that he did not even reference or seem to write. Probably, it was added by the embarrassed publisher. As I recall, it had some doctor saying old ladies with rheumatoid arthritis are happier than those without it. Personally, I find this to be incredibly specious.This is not a fable, or a layman's book. The title here is the \\"Problem of Pain.\\" Any rational being would expect a direct discussion on that subject. This book is less Christianity or religion than it is meaningless intellectualism. Eclectic opinions on unimportant matters that he put together because he thought they were too cute by half and wanted to use big words that he had learned specifically to impress people. It has about as much value as intellectualism in any field. Architecture or fashion, for instance. Basically, I would call it pure dreck.DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK, if you are a young person with an autoimmune disease that no one else can see and makes everyone think that you are lazy BECAUSE you will not find your answer here.

Unknown in the US, I would suggest Peter Vardy's 'The Puzzle of Evil' for an introduction and part answer to the problem."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The Problem of Pain was good in some areas and not so good in others. C.S. Lewis makes quite a few assumptions without any Biblical basis. Some of the things he mentions make completely no sense. Here's a quote; &quot;Our Lord while stressing terror of hell with unsparing severity, usually emphasises the idea, not the duration but of finality. Consignment to the destroying fire is usually treated as the end of the story - not the beginning of a new story. That the lost soul is eternally fixed in its diabolical attitude we cannnot doubt: but whether this eternal fixity implies endless duration-or duration at all we cannot say.&quot; What exactlly is he suggesting? That those in hell will not suffer eternally? Revelations 14:11 says &quot;The smoke of their torment rises forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night for they have worshipped the beast...&quot; Aside from this there are many other things he says which make no sense. Yes, he does make some good points, but not many. I guess this is to be expected considering his apologetics are about 60 years old. I highly respect C.S. Lewis and he was definitely one of the geniuses of his time. Sadly since there is such a lack in good Christian apologetics these days with a few exceptions; we are left with only the long and gone apologetics of C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaffer. More recent apologetics would be Hugh Ross, William Dembski, and Michael Behe, who are very underappreciated for there hard work. C.S. Lewis wrote very good fiction which can still be highly appreciated by today's society. I'm not saying his apologetics are terrible; not at all. Merely that they are old and a lot of the theory's can be easily debunked. If you love to read, then I'm sure his work is well worth your time. If your merely looking for answers to certain problems; I would suggest something a bit more recent, or maybe searching for the answer yourself."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The book may be of interest to a devout Christian.

I was actually excited since it was supposed to \\"answer\\" my questions about the topic of the book. A blog I've been following, @ [...]we've been reading the bible together chapter by chapter. He had also suggested this book as a book for his book club. I thought it was a great idea. [...]A few chapters in, I am having trouble finishing it. He asserts a lot of stuff without justifying it, sometimes pulling stuff out of nowhere.

I've never seen so many logical fallacies jam packed into so few pages. I welcome anyone to come and join the discussion. Maybe someone can clarify a lot of the problems we've been having.It's obvious that CS Lewis really believes what he is writing.

Lewis, is a non-fiction work that looks at the title phenomenon in a Christian theological context. The chapters in the book look at human pain, animal pain, divine omnipotence, human wickedness, and other theological/philosophical concepts.I found \\"Problem\\" to be a curious book. Some parts are well-written and thought-provoking, some parts are dull. Some parts just seem self-indulgent and even silly; at its worst the book reads like an eggheaded parody of theology. The chapter on hell is particularly unsatisfying; I found it to sound patronizing and frustratingly vague at times. But the book as a whole is thankfully enlivened by delightful flashes of wit.Theologically, Lewis seems to be at odds with strict biblical literalism; in chapter 5 he appears to endorse the idea of biological evolution, for example. Despite my reservations, I feel that this is a worthwhile book for both Christians and those of other belief traditions."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis spends much time discussing the redemptive role of pain; problems of goodness, free will, and evil; and hell. He even includes a chapter on the suffering of animals. There is, however, no chapter on the suffering of children. Typical of Christian apologists, Lewis focuses on why God would create rational creatures capable of evil and allow them, and others affected by them, to suffer from the consequences of their evil choices. The problem he ignores is why his God, supposedly without whom nothing could exist, underwrites, for example, the very being of the cancer cells that ravage the body of a child. Such an omission renders the book useless.[Update: As an aftereffect of replying to comments on the original review, I'd like to make the following clarification: Lewis would seem to deal with the issue of why moral innocents suffer by declaring that there are no moral innocents, in that even children daily commit a sin due to their \\"choosing\\" of self over God. Only an apologist desperate to pull together the incompatible strands of his theology could claim that infants are capable of making that sort of freely willed moral choice.]"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"CS Lewis is held by many to be the premier Christian apologist of the 20th century. Unless one is morbidly naive, or has yet to encounter the counterarguments to Christianity in particular and theism in general, I honestly cannot see where his appeal lies.The Problem of Evil is an insurmountable one for Christians (and all other theists who believe in a perfectly loving, all-powerful and all-knowing god). There have been intense and motivated efforts over the past two millennia to defend such a position rationally, and they have all failed. Miserably. Utterly. And in many cases, dishonestly.Some approached involve invoking an unknown \\"greater good\\" defense (which throws god's omnipotence under the bus. An omnipotent deity could simply actualise a desired goal without needing to use suffering as a \\"middle man\\"). Attempts to shift the problem by asserting that human happiness is not the goal of life (but knowing god is) removes the omnibenevolence and omnipotence of god (if you love someone, you don't want them to suffer. It really is that simple). On page 104, Lewis concedes that not everyone suffers equally. He does not give a reason for this, and indeed, admits that our puny human minds cannot understand why god would allow some to live decades in comfort and luxury while others suffer for months or years on end. To quote Lewis himself: \\"The causes of this distribution I do not know; but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some humble, pious, believing people suffer, but why some do NOT (emphasis Lewis', in italics). Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\\"That's not an explanation. Lewis is falling back on the ancient and ubiquitous appeal to ignorance. God's mysterious ways are beyond us. Well, by that \\"logic,\\" he could send all Christians to hell and everyone else to heaven, and Lewis, by his own admission, would just have to suck up an eternity of torture.The old canard of free will is often invoked. Unfortunately, free will is meaningless unless everyone has an equal amount of it. This is undeniably NOT the case. Not everyone is given the same lifespan, physical strength, mental acuity, political clout, financial resources, and so on. Lewis is pontificating from the luxurious confines of his residence, funded by conveniently gullible sheep. This has certainly damaged his ability to empathise with the billions who live on less than a dollar each day. And the thousands who starve to death every time the Earth completes a full rotation.Lewis also, perhaps unwittingly, advocates a social Darwinism in which the rich and physically powerful are able to murder, rape and steal from weaker individuals (and are therefore less able to exercise their own free will to prevent their own suffering). Lewis worships a cosmic pedophile who revels in granting freedom to abhorrent individuals while getting his jollies from seeing the most vulnerable suffer and die in agony (only to get thrown into even more torture in the Christian vision of hell).Lastly, a loving god would take away free will from those who would willingly surrender it in return for a life without suffering. Funnily enough, Lewis seems to believe in a heaven without suffering but with all the bells and whistles of freedom. So why not create that universe from the get-go and stick with it? Why create a universe with even the possibility of corruption? It certainly is not something a perfect god would do. Then again, a perfect god would not blackmail beings he supposedly loves for eternal worship.While Lewis is usually a good writer, capable of spinning yarns to attract the attention of children and young teenagers, he also assumes that there is a deep, overriding purpose behind suffering. This purpose is so important that it is more critical to his god to NOT end suffering now, but to let things run their \\"natural\\" course until his plan is complete. In service of this goal, he creates a short story that is akin to an essay on theistic evolution, and how man is ultimately responsible for the Fall and his own corruption. If god knows everything, including the future, then he orchestrated the fall (and everything else) before setting his plan into motion. Arguing that god exists outside of time is a lazy copout, nothing more.As a 'loudspeaker' for the Christian god, pain has done more to drive people away from him than anything else. An all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good god would not allow any suffering, even in the service of a so-called \\"greater good.\\" And if such a god desires suffering for a greater good, then it would follow logically that his followers should cause suffering to convert more people. After all, that is god's best tool for getting our attention, is it not? Fortunately, CS Lewis and most Christians today do not follow this logic to its end point.

His \\"solutions\\" (and he would not call them solutions) are not easy but they are very sensible and true to his faith.

But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.&#34; Lewis then works through the argument from there, and concludes, &#34;Try to exclude the possiblity of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free-wills involve, and you will find that you have excluded life itself.&#34; In doing so, he explores the difference in love and kindness, explores the question how a &#34;bad&#34; creature could come from the hands of a good Creator, the meaning of the Creation and Fall, the meaning of evil or cruelty, the illusion of self-reliance and pain's role in breaking that illusion and re-forming it into true self-suffiency as a co-creator with God.Lewis makes valuable, thoughtful arguments that hold together all the way to the end, building on each argument to the next. If you've ever wondered about the meaning of pain in a world created by God, this is your book.Although the book may feel somewhat difficult to plow through, particularly at first, this is mostly due to the difference in writing style when Lewis wrote the book and the difficulty of the topic. The book becomes easier to read as you make your way through it. This is not a book to be skimmed - it requires thoughtful, thorough reading."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is one of the best books I've found to address the considerable question of how a good God could allow bad things to happen. I found it to be as challenging and interesting as Harold Kushner's \\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\\" although the two theologians come to different conclusions about what the reason for pain is.Part of what makes Lewis amazing is the crystal clear language and metaphor he uses for examing faith. In \\"Pain\\" he talks about humanity as being an opportunity to \\"reverse the fall of Adam\\" by coming to Christ. Here, in one sentence, he has truncated the scope of the Bible down to one goal -- start with the Fall, end with the Resurrection. A perfect, crystalline comment -- one of many in this book. Then Lewis is on to the consirable task of explaining why God would require pain (in fact, death) for his creations.Lewis -- in another excellent metaphor-- likens God to a sculptor and man to his clay. God is an artist, and won't stop until his creation is perfect. The pain we feel in life are God's attempt to make us his perfect creation, to complete the goal he has for our lives. In another collection, Lewis likens God to a heart surgeon. Knowing the full process required, the surgeon can't stop the process when the patient cries out in pain, because if he did the required outcome would never result.Lewis likens Christians to a child drawing a circle -- they are attempting to draw something but it is rudimentary and sketchy, while the perfect circle God wants for people's lives is outside the reach without pain.Fine, you might say, but what about needless suffering? Not the pain of death but the pain of life -- suffering children, poverty, abuse. Lewis is a little less convincing on this topic, relying on the age old excuse of blaming free will and man's sinful nature for the unneccessary pain in the world. Here I like Harold Kushner's metaphor (co-opted from another source) that human beings are \\"God's language\\". When you ask \\"where is God?\\" the answer is that God is in the spirit of inspiration of people who help out in times of crisis. God can't intervene, Kushner says, so he inspires people to do his work for him.All in all, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is an excellent book, well worth the read."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Pain is real, just as sorrow, death, and wickedness. Your becoming a Christian will not encapsulate you away from it. Christ did not promise that in the first place. But there are reasons why pain happens, as much to Christians as non Christians, and we should reach a better understanding of the circumstances in which we live, so that we can apprehend the promises that are envolved through that pain. Everyone is to pick up a cross at childbirth, but whether you follow Christ with it depends only on you.This book won't be the treat that 'Mere Christianity' was. It's more philosophical; it assumes the reader is a Christian and has some knowledge of Scripture. But nevertheless, everyone can follow his thinking and it will all make sense. About 160 pages, it has chapters of between 10 and 20 pages, and frames the problem in its right context before reaching his conclusion at the end of the book. This is not a make-you-feel-good (dumb) self-help book. It's a make you understand book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The problem is a real one, and Lewis brings considerable intellectual power to bear. But the result is disappointing. If his role is to \\"justify the ways of God to man\\", then in an intellectual sense he has succeeded to the extent of internal consistency. But his chapter on animal pain is chilling; if he had ever seen an animal in pain he could hardly have written so callously. His avowed fear of pain makes him intellectualize it to the vanishing point. This was an intensely human man, in some ways a noble man, but the humanity and nobility are missing and all that is left is the Oxford don. Read this, then read A Grief Observed, when he has to face the loss of his wife. That's the real book. That book gives the whole truth about the problem of pain. As he says in A Grief Observed, the cardplayers are right. if there's no money riding on the game, no one takes it seriously. The problem with The Problem of Pain is that Lewis had no money riding on the game when he wrote it."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book is a good honest look at issues involving the issue of God, suffering and evil.

A masterful book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis tackles the seeming paradox of pain in a world created by a loving God. We find it isn't so paradoxical. How can we escape pain without the forfeiture of free will? How would we love? How would we cherish? All that was good would be provided. All that was bad, extinguished. What, then, would be good? What measure could we take? Without free will we would be mere automata and, as automata, we would be nonsense.Grief exists because love exists. People die premature deaths because they must if we are to exist in a world where free will is possible. Anything else would be a controlled experiment, a massive fraud where we are not free to love God, but are predetermined to do so. There'd be no upside for there would be no down. We, in essence, would be pointless.The problem of pain, once looked at through Lewis, becomes not so much a problem, but a requirement. Indeed, it becomes surprising that one hadn't arrived at this reality before. C.S. Lewis' clarity of mind is as evident in The Problem of Pain as in his other apologetics. His works are immeasurably helpful to those willing to assess them objectively. 5 stars"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" Lewis deciphers a very trying question for the whole of Christianity - why must humanity suffer. Many atheists argue that if God were both omnipotent and good, why does he allow such a world of pain to exist? Lewis answers this question and many others in a style that can easily be compared with a learned scholar, not a layman.While I don't agree with all of Lewis's suppositions in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" (namely some of the statements found in the chapter \\"The Fall of Man\\" dealing with the origins of the human species), he still by and large offers up a very convincing case deeply rooted in the best Christian doctrine around - The Bible. The problem of pain for the Christian may be summed up rather simply: 1) Man, not God, was and is the creator and instigator of pain through Adam's sin. 2) Pain is a megaphone God uses to speak to us - sharply perhaps, uncomfortably, even unbearably - but if pain did not exist, would the joy and peace of God's love be the same? God uses pain to rouse a deaf world, to let us all know that something is wrong, that we need something beyond ourselves. 3) While life can be exceedingly painful at times, there is always the happiness, the sunrises and the mountain streams, for us to enjoy. Pain allows us see joy even more clearly.

The only chapter that led me to question his words is on man's fall.On human wickedness: \\"A God who did not regard this with unappeasable distaste would not be a good being.

It is for our sake.\\"The full acting out of the self's surrender to God therefore demands pain: this action, to be perfect, must be done from the pure will to obey, in the absence, or in the teeth, of inclination. How impossible it is to enact the surrender of the self by doing what we like,...........\\"After finishing the book, a thought on heaven came to my mind:The differences are what makes up a community whether here or in heaven: God has created us after a time where all was God (but that is no more!); we are all unique parts to a puzzle. He needs us all back to complete it----to rejoin our family in heaven; it pangs Him that many will not make it, and choose to ignore their created purpose, because they have surrendered to the self and not to the Lord. Once all was God, but after the creation all has changed; we are asked to be with God because we are of God. We are distinct here on earth, but the maximum distinction awaits us in heaven, to be reunited with our Creator.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis comes in hard and hits at the basis of pain from many aspects.

He is always accessible to ordinary people like me because of his plain-spokenness and his willingness to use analogies and examples. That said, he had his work cut out for him here, and he wasn't up to the task. Here's where he fell short.* \\"If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" (p 17). This is a straw man and a non sequitur. It's a straw man because the universe isn't bad. Viewed one way, it merely *is.* Viewed another way, parts of our universe are good (sex, love, family, football) and parts are bad (pain, loss, despair, death). It's a non sequitur because there is no logical link between the universe and Lewis' implication that because we can conceive of the Good, Good therefore must exist. It would make just as much sense to say that because humans have conceived of a movie where aliens come to earth that therefore E.T. must exist.* Lewis uses the reasoning that because we, humans, have a conception of proper conduct, with only some variation among cultures, that this must mean that God has given us morality (p 21). In response, I note that if morality is externally imposed on us as a fixed law of nature, then there would be no variation in it, or else God would be inconsistent. It would be like having the sun shine for one person but not the person right next to him. Moreover, there is a simple anthropological explanation for basic moral conduct. Conduct that perpetuates the family or group over time is more successful than conduct that harms the family or group. That's why the Hottentots, who immorally kill their \\"excess\\" babies, remain a small group, while the rest of humanity has grown.* The key part of the book is Lewis' attempt to resolve the problem of pain inflicted on people by forces of nature, i.e., pain experienced by a person, inflicted by a force not engaging in human free will. Lewis attempts to answer this particular dilemma by essentially arguing that the nature of reality requires this type of pain to exist: \\"Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature...involve[s], and you will find you have excluded life itself\\" (pp 33-34, see also p 54).Frankly, Lewis' conclusion doesn't make sense. Let's take a plausible example from the 2004 Tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people, many of them children. A child is the least morally culpable type of person, I think everyone can agree. So: a three-year-old child is drowning in the tsunami, screaming for help that never comes, gasping, choking, in utter terror as he vainly attempts to catch a breath of air. He drowns after experiencing four or five minutes of torture and fear. Lewis is saying the child *had* to suffer this way -- that reality would grind to a halt if he didn't? Lewis himself in this very discussion admits God performs miracles when it suits him (p 34) but somehow God can't alter reality so that this child does not suffer?Lewis attempts to buttress his position by arguing that to take away pain totally would be like playing chess with a player who could change the rules at his whim (p 34). That might make sense when discussing pain caused through free will, but not when discussing pain caused by nature. He inappropriately analogizes the impersonal forces of nature to a free-willed individual, the chess player.* \\"When the relevant difference between the Divine ethics and your own appears to you...the change demanded of you is in the direction you already call \`better'\\" (p 39). In response, I point out one of the classic clashes between human ethics and divine ethics presented in the bible: the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham. Gen. 22:1-2. Is Mr. Lewis really telling us that our moral compass will tell us that offering our children as sacrifices is in the direction of \\"better\\"? Which is more important -- following our morals or being obedient to God? Lewis can't make up his mind, first saying the former (pp 38-39), then the latter (pp 101-102).* \\"[L]ove may cause pain to its object, but only on the supposition that the object needs alteration to become fully loveable\\" (pp 55, 91-92). While that may be true in some circumstances -- \\"For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth\\" Prov. 3:12 -- it certainly doesn't make sense when it comes to the suffering of children. Does a baby really need to die screaming in agony in that house fire in order for God to fully love it? Ridiculous. Outrageous. Monstrous. Contemptible.Lewis can throw in the towel, and claim that spiritual realities are not \\"even explicable in terms of our abstract thought\\" (p 86). Or he can cherry-pick his examples on pain by claiming that free will necessarily must include pain (pp 32-31, 81-82) and we need pain to whip us, adults, into shape morally (pp 55, 104-107, 120). Fine. But don't pretend the existence of pain can be satisfactorily answered if you can't answer the problem of pain inflicted by nature on children. Every, EVERY scenario in which pain is felt and inflicted must be satisfactorily answered, or the premise of a loving, personal God, fails.Personally, I think the only real response to the problem of pain is the one God gave to Job: \\"Shut up.\\" See Job 38:1 - 40:2."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book can change the way you view things, if you let it. If you are looking for a book that is relevant now, as it was when it was written, and will be relevant still in 100 years, read this book. And then re-read it often. CS Lewis was ahead of his time...still is. Awesome book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Suffering is not an easy subject to approach. Humans are virtually incapable of approaching the topic objectively. We all have experienced suffering in some way. You may have felt it firsthand and/or you have empathized with a close friend. Suffering is an inescapable reality of life. We can try to run from it but it will always find us.I think it is valid to admit that the modern American has never truly experienced suffering. Even an individual classified as \\"poor\\" typically has some general education, enclosed shelter, access to adequate nutrition. In comparison, billions around the world live on less than dollar a day, have no guarantee of clean food and water, and no safe shelter to shield them from the elements and their enemies. However, we do understand that suffering is not always a physical attribute, in fact suffering in the soul can feel even crueler.C.S. Lewis, in my opinion, is one of the best thinkers in the twentieth century. His combined ability to think logically and communicate eloquently made him a superior scholar and an excellent apologist. Lewis recognizes that pain is a problem for a religion that believes God who is all-knowing, all-powerful, and most importantly all-loving.We agree God can do anything, but can the all-powerful overcome the impossible? Sunday school children love to ask the trick question, \\"Can God make a rock so big that He cannot lift it?\\" But to Lewis \\"nonsense remains nonsense even when you talk about God.\\" God cannot make a square with five edges because the rules indicate a square has four edges. God, though being all-powerful, has set the rules. In creation, He has given man free will and with free will the door to suffering is unlocked.\\"Trying to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and existence of free wills are involved, and you find that you have excluded life itself.\\" Creation with free will unfortunately leads to suffering. God allowed for the opportunity, and we as humans regrettably pounced on the chance.It is very clear that there is something very wrong with the world we live in. How in the midst of horrible suffering happening to us or around us did we ever come up with the idea of a loving God? God is real. This world is not our home. We will never be completely happy here because we will never be satisfied here. The one who satisfies is in Heaven where there is praise and no pain.This is a very deep book that requires a lot of reflection. This book does not answer all of my questions, but no book on suffering will."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis first wrote this book in 1940. In this manuscript Lewis considers the problem of suffering from a theoretical and theological viewpoint. The existence of pain in a world created by a good and loving God is a fundamental dilemma and perhaps one of the most common objections to Christianity.Lewis touches on some very key points of basic theology. But, he does so in a way that is bold, informative and energizing.In discussing the omnipotent and good natures of God, Lewis wrestles with two ideas that no sinful human could begin to understand. He does a splendid job comparing created and Creator so as to remind us that because of our nature man can not comprehend God's. However, Lewis makes a valiant effort to help us get a better grasp on God's perfect love.The heart of the book is centered on a review of man. Lewis investigates the fall of man and man's wickedness and pain. Aware of the reader's humanity he reminds us that we are imperfect, sinful and contain no qualities that are redeeming to a perfect being. Our pain, while unpleasant, is in fact well deserved and compassionately lenient.The conclusion is not - why does God allow pain? But, instead - why does he allow any of us a respite from our suffering? There is nothing in man deserving of relief or reward, but, through the grace and mercy of God, He has determined that He will provide some of us an eternity free from pain. How sweet that will be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C. S. Lewis has a masterful way of putting deep concepts into simple words and analogies. The \\"Problem of Pain\\" is an age-old question, asking how can God allow pain and suffering in his creation if he is indeed good and all-powerful. Though not providing a comprehensive answer, this book provides many of the write answers in a way that is accessible to any reader of teen years and beyond. Difficult questions deserve careful and clearly-communicated answers. This book provides just that."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"It is somewhat inconceivable to think that the same man who authored \\"A Grief Observed\\" also penned a book about pain. But Lewis is honest about his task in regards to writing about pain, stating that \\"All arguments in justification of suffering provoke bitter resentment against the author.\\" This is perhaps why a \\"Grief Observed\\" is so incredible. In a \\"Grief Observed\\" Lewis writes about his own suffering (the lost of his wife) in stark detail, expressing his doubts about his faith and God. So in a sense, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" should be read juxtaposed to \\"A Grief Observed\\" since any resentment against the author will quickly dissipate with the turn of each page. Behold a man who could not avoid the problem he set out to justify. The \\"Problem of Pain\\" deals with the theoretical justification for pain; \\"A Grief Observed\\" is the application of that theory.In this book Lewis writes: \\"If I knew a way of escape [escape from suffering] I would crawl through sewers to find it. But what is the good of telling you about my feelings? You know them already: they are the same as yours. I am not arguing that pain is not painful. Pain hurts. That is what the word means. I am only trying to show that the old Christian doctrine of being made 'perfect through suffering' is not incredible. To prove it palatable is beyond my design.\\" Thus, Lewis sets out to give us a different perspective about suffering. He traces suffering back to the fall in Eden and Satan's reign in the world. Lewis also talks about human pain and animal pain. Lastly, Lewis switches voices as he discusses heaven and the restoration of the human soul.I'll admit that this book isn't an easy read. I'll be the first to admit that there are many things in this book that I have yet to understand. But I think that with more time and experience, I will be able to re-read this book and think, \\"Alas Lewis, I see.\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The pages are yellowing on my modest collection of C.S. Lewis paperbacks. I've read them several times over the years, and they ring as strong and true as the first time through them, if not more so.In the Problem of Pain, Lewis deals with the difficulty of suffering in a world created by a good and all powerful God. As a Catholic, I understand that suffering exists to bring about a greater good, but why is that? Basically, it comes down to our free will; if humans are beings free to choose and not simply automatons, we have to have the ability to go bad: we are self-absorbed rebels and, as Lewis explains, \\"the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems to be well with it.\\"There are plenty of great, informative reviews already written, but I just want to highlight two passages that stood out to me; I'm a sucker for dogs, so these both had added impact.The first passage is an analogy to help explain why pain is involved - even necessary - in God's plan for us to reach perfection:\\"Man interferes with the dog and makes it more lovable than it was in mere nature. In its state of nature it has a smell, and habits, which frustrate mans' love: he washes it, house-trains it, teaches it not to steal, and is so enabled to love it completely. To the puppy the whole proceeding would seem, if it were a theologian, to cast grave doubts on the 'goodness' of man: but the full-grown and full-trained dog, larger, healthier, and longer-lived than the wild dog, and admitted, as it were, by Grace to a whole world of affections, loyalties, interests, and comforts entirely beyond its animal destiny, would have no such doubts.\\"How true. House breaking must be a complete mystery to that furry, little, tail-wagging barbarian; and the concept of bathing must be as linked in the mind of a puppy to torture as food is to pleasure.Lewis continues:\\"It will be noted that the man takes all these pains with the dog, and gives all these pains to the dog, only because it is an animal high in the scale - because it is so nearly lovable that it is worth his while to make it fully lovable. He does not house-train the earwig or give baths to centipedes. We may wish, indeed, that we were of so little account to God that He left us alone to follow our natural impulses - that He would give over trying to train us into something so unlike our natural selves: but once again, we are asking for not more love, but less.\\"The next passage, near the end of the book, deals with the idea of vicariousness in Christianity. As we are saved and resurrected in the man Christ, so too, Lewis supposes, our pets may - may, mind you - be taken up through us as we are taken up through Christ:\\"And in this way it seems to me possible that certain animals may have an immortality, not in themselves, but in the immortality of their masters. And the difficulty about personal identity in a creature barely personal disappears when the creature is thus kept in its proper context. If you ask, concerning an animal thus raised as a member of the whole Body of the homestead, where its personal identity resides, I answer \`Where its identity always did reside even in the earthly life -- in its relation to the Body and, specially, to the master who is the head of that Body.' In other words, the man will know his dog: the dog will know its master and, in knowing him, will be itself. To ask that it should, in any other way, know itself, is probably to ask for what has no meaning. Animals aren't like that, and don't want to be.\\"Since reading that passage, I have often wondered, petting my dogs as they rest so blissfully on the couch, if one day I may find that in return for the adoration and companionship they have afforded me, if, in 'civilizing' them, I have not done a greater thing than I know."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"There are things in life that can be learned which cannot be taught.For some of those things it is a matter of audience.I remember a song from a couple years ago which contained, roughly, \\"You never know what God is going to use to reach you.\\" In particular, there was a line about having to say goodbye to someone who left too soon.The moral of the song was, again roughly, \\"that which is bad, is actually good, when you belong to Jesus.\\"I think it is perfectly fine to have this realization *for yourself*.I can quite see someone in the grip of loss, steadfast in their faith, come to God and worship and cling to His sufficiency and providence.But I think this realization loses all of its power when you try to translate it to the 2nd person.\\"Hey, you should worship God because of this.\\"Whether this conveyance is true or not, the message is lost.The moral compass of the hearer almost becomes a raging beast, \\"What right have you to tell me to submit to this injustice.\\"That's why I didn't like the song much then.I like it even less today.This is because I now have a brother and a friend who have both been asked to make the sacrifice of Abraham, their child. Or if the analogy breaks down, because Abraham made a choice, the sacrifice of Job, which was to worship through the loss.So if one is going to talk about someone's pain, one is, from the outset, choosing to be indelicate. He is choosing to talk in 2nd person about those things which experienced in 1st person sweep one directly into the throes of existence and mortality.That said, The Problem Of Pain is about as delicately indelicate as can be achieved on the matter."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The intellectual problem raised by human suffering, examined with sympathy and realism from a Christian point of view.

His ideas about pain and how it relates to our ideas about God are not unique to Christians or only applicable in that context. I think this is a book for people who are searching, who don't know what their faith is and how to proceed in the world. This is a book about also ideas. Lewis speaks honestly about his own Christian faith and eloquently about ideas themselves but I don't think his work attempts to force or presuposes that you have reached any conclusions about religion God, life's meaning - infact his argument almost starts from the position of atheism - Lewis is also a great story teller - see Screwtape Letters, Narnia, etc."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I consider this little book on a par with the author's well-known classic Mere Christianity, as it addresses many profound questions that those in search of truth must have grappled with.

Lewis makes an attempt to explain the causes and purposes of pain. He explains its necessity in the universe in which we live and how God makes use of it. Out of the nature of both God and the universe, Lewis tells of how we have helped to usher pain into our existence. In doing so, he touches on the very essence of creation and the relationship between God and man. There are some very poignant notions in this book. The reader will develop a greater understanding of how we relate to God. The Problem of Pain will probably not comfort someone who is in the midst of dealing with his or her own suffering or heartbreak. It appears that it was intended for more of an intellectual approach to the subject. There are, however, some cumbersome and awkward moments in the book. Lewis makes what seem to be some largely unsubstantiated claims that are outside his realm of expertise, such as man's ability to control all his own biochemical processes before the fall and how animals come to God through man. These ideas seem to come at best from Lewis's imagination. He is humble in his consciousness of his own imperfection. In the preface, Lewis states, \\"If any real theologian reads these pages he will very easily see that they are the work of a layman and an amateur.\\" His writing style is like free flowing thought which can be difficult to read at times. Nonetheless, the work is in no way incomprehensible. Overall, the profound ideas Lewis has on the nature of pain have deepened my own spiritual understanding, and I considered it a privilege to have read his work."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis wanted to write this book anonymously because he felt he was too much an amateur and a layman to cover such a theologically difficult subject. He was convinced otherwise, which was a good thing. We can thus put it into context with his other works as well as the man himself, certainly no \\"amateur.\\" I read this once, noticing its rich complexity, so I immediately read it again and wrote what I thought were the highlights, chapter by chapter. Unfortunately, it's lengthy.In his \\"Introductory,\\" Lewis starts out by offering his atheistic version of \\"Why do you not believe in God?\\" giving a dark explanation of the world summed up with \\"The race is doomed\\" and that all evidence points to a universe hardly \\"the work of a benevolent and omnipotent spirit.\\" But such pessimism poses a problem: \\"If the universe is so bad...how on earth did human beings ever come to attribute it to the activity of a wise and good Creator?\\" He offers some of the possibilities for this but then makes a startling statement: \\"At all times, then, an inference from the course of events in this world to the goodness and wisdom of the Creator would have been equally preposterous; and it was never made.\\" He footnotes: \\"i.e. never made at the beginnings of a religion. After belief in God has been accepted, \`theodicies' explaining, or explaining away, the miseries of life, will naturally appear often enough.\\" (Emphasis added)Lewis delves into the elements of all developed religions, the first being an explanation of \\"awe\\" of the Numinous, or mighty spirit, which is as old as humanity itself and was \\"not the result of an inference from the visible universe.\\" He attempts to explain \\"awe\\" but acknowledges the difficulty and concludes that there are only two possible views: \\"Either it is a mere twist in the human mind, corresponding to nothing objective and serving no biological function, yet showing no tendency to disappear from the mind at its fullest development in poet, philosopher, or saint: or else it is a direct experience of the really supernatural, to which the name Revelation might properly be given.\\"The second element of religious development is the acknowledgement of some kind of morality expressed in words like \`I ought' or \`I ought not'. And \\"they all agree in prescribing a behavior which their adherents fail to practice. All men alike stand condemned, not by alien codes of ethics, but by their own, and all men therefore are conscious of guilt.\\" Where did it come from? Lewis offers another \`either-or' possibility. \\"It is either inexplicable illusion, or else revelation.\\"The third stage in religious development is when humankind makes the Numinous Power \\"guardian of the morality to which they feel obligation.\\" Lewis discusses variations of this, e.g. \\"sheer moralism\\" or \\"non-moral religion\\" but again concludes that the connection may be sheer madness, and \\"oddly fortunate in its results,\\" or revelation.Lewis then moves to the historical event in Christianity, saying that either Jesus was a \\"raving lunatic\\" or He was precisely who and what He said he was. \\"There is no middle way....Christianity is not the conclusion of a philosophical debate on the origins of the universe.\\" And it isn't a system \\"into which we have to fit the awkward fact of pain: it is itself one of the awkward facts which have to be fitted into any system we make. In a sense, it creates, rather than solves, the problem of pain, for pain, would be no problem unless...we had received what we think a good assurance that ultimate reality is righteous and loving.\\" In thinking about this, the fact of pain is painful; it hurts. But I think Lewis is saying that it's either man functioning like an animal, like accepting death at the jaws of a wolf pack fatefully, as it was meant to be, as opposed to the pain of the believing person feeling that somehow \\"it's not fair\\" because he knows there is a loving spirit guiding the universe. The former really has no legitimate complaint for it's consistent with his worldview. The latter seeks understanding, which is the point of his book. Thus, Christianity has hit \\"us in the face\\" with this problem of pain.In the chapter \\"Divine Omnipotence,\\" Lewis first presents the age-old question, \\"If God were good, He would wish to make His creatures perfectly happy, and if God were almighty He would be able to do what He wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\" Lewis's explanation is long, dealing with free will, definitions of terms, and \\"anthropomorphic\\" conceptions of God's freedom. But I enjoyed, and record, one concluding remark: \\"It is no more possible for God than the weakest of His creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.\\" Yes, that seems correct.We still have to deal with how we are to reconcile God's goodness with a suffering world, without contradiction. In the chapter \\"Divine Goodness,\\" Lewis raises the question of the definition of goodness leaving open the possibility that we do not see the whole picture as seen by God. But the fact that we are called to repent suggests that the good is not just a reversal of what we know. Nor is goodness synonymous with contentedness; e.g. God as our kindly grandfather liking to see the children enjoying themselves. \\"If God is Love, He is, by definition, something more than mere kindness.\\" And Lewis describes the nature of this love--we are the objects of this serious love. We asked for a loving God and we have one. But He is the \\"lord of terrible aspect\\", a consuming fire. \\"The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \`love', and look on things as if man were the center of them...God has no needs...God's love, far from being caused by goodness in the object, causes all goodness which the object has, loving it first into existence and then into real, though derivative, lovability.\\" He has everything to give and nothing to receive. \\"If He requires us, the requirement is of His own choosing.\\" If He suffers, it is from a \\"humility that passes understanding.\\" If He chooses to need us, \\"it is because we need to be needed.\\" He is all goodness \\"for our sakes...to experience the love of God...is to experience it as surrender.\\" Lewis drives home the point: \\"When we want to be something other than the thing God wants us to be, we must be wanting what, in fact, will not make us happy.\\" When we follow the demands of worshipful obedience, do we honestly suppose that it can do Him any good? It is for us.In the chapter \\"Human Wickedness,\\" Lewis deals with the fact that the \\"good news\\" was viewed as a healing to a people who knew they were mortally ill. But this has changed in modern times and \\"Christianity now has to preach the diagnosis...before it can win a hearing for the cure.\\" In other words, it has to give bad news, news that people don't want to hear. He offers explanations for this condition, which I won't cover, but suggests that an old sense of sin is essential. Otherwise we're not part of the audience to whom Christ's words were addressed (by our own choosing). Lewis considers some of the illusions we harbor in regard to sin:We are deceived by comparing ourselves, Mr. X, as not much worse than Mr. Y. Also, we often believe \\"that habitual vices are exceptional single acts, and make the opposite mistake about our virtues--like the bad tennis player who calls his normal form his \`bad days' and mistakes his rare successes for his normal.\\" Lewis is saying that we don't face reality about ourselves. (And I can personally relate to the tennis analogy since I once fancied myself as a player.)A reaction to social conscience, a good thing, and the resulting corporate guilt can mask or deceive us. It can become an excuse for evading the real issue of personal responsibility.\\"We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin.\\" As all times are eternally present to God, time does nothing to wash away guilt. Only repentance does and \\"we should remember the price of our forgiveness and be humble.\\"There is no \\"safety in numbers\\" as though it made our sins more excusable because the majority of our neighbors consider it within the normal standard of decency.There is a temptation to compare people of this modern age as being so much more humane or enlightened than those in ages past and he offers some good examples of how this isn't necessarily so (It's called chronological snobbery.)Beware of reducing all virtues to a sentimental kindness. One cannot be truly kind unless one has all the other virtues.The Holiness of God is something other and more than moral perfection; but like corporate guilt, it is easily used as an evasion.\\"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God.\\" James 1:13.Lewis quotes William Law: \\"If you will here stop and ask yourselves why you are not as pious as the primitive Christians were, your own heart will tell you, that it is neither through ignorance not inability, but purely because you never thoroughly intended it.\\" He closes the chapter with a clear description of true humility, not the kind where we put halos around our own heads, which is the worst sin of all-pride.In \\"The Fall of Man,\\" Lewis defines the doctrine that man is a horror to God because of the abuse of free will, then discusses two theories on the origin of evil: Monism (God being above good and evil) and Dualism (God produces good but some independent power produces evil). The Christian view is more complex--the nature of free will, a good thing, includes the possibility of evil. Augustine saw the sin described by the Fall as the result of pride, a sin against God. What exactly happened when man fell, we don't know; but Lewis offers his own mythic tale involving \`Paradisal' man who, as a species, spoiled himself, and therefore \`good' must come from corrective action.In \\"Human Pain,\\" he suggests that the human spirit will not even begin to try to surrender self-will as long as all seems well. \\"Now error and sin both have this property, that the deeper they are the less their victim suspects their existence; they are masked evil...We can rest contentedly in our sins and in our stupidities...but pain insists upon being attended to.\\" Pain is God's \\"megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\" It is not vengeance but Lewis acknowledges that it is a terrible instrument that could lead to final unrepented rebellion of man. Another element of this issue shatters the illusion that what we have is our own and it's enough for us. We say \`we have all we want' and unfortunately it does not include God. In this scenario, He is an interruption. He is our parachute, there for emergencies only. And as long we call our own life agreeable (under our astute management) we will not surrender to Him. God then must do something to help us see the \`false happiness'. Lewis calls it \\"Divine Humility.\\" If we have not learned to know Him, our life is wretched, in spite of all appearances. We thus don't even know our need, i.e. \\"the dangers of apparent self-sufficiency.\\" Lewis says, \\"God's will is determined by his wisdom which always perceives, and His goodness which always embraces, the intrinsically good.\\" And one of the good things that rational creatures should freely do is surrender themselves to their creator in obedience. It's for our own good.Lewis carefully discusses this business of writing about pain in the abstract recognizing that it is not the same as experiencing it. He doesn't even attempt to \\"prove it palatable.\\" He does explain, \\"Tribulations cannot cease until God either sees us remade or sees that our remaking is now hopeless.\\" Lewis then offers six additional propositions on the subject of human suffering:The paradox of suffering: If it's \`good' shouldn't it be pursued? No! It's not good in itself. What is good for the sufferer is his submission to the will of God and for the spectators, the compassion and mercy aroused. God can and does make a complex good out of a simple evil.Tribulations will not cease until God \\"sees the world to be either redeemed or no further redeemable.\\" Thus man's attempts for \`heaven on earth' are absurd but the hungry still need fed, the sick cared for, the dying visited and loved.The Christian doctrine of self-surrender and obedience is theological, not a political doctrine. There is no inference to a political system or obedience to a political system.We are never safe in this life but there is plenty of enjoyment. However, God will not encourage us to mistake our pleasant journeys over the landscape as a trip \`home'.\\"There is no such thing as a sum of suffering, for no one suffers it.\\" Lewis argues that adding numbers don't add more pain. (I have to think about this one--six million Jews? One million Ugandans?)Sin by its very nature breed's sin by strengthening sinful habit and weakening the conscience. On the other hand, certain pain, once over, is over.Hell as a doctrine is one of the chief reasons Christianity is attacked as barbarous. Lewis agrees and detests it also; but sees the rationality of the possibility of losing (as well as the clarity of Scripture on the subject). \\"The problem is not simply that of a God who consigns some of His creatures to ruin.\\" It's made complex by the cross--\\"so much mercy, yet still there is Hell.\\" While it may not be tolerable, Lewis argues that it is moral by addressing the objections to it:Hell is objected to as retributive punishment. But Lewis gives a long account of the truly despicable unrepentant man who will not be converted and asks, \\"what destiny in the eternal world can you regard as proper for him?\\" He then discusses the acting out of revenge or spite as an improper response but acknowledges an ethical demand and the conflict of Justice and Mercy. That such a man should be forgiven for remaining what he is, is a confusion of \`condoning' and \`forgiving'. To condone evil is the same as ignoring it, the same as treating it as though it were good. The totally self-absorbed, the evil man, will get his wish...\\"to lie wholly in the self and to make the best of what he finds there. And what he finds there is hell.\\"Another objection deals with \`eternal damnation' vs. \`transitory sin' built on the idea of eternity as a \\"mere prolongation of time.\\" But he rejects this idea and offers a descriptive analogy considering eternity as a \\"solid\\" while our base-line earthly life is a line.A third objection concerns our images of hell, e.g. as expressed in art. Christ speaks of hell as \`everlasting punishment', of \`destruction', and \`exclusion'. Lewis says, \\"To enter heaven is to become more human than you ever succeeded in being on earth; to enter hell, is to be banished from humanity.\\"Finally, it is objected that the loss of a single soul to hell, means a defeat of omnipotence. \\"And so it does\\" Lewis agrees. \\"In creating beings with free will, omnipotence from the outset submits to the possibility of such defeat\\". Lewis calls this a miracle, not a defeat. \\"I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful, rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside... They enjoy forever the horrible freedom they have demanded, and are therefore self-enslaved.\\"To the objectors of the doctrine of hell, Lewis asks: \\"What are you asking God to do? Wipe out their sins? But He has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what He does.\\" Lewis then reminds the reader that this chapter is not about some distant person facing possible damnation, our friends, or our enemies; \\"it's about you and me.\\"I found the chapter on \\"Animal Pain\\" a bit of a stretch. Although Lewis finally offers that \\"we just don't know,\\" I won't comment further.I will briefly close with the final chapter on \\"Heaven.\\" In Romans 8:18, Paul says that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy compared to the glory of heaven. Lewis says Christians are criticized as escapists, trying to ignore the duty of making a happy world and looking to a dreamy \`pie in the sky' existence. He also notes the fear in some that heaven is a bribe but counters that heaven offers nothing a mercenary soul desires. Lewis beautifully writes of the nature of heaven, the union of the soul with God, in its \\"continual self-abandonment\\". He writes of it less as explanation, and more as poetry, so trying to capture it here is more than I'm able to do. It is certainly a great mystery!This is not a book for light reading. Lewis skillfully offers an analysis and perspective on some sticky subjects within Christianity."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I have recommended this book to so many people over the years. CS Lewis's writings have a certain wit about them that keep you entertained while at the same time exploring vast Truths. Like Chesterton, Lewis is excellent at keeping the attention of his readers while leading their logic into deep philosophical Truths. If there is a loving God, why is there so much evil in the world? Who hasn't asked this question? Even a believer asks this question. Atheists, however, rather than asking the question and seeking an answer, instead use this questionable characteristic of life to demonstrate the absence of an all-good, all-powerful, omni-present God. Every person who has read this book that I have talked to has really enjoyed Lewis' witty and personal style of writing. All in all, buy this book and then pass it around!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"St. Thomas Aquinas said that there really is only one legitimate objection to the existence of God--the problem of pain. How could an all-good, all-powerful God permit such pain and suffering in our world? In his book, Lewis devotes a chapter to each element in this problem.God's goodness, according to Lewis, doesn't mean \\"niceness\\" in the modern sense. It doesn't mean that God's ultimate goal is for us to be carefree and comfortable. We must remember, Lewis reminds, that God is \\"our father who art in heaven,\\" not \\"our grandfather who are in heaven.\\" Which means he sometimes refines us and brings challenges that end up benefiting us and make us fully alive. God does that not in spite of his goodness, but because of it.Regarding God's power, Lewis explains that while in most cases God doesn't cause pain, he certainly permits it because it can often have incredibly positive effects. Pain fortifies and refines our character, as most of us can attest, while it also forces us to lean closer to God. Both are worthy ends in God's eyes.In addition to these topics, Lewis also covers the nature of heaven and hell along with the interesting question \\"do animals experience pain?\\"The Problem of Pain is one of Lewis' most brilliant books and, excepting Mere Christianity, the one I would most likely give to an atheist friend. It's an intelligent, charitable response to one of Christianity's thorniest issues and I think Lewis' answers are some of the best available."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Whether physical, emotional or spiritual, pain is an undeniably reality in this world. C.S. Lewis eloquently explores the pain we endure as humans, as well as the Christian response to it, in this wonderful book.I think many non-believers find pain to be a great deterrent against them accepting faith. They wonder how a loving God would possibly allow His children to suffer. This has never been a problem for me, although I have been fortunate to avoid devastating tragedy in my life. Lewis explains how pain is a product of the Fall, how through the Fall humans have become vulnerable to \\"the laws of nature\\", which they were not subject to before sin tarnished Man. Lewis also writes of animal suffering, the grim reality of Hell and he concludes with a vision of Heaven: \\"But God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love\\"I would highly recommend this book to Christian and non-Christian."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This might be one of Lewis's greatest and most challenging works. The questions he tackles are among some of the most profound that human beings face, and Lewis approaches them with characteristic logic, sensitivity, and humility. His \\"solutions\\" (and he would not call them solutions) are not easy but they are very sensible and true to his faith."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In The Problem of Pain C.S Lewis addresses the \\"elephant in the room\\" when it comes to Christianity. He answers this question, if God really loves us why does he allow pain to come into our lives? Everyone at one point or another asks themselves that. C.S Lewis gives us a new point of view and theological reasons to this issue.One of the main reasons that he tells us is that our pain is a reflection of our sin. When we sin we are subconsciously turning our hearts away from the Lord and that causes us to endure pain. \\"We have a strange illusion that mere time cancels sin. But mere time does nothing either to the fact or to the guilt of a sin.\\" Lewis mentions this because people who are constantly in emotional pain are waiting for time to cancel their sin. Not everyone who is in pain is experiencing it as a reflection of sin, but as christians we seem to be in a lot more pain than others due to sin. This is because we know what is right and we choose to walk down the pain of temptation and sin. \\"From the moment a creature becomes aware of God as God and of itself as self, the terrible alternative of choosing God or self for the centre is opened to it.\\"C.S Lewis also explains how once you experience God's love for you, you will forever long to have it. \\"God will look to every soul like its first love because He is its first love.\\" This part of the book helped me to re-fall in love with God. As Christians we find it easy to become accustomed to just do the \\"christian walk\\" and we start to forget about all the things that God has actually done for us. \\"We regard God as an airman regards his parachute; it's there for emergencies but he hopes he'll never have to use it.\\" This quote was one of the most powerful quotes for me through out the entire book. It moved me so much because I could see in my own life where I was putting God on the back burner. This book has taught me a lot of things that will help me through out my life.C.S Lewis is an amazing man of God. You can see it in his writing that he writes because of experience. He lets his walk with God lead his writing. As Christian reading this book you can look into the words that Lewis says and relate it to your lives. I believe that God has given Christians this chance to have authors like Lewis to relate to and to seek advice from. In the end this is the statement I will leave this with, \\"God has paid us the intolerable compliment of loving us, in the deepest, most tragic, most inexorable sense.\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In the beginning of Saint John's gospel, Philip finds Nathaniel and excitingly tells him, \\"We have found the [Messiah], Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth!\\" Nathaniel's obviously less than enthusiastic response was, \\"Can anything good come from Nazareth?\\" (Jn 1:45-46). I think if we approached a friend and told that friend, \\"I have a new richer outlook about pain!\\" Our friend would most assuredly respond very glumly, \\"Can anything good come from pain?\\" Let me qualify that statement! Our friend would reply thus, unless they had read \\"The Problem of Pain\\" by C. S. Lewis.This book is based on the claim and belief that underlies all Lewis' works, and that Nathaniel quickly found out, that something good did come out of Nazareth! With his extraordinarily rare brilliance that mystifies his readers, Lewis takes a subject that does not make sense, cannot be understood, and cannot be readily accepted. Startlingly, we then marvel as his incredible mind begins to make sense of all this, so that we, the reader, can begin to understand, and learn to accept to some degree, certainly in this case, one of the most difficult aspects of life that many people have to face or experience.Nathaniel did not just swallow what Philip said; but, he accepted the invitation, \\"Come and see!\\" We certainly do not have to buy this whole matter blindly. I even propose that we do not even have to read the entire book! We just need to go and see for ourselves. Begin to read the book and see what happens!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"\\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world\\" - p. 91.The problem of pain or our objection to its existence as CS Lewis emphasized, in parallel, can be summarized by the word of Epicurus, a first century philosopher, \\"Either God wants to abolish evil, and cannot; or he can, but does not want to; or he cannot and does not want to. If he wants to, but he cannot, he is impotent. If he can, and does not want to, he is wicked. But, if God both can and wants to abolish evil, then how comes evil in the world?\\" The problem statement seem to bring a contradiction in God's attribute of Omnipotence and Love in solving the problem of pain/evil (there is a reason I use pain/evil term correspondingly) which is CS Lewis first tackled in this book.The trick question which is often brought up regarding God's omnipotence is going like this, \`Can God create a stone that He can not lift?' is like asking, \`Can God be a No-God or un-Godlike?' As CS Lewis put it, \\"This is no limit to His power. If you choose to say God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it', you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combination of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them to other words \`God can'\\" (p. 18). In the end, \\"not because His power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God\\". (p.18)And then came the second problem (or so it seem we make a fuss and problem about it), any consideration of the goodness of God at once threatened us with the following dilemma. \\"On the one hand, if God is wiser than we His judgment must differ from ours on many things, and not least on good and evil. What seems to us good may therefore not be good in His eyes, and what seems to us evil may not be evil. On the other hand, if God's moral judgment differs from ours so that our \`black' may be His \`white', we can mean nothing by calling Him good\\". (p. 28). The point is our conceptions of the Divine goodness which tend to dominate our thought though seldom expressed, are open to criticism. Or is it what we thought of God's goodness is like we want the heaven but we do not want God in it, if God comply with that demand then He is a good God.If we can come to term with....well the above terms then we can talk the problem of pain/evil reasonably and objectively (as objective as a human can be) as CS Lewis proceeded with the rest of the book. The book does not present an essay of problem of pain for practical application. It is in the realm of our mind that we perceive pain as a problem and it is in this realm CS Lewis quenching our intellectual curiosity of such perceived problem. For practical application (as in emotionally), I suggest Where is God when it Hurts? by Philip Yancey.\`What are you asking God to do? To wipe out their past sins and, at all costs to give them a fresh start, smoothing every difficulty and offering every miraculous help? But he has done so, on Calvary. To forgive them? They will not be forgiven. To leave them alone? Alas, I am afraid that is what He does. - p. 130"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I relly Enjoy C.S Lewis, This book helped me realize in the logical sence that God Does love me, even though I have Pain.Great Book, I relly Enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The Problem of Pain is the first of C.S. Lewis's apologetic works. Having been an athiest(or maybe just a skeptic?) ten years before, Lewis certainly had walked through this problem on his own and in 1940 wanted to help many of his fellow British skeptics through it, too.The book starts, after a disclaimer on his lack of theological schooling, with an explaination of selves that are distinct from God and a description of the fall of man before tackling human pain. His basic argument is that, while human pain is a result of Adam's Fall, God uses it for our good to A)alert us that something is wrong with the universe and B)to refine Christians into better people. Lewis does admit that while pain can \\"rouse the bad man to a knowledge that all was not well\\" it can also \\"lead to final and unrepented rebellion\\". He finishes with a very good explaination of Hell,\\"the doors of hell are locked on the inside\\" and an equally good chapter on Heaven.This is a book for those who are struggling with the \\"idea\\" of pain; in other words, \\"If God is so good why does allow people to be in pain and even send some of them to Hell?\\" But if your question is more concrete, like \\"Why did God allow my husband to die from a fatal illness?\\" you will probably find this book to be like salt in a wound. If that's you I would recomend Lewis's other book on pain, A Grief Observed, or Philip Yancy's Where is God when it Hurts. The Problem of Pain is certainly an excellent piece of apologetics, however, and I found it to be very helpful."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I think it is Lewis' point that this life on planet earth involves a series of good events intersperced with very painfult ones. We start this life with few of its bumps and terrors. [Even embryos can absorb painful events if they survive at all.] God seeks to create man as one with whom He can have companionship so He does not want to control the creation. Man struggles through random events of pain and sorrow but also of beauty and joy. Man develops his own character during the course of his life. In this way God creates man with character by letting man develop it himself but using pain, sorrow, beauty and joy supplied by God's creation. One of the mysteries of the universe is how we can take with us through death the character God wants for his companionship."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis effectively and poignantly analyzes the age-old &quot;Problem of Pain.&quot; The logos of his reasoning never falters, but goes hand-in-hand with the pathos of his telling. More still, he effectively establishes his ethos by being uniquely qualified to disect the problem, having suffered much on his own, popularly known to have lost his wife to cancer.This book, an enlightening pleasure, helps the reader understand pain, why it occurs, and why it is necessary."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis wrote this book in 1940, twenty years before his wife Joy died of cancer. After this experience he wrote \\"A Grief Observed\\". \\"The Problem of Pain\\" begins \\"Not many years ago when I was an atheist ... \\". Thus, with first hand experience of the view that pain and an Almighty God cannot co-exist, Lewis plainly sets out the \\"problem\\": \\"If God were good, He would make His creatures perfectly happy, and if He were almighty He would be able to do what he wished. But the creatures are not happy. Therefore God lacks either goodness, or power, or both.\\"From here he takes the reader on a journey that does not merely attempt to tackle the co-existence of God and pain, but scrutinses the very concepts of God, pain, love and happiness. Later, in \\"A Grief Observed\\", what was (relatively) impersonal writing on a theological dilemma in \\"The Problem of Pain\\" becomes a personal testimony."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I would recommend this book--The Problem of Pain--very strongly to the Christian reader. Certainly, the thrust of this book is NOT to convince agnostics and atheists of the validity of the Christian platform, and anyone choosing to live in the Fool's Paradise that is agnosticism will come away from a reading of this book just as incredulous and empirically-minded as before. As any well-versed Christian knows, a testimony of God and of Christ comes not through study and reason alone. Any agnostic or atheist wishing to investigate the fundamental claims of Christianity would be better off studying C.S. Lewis' \\"God in the Dock,\\" or \\"The Grand Miracle\\"(an abridged version of \\"God in the Dock\\").Chiefly, I think that this book is meant to help Christians--or those with Judeo-Christian leanings--to reconcile the existence of pain with the realities of God's mercy, benevolence, and grace. Christians--and people of many other religions--believe life in the universe to be the result of a deliberate and calculated act of creation (nothing random or irrational, as the agnostics postulate). In light of this fact, a great number of Christians wonder why God would knowingly and intentionally create a world in which pain and sin had the possibility of being introduced.Lewis very accutely observes, in this book, that free will--while certainly POSSIBLE without the option to commit evil--would be utterly WORTHLESS without the option to commit evil. As I have prayerfully contemplated this doctrine, I have come to know if its truth. For instance, when my father or mother told me--and still tell me--that they love me, it was and is deeply meaningful because I know that they CHOOSE to love me. If all my parents could possibly have done was love me, with no active decision on their part to do so, their love would have no meaning. They COULD have chosen to abandon or abuse me, but they did not. And that gives meaning, indeed, to all of their love and nurturing. We do not congratulate fish for breathing under water, after all (it's the only way they possibly can breathe!).Lewis also observes, with emphasis, the fact that Jesus Christ could only have been one of two things: A lunatic or a God. The combined multitude of witnesses that knew Him--according to both Scriptural and Non-Scriptural documentation--affirm that if there was one thing Jesus constantly declared it was His own Godhood, and His Sonship to God the Father. When all of the evidence is taken into account, the representation universally set forth is that Jesus of Nazareth claimed to be God. Some denied it, some believed it, but all knew that this was, at least, His claim.And, of course, all things taken into consideration, only a madman would have even the slightest inclination to make such claims unless the claims were true. Jim Jones and David Koresh are two primary examples of men who falsely claimed to be God, and who were, as is undoubtedly known, both certifiably insane.Lewis makes the point, also, that with pain comes humility, and with humility comes receptiveness to God. If we were never to experience pains or disappointments in life, we would always take our blessings and gifts for granted. Either that, or we would worship the gifts (blessings) instead of the Gift-giver (God).The point is also made--and it agrees perfectly with Emerson's essay on the Law of Compensation--that every \\"loss\\" in life is, in reality, a sacrifice offered to the acquisition of something else: If a man loses his left arm, he develops an impressivley strong right arm; If a woman loses a husband to death, she is relieved of her duties as wife, and thus is free to go about doing other things.Finally, the Tester and the tested are both positively identified. Unfortunately, many--including some professed Christians--assume to be testing God. If, for example, they read in the newspapers of an elderly man shot down and robbed by thugs, they will say, \\"God failed him.\\" But, the fact is, through all of the tribulations and turmoils of life, WE are the ones being tested, NOT God. God is already the paragon of absolute perfection. We, on the other hand, must prove ourselves in the test that is life (and, in the case of thugs robbing elderly men, such thugs fail the test quite horribly).To love and adore God in a perfect world--a world without pain or opposition--would be no major accomplishment. But, to love and adore Him in spite of all temptation and adversity is a most supreme accomplishment.This is a most praiseworthy book!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"It is works like this that will have C.S. Lewis ranked, in the future, with thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas. The book is very \\"readable\\" but must be re-read over and over to start to get a hold of the momentous implications of the ideas he is proposing. Do the work to try and comprehend the message and you will be rewarded with a far greater sense of personal peace in this suffering world. Changed my life 14 years ago. Changing my life again as I read it now.There are astounding ideas captured in words. For example, in answer to people saying that they couldn't believe in a God who needed our worship, comes a lucid response about how God doesn't need us, but humbles himself for us to relate to. Lewis writes:\\"A man no more diminishes God's glory by not worshipping Him, than a lunatic can put out the sun by writing the word \\"Darkness\\" on the walls of his cell\\""},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The only goal of my brief and amateur review is to simply express my unqualified opinion of what the reader should expect to find within the pages of this amazing work of literary art. To quote directly from C.S. Lewis himself \\"What I am now going to say is merely an opinion of my own without the slightest authority, which I submit to the judgment of better Christians and better scholars than myself.\\" Even worse, Lewis actually was a scholar, and I am not.As you may suppose from the title, The Problem of Pain is not a lighthearted work designed to keep the passive reader entertained while he waits for a flight, or passes time in the library. It is not meant to be read in one sitting, nor is it meant to be skimmed over for the highlights. There is no point in this book where the reader suddenly realizes that he has already \\"figured this out\\", or \\"gotten what he needs\\". This book is meant to be read in a quiet, even peaceful, place where your mind can focus on the depth of the material and allow the concepts and theological analyses to sink in completely. It is a book that will cause you, or at least it caused me, to go back and reread paragraphs or entire chapters because you suddenly realized he lost you ten minutes ago. In short, it is much like the second half of \\"Mere Christianity\\", it can be a tough read.Another thing you may infer from the title is that this book may be ideal for someone who is in a season of difficulty or pain in their life right now. In my humble opinion, it is not that kind of book. This material is for those who are seeking a greater understanding of the evil, suffering, and pain in this world. To rethink the Fall of Man and the Doctrine of Original Sin, the effects of the natural world, and ultimately to begin to consider the realities of Heaven and Hell.It is a tool to be used in the education of a Christian adult who is trying to more deeply understand this fallen world, how we got here, and what lays ahead. To prepare a person to be ready for whatever challenges this broken world may bring. It is not a book to comfort the grieving widow or widower with flowery and fanciful, yet understandably comforting, prayers of strength and fortitude as they struggle with their grief. I see nothing in these pages that would comfort the parent of a sick or dying child, if read from their perspective deep within such unimaginable anguish. It is no good to bolster the foundation and board up the windows after a hurricane. That is the time to pick up pieces and rebuild. This book is for the calm before the storm, it is to set a deeper foundation and ready the steel shutters that allow the house to withstand the forces of the storms of life. It is an essential tool in the mature yet still developing Christians belt to help him more confidently and faithfully face the realities of evil in a world full of fallen men and the ultimate mixed blessing, free will.The Problem of Pain addresses one of the most difficult objections to Christianity in a very clear and thought provoking way. You may find the tact to be quite direct, and less than gentle, which is precisely why this is not a book for those currently in a painful season. For those people, and in time we shall be one of them, there are far more gentle and consoling books available. One last thought on this, it is also possible that this book is for those who have had great suffering in their past, and are now trying to come to grips with it, and move forward in, or even return to, their walk with Christ. For that application though, be gentle and consider all that I have said before giving this book as a gift to a healing soul.In summary, I recommend this book to anyone who is seeking to become closer to God by gaining a more clear understanding of His Word, His world and His people. It is for those who seek answers to the difficult questions, whether for their own edification, or to be prepared to defend the Faith when called upon to do so. Jesus Himself said to \\"...bring you mind\\", and this book requires you to do just that.-------------------Side note: Before he was saved by Christ, C.S. Lewis was an atheist. This is of little importance now because once he was saved he became one of the best and most prolific advocates of Christianity in literary history. In the \\"introduction\\" of this book, Lewis gives what had previously been his response to the question, \\"Why do you not believe in God?\\". His answer consists of one long paragraph taking a little more than one page of the book. That answer is one of the most difficult passages I have ever read, and far from being a convincing argument for atheism, it gives the reader a very clear example of how truly blessed we are to have our Faith in a loving God. The other option is nothing less than horrific."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"As a dentist I've had the opportunity to treat several patients with chronic idiopathic oral-facial pain.

This book cannot be fully grasped in its original context without some degree of belief or acceptance of Christian doctrine. It is apologetics at its best, but cannot be considered in the \\"self-help\\" category like many contemporary titles are.That said, this must be the finest treatise on the apparent contradiction between the existence of pain and the existence of a supposedly loving God that has been written.Succint, well-organized, thorough, yet \\"The Problem of Pain\\" still reads like it was written by a human being rather than a scholar. Some chapters bring conviction. The chapter on Hell brings fear and dread, and respect for Him who can \\"destroy both body and soul in Hell\\". The chapter on Heaven, which Lewis admits is his own philosophical foray, no one else's -- brings hope and reassurance that Heaven is your true calling, your one True Home.This is not light reading, at least not at first. This may not be a book to recommend to someone at the height of a crisis; Lewis taxes your attention and does not take any short cuts. A \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of this book would miss the point. Pain is one of the toughest theological problems a Christian can face, either in their lives or the life of another person they know -- and Lewis does not want you going in armed with half an argument or some \\"Precious Moments\\" sentiment.From a non-Christian POV, I would be surprised if this book made much sense -- so many of the pillars are set on Christian theology, philosophy, and tradition. If you cannot (or will not) accept the possibility of the existence of Heaven, Hell, or God, this book will be just so much incomprehensible babble.But, as I said, it is not written for that segment of the market. This book is best read by the thinking Christian who has reservations about aspects of Christianity that seem to gloss over, avoid, or ignore the issue of human suffering."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis analyzes the fundamental question, or problem, of pain: how can God be omnipotent and yet allow pain (war, injury, cruelty, etc.)? Lewis's answer has many levels. Foremost, is that nature had to be created with certain unchangeable properties. For example, the same hardness which allows wood to serve as a beam in my house allows it to serve as an instrument of potential injury, as when that beam collapses and hits my head.The world also had to be created neutral so that humans could interact equally with one another, i.e., those same, unchanging properties of wood allow it to be manipulated similarly by anyone. But, obviously a neutral world contains the potential for good or evil. Wood can be used to build a home, which is good, or to create a weapon, which is evil. But, this is what makes us human. We have free will.If I choose evil, God could not intervene. For to intervene some times but not others would be unjust and illogical (this is why miracles, if you believe in them, are extraordinarily rare). And to intervene once is to intervene always. Imagine if God intervened each time one person was going to cause another, or himself, pain. If he did, we all would be puppets, not humans.Another interesting idea in this book is that of Original Sin. According to Lewis, we have not inherited Adam's sin, as is commonly believed, but instead everyday face Adam's identical choice, perhaps thousands of times a day. For Adam's sin was not disobedience in eating the apple, but in choosing himself over God. Adam had the opportunity to see himself either as a creation or an individual self existing apart from God. Thus, according to Lewis, a final reason for pain, is that it is God's wake-up call that we have, in constantly choosing ourselves, chosen the wrong thing.This is a profound and provocative book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book clarified many issues in my life and turned my God from One that was a bit of a stretch to fit into my everyday world, into a God which makes himself evident in every aspect of the earth, evil and pain included. I think this book frankly is a better apology for Christianity than Mere Christianity. Definitely a good introduction to the problem of pain, and the clearest exposition of the free-will defense I have read. C.S. Lewis deals with a concept lofty and philosophical in a manner that grips my attention and bolsters my faith. I recommend this book first above all Lewis' other books on theology."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I'm a blogger. Blogging makes me read. It makes me turn off the television and read. This is very good. What I have been reading lately is C. S. Lewis. Particularly, I've been re-reading The Chronicles of Narnia. After reading through The Magician's Nephew and The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, I decided to shift gears and read one of Lewis's theological works before resuming the Chronicles.All I can say is, \\"Wow!\\" The Problem of Pain is not what I expected. I'm not sure what it was that I did expect. Perhaps something more along the line of a good evangelical book - you know, shallow, but with lots of Bible verses. Pain is exactly the opposite. Deep and with very little use of prooftexting. How the Church of the twenty-first century needs more minds like C. S. Lewis! We have been drowning in the fluff of \\"make-me-feel-good-like-Jabez-bless-me-bless-me\\" Christian publishing for years. It is very difficult to find a Christian book store that sells theology anymore (perhaps because Christians don't think or read anymore). I bought this copy of Pain from Amazon.Lewis is surprising because he doesn't go where you anticipate he will. He tackles the issue of pain from a very human angle. He asks the right questions and doesn't always give us the answers we want. Lewis is often held up by evangelical Christianity as a beacon of evangelical thought. I wonder if those evangelicals have even read him lately? Lewis disagrees with the doctrine of total depravity, questions original sin, weaves a parable of the fall which includes evolution, and leaves the door wide open for something other than an ever-burning hell.The answer to the problem of pain is that we are works in progress, being made lovable by a God who loves us even when we are not yet lovable. Says Lewis, \\"If the world is indeed a 'vale of soul making' it seems on the whole to be doing its work.\\" The true heart of the book is the two chapters in the middle of it all: \\"Human Pain,\\" and \\"Human Pain, Continued.\\" Lewis says, \\"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\"One of the most intriguing and thought provoking passages I encountered was this: \\"As for the fact of sin, is it probable that anything cancels it? All times are eternally present to God. Is it not at least possible that along some one line of His multi-dimensional eternity He sees you forever in the nursery pulling the wings off a fly, forever toadying, lying, lusting as a schoolboy, forever in that moment of cowardice or insolence as a subaltern? It may be that salvation consists not in the cancelling of these eternal moments but in the perfected humanity that bears the shame forever, rejoicing in the occasion which it furnished to God's compassion and glad that it should be common knowledge to the universe. Perhaps in that eternal moment St Peter - he will forgive me if I am wrong - forever denies his Master. If so, it would indeed be true that the joys of Heaven are for most of us, in our present condition, 'an acquired taste' - and certain ways of life may render the taste impossible of acquisition. Perhaps the lost are those who dare not go to such a public place. Of course I do not know that this is true; but I think the possibility is worth keeping in mind.\\" Are we to understand in this passage a bit of Eastern Christian thinking? Is salvation not exclusively individual, but also corporate? Is pain part of the process whereby a corporate humanity is brought to a heavenly perfection in Christ?Lewis always makes me think and re-think. We need more of that in the Church today. O, that our teachers and preachers would read!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis was a rare individual. One of the few non-clerics to be recognised as a theologian by the Anglican church, he put forth the case for Christianity in general in ways that many Christians beyond the Anglican world can accept, and a clear description for non-Christians of what Christian faith and practice should be. Indeed, Lewis says in his introduction that this text (or indeed, hardly any other he produced) will help in deciding between Christian denominations. While he describes himself as a 'very ordinary layman' in the Church of England, he looks to the broader picture of Christianity, particularly for those who have little or no background. The discussion of division points rarely wins a convert, Lewis observed, and so he leaves the issues of ecclesiology and high theology differences to 'experts'. Lewis is of course selling himself short in this regard, but it helps to reinforce his point.Lewis sees pain as an inevitable part of the human experience, given our condition of being estranged from God. He does not pain and suffering as being caused by God. 'The possibility of pain in inherent in the very existence of a world where souls can meet,' Lewis writes. 'When souls become wicked they will certainly use this possibility to hurt one another; and this, perhaps, accounts for four-fifths of the sufferings of men.' God has a role in that God is the creator of all things, and set things in motion, but God is not responsible in Lewis' view for the individual or corporate acts of humankind in contradiction of God's will. In this, Lewis does go against the Calvinist strain that goes through Anglican and other theologies.Lewis highlights part of the problem with pain in that it cannot be easily ignored. 'We can rest contentedly in our sins and our stupidities; and anyone who has watched gluttons shovelling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists upon being attended to.' Lewis admits that this is a 'terrible instrument' that God uses to draw people back to God's will, and that it isn't always successful. In addressing the doctrine and idea of Hell, Lewis admits that this too is a terrible idea (in fact, he states it is an 'intolerable' one), but also states that this is not meant to be an intellectually satisfying or comprehensible doctrine, but rather a moral one. Lewis does hasten to state that people often confuse the imagery of Hell for the doctrine of Hell - the ideas of Dante et al. are very pervasive, and our conceptions of what is meant by Hell usually owes more to such sources than the actual Biblical text.Lewis also shows part of his method of biblical interpretation in different passages in this book. In the chapter on Animal Pain, he discusses the absence of statements in scripture about whether animals share in immortality. 'The complete silence of Scripture and Christian tradition on animal immortality is a more serious objection; but it would be fatal only if Christian revelation showed any signs of being intended as a \\"system de la nature\\" answering all questions. But it is nothing of the sort.'Lewis explores the issues of divine omnipotence, divine omniscience, and divine goodness as possible contradictions and stumbling blocks to the way we see the world (or the way in which we can see a world with God operating in it, or responsible for it). Lewis comes to no definitive, systematic conclusions that will satisfy everyone. In the case of this particular text, Lewis is writing is a specifically Christian context, and readers from other backgrounds and adherents of other traditions may find less to connect with in this text.This is a key piece in the overall structure of Lewis' theological construction."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"There are better books about the theological problem of pain (the biblical book of JOB, Paul Brand's PAIN: THE GIFT NOBODY WANTS, and Philip Yancey's WHERE IS GOD WHEN IT HURTS?, to name three), but Lewis's book is a good place to start. Lewis himself makes it clear in the introduction that this book only addresses the intellectual problem arising from suffering, and as such does not pretend to give advice about living with pain. Lewis offers this by way of observation, that &quot;when pain is to be borne, a little courage helps more than much knowledge, a little human sympathy more than much courage, and the least tincture of the love of God more than all.&quot; As a catalyst for considering the theological difficulty of resolving the idea of a good God with the pain and suffering in His creation, this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Is pain God's megaphone?Lewis ably examines the thorny subjects of pain and suffering in this book. The brief work is at once philosophical, logical, and semi-theological, even though Clive points out in his preface that he is no theologian (We can thank God for that!).Lewis seeks to answer questions such as &quot;If God is good and all-powerful, why does he allow his creatures to suffer pain?&quot;No stranger to pain himself, Lewis sheds some valuable light on the subject and on human nature. The book is both a comfort and a discomfort. One wonders how differently Lewis might have approached the subject after the death of his wife, for example.I found the later chapters, particularly those on Hell, Animal Pain, and Heaven particularly enlightening.&quot;Pain,&quot; writes Lewis in the end, &quot;offers an opportunity for heroism.&quot; His words ring true. Those who have suffered, to any degree, will find the book intriguing.A fine work, I would not recommend that the Lewis neophyte begin with this work, but perhaps &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot;"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"If God loves us, why do we suffer? Why is there pain? Why? Christian Apologist extraordinaire C.S. Lewis studies the possible answer to these questions. The answers are intellectually stimulating and thought provoking, to say the least, for those interested in the direction (Christian, primarily orthodox) Lewis's argument takes. What is more fascinating about the text is the rigid emotional distance Lewis has to the subject, his own personal experience with Pain (told in A Grief Observed) still many years away. Those wanting a more easy to relate to study should read Grief. Those wanting a strictly intellectual and emotionally distant look at the concepts and Christian answers could do a lot worse than The Problem With Pain. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Many times through my second reading of the book (first time a decade ago), I felt-\\"this is what language was made for.\\" Of course, no apologist can posit an argument without counter. However, Lewis shows himself vested with not just \\"divine\\" insight, but also with his unique, unmatched grasp of the human condition, primarily as expressed in literature and linguistics. This book echoes many themes from his earlier writings, he reveals himself consistent throughout. His intellectual foundations (he might not call them quite philosophical) are strong. His discussion of the \\"neutral field\\" as a requirement for interaction is masterful. Anyone that doubts the validity of his comments on free will won't be convinced of such by any arguments. For the rest of us, Lewis clarifies a conviction consistent with the broadest sweep of churchdom-what he would most certainly call \\"mere\\" Christianity. If one sees contradiction between his comments here and his own \\"A Grief Observed\\" then rest assured you are sitting at the feet of a human teacher. His writing is intensely personal-his comment \\"how can I say with sufficient tenderness what here needs to be said\\" reveals his heart for humanity in the comments that follow. Furthermore, he takes the high ground decades ahead of the animal rights movement in his ideas about animal pain, to which he devotes an entire chapter. He is an able voice to promote real care-stewardship-of animals long before the issue became so trenchant. His final chapter on heaven is best illustrated by reading his adult fiction \\"Perelandra\\" where he re-creates Eden, and to stages their triumph over original sin."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"While I read this book (in fact, an old, battered version of my mother's) in order to answer some questions regarding pain and why it exists in a universe created by a loving God (if one accepts this hypothesis), Lewis not only convincingly answered those but also dug into topics such as free will and election, clarifying many other not necessarily pain-related questions in the process. I am now convinced (my apologies to all the Calvinists out there) that free will is an essential ingredient to human being and that it is necessary in order for Christian self-surrender to have any sense at all.I usually don't riposte to other reviews, but I don't believe the reviewer was correct in saying Dr. Lewis chickened out, largely because his concept of innocent children seems erroneous to me. I remember my younger brother was fully capable of scheming before he could even talk. The helplessness of children does not make them innocent.I fully recommend this book to anyone grappling with problems of pain."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis points out that this volume is a defense of the idea of an omnibenevolent God against the 'argument from the existence of pain' and is not conceived as a theodicy. That is, Lewis makes no attempt to separate God from the problem of pain, in fact, apart from certain classic theological ideas, the suffering of 'conscious' beings (humans) cannot be coherently understood as being a \\"problem\\" at all. In an atheistically meaningless universe, the concept of suffering is meaningless, thus the awareness of a pain \\"problem\\" can only be addressed theologically. Although he modestly suggests that others might offer better theological arguments, it seems that Lewis argues plausibly, rationally and soundly. The following sentences present, generally and briefly, one of Lewis' more famous arguments:\\". . . anyone who has watched gluttons shoveling down the most exquisite foods as if they did not know what they were eating, will admit that we can ignore even pleasure. But pain insists on being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.\\" (p 91) \\"While what we call 'our own life' remains agreeable we will not surrender it to him. What then can God do in our interests but to make 'our own life' less agreeable to us, and take away the plausible source of false happiness?\\" (p 94) \\"How can I say with sufficient tenderness what here needs to be said? It does not matter that I know I must become, in the eyes of every hostile reader, as it were, personally responsible for all the sufferings I try to explain . . . (p 95) \\" . . . [God] is not proud, He stoops to conquer, He will have us even though we have shown that we . . . come to Him because there is 'nothing better' now to be had.\\" (p 96) \\"Those who would like the God of Scripture to be more purely ethical, do not know what they ask. If God were a Kantian, who would not have us till we came to him from the purest and best motives, who could be saved? And this illusion of self-sufficiency may be at its strongest in some very honest, kindly, and temperate people, and on such people, therefore, misfortune must fall.\\" (p 96) \\" . . . but from our present point of view it ought to be clear that the real problem is not why some . . . people suffer, but why some do not. Our Lord Himself, it will be remembered, explained the salvation of those who are fortunate in this world only by referring to the unsearchable omnipotence of God.\\" (p104)Other problems and arguments are treated, but the approach is not exhaustive. Lewis doesn't intend it to be; he merely wants to address certain obvious questions (and he does this quite ably). As I read this I concurrently read J. C. Polkinghorne's \\"Quarks, Chaos & Christianity\\" which addresses the problem of pain as well as the problem of \\"natural evil\\" -- as each relate to the concept of freedom. Some say that Polkinghorne thinks as Lewis would have if he had been a quantum physicist; so if you find yourself agreeing with Lewis or at least intrigued by his arguments, I'll suggest you read Polkinghorne as well."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In this classic by C.S. Lewis, the writer's brilliance really shows. Aside from his somewhat speculative approach to applying Eden to evolution and the way he treated Heaven and Hell as the final destinations rather than resurrection with New Heavens/New Earth, this book is excellent. I was inspired, challenged and strengthened by the reading, and will certainly read it again sometime down the road."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Probably less appealing (than, say, Mere Christianity) because Lewis is needing to be more \\"lateral\\" here, more horizontal, more earthbound. There is nothing merely inspirational about his book, in other words, since it is taking as its subject a pretty serious philosophical problem.I'm not a hundred percent on board with reviewers who insist that one must be a Christian to appreciate this book. But an openmindedness to thoughts about a deity, and some grasp that humility and submission can be good things, that one can learn from them, are probably essential qualities to bring to this reading. No proud atheist will be satisfied by these arguments.For my money, Lewis is at his best here when speculating about the afterlife. His subjective version of heaven, as a place where personal joys are extended and sustained, is so much more appealing than centuries of talk about streets of gold, or harps and clouds. He has a way of making heaven meaningful, a place you'd like to be."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This was a very good overview of the problem of evil and how to respond to it from a Christian viewpoint. Lewis does quite well in most of his chapters making solid Christian points. Yet he loses me in his chapter entitled \\"Animal Pain\\" wherein he SEEMS to identify that some animals have not only sentience but a sufficient amount of conciousness to almost be considered moral beings. He then describes a version of animal \\"heaven\\" wherein tame animals are incorporated into their masters as we are incorporated into God. Strange stuff indeed.Besides this though, the book is quite splendid, with a great explanation of God's omnipotence and His omnibenevolence."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"In picking up this volumne it has been a long time since I read anything by C.S. Lewis. I had forgotten how logic oriented he is and how these writing of his can be very academic and intellectually stimulating. I picked this volumne up because of dealing with many people and the pain they are feeling with depression.Lewis does a great job of academically addressing the issue of pain in relationship to our emotions. This is not a book about addressing physical pain, for such a book pick up Joni Erickson's new book, the problem with pain. This book deals with how we as Christians handle the aspect of pain in regards to suffering, relationships, anxiety, depression and extreme emotionally turmoil.Lewis does a good job of addressing the issue, although at times I think he is far ranging in his dialogue. He addresses the issue of God's omipotence and His goodness. He does an extremely good job of this. Then he moves on to the issue of human wickedness and human pain. The logical progression of his arguments are good. Although it doesn't appear that his dialogue is from a personal experience but from an academic intellectual pursuit.Just when I thought he was going pretty deep he had one of the funniest quotes I think I can ever write down and use. In discussing the issue of pain with animals he sarcastically is writing about how some people want to believe that all animals go to heaven and have souls and have feelings. He doesn't quite buy into that. But here is his quote that I love, \\"if the worst came to worst, a heaven for mosquitoes and a hell for men could very conveniently be combined.\\" I wholeheartedly agree!But probably the main point of his argument is this, all Christians will suffer. He doesn't ask, \\"Why do good people suffer?\\" Instead he asks, \\"why don't all Christians suffer?\\" He sees suffering and pain as the way for God to help us grow in our spiritual walk with Him.This book is for every Christian. But it is not light reading. It takes discipline to read, think and then digest what C.S. Lewis is writing. But it will be a good exercise.Once you have read this you need to follow it up by reading his book, \\"A Grief Observed\\", that will be the one that you find absolutely riveting in regards to how he personally deals with suffering, grief and pain.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I think this was the first book by Lewis I had exposure to. I was 15 to 16 years old, and I remember not being able to know what I was reading, but falling in love with however it was being said. It was through this book that I came to love not just Lewis, but reading in general. Over time, I became a better reader and this book has had a huge impact on my life.I shall never forget reading the first couple paragraphs of the chapter on Heaven. I remember reading them over and over again, cherishing how true his longings mirrored my own. I remember pulling aside anyone I could get a hold of and reading this beautiful passage. Almost without fail, whenever I read these passages to others, they are stricken with delight, and touched by that same stab of joy Lewis himself felt all those years ago as a child in Ireland.As a philosopher major, I can testify to Lewis' philosophical abilities. He is an able philosopher with remarkable philosophical intuitions. He is one of the finest writer of pros I've come across, and his style has made me fall in love with the English language.As for the content, Lewis probes one of the deepest mysteries in life: the riddle of pain in a Christian universe. And there are no easy answers. Having read Plantinga, van Inwagen, and Alston, though these world-class philosophers do great, I prefer Lewis. There is a tone in Lewis' pros that is almost deliciously Christ-like, a sweet aroma that makes you feel like you're being talked to by someone who isn't here to mock you or make you feel stupid. He is here - as he once said - like a patient in the same hospital, who has been here a little longer, and has learned some tips on how to cope.His chapter on Animal Pain is the most speculative (as he admits), but his speculations are thought provoking, taking away from the beasts self-consciousness, leaving them with sentience. The logic is that if you take away self-consciousness, the beast can't discern an 'I' which experiences successive states of pain: in other words, there is no 'I' to connect together all the successive pain states.The Fall entertains Lewis' theory about how the rational faculties - once man disobeyed - sunk beneath the tide of the passions and became subject to them, all within the historical context of biological evolution: once man evolved sufficiently, rational capacities were directly implanted by God, giving us the Adam and Eve of Scripture.The Chapter on Hell was the most unclear to me, even after the Peter Kreeft commmentary you can find in his books on Heaven. In Hell, the 'I' is abolished, and so there is no unifying 'I' to tie together the various facets of the soul, like a book without a spine, the pages eternally blown away. Time is no longer linear succession or progression - time stops growing in length, and the soul somehow lingers in this eternal final instant where - mysteriously - the soul is destined to linger in time's eternal width. If you imagine time as a line, then eternity in Hell is like a plane; or if you imagine time as a plane, then eternity is like a cube. Just as the plane is a dimension of the cube, time is a dimension of eternity.As you can see, Lewis' speculations build upon the speculations of past philosophies about these issues. Lewis confesses to be standing on the shoulder's of giants, and when he himself is a titan, we are able to see very far indeed.The best thing about Lewis is that even if you disagree with him, the presentation is given in a logical order, with clearly written pros, illuminating analogies, and penetrating insights into the human condition.A must read!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"C.S. Lewis is never light reading. He is highly educated and challenges the intellect. Which is good. Especially for a topic such as this.He explains the age old question - If God is Good, and if God is all powerful, and if God is loving, then why is there pain and suffering in the world?Lewis starts out presenting the problem. He explains that if there was no God, then there would be no problem. If life is mere chance, then the fact that there is pain would be a non-issue.So where did we come up with this idea of a good and loving God? Certainly not by looking around us! Pain, suffering and injustice are older than recorded history.He then proceeds to explain that in a universe where the creatures have free will, there is going to be a chance that one of us its going to hurt someone else. For example, God made wood which can be used for many purposes. It can be used to make fine furniture; or to make a baseball bat which can be used for fun, or can be used to hurt someone else.This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to be able to explain the problem of pain to themselves, or to those who who are skeptical or searching."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis deals with a timeless issue in this book: why is there suffering and pain? In the UK, this issue has come centre stage in moral debates. Should a being being permitted to exist if its life is destined to be one of \\"useless\\" suffering.There was an article in the paper about a year ago about a couple who had a child with cystic fibrosis and wanted through IVF to conceive a child free of this nasty disease. Through the \\"miracle\\" of science, they were enabled to screen out any embryos with the disease so that they could have a \\"perfect\\" child. The logic for this was, so they said: \\"why would anyone want anyone to suffer\\" (aside: what would their existing child with CF be now thinking: it would have been better that I had not existed?) as if all who suffer, would wish not to be rather than to be. This kind of thinking is becoming indemic. It is a rejection of the truth which shines forth luminously from every human being, a truth which causes the beholder to say: \\"It is indeed wonderful that you exist\\"And, this is where Lewis comes in with an attempt at answering the question of: \\"why is there suffering\\"?:\\"The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word \\"love\\", and look on things as if man were the centre of them. Man is not the centre, God does not exist for the sake of man. Man does not exist for his own sake\\".Thus, love has become associated with a soft type of sentimentality in our culture; but it is much greater than that: it actively seeks for the good of the person loved - love may thus permit suffering to enable the person loved to become a person, who is himself capable of self emptying love. Lewis notes: \\"We are not merely imperfect creatures who must be improved; we are, as Newman said, rebels who must lay down our arms\\".Lewis does not shrink from giving suffering its due: \\"No doubt pain as God's megaphone is a terrible instrument; it may lead to final and unrepented rebellion. But it gives the only opportunity the bad man can have for amendment. It removes the view; it plants the flag of truh within the fortress of a rebel soul\\"In a word, suffering destroys our self delusion that we are in control, that we are demi-gods: when we suffer, we know where we are and its not at the centre of the universe.Thus, whilst suffering (be it physical, natural or emotional), is an effect of evil, being a privation of the good, it can lead us to a recognition of our creaturely place in the universe and hence to find out true \\"orientation\\".On hell, Lewis states; \\"I willingly believe that the damned are, in one sense, successful rebels to the end; that the doors of hell are locked on the inside\\"Lewis is very good indeed in this book; he synthesises brillianty key christian doctrines coherently and intelligibly.Brilliant!"},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"While some (including myself) would disagree with Lewis on some parts of the book, the profound insights more than make up for the differences. The chapter on Heaven somehow manages to describe, in clear and flowing prose, the normally indescribable longing of the spirit."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"A question which so often plagues us is what Lewis attempts to answer. His examples, as good as they have been in the past, have never been better, cornering us at every position, until we can't help but admit that he was right, even if we don't want to. And, when you read this book, as in so many others of his, you are surprised by the internal joy you feel which makes you never want to lose the memory of even the moment you are in.If you have the patience to re-read every page a few times, then get started as soon as possible; if not, then read Mere Christianity first to get an understanding of why people love this author so much, and then you'll know why it's worth going over each page several times."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis does an excellent job of conveying his reasoning for pain's necessary existence, though as other reviewer's have noted, if you have no concept or acceptance in the existence of a God, then this book would seem no more than an inept grouping of essays from yet another of \\"God's sheep.\\" I had often pondered the thought as to why God allowed such atrocity to exist in the world, but this book did definitely lead me to a greater understanding of why, from God's perspective, that such things must be as they are. Essentially, Lewis says it is for the greater good of mankind and that it proves God's love for us, for pain more often than not drives us closer to the God who so wants our communion, (that same God that we so often neglect to commune with when all is going well) though Lewis does readily admit that at times pain creates feelings of bitterness or resentment towards God.Lewis does not try to obscure the fact that he probably tolerated pain no better than anyone else. In both the exposition of his vulnerabilities as a person that he makes throughout the book and the scriptural references he uses to back up what he says, Lewis does an outstanding job of conveying the message that God would neither have given us free will nor pain if he did not love us with complete abandon. Definitely recommended reading for any Christian seeking a better understanding as to why hardships must be endured."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I definitely like the premise of Lewis' book - Christians must be able to explain \\"The Problem of Pain\\". Or in other words, given the fact that we belive in a loving God why is there so much pain and suffering in the world. Definitely not an easy task, but a necessary one.Overall I think that Lewis does an excellent job explaining in a very logical fashion why pain exists, and the purpose that it serves. He covers many difficult facets of this topic in a unique way. I believe that his analogies are very powerful, and well beyond my capability of coming up with this material. I truly appreciate the way he so easily works his way through the material. He was truly gifted by God with a unique apologetic approach.I agree with a few other reviewers that this book is not without fault. Two sections I did not find to be very good were the chapter on the pain of animals, and some of the chapter about the fall of man. The chapter on animals seems out of place, the one about the fall includes some obscure rambling about the origin of man. Not really Lewis at his best.Having said that, I still highly recommend this book to any Lewis fan, and definitely any Christian. We need to be able to provide answers to life's difficult questions, and Lewis is a great source of material for supplying the Christian world view."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"What more can be said about C.S. Lewis... indeed!This book gets off to a slow rambling start as noted in a previous review but gets up to speed about a quarter of the way in. And once you are in the book is VERY mentally engaging (not one of Lewis's lighter books).Lewis tackles the big question: How can a supposedly loving God allow suffering?If you haven't asked that question yourself then you are probably too shallow to get into a book like this ;-)If you haven't been confronted with a question like that from someone else then you need to get out a bit more...Lewis tackles the big question with intellectual depth. However, some of the most interesting portions of the book come when Lewis allows his fertile and creative mind to speculate. For example, he touches on the pre-history of man before Adam which might be problematic for some but should given a chance...His short sidebar discussion on the purpose of pain in animals is wild and wacky (almost trippy) stuff that I had never thought about.His thoughts on hell and damnation are weak. Caution: I believe the final punishment for unrepentant sin is permanent death (or non-being)... so you may want to take me with a grain of salt.Anyhoo... if you like to have your brain stretched and tickled at the same time you might want to try this one. But I'd recommend you try some of his fiction first. My personal favorite of his fiction isTill We Have Faces: A Myth Retold, then try the more accessible apologeticMere Christianity.The Problem of Pain is a bit tougher to chew."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"For a person who includes \\"Mere Christianity\\" in any list of my favorite books (most influential, most often read, etc.), I really haven't read much of C.S. Lewis's other work. I intend to remedy that, having just finished \\"A Grief Observed\\" and, more recently, \\"The Problem of Pain\\".As would be expected, the book is full of brilliant insights and Lewis's trademark logic and disarming wit. Consequently, it should be read by just about everyone, although it is probably not the best introduction to the subject for non-Christians.I held back one star only because Lewis's writings on the origins of sin and mankind are wildly speculative and arbitrary, and are founded on next to nothing. His views on the topic are further clarified in the chapter on animals, but just as I was starting to track with him, he tossed in a little more craziness. One of Lewis's usual strengths is a fresh and unorthodox perspective, but he gets a little out of hand for a stretch. My criticism is not that these portions of the book were not what I expected, but rather that they were not useful."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"The Problem of Pain seeks to answer one of the most consistently asked questions about the Christian faith: why is there suffering and how is suffering possible in a universe created by a God that claims His goodness. Lewis, in what amounts to a very long essay, not only seeks to answer why pain and suffering are present in this world, but how this most negative of situations can actually be used for good in the lives of individuals facing affliction.Pain, whether physical or otherwise, is a problem to be explained precisely because things in the world do not seem right. The pain the Lewis addresses most are the pains caused by spiritual separation. While the pain caused by biological processes is bad, Lewis seems to indicate that much of the pain we suffer through is due to our rebellion against God and our inability and failure to achieve peace and happiness.For those with more modern literary tastes the important thing that Lewis carries away from his speculation is how the origin of pain is absolutely correlated to the dissolution and fall of man. The Biblical narrative's statement that by sin death entered the world is a short, yet profound statement of the origin of pain. By developing his speculative story of the origin of man, Lewis ultimately says that man has refused to communicate with God by natural means, and as a result God has agreed with man and cut man off from natural communication with Himself.Any issue dealing with pain in the lives of modern believers has to be addressed from two angles. The first is the necessity of encouraging an embattled group of people who are called out by and being changed by their Creator. The second deals with the unique challenges of the modern world where naturalistic and pantheistic tendencies point the believer inward to solve his problems of pain and suffering.For those in need of encouragement in the midst of suffering, Lewis is quick to point out that pain is often much to be preferred over many types of temporary pleasure. Here Lewis is consistent with much of Protestant thought in that any sort of sanctification is confined to the earthly life of the believer. All pain and suffering that is used as a sanctifying process ends in life, there is no possibility of Purgatory.The advances of the naturalism and scienticism of the modern world have for the first time led many to believe that pain can be solved successfully apart from the work of God. The generations, since the late 1800's, have believed as truth that men do not need God, and furthermore, that no sort of supernatural intervention will solve pain and suffering. From physicians to political peace brokers, much of the world has developed deep faith in its own ability to solve any natural pain or any pain caused by the suffering of others. The ever-increasing influence of pain and suffering upon modern man can be said to be inversely proportionate to the level that modern man believes he can escape from pain. The great value of The Problem of Pain is that it attempts to remind any who have a sense of arrogance about modern man that pain for them is God shouting above their pride so that they would recognize his sovereignty and His care for them."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"I have been reading several of CS Lewis' books lately because I enjoy the way this man of great intellect and faith expresses the major doctrines of Christianity. He has a way of taking very difficult concepts and making them easy for me to understand. This book not only addresses why we have pain, but also explains several related doctrines more clearly than I have seen before.His discussions on the characteristics of God and his love were presented well. He talks about God having power to do what is intrinsically possible, not the intrinsically impossible. God cannot allow free will and also make sure there is no pain. A loving God does allow pain, just as a loving parent sometimes allows pain to help his child become wiser and stronger. A child that has been totally protected from pain or consequences is spoiled and does not reach his or her potential.From the above it appears that Lewis does strongly believe in free will, which does make the problem of pain much easier to comprehend. This happens to agree with my feelings on the subject. He also points out that we humans sometimes need pain to remind us of our need for God. I sometimes find myself forgetting to pray as often as I should when things are going smoothly; but I always seem to remember God when things are not going well.I strongly recommend this book for anyone wanting to understand why God allows pain. I don't agree with all of his arguments, but I thought they all were well presented and it got me thinking."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Even though this book is thin, it took me a long time to make it through the first 3 chapters because there is so much food for thought. Chapter 3 especially changed the way I look at things. This is an important read for anyone who has ever asked \\"Why me?\\" or said \\"It doesn't seem fair\\". Or even for anyone who wants to experience a level of writing far beyond the normal read. I bought this book and made it through chapter 3 before giving it away to a friend in need, and had to buy a new one because I was desperate to read the rest."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Excellent book by C. S. Lewis. Used for adult Bible Study discussion group."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"According to the Author, Lewis took up the daunting task of trying to understand why pain exists if a good God exists too on a suggestion from a colleague. He notes in the book that figuring the problem of pain out started out as a duty, then quickly became an immense pleasure. Reading the book may give the reader the same progression of feelings. One may feel the urge to confront the deep question of pain and how that impacts one's faith is an obligation to be met grudgingly against one's will. However, while delving into the work, one will find it extremely pleasurable as the author reveals that there really isn't a problem of pain. The question eventually evolves from why, in a world created by a good and all-powerful God, is there pain and suffering to why, in some instances, is there a lack of pain.Lewis illustrates his resolution of this problem eloquently and sufficiently, though concisely. The book could be much longer and still not fulfill every but, though, or what if created by these major life concepts.I recommend \\"Mere Christianity\\" over this book, but suggest that this is a great supplement. While some ideas overlap, there is much to be learned by each book."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"This book attempts to tackle the problem of evil from the perspective of Christain theology. Ultimately, I feel this book falls short of its objective; I am an atheist, so it's not exactly surprising that I consider theodicy to be a doomed endeavor.However, I found this book to be a thought-provoking presentation of the subject, and the most solid presentation of the free-will theodicy that I've ever seen.

I'd expected something a lot better and I was astonished at the poverty of Lewis's theodicy.

Not an easy reader."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Lewis's preface to his \\"Problem of Pain\\" is a train-wreck and it put me off him forever.Only palatable once rendered a game of rhetorical and scientific whack-a-mole, you will find a steady precession of sloppy thinking from page one:*Opening quote supports the opposing position, made by a thinker known for theological sophistry.*Appeal to authority of dubious honesty. It is doubtful C.S. Lewis was ever more than agnostic, and not a very thoughtful one at that, in fact he seems to have been made out of straw.*He claims he thought the universe was completely dark. This is certainly false.*He claims he thought that the universe is \\"unimaginably cold\\". The universe is 3K. That is a very easily comprehensible number, especially when compared to absolute hot (Planck temperature).*Claims that celestial bodies are 'few'. This is mind numbingly stupid. He seems stunned that things might have a little space in between them.*Claims that few places support life, perhaps only Earth. We have discovered hundreds of planets and even by cautious estimates the Universe is boiling with life, some of it sentient.*Thinks in terms of millions of years. Cute.*States consciousness is necessary to feel pain. This is not obvious, and he does not try to justify himself.At this point I threw the book down in disgust and did not return to it. He's not worth your time."},{"Title":"The problem of pain,","review":"Since God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion. When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God. Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact. So pain is God's megaphone. If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain. Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone. But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to \\"plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls.\\"Where does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from? Given mankind's painful existence, \\"an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous.\\" God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed. Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - \\"What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?\\" One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible. Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters? I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true. Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God's viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love. In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as \\"damn nonsense.\\" Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.Lewis's insistence that people have free will needs to be examined. Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin. Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception. The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability. Abused children typically grow up to be abusers. In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23. Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will. Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop. In most people it remains largely dormant. Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability. Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.Lewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution. Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man's appearance on Earth. Somehow, the perfectly good \\"Paradisal Man\\" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan. Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.Lewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic. Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation. I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life. The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity. According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God. I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug. I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible. Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ. I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender. Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan's ultimate deception. But I have also experienced Satan within myself. If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan. I know the difference. I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.I am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound. In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth: It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence. This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control. There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness. As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain. The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents. What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything. Satan can therefore be described as \\"God's self-ignorance.\\" Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical. C. S. Lewis tells us that \\"it is not God's purpose that we should go back into that old identity.\\" I think I agree with him on this point. Mankind's goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA: A YOUNG MAN'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)"},{"Title":"Rutland in Color","review":"I had no idea there were so many great color photo's of the Rutland out there.

That was only six years before the acclaimed film by Luchino Visconti was released. But Il Gattopardo is ineluctably a 20th C novel masquerading as a 19th C Romance, in style as much as in setting. I insist on telling you this because, if you didn't read the preface or look at the back of the title page, you might well be dangerously startled when Lampedusa first breaks the frame and refers to events of his own lifetime. That doesn't happen until a third of the book is finished; until then there is no 'narrator' in sight. Thereafter, however, Lampedusa inserts his \\"I\\" at judicious intervals, calling the reader away from the Sicily of the 1860s with metaphors of modernity. Eventually he even mentions the atomic bomb.Possibly some readers will be annoyed by Lampedusa's occasional first-person anachronism, but I don't think they were an accident or an error of style. They're a significant clue as to the intention of the novel, which isn't simple nostalgia. Lampedusa doesn't whitewash his setting or his characters; Sicily in the 1860s was a land of grievous poverty and economic stagnation, a society still bogged in feudalism, and the aristocratic families that supply nearly all the characters in Il Gattopardo were decadent, besotted with themselves and their possessions, reactionary, indifferent to the misery of their society. Their highest aspiration was to hang on to their luxury and privilege as long as they could, at least their own lifetimes, and let the next generation fend for itself. Only the central figure, Prince Fabrizio Salina, gets much respect from his 'creator' Lampedusa. His flaws and follies are the same as any other of his class, but his vitality and his inward perceptions of his milieu exalt him above the stagnant morass of his insular society. It's not mere words, on Lampedusa's part, to depict the Prince's fascination with astronomy. Salina is, for this author who might be his great-grandson, as genuine a hero as historical reality allows.The plot of Il Gattopardo is rather loose. It's the era of the Risorgimento, the unification of Italy with Garibaldi as the charismatic revolutionary. Prince Salina imagines himself, correctly as it turns out, as \\"above the fray\\". His preeminence will remain untouchable and his Sicily, with all its failures and inequities, will remain eternally the same. His wealth is being eroded by energetic and unscrupulous lower-class parvenus, but he disdains to resist them; such has always been the case, a process of revitalization. The Prince's nephew, a charming and talented fellow whom we see only as the Prince sees him, is an enthusiastic Garibaldino and an avatar of the Sicily-to-be, but his uncle's affection for him is stronger than any political discord. Eventually a love story unfolds, between the nephew and the beautiful daughter of the Prince's polar opposite, the up-and-coming parvenu \\"Don\\" Calogero. That romance is in effect the structure of the novel, but the heart and soul of Lampedusa's tale is the complex depiction of the personhood of Fabrizio Salina.If it's not nostalgia, then what is it? I think it's a celebration of \\"tempo perso\\" -- temps perdus/lost times -- a monument of their beauty as well as their infamy, intended to rescue them from oblivion. In that mode, it reminds me of the extraordinary Squarcialupi Codex of 15th Century Florence, an opulent illuminated volume containing the best music of Tuscany's distinctive indigenous composers, whose style was already utterly out of fashion, displaced by the arrival of the Franco-Flemish polyphonists in Italy. The redactors of the Squarcialupi Codex had no expectation of reviving the music of their greatest native composers like Francesco Landini, nor even to encourage performance of it. They meant forthrightly to immortalize the accomplishment by wrapping it sumptuously in museum shrouds. Il Gattopardo strikes me as having the same intention, not to replay the 'music' of pre-modern Sicily but actually to inscribe it in the museum of literature before its image faded from human memory."},{"Title":"Il Gattopardo","review":"...and it won't be easy.

The overthrowing of a government provides us with a good action book.The Manson Consolidated Mining Company has sent one of its mining scientist to the Crystal Mountains to check if the mountains contain tin.

Sadness also finds a palce in parts of hte book. The best book by Fredrick Forsyth, following The Day of The Jackal. The novel maintains a steady pace throughout, mystifying the reader's mind. It is a woderful piece of art. The writer has succeded in putting bringing together thrill and sorrow at the same time, something that I found missing in The Day of The Jackal and The Odessa File. both were equally gripping but this book has to surpass the quality of the two other books only because of the different emotions, felt not only by the writer, but also the the reader..."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"It can not be denied that Forsyth put a lot of research intothis, and should be duly commended for that. He has an ability ofwriting a good story, and unlike many, he knows how to conclude his works, usually above satisfactory levels. This was said to contain a shocker for an ending, but I tend to disagree. Not exactly a shocker, but a pretty neat twist to the story, that, for sure."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"The ingredients for a vintage Forsyth novel are there. However, the mix is not optimal. At times, the reading becomes tedious. Notwithstanding that, it's still a good read, even if it's just for the sake of increasing your general knowledge."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"The time: the early 60's. Successive British governments are shedding their empire. The place: Africa where regimes are emerging through barbarism and chaos. Mercenaries are fighting on all sides. Some work for the highest bidders and some work for leaders they believe will bring stability, justice, and freedom. Mercenary Cat Shannon, former royal marine, is on one of the last planes out. His side has been overrun.In the African hills of Zangaro, a British miner takes soil samples in the belief that it holds copper, but the samples reveal a rich deposit of the rarest ore in the world--platinum.Once his employer discovers the real value, he hatches a scheme to get the mining rights. He will hire mercenaries to overthrow the regime and install a puppet who will give him the mineral rights to the mountain. Reenter, Cat Shannon who is hired to do the job.Shannon recruits the best. He knows how to gather what he needs in secret, getting large sums of money out of the country, and acquiring the weapons and equipment he will need without arousing suspicion, fending off jealous competitors, but he has to speed up the operation.His employer discovers the Soviets have also found out about the platinum and are sending a ship of surveyors and mining experts of their own, and the current Zangaro regime is far more inclined to do business with them. It has become a race against time.Shannon and his men land off the coast and begin their operation, but there is a twist that even his employer did not count on. It is worthwhile reading this book to find out.Forsythe manages to introduce an amazing amount of detail about mining, finance, smuggling and Africa to the point that you believe he is expert in each. He weaves these details into a story that builds with suspense and intrigue. The climax, as usual, will surprise you.Cry Havoc! Let slip the Dogs of War. But, don't let the book slip away from your shelf."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"A routine analysis of an African Republic's mountain's ore content uncovers a motherlode of one of the most rare metals on the planet, platinum. However the African Republic's government is a ruthless dictatorship, rabidly anti-western and pro-communist. Facts that do not intimidate Sir James Manson, chairman/managing director of Manson Consolidated Mining Company Limited, in the least. Not surprising when, even at dirt cheap prices, the mountain is worth ten billion dollars. Eager to snag the mining rights, Manson quickly sets forth a rather unique plan. Hire mercenaries to help overthrow the government, replace it with a pro-west puppet dictator, have a shell company buy up the mining rights to the mountain, have ManCon buy the shell company, and rake in the cash by the basket full. Easier planned than done, as others quickly get their eyes on the same prize.Frederick Forsyth narrates with a reporter's deadpan voice and backs up the seemingly outlandish story with a huge amount of detail that makes it all seem credible. While the book does crackle with energy and keeps the pages turning, it lacked that something special to lift it up above the average page turner. But fans of Cold War era Men of Adventure tales will be sure to love this, recommended."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Amazing research needed for this, great how it all knits together. Good surprises and plot twists, very good ending. Not his best but definitley better than the opposition. No wonder it takes Forsyth on average 5 years to produce a novel, keeps everybody on tenderhooks waiting for the next brilliant book."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Ironically, I read most of this book while in a West Africa country a couple months ago -- not far from where this supposedly took place in real life -- it kept me interested during flights and at the hotel. Truth is stranger than fiction but this fiction is pretty darn good.The twist at the end was surprising and thought provoking. If you like history and intrigue, you'll probably like this book. In fact, I think I'm going to buy another copy for someone's Christmas gifts."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I re-read this book every couple of years. Sometimes I buzz through the parts about Swiss bank account transfers and customs-house forms. Other times I drink in all those technical details like a foaming schooner of Flemish ale. Depends on your mood, I guess. Regardless, I always savor the action sequences, which are relayed in splendid detail, and Forsyth's unique brand of gallows humor.This is about how one man sets up and carries out a coup d'etat, dollar by dollar, bullet by bullet. It it not just a shoot-em-up, and those who wish to read such a book should go elsewhere. But for those who savor the details, and camaraderie shared among wild geese in an Ostend bar at the end of a good day's scheming and plotting, this book is one in a million."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I think this is an interesting read even if it a novel. I read this after a reference to this book in a news story about the coup de etat in the island nation of Comorros. At that time, some South African mercenaries overthrew the crazed rule of the African ruler of Comorros. That is where the reference to the Dogs of War was made.One of the previous reviewers thought it was bad for Forsyth to spend so much space on how the coup was organized. The procurement of all the arms with the export license was very fascinating. What Forsyth revealed was that coups could be done privately witout the knowledge of governments. One only had to know how to procure and organize for the overthrow of a government. I think Forsyth did this well.This is an interesting read. This may not be on the level of his previous books, but it is still a good read."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"This is the mercenary counterpart to what is an anatomy to an assassionation in the Day of the Jackal.A closely-guarded secret discovery of rich platinum deposits in the Crystal Mountains in a tiny African state led a British entrepreneur Manson to finance a coup in the state to obtain control of the deposit. Keeping himself anonymous and working only with 2 greed-motivated underlings, Manson sought out a notable mercenary leader Cat Shannon who just returned from an unsuccessful mission from Africa.Unwilling to be pawn to an unseen mastermind, Shannon initiated his own counter-espionage to learn more about his paymaster and the interest in the apparently insignificant African state. To add spice to the game, the Russians, who had the major influence in the state, also learned that a British survey completed several months before in the Crystal Mountains which reported no significant tin deposits (the original object of the survey) may not have been completely truthful ...The start of the tale focus on the cat-and-mouse game Manson and his underlings played to keep their discovery a secret while trying to launch a military takeover, finding the suitable men to fight and another to be the puppet head. The middle of the tale looks at the mercenary acquiring, financing and transporting the necessary hardware from various sources in Europe. The narration is well-detailed, showing for the right price, anything can be bought from the street hoodlums or from the your own government.Manson and his underlings were well-constructed, appearing to be more mercenary than the soldiers of fortune. Shannon, on the other hand, a man who after his earlier African experiences could not adapt to a cog-in-the-wheel life in civilised Britain, showed such sharp mettle and acumen that one could not help but wonder what a splash he would have made if he had found the determination to make his mark in the business world. The other mercenary characters were also colourfully potrayed, though sometimes their identities became mixed.Another aspect well-written was Shannon's inner self who found himself always fighting a war whose ultimate beneficiaries were the people he despised bitterly. An entertaining moment was found in Manson's daughter, beautiful model well-versed in the ways of the world, a barracuda to break men of wealth, becoming almost innocent and childlike when confronted with Shannon's world.Unfortunately, unlike the promise of the book's introduction at the backcover, the Russians never did was played to their full potential.This book offered an alternative perspective to the 60s &amp; 70s, contrasting the concerns and motivations of Europe then to the really dark times in Africa. Certainly an interesting book, enough to occupy for a long journey, best read uninterrupted if one does not want to lose track of the details."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I loved this book because the characters are real, the plot seems authentic, and the hero achieves what men always desire...to use ones' honor for an honorable cause."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"The Dogs of War is a how-to manual for setting up a mercenary coup of a third-world African country. The detail was impressive and shows that Frederick Forsyth really researched the ins and outs of arms smuggling and mercenary deals while a BBC journalist in Africa.The main character, Cat Shannon, disseminates just as much information as is minimally necessary for each and every component of his operation so that he's exposed no more than necessary. He's an experienced mercenary who lives the life of danger, whether brandishing weapons in the jungle or obtaining end user certificates for arms shipments in Yugoslavia. His life is exciting, yet he's in control all the time and the reader learns that this is why he's lived as long as he has.The country in question, Zangaro, is home to a platinum reserve that could rival known deposits in quantity and British mining magnate, James Manson, wants it all to himself without the fuss of dealing with the existing dictator. Where Cat Shannon is meticulous in setting up arms purchases, transportation issues, and hiring experienced killers, Manson is a master craftsman at avoiding legality in the business world through setting up shell companies, forging scientific surveys and filing false reports to government agencies.The detail is both the strength and the weakness of this book. It's not an action/adventure. It's a how-to, as I pointed out earlier. That works to a point, but somewhere in the fourth or fifth iteration of end-user certifications, I got bored and just wanted them to get to Africa and kick some ***. For that reason, I can't give it a high rating even though Forsyth writes so beautifully I'd read his \\"What I Did on my Summer Vacation\\" essay from fourth grade. This just isn't his strongest work.But, if you're going to overthrow a nation-state, please read this book."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"This book holds together quite well, although is noticably dated at this stage.

That's the first 50 pages.The next 350 pages are the mercenaries buying boats, guns, clothes, oil, and ammo, with plenty of \\"something could go wrong, but no, it doesn't\\" moments thrown in to make you think the book might hold some dramatic tension sometime in its barely endurable length.The last 30 pages is an attack that can only be called antilimactic.I didn't care about these people, their cause, or whether they made it out alive or not. It would have been nice to see what they could do with a little more plot."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I actually liked this book more than Day of the Jackal, which is also 5 stars, because, having lived in Africa, the book rings true. Equally true the characters are 1-dimensional and cardboard caricatures at times, but, that does not mean it is not authentic. All these architypes you will see in post-Colonial Africa in one form or another. Also wickedly ironic and racist, but in a benign way."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Dogs of War is one of the finest work of Frederick Forsythe. The author has done considerable amount of research to present a true picture of the world of merceneries with explicit details. The plotting is amazing.

More than one third of the book is a long description of logistics that will make the reader bored and want to jump pages. It's an endless description of buying suplies, of stock market actions, etc, with the purpose of giving credibility to the action itself. But it backfired."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"The whole idea of a group of mercenaries going on a covert mission to invade another country to overthrow the government, insert a puppet dictator and then exploit the natural resources sounded fascinating and realistic to me. I expected a lot of drama and intrigue but that's not what I got. I would describe most of the book as bland or lukewarm. There were simply too many monotonous details written about the organizing of the covert operation than the operation itself. I don't mind reading about details of events before an operation or attack, it's just that the organizing of this operation went a little too smoothly. It seemed like the hero of the story (a mercenary) didn't have too many worries. There was just one big problem he had but it was delt with very quickly like magic. How a certain event unfolded was not explained very well as it could have been. While reading, I was wondering &quot;Where was he and how did he know?&quot; and &quot;Exactly how did that happen?&quot;. Some may not pay that much attention to it but I think the sub-plot could have been drawn out more, it was resolved too easily.The little twist at the end was effective and made sense. I actually thought that it was kind of funny.Forsyth fans will find this book enjoyable, but not nearly as gripping as his other books like &quot;The Fist of God&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Jackel&quot;."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who have given this book a low rating. This is definitely not one of Forsyth's better books. There is a very good short story lurking here, but the book is padded out with excessive amounts of non-essential logistics and accounting (and the fairly trivial sums involved make it seem extraordinarily dated). Promising plot twists - the murderous rival mercenary Roux, the competing Russian interest in African minerals, the factions competing for power in his fictional country - are given short shrift. The author was clearly deeply affected by his experiences in Biafra, but the story emphasizes only the incompetence and corruption of sub-Saharan Africa, and only in the very brief denouement do we get any hint of the idealism that also exists in the continent. Perhaps if the author had developed these and other sub-themes to their full potential the book would have justified its length. As it is, it looks very much like something written to satisfy contractual obligations."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Great opening, great setup, great action, FANTASTIC ending."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Frederick Forsyth has written some legendary thrillers, in particular The Day of the Jackal. In this novel, the jackal is replaced by dogs, and the lone assassin replaced by a team of mercenaries with the mission of taking over a floundering African republic. The mission is instigated by Sir James Manson, whose driving force is marked by \\"an unscrupulousness ... a preparedness to ignore so-called moral principles in pursuit of the goal succcess.\\" (p.117) Manson heads the huge mining company Manson Consolidated, and after discovering a mountain with ten billion dollars worth of platinum, in his pursuit for mammon Manson decides to maximize his millions by arranging a coup to take over the African country which holds this buried wealth. Through his personal aide, he employs mercenary leader Cat Shannon to undertake this mission.Most of the novel revolves around Shannon's preparations for the military coup. Just as The Day of the Jackal was the anatomy of a hit, the Dogs of War is the anatomy of a coup; it deals with a military coup in the same manner that the former book deals with an assassination attempt. The concept is certainly interesting - \\"knocking off a bank or an armored truck is merely crude - knocking off an entire republic has, I feel, a certain style.\\" (p.120) But unlike The Day of the Jackal, the anatomy of the coup suffers from tediousness at times, and is overly burdened with details of letters and arrangements as Shannon acquires arms, equipment and men. The apparent depth of Forsyth's research is fantastic and certainly adds to the credibility and authenticity and a slow and convincing build-up. But unless you are personally planning to take over an African republic, you will find many of the details rather unnecessary, The story is also marked by instances of remarkable coincidence, such as Shannon's ease in bedding Manson's daughter. Although there are implicit references to unchastity, we are spared any vivid details, and the instances of profanity can be counted on one hand.In the end, while it's an interesting novel, it doesn't have nearly the same bite as the Day of the Jackal. The ending moves quickly and has a nice twist (although the glorification of suicide is disappointing), but it is too little too late. It's clean and convincing, but the majority of this book is rather too slow moving. The bark of these Dogs of War is worse than their bite, and anyone looking for more bite is better off re-reading the Day of the Jackal. Even Frederick Forsyth can't make dogs bite as well as jackals."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"People with no reason to worry about continued living can make very bad opponents, as those who go up against Cat, the protagonist in this mercenary tale, discover.Cat is tasked with putting together a mercenary operation in the pursuit of what?

It is very detailed on the 'how to' of building a mercenary operation amongst other things (banking and setting up front companies), which I really enjoyed.It seemed to be almost a manual for the mercenary soldier. In fact, if you are thinking of becoming one you should probably read this book.Don't get me wrong here either. There was a very good story, and with a surprising end (and surprising middles too).Very well written. Anyone know of other books detailed like this?"},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Having read most novels and short stories of Frederic Forsyth, I was disappointed by the dated feeling of this early seventies novel.

Since I have been driving a lot recently for work, I got the Audible version to listen to. It was narrated by Frederick Davidson. It was bad to say the least. His voice was annoying to begin with, but once he changes his voice for the characters, horrid. Female voices were the worst. This was bad. Awful.

The characters are memorable, the detail impressive, and the storyline is taunt. I think the most impressive part of the book is both the detail of how the shell company was set up and the detail of how the assault on Zangaro was executed. Just a terribly impressive book that details a microcosm of the late 50's to late 60's geopolitical struggles in Africa. I can never put it down once I start it. Now if they would just put it on a kindle I would be happy"},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I often see a movie first and *then* read the book.I've seen the movie version twice and then took my time acquiring the novel.I just finished it up this morning.The one and two star reviewers had it right: Forsyth goes into endless administrative detailabout the preparations for the mission, which go on for a couple of hundred pages, wrapping upwith an unexciting and mostly predictable paramilitary action.Characters were a bit more intruiging than most of the naysayers give the author credit for.I would pay money to be able to overhear some of their barstool recounting of their prior exploits.Potentially interesting complications, like a rival merc's vengeful intentions and a competing Russianmining survey team, and of course the ever present spectre of an overly curious customs official inquiringtoo deeply about strange cargoes are given short shrift.I'm somewhat of a firearm and military history enthusiast. Forsyth's equipping of the mercs withWWII era 9mm submachineguns was a basically believable choice. However, it feels as if \\"9mm bullet\\"and \\"Schmeisser submachine guns\\" were terms previously unknown to the author, because he keeps mentioningthem endlessly, as if he became strangely gleeful at having uncovered some basic gun knowledge.Since the mercs never seemed to entertain the idea of outfitting themselves and their African allieswith any other infantry weapon, simply saying \\"ammunition\\" and \\"weapon(s)\\" when the smuggling logisticscame up in the narrative would have sufficed.Nonetheless, I pounded through the book in fairly short order, so that probably says a fair amount aboutthe entertainment factor, even as I damn it with faint praise."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I did not like this book as much as I have liked many of his other books. Maybe I was excepting too much after The Day of the Jackal. I guess the subject matter and location just did not turn me on. I thought the story was very good idea, original. The characters are as good as the author has done in the past. There is a good amount of action and details that are interesting. The story is strongly created and moved through the book. I just was not that interested in the outcome but it was a good effort."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"There are numberless tiresome paperback \\"action novels\\" about mercenaries. Most of these are fairly predictable and very comicbook-like in their quality. This is not one of them!Mr. Forsyth, who actually researched what he writes about, has created a very realistic scenario of a modern-day mercenary action, and the powers that be that brought it about.A geologist finds evidence of massive ore-deposits in a typically unstable African republic (its description is very much like Liberia) whose major industry is mining. A British corporation has mining interests already in country, and wants to capitalize off of this find. However, the current president, is a corrupt and eccentric despot of questionable sanity...and he is favoring political and economic ties with the Soviet Union. The solution: the British corporation hires a team of professional free-lance soldiers to stage a coup, and put a new president in place, one who will favor the corporate interest!The major part of the story is the complex procedures in which the mercenary team makes its preparations in a year prior to the action, emphasizing secrecy. The actual action on objective is short, sharp and decisive...but with an outcome that the corporate sponsor didn't quite expect!"},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"The Dogs of War is one of Forsyth's best. Although written in the early 70's, it completely holds up over time (just as Day of the Jackal). The story is set in several exotic locations throughout Europe and Africa. In true Forsyth style, the first 85% of the book is setting up the action in the final 15%. Making the arrangements for a coup de tat is fascinating and the action doesn't disappoint. Fantastic book - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"This book is much better then the movie, although the movie was completely different from the book. If you are a fan of Forsyth, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"Forsyth uses actual places and possible events to create a plan to take over a country. The characters are interesting and the main character Cat Shannon makes you think twice about mercinaries. The plot twist is terrific and just knowing there is one keeps you guessing till the end."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I liked a lot of things about this book; sometimes that enjoyment continued for several pages at a time. Frederick Forsyth would be a great writer even if he were writing stereo instructions. The problem is, with all the attention paid here to logistics, \\"Dogs Of War\\" doesn't feel that far removed in dryness from a Sony manual.Frederick Forsyth had his mojo working in the early 1970s, when he launched his fiction career with the magnificent \\"Day Of The Jackal\\" and followed up with a totally different, equally absorbing work in the same vein, \\"The Odessa File.\\" He had contracted for a third book, and evidently drawing on his experiences as a journalist covering the Biafran civil war in Nigeria, decided to write about a group of mercs hired to topple the leader of a small African nation.As a premise, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is very promising, and Forsyth's familiarity with the sights and smells of Africa feeds a backdrop that at times is presented quite well. A cynically world-weary tone predominates, and that works well in the context of the story. The problem is there isn't much of a plot, and a core group of main characters that, while presented as hard-bitten desperados, don't exactly give Pike, Dutch, and the rest of the Wild Bunch a run for the money in terms of characterization. One guy is called Tiny because he's large. Another strops his knife whenever there's a lull. When these characters finally face danger, we don't know them well enough to care about their fates.You know there's a big problem when there's only a few pages left in the book and the mercenaries haven't even hit the beach of the country they are about to take over. Forsyth takes his time getting to the central action of the story, and though he writes with his usual flair, the final showdown is perfunctory and unconvincing.You can see some positive developments in Forsyth's writing here, such as the emergence of humor, especially with a subplot about some scummy capitalists who set up a shell corporation for their illicit scheme with the unknowing help of a balmy Scottish widow. He works in a lot of fascinating commentary on the nature of the world though the eyes of the main protagonist, Cat Shannon.\\"The truth is, the Establishment is on the side of the big battalions, because it created and armed them in the first place,\\" he tells a lady friend. \\"It never seems to occur to the millions...that maybe God, if there is one, has something to do with truth, justice, and compassion rather than sheer brute force, and that truth and justice might possibly be on the side of the little platoons.\\"But not all the side routes Forsyth takes justify the time and attention, and there are too many ideas that either are left half-baked (a Russian interest in the African nation, a rival mercenary homicidally jealous of Shannon) or that cry plot convenience, like how Shannon gets the inside track on his employer's intentions.In the end, \\"Dogs Of War\\" is not so much a bad book, but a frustratingly incomplete one. It's got that classic Forsyth style for those (like me) who admire it, but it lacks a sense of purpose. It's not a surprise Forsyth took a few years off before penning his next, far better novel, \\"The Devil's Alternative.\\""},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"I picked up the book attracted by the bestseller and interesting plot, it does has a pretty good start but I was a bit disappointed on how predictable the story has evolved.

It tells of a band of mercenaries who find themselves knee-deep in the plot of an English CEO to literially take over an minor African nation and install a president who will give them a deal on mining rights to a certain mountain. It's a wonderful tale set in the '70s, full of close calls and twisted dealings that ends with a surprise! A real page-turner."},{"Title":"Dogs of War","review":"A very detailed Forsyth, as always.

F. is an intricate cultural novel which focuses on the different concepts that underlie politics across the world in a central African location. This book is intricate in all the concepts it deals with, i.e. politics, resource economy and the eclectic types of tribal mercenaries present. All in all, the book is a horrendous yet scrupulous analysis of the complex avarice that is ubiquitous in all socio-cultural hodgepodge novels. The complex metaphorical analysis and connections present in the book allow the reader to better discern the sundry of indelible characters that try to attain the resource-gluttonous needs of every complex society around the world. The platinum rich mountain is more than a unifying symbol of greed unto which all humanity rests its existential and rather materialistic bases on. It is more of a dithering social analysis that percolates through the general needs of our modern world, which depend on such symbols as platinum rich mountains. The incipient technological innovations that come through what we need in our modernistic valued world comes to see the mountain as a complex intertwined mix of different cultural as well as political needs. It therefore becomes the sole possessor of all mind psychology and philosophy, which base their attitudes on the materialism that pervades most of our societies and governments today.!

She has written MURDER, A MUSICAL and THESE BONES WERE MADE FOR DANCIN' plus another series, Smith and Wetzon and this one , Olivia Brown mysteries, and co-authored with her husband, Martin&lt; the Dutchman mysteries.This story takes place in 1920 in Greenwish Village with the artzy populace. In 1970, I knew such a man who was into the thing called 'free love.' His last name was almost the same as hers, Meier, and he was from Indiana. He was in a play at the college in which my youngest child was a minor character. He was the musical & youth director at our church and supervised the 'Youth House.' I would not allow my teenage sons to take part in any activities there. When I questioned him about his idea of 'free love,' I inquired about the young girls. He told me, 'they are jail bait.' I wasn't aware that he had just got out of jail when he came to our town as a prospective Methodist minister with a wife and three daughters. That seemed normal enough until he fondled the wrong boy and ended up in jail again, was even caught bringing drugs into the jail after a visit home. He was personable and had a 'good life' before him if he could have just left the young males alone. He died as far away from that town as his wife could find, so that we would not know that he died of AIDS. A sad story all started with his Hoosier idea of 'free love' transferred to a small Tennessee town where mothers watch their children. No one ever suspected him of wrong doing and we were all stunned he had served time in an Indiana prison for burglary.Olivia Brown is a woman alone, having lost both of the men in her life to death. She becomes attached to a private detective hwo lives in her apartment house and is soon flaunting Prohibition at a speakeasy (club) called Chumley's. She finds a dead woman who is the exact double of her, and must find the murderer before everyone laments the fate of one with so much promise -- like Bob Meier -- who died too young.It is a good Twenties style mystery and the lifestyle of that era with so much denied the ordinary person, but life in the fast lane was plentiful and dangerous. Even the movie stars of that time lived a scandlous and tormented L. A. party scene with drugs, liquor and loose morals."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Pretty good mystery set in 1920's Greenwich Village. Olivia Brown is a poetess whose fiancee was killed in WWI. She inherits a house in the Village, and, along with it, a tenant, Harry, a P.I. One night, she stumbles across a dead body that looks suspiciously like her, and she enlists Harry's help to find out what's going on.Good depiction of flappers, Prohibition, and the Jazz Age. The character development was a bit shallow, and I hope the second book will improve on that. There's a lot of potential here!"},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Olivia wasn't so in love with herself. The character is shallow and boring. I wouldn't mind her if she would shut up about all her lovers. Yeah, got it, men like you...probably because she is sleeping with the entire city. I suppose she is written to be stubborn and relentless but she succeeds at being foolish."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"I loved the novel Free Love. It is set in the Greenwich Village of the 20's. It has wonderful atmosphere and characters. She really captures the sprit of the prohibition era. The murder mystery is engrossing, and it seems that the Village never really changes. The main character, Olivia Brown is a poet, part-time investigator, and self professed bohemian. She is a little too obsessed with the choice of her next lover. It almost seems like job interviews. If the author would place less emphasis on that and more on the story it would flow much better."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"This is a departure for Meyers, who up until now has written wonderfully about Wall St. in the great Smith and Weston series. The time is 1920 and the new character is a poet named Olivia Brown who lives in Greenwich Village and runs around with other artists from pub to pub when she's not working. She accidentally gets herself involved in a murder (naturally) and I for one didn't figure it out, which is odd for me. It's beautifully written, warm and funny but with a gritty edge. This is a must read. A+"},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"In the late sixties, young people flocked to Haight-Asbury seeking free love, intellectual stimulation, and easy access to drugs. The flower children thought they discovered the true meaning of freedom. However, in 1920 in Greenwich Village, free spirits lived outside society's even stricter rules.Olivia Brown refuses to live by any rules other than her own. When her guardian dies, she inherits an almost empty house in the Village. Her recently published poetry received attention from Vanity Fair and Vogue. She has many swains, but is selective as to who her current lover of the moment is. Though prohibition is the law, she drinks whenever she wants to imbibe.On the way to a production that she is a participant, Olivia finds the corpse of her own doppelganger. She later learns that the deceased is actually a male. Olivia begins sleuthing. However, anyone she questions turns up murdered. Someone is destroying her property, leaving behind ugly items for her to easily find, and painting her as a serial killer. The poet knows someone stalks her with a vengeance that would frighten a lesser person.Annette Meyers captures the essence of the bohemian movement so fully that the atmosphere of 1920 Greenwich Village feels eerily similar to that of the sixties. FREE LOVE contains an entertaining historical mystery that centers on a unique amateur sleuth. However, the tale provides a social commentary on individuals who choose to live outside society's norm, a circumstance that leads to freedom and pain. Ms. Meyer's opening gamut will thrill sub-genre fans who will want more tales from the 1920's Lower Manhattan."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Olivia (or Oliver as she is known to her Greenwich Village friends) Brown is the kind of historical female sleuth that readers of this genre would love to love. Unfortunately, beyond telling us that this is 1920 Greenwich Village and the Prohibition puts a cramp in the artistic lifestyle, author Annette Meyers does little to evoke a true sense of place. The dialogue reads as very 1990s and I was surprised to read that a character attended a lecture by the famous woman rights advocate Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who died in 1902.The plot is also weak, centering on a case of obsession. I thought that the perpetrator was very obvious and that a young woman who had already been involved in some detective work would have pulled everything together much quicker.I may take a look at Meyers's planned sequel, but it will have to be a whole lot better for me to read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Annette Meyers delivers a wonderfully different mystery and an egregarious eccentric in the Flapper era poet, Olivia Brown. Olivia might not match Sherlock Holmes but the writing style of FREE LOVE is a delight and the plot satisfying. I enjoy quirky books, and FREE LOVE captures the Jazz Age's daring people, clothing and lifestyles. Looking forward to Olivia's next adventure in the series."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"While I enjoyed this Annette Meyers murder mystery enough to keep reading, I tired of the cigarette smoke and gin and sexual dissipation. I don't think I am really old-fashioned, but I found Olivia Brown to be young and shallow.Her bohemian life in the environs of Greenwich Village circa 1920 is intriguing enough for a relaxing read, however. And, I, too, was not sure I had the culprit clearly named until pretty close to the end. Actually, the obsession of the men around Olivia (Oliver to her cronies) is believable, if one realizes that they are all gin-soaked and willing to participate in any free love (sex) made so readily available.The strong friendship between Olivia and her caretaker Mattie is touching. Once again we see the faithful servant class guarding and protecting their upper class employer. Lucky Olivia to have inherited this brownstone from her rebellious great aunt Vangie, to have inherited Mattie's help, and to have inherited in perpetuity, a private eye tenant, Harry Melville.Olivia's interjected poems reflect the supposed burning genius of an artist whose decadent life fuels her gift. Some of those &quot;inspirations&quot; fell cold on me. Olivia's theatrical experience, particularly in O'Neill's off-Broadway introduction of The Emperor Jones, was quite sensual and led me to believe that it would not have taken much for Olivia to have shared a bi-sexual liason with the women in her group.I am sure I will try the next Olivia Brown novel when Meyers publishes it. In the meantime I will try her Smith and Wetzon and her co-written Dutchman series. Having seen Meyers and her spouse Marty on CBS Sunday Morning as a featured couple, I want to read what they have written, just for kicks."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Poet Olivia Brown's new life in her recently inherited brown stone house in Greenwich Village is shattered when she trips over a dead body whose face strongly resembles her own. When threats to her own life keep popping up, she joins forces with her lower level tenet, hard living private detective Harry Melville, to seek an end to this mounting terror. Who is the culprit, and why is he after her?Olivia thrives in Greenwich Village which had become home to a fascinating mix of free spirits, eccentrics, writers, jazz musicians and social activists. Most are young, few with any money. Meyers has credibly created the Village atmosphere where intellectual life encouraged late night discussions in \\"tea\\" and \\"coffee\\" houses, along with excessive smoking and drinking in spite of Prohibition, and often done in defiance of it. The book's title reflects this time of freedom when women chose lovers and abandoned them at will in great contrast to the mores of the Victorian age!Period personalities appear in the plot such as Steven Lowell, the Providence Players, and the Hudson Dusters, the notorious Irish street gang whose members end up protecting Olivia more than once. Since Meyers' character is loosely based on the poet Edna Vincent Millay, poetry related to the plot is interspersed throughout the book - a nice touch.Meyers includes comments about the history behind the story. This is the first of her Olivia Brown series. They are nice companion books to the 1920s San Francisco Fremont Jones series by Dianne Day."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Scene: Greenwich Village, 1920s. Main character: Olivia Brown. What she finds: A body that looks like her. Things are happening all over Greenwich and they all seem to tie back to Olivia. With the aid of her boarder Harry, a private investigator, Olivia starts to seek the truth. A good vacation book that lured me in and kept me reading to the end (and for once I didn't peak at the ending)."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Olivia was having the time of her life. She could finally have fun and concentrate on her work at the same time. After drinking with her friend Whitt, they stumble out into the rain and discover a women's body. Shortly after this she starts to be harassed. With the help of her friend Harry, a private investigator, she cracks the case, and finds that it was Bennett. He was trying to get everyone out of the way so he could run away with Olivia. He also was harassing her so she would run to him with all of her problems and have a shoulder to lean on. This book was very suspicful, and I recommend it whoever loves a good mystery book.The book is good because it shows what life was like back in the roaring 20's. A lot of the women started to come out of their normal modest life and started to \\"spice things up\\". Olivia and her friends drank alcohol, which became a lot more popular with women around the 20's, when prohibition started. They were free spirits. Some were poets, while others were actresses, singers, or dancers. But none the less they lived happy lives.The author has a very creative way of writing her mystery books. She changes things from the predictable motives. For example, in this book sometimes the killer didn't have a set motive for killing a person. She made it so that readers had to think about what ties the person to his main motive. Which makes it ideal for someone who likes books that make them think.This book is very suspenseful. Just when you find out something, it twists and goes ina completely different direction than expected. When Olivia and Whitt find the woman's dead body, in a few days she comes to find out that the women is actually a man, who is obsessed with her, and wants to become her. When the next murder takes place, the only way they found the murder weapon was when Olivia was playing around with a piano and she realizes that one of the keys sounds funny, and she opens the lid, and finds the knife. Little did I know that the piano from earlier in the book would come back to play such an important role.Free Love, by Anne Meyers, is a wonder mystery that takes place during the flashy period of the 1920's. You will instantly fall in love with the characters, especially Olivia Brown. Read this if you want to read a book that suspenseful mystery."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"Escapist fiction for me is a story so atmospheric that long after closing the book I can still visualize the scenes. Ms. Meyers' debut of Greenwich Village bohemian Olivia Brown and her motley crew of characters does just that. Yes, Olivia is shallow and self-absorbed, but, hey, she's only in her 20's. If this series is ever interpreted as a movie, buy stock in tobacco. Every other page someone was lighting up a cigarette, to the point, unfortunately, that it was a distraction. Did they really smoke non-stop in the '20's? We'd have no 85-year olds alive today! That aside, this entertaining mystery has me primed for the second in the series, Murder Me Now."},{"Title":"Free Love","review":"World War I has just ended. The men who are coming home have come, Prohibition is in place. Women have the Vote, bob their hair and are trying all of the new freedoms open to them including the right to pursue casual sexual liasons.Olivia's fiancee died in the War, her remaining family killed by the influenza, finds herself the possessor of a house in Greenwich Village that had belonged to her Great Aunt Vangie. There she resides with her maid Mattie and her downstairs tenant, Harry Melville, a private investigator. She writes poetry successfully, drinks and smokes to excess and enjoys men with an almost frenzied heedlessness.But one day while on the way to meet with some of her other friends she discovers a body lying in pool of water in the street. In the days that follow she receives threatening messages, Harry is beaten up in an alley and, as she tries to discover what is happening, a trail of deaths follow her.There's one annoying moment when Olivia has a lapse of intelligence, other than that, the book does a good job of creating a believable picture of Jazz Age Greenwich village, from it's Irish gangsters to the Provincetown Players."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Crane's The Red Badge of Courage","review":"I had to read this book for english class.

It's sole purpose is to summarize Crane's novel about the Civil war. In reading more about Crane, we learn that he was an American novelist and poet who was known for.... &quot;his pessimistic and often brutal portrayals of the human condition, but his stark realism is relieved by charm and sympathetic understanding of character&quot;......... Although this review book does summarize each chapter (I read each chapter of the review book before I subsequently read each chapter of the book, so I knew what to expect) it cannot do justice NOR take the place of reading the actual words of Crane. His book is magnificent and his skill at manipulating words is extraordinary. I read and reread savoring the descriptiveness of each sentence. His genius is that he had never experienced military service or the ordeals of combat which he so wonderfully describes here. His experience as a correspondent during the Greco-Turkish War in 1897 are perhaps the basis for his knowledge about the terrors which face a soldier. Please read each and every sentence and study them intently. They are so perfect in their construction that I could ably picture all the scenes he described. I am curious now to view a film (which I heard was made of this book). This review book is good, but don't avoid reading the actual book itself, because you will have missed a great experience.

I am in an 11th grade English class, and this book did not have difficult vocabulary, rather just details that could send a person to insanity.

For example in my history of reading civil war novels, they tend to focus on the politics of the war more then the war it self. This book was more about the fighting and what a man went through in the battles. But what the book gained in action it lost in the long winded description. Also personally the version i had to read contained very little letters, and when i'm nearly asleep from the subject matter those little letters would blur together and really knock me out. It had what i refer to as dictionary print and i think all people out there can relate.The truth is i really didn't read a whole lot of this book becuase i could get about 7 or 8 pages down before i would start sleeping and the parts i did read were difficult to understand so i would recomend cliff notes for this particular book.

I highly recommend it. If you think Renaissance drama means &quot;only Shakespeare&quot;, you need to try some of his contemporaries, like the Poet Laureate Ben Jonson. =smile= Of the three Jonson comedies I've yet read, this one is great fun! Be warned that some of the &quot;alchemical&quot; language may be seem too specialized, unless you know this time period; since it's supposed to be patter to trick the marks, that's not the detraction it seems to be._The_Alchemist_ has a legion of characters, most of whom are the marks. They deserve what they get--but because this is Jonson, the ones running the confidence games may not end up as you expect. His type of comedy is atypical of his period in that respect. If you aren't familiar with the Renaissance speech, then I recommend the excellent New Mermaids text. The extensive footnotes are mostly a glossary, which is extremely helpful! [Yes, it makes some of the period jokes make sense then.]Since the characters are drawn broadly, you will be surprised at how easily you will understand them, whether they are greedy or lusty or foolish. The smooth way one con fits into working the next ongoing one is priceless!Much like _Volpone_ [also by Jonson], this is a play about greed, about con games, and about how people can allow avarice, lust and money to corrupt them. Call this satire, parody or farce--no matter, the humor is biting and witty and wild. For comparative humor in the same period, this is somewhat comparable to Marlowe's _The Jew of Malta_.I love the way the characters work with and against each other. Subtle may dazzle or mystify with his language, and Dol Common may keep them from destroying their three-way partnership, but Face is my favorite of the trio. He is the trickiest of them all. I like how he fares in the ending too, which leads me to believe Face is like a cat. =grin= To me he's likable in the same outrageous way!"},{"Title":"The alchemist; (Yale studies in English)","review":"I recently read the early 17th century comedy \\"Volpone\\", my first introduction to Ben Jonson. I was surprised by how well Jonson's humor had traveled through 400 years of cultural change. I did have difficulty with Jonson's dedication (several pages), the introductory argument, and the prologue as well as a \\"Pythagorean literary satire\\" in Act One, Scene One. But thereafter I found the humor to be natural and enjoyable. I even found myself somewhat sympathetic for the unscrupulous Volpone, Mosca, Voltore, Corbaccio, and Corvino. I immediately hunted around on my dustier bookshelves for other works of Ben Jonson.\\"Epicene\\" was less easy to digest, but was worth the effort. There is a surprising twist in the final scene and I suggest that the reader avoid any literary criticism or introductions to \\"Epicene\\" until after your first reading. I had less empathy for the characters in \\"Epicene\\" and it was difficult to identify any \\"good guys\\". The characters were not terribly disagreeable, but simply dilettantes that had little concern for morality or ethics. The dialogue is more obscure (and more bawdy) than in \\"Volpone\\". I found it helpful to first read the footnotes for a scene before actually reading the scene itself.\\"The Alchemist\\" is more like \\"Volpone\\". The main characters are unscrupulous con-men; their targets are gullible, greedy individuals. I learned quite a bit about alchemy, at least alchemy as practiced by 17th century con-men. As with \\"Volpone\\" and \\"Epicene\\", I was unable to predict how Ben Jonson would bring the play to a satisfactory conclusion. I enjoyed \\"The Alchemist\\" and I expect that I will read it again. I don't know if it is performed very often, but it would probably be quite entertaining.\\"Bartholomew Fair\\" introduces a large, motley collection of characters that largely converse in lower class colloquialisms that require some effort to master. The comedy was intended in part to be a satire on Puritans and thereby please King James, but it was equally an introduction to the varied individuals that might be encountered at an annual fair. It was not easy to keep track of the many characters and I continually referred to the cast listing to reorient myself.There are a number of collections of Ben Jonson's plays. I recommend an inexpensive collection, \\"The Alchemist and Other Plays\\", publish by Oxford University Press as a World's Classic. The introduction, glossary, and explanatory footnotes by Gordon Campbell are quite good. Begin with either \\"Volpone\\" or \\"The Alchemist\\" if you are new to Jonson. I hope you are as surprised and pleased as I was."},{"Title":"The alchemist; (Yale studies in English)","review":"Ben Jonson, although modern audiences find him difficult to read, played an important role in the development of the English comedic play. Volpone is a dark comedy that explores the twisted world of a con artist and his toady. The play demonstrates Jonson's awareness of the hypocrisy of social situations. Similarly, Bartholomew Fair takes the reader on a tour of the seamier side of seventeenth century London life. Zeal of the Land Busy, a religious hypocrite, still speaks to our generation when questions of religious expression still plague us. Epicene is a gender-bender in which the ideal silent woman turns out to be a man. The Alchemist, although the most difficult of the plays to read, is worth the effort, as it explores the questions of knowledge, ownership of knowledge, and abuse common in today's world."},{"Title":"The alchemist; (Yale studies in English)","review":"The Alchemist By Paulo Coelh"},{"Title":"Railroad Depots of Southern Indiana (IN) (Images of Rail)","review":"This book is both entertaining, nostalgic and informative to this former CSX employee.

Carleton Coonnever approached his topics in a less than scientific way.Political correctness has not yet entered academia to hide the truth. Mr. Coon merely refined his definitions and did not renounce anything or change his mind in the sense that one is wrong about something. The paragraph in \\"The Origin of Races\\"reads: \\"Races like the Nordic, Alpine, Mediterranean, East Baltic,and Dinaric...are neither subspecies nor, in a strictsense, local races, although some local races may be defined in these terms. These words have also been used in the sense of types, which can be picked out of local populations. One may find a Spaniard who is typically Nordic in the midst of a population Of Mediterraneans, including his own brothers. In a sense the situation is genetically comparable to finding a man of blood group B whose father's group was A. Types selected in this fashion are interesting to observe, and we notice them every day. Whether or not they reflect the origins of a population in one way or another, we must remember from the taxonomic point of view such types are not races but simply thevisible expressions of the genetic variability of the intermarrying groups to which they belong.\\"This is exactly what \\"The Races of Europe\\" demonstrated.If the book were a textbook on dog types, no one would care. But people are somehow invulnerable to the laws of heredity. I refuse to be dumbed down for someone else's political agenda.Carleton Coon was a professor at Harvard and at the U. of Pennsylvania. He is deceased and cannot defend his works of science, but I am alive and I can and I do."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"In the early 1970s I sold books about the white race in Silver Spring, Maryland with my partner, a very talented fellow who helped me to get the enterprise going even though it had to start on the kitchen table of our apartment. Eventually he took full responsibility and operated for many years on his own. Our company was called White Legion books, and although we handled just about every book anyone ever recommended about the white race, there was no book more sober, professional, and fascinating than Carlton Coon's &quot;The Races of Europe.&quot; A lot of readers who are familiar with older classics on this subject know that such books tend to be politically biased in favor of Germans, Icelanders, and other nationalities believed by the far right to be superior representatives of the race. Carlton Coon, however, does not promote such obsolete beliefs. And it's unfortunate that more people interested in this subject, especially right wing political activists, couldn't learn from this book why they should give up the ideas of superiority which devaluate many whites. The misguided still laud the abilities of Nordics over other members of the white race; such as Alpines and Mediterraneans. That this is foolish is evidenced by the fact that it is vitually impossible to tell with total certainty, without some detailed DNA examination, exactly what sub-racial category someone is in. There are just too many jokers in the deck, and even a person fitting the &quot;Nordic profile&quot; can spiritually be in some other category anyway. When someone comes along on the political scene who ignores these facts, such as George Lincoln Rockwell of the American Nazi Party, it can have fatal consequences for the advocate. Rockwell was assassinated by John Patler, who was once the most active and loyal stormtrooper of his group; in fact, this party member was highlighted in the original edition of Rockwell's autobiography &quot;This Time the World&quot; with a large photograph (It's since been censored out). Patler, a Greek American with a dark complexion, one day realized that he was in a racial category considered by the National Socialist ideology to be a second class position - a Mediterranean. If you ever have the opportunity to see Carlton Coon's book, which could be available from a really decent college or university library collection on anthopology, be sure to look at the hundreds of photographs that are included for the purpose of identifying the many types of white people that exist. If you look carefully, and you have a natural eye for it, you may even see someone who looks just like yourself, or like your family members. These &quot;types&quot; were created because of the long periods of time in Europe when people did not move around very much. And while it's true that the Europeans of America are often much more blended than the types seen in Carlton Coon's book, you will still be able to see what &quot;types&quot; comprise the faces you've long been familiar with. I found it quite easy to locate faces so familiar that I see them every day, and they were easy to verify because there's supporting information below each photograph to confirm each determination by the few geographic locations associated with them in Europe. If there is anyone who has the opportunity to reprint this book, I would urge them to do it as soon as possible; for it's obvious that a lot of people never want to see this book available again."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"I first found and read this book from our local library... it is a masterpiece to anyone interested in anthropology. Although the cost was about $78, I decided that I had to own it and bought a new copy. The new edition I received was certainly new and clean, but the print was not quite of the quality that the library edition had. The B&W photographs/plates of the library edition were high quality, glossy prints; whereas, this new edition has disparagingly mediocre reproductions of them."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"My review is not on Coon's work itself, but on the quality of the binding offered here.For the money, I feel the book should be of higher quality. The paper is cheap; the book is overly bulky for its dimensions; and, in consequence, it's clumsy to hold and because it's so thick, the left-hand-side pages become difficult to read the deeper into the tome you get. For $70, one should expect better quality - a bigger, better-bound edition."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"Regardless of enormous advances that biology has made in the last decades,certainly racial typology has its own value in tracing,for example,human migrations whithout whose some historical aspects cannot be fully understood.Unlike the German literature in the 1930's,which is littered with ethnocentric superstition,in Coon's textbook we are finding blow to fallacies that something like &quot;White Race&quot; exist.What do Osteuropids have in common with Atlantomediteranians that sets them in special status vis-a-vi Mongoloids or Aethiopids for example?Our current misperception about races derives because we think only about &quot;racial conglomerates&quot;,we see differencies that are obvious &quot;at glance&quot; without giving second thought.Although a little bit of obsoletness can be detected here and there,nevertheless this is good starting point for racial studies,together with two classics-&quot;Mankind Evolving&quot; by Th.Dobzhansky and &quot;Race&quot; by John R. Baker."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"This textbook differs so from nearly all others in it's deapth of treatment of the subject of the complex movements of peoples in Europe, Eastern Asia and Northern Africa. Each chapter could have been produced as an entire text. Of course descriptive terminology of physical anthropology must be mastered and detailed maps are needed for a thorough examination, but this text attempts to pull together all of the finds and studies available throughout the world of 1939. Since the page count of the edition mentioned here in Amazon is identical to the orignal 1939 edition, I must assume the later book is a reprint. I am anxious to learn if Carleton Stevens Coon updated his work with post-war findings. I find the study of these complex movements similar to a study of, say, astronomy. To most people, such a study would prove equally as original. In recent years our PBS Nova show has featured some abstract regional discoveries in Anthropology complete with an hour of speculation. But readers of the Coon text are already familiar with the directions of their conclusions. Possibly few have read Coon's masterful research compilation. Coon was begining his illustrious career when he wrote, \\"Races of Europe.\\" I am anxious to read his work from later life."},{"Title":"The races of Europe","review":"Although very rare in print, this offering by Amazon is indeed the same masterpiece of anthropological research penned by Carleton S Coon, and it's certainly new and clean, but it is NOT the original edition with high quality, glossy B&W; photographs/plates like the original edition still found in many public libraries.The B&W; photographs/plates of the original edition were high quality, glossy prints, whereas, this new edition has only mediocre, margainally-acceptable reproductions of them.

It viberates with the same passion as the latter. While Hunter's Moon may not appear as glamourous as The Demon Lover at first glance, it has a sweeter plot, a tenderer hero, and hence a more romantic story overall. Also, if you enjoy lively repartee between the hero and heroine, with him being thick-skinned and her seemingly prudish, this book will be a treat."},{"Title":"The Time of the Hunter's Moon","review":"Anyone who has ever read anything by Victora Holt or any romance novel for that matter will know just where this one is going - impovrished young woman probably an orphan, just beginning a career as a teacher/governess in late 19th century England finds herself involved in a mystery/facing danger pursued by one or more handsome mem, at least one of whom is somehow unsuitable but in the end solves mystery and finds love, fortune and happiness.If it is so trite and predictible why then 5 stars? Because it is so much fun reading the descriptions of the romantic settings, trying to stay ahead of the author figuring out just who is a good guy and who is a villian, seeing just what little twists and turns the plot will take and how the heroine will manage to emerge triumphant and with virtue intact.The heroine of this story is Cordelia Grant, who is 19 when the novel begins, a student in an exclusive Swiss boarding school. Her parents died long ago in Rhodesia but her guardian, Aunt Patty, has sent Cordelia to the school to prepare her to join the staff of the girls' school that she runs. During her last few weeks in Switzerland Cordelia and her friends meet a mysterious, handsome stranger who appears and disappears from Cordelia's life over the next few months. Alas Cordelia's family fortunes have taken a turn for the worse forcing her to seek employment in another school. There she meets yet another handsome man, the local lord with a scandalous past. Soon Cordelia must find herself torn between these two and yet another handsome man but before she can find romance for herself she must find justice for an old friend and protect her students from an old threat.This will probably never make any lists of 'great literature of the 20th century' nor be on any school's required reading lists but it is a great book to curl up with and spent a few hours blissfully wasting time."},{"Title":"The Time of the Hunter's Moon","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite Holt books.

Her tone, nuances, and the way she takes us all over the globe make reading her books a fun trip. Not so with The Time of the Hunter's Moon. The pace was very slow, but my biggest complaint is her leading man, Sir Jason. Sir Jason is, in a word, a complete brute. He tries to force young Cordelia from her purity and her morals, which is totally unacceptable. Make no mistake: rape is a crime of power and not a crime of passion. I have no regard for selfish, controlling men. Healthy relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. I don't wish ill of any person, but I guess this is ok to say since Sir Jason is just a character: I wish that he had stayed over the cliff that he went over. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Time of the Hunter's Moon","review":"This was my first introduction to Victoria Holt's work, although I had heard good things about her books. I have to say that I am not impressed. It was easy to discern what was going to happen, although I kept reading hoping that there would be a twist. There was not. Instead, I had to read the entire book, just to find out that what I suspected was happening, was indeed happening and although the herione was an intelligent and cautious character, she was unable to clearly see what was before her. This was disappointing and seemingly out of character. There were other instances in the book where I felt other characters would suddenly act out of character and it felt like the author needed them to act a particular way so that the plot could happen.My biggest issue with this book, however, is the relationship between the heroine and her romantic interest. His determined pursuit of her is almost endearing but turns dangerous and menacing when he attempts to lock her in a room and rape her! Although the heroine responds in the manner that one would expect, I certainly didn't expect her to end up marrying him!! There are several places in the book where the author implys that because it was done for love than it is excusable. The internal dialogue of the heroine understandably conveys her confusion and mixed emotions about the event but one wonders, What is the author trying to say? That a rape victim actually wanted to be raped? That there is romance in this??! Think twice before reading this book. It is poorly written, lacks a strong and interesting plot, and conveys a very misleading and dangerous message. I truly think the author thoughtlessly threw this book together."},{"Title":"The Time of the Hunter's Moon","review":"I do not own the book but I have read it and it is terrific for someone who loves a good mystery, anticipation for romance, and enjoys the history of the 18th century. This is an old-fashioned romantic novel and is the best. I have read most of her novels and she always writes in 1st person which makes you feel like you are the character that she is writing about and that you are apart of this mystery and romance.With the mystery part of it, she keeps it suspenseful enough to carry it throughout the novel and has some interesting twists to the key behind the mystery.The romantic part of it is not so graphically detailed. The main character ends up finding romance but it's exciting and the thrill behind it is that the character keeps her guard up trying to resist this man's charms. There is the thrill behind the man that's peristently pursuing her for romantic reasons and the possibility for love. The author always makes the male character a man that might have quite an exciting past but he always manages to respect the main character that he is pursuing.She has been my favorite writer since my mother made a recommendation on this. You can imagine how some books may be dry and not capture your interest. I can read this book many times more!"},{"Title":"The Time of the Hunter's Moon","review":"Victoria Holt really knows how to spin a yarn, and I've really enjoyed her other books. This one clips along and has some interesting plots turns, but you never really respect the main character, Cordelia, because of her attraction to a man who doesn't exhibit a great deal of solid character, and in fact in one scene attempts to rape her. At the end of the book I felt like her life would go downhill from there.

I am also a former high school dropout who did not learn to read or write beyond a rudimentary level until I was a grown man. I am very dyslexic and have attention deficit disorder, but no one knew that until I was fortunate enough to be helped by counselors at Sonoma State University. To make a long story short, English grammar has always been a nightmare for me, a bottomless pit of unfathomable rules. Because I have a fairly good ear, I learned to write by reading everything aloud and listening for mistakes. I learned to hear mistakes much like most of us can hear a bad note on the piano, but still I had no idea why they were mistakes. Knowing all of that about me, guess what I majored in in college. If you guessed English, you're right. After working as a laborer for twenty-five years, I was starving to learn how to express myself. But even after I graduated (as a Presidential Scholar) I did not have a clue about grammar, just a good ear and a heartfelt desire to write. I volunteered with Literacy Volunteers of America and loved helping people learn to read. One thing led to another and before I knew it I was teaching at a community college. I became popular as a teacher (as the former class dunce, I have lots of patience for those who have trouble learning), but I always felt ashamed that I didn't know more about grammar. Then, just by chance, I discovered Basic English Grammar by Betty Azar. Through her book, Ms. Azar has taught me more about English grammar than all of the other books I've read combined. Hers is incremental, focused, systematic, humorous, and it explains things with a clarity that absolutely works for me. And believe me, if it works for me, it will work for almost anyone. Cetainly, as you can tell from this sample of my writing, my grammar is not perfect, but still I have learned so much that I didn't know before. If anyone should actually read this review, I want you to know that I have no vested interest in this book or the company that publishes it. This is just my way of saying thank you to Ms. Azar. I was starving for knowledge, and she was kind enough to invite me to the banquet. Thank you, Ms. Azar. I hope to meet you one day and tell you all of this in person. John."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"I have been using Betty Azar's book Basic English Grammar for many years. I find it a perfect supplementary text for other series books that focus on themes and the functional aspect of the language, but do not offer much in the way of drill practice. The fill in the blanks exercises are perfect for homework assignments, especially in the initial stages where practice with the form of the grammar structure needs to be mastered in order to create a foundation for freer expression. The writing assignments are well developed and provide students with a chance to apply on a more personal level the grammar structures they have learned. I also have found that the ORAL:BOOKS CLOSED activities have saved me hours of inventing cues on my own because they allow me to interact with the class as a whole and require that the students process the structures from listening, not the written word. If delivered in a manner that the students don't know who will be responding next, you can engage everyone in using the targeted structures to make a response, even though you call on only a selected number each time. Because drills are necessary, but can become repetitive, I further challenge the students to give their responses to their partners by asking them to &quot;look into their partners eyes&quot; when they respond, instead of speaking while they are reading off the page. I call this &quot;thinking and speaking&quot; because they must use their short term memory instead of their eyes. Hopefully this endeavor will help to move the structures that they are practicing into their long term memory, where it will be available to them outside the classroom. I am especially grateful for all the thought that has been put into the development of this beginning level book in the Azar series, as it has provided me with a strong foundation for teaching the basic structures of grammar. If it were more thematic, however, I would possibly not use it only as a supplementary text."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"This is a well-organized, easy-to-understand tool for teachers and students that will serve as a helpful supplement to broad-based classroom instruction. (This evaluation of Azar's work is from the perspective of teaching EFL.)For learning and teaching language, linguists now largely agree that &quot;research has failed to crown any single method as superior.&quot; At the same time, researchers assert that a multi-entry program is best, one that uses as many different and varied means as possible. Therefore, if we assume that each method and tool used inside or outside the classroom for learning language is just one small piece of a large collage of methods, we will find that nearly every kind of material and method has its place.To shrug off Azar's 'Basic English Grammar' by claiming that &quot;It doesn't work&quot; is to misunderstand its place in the classroom. For teaching conversation skills, it ought not in any way to be the bread and butter of a teacher's instruction; rather, interaction and dialogue that involve the five senses and (where appropriate) the whole body ought to have foremost priority. A heavy emphasis should be first placed on raw listening comprehension alone, afterwards on speaking; after that reading and finally writing. Once basic language skills have been developed in this way, teachers can introduce more formal instruction in grammar, using various exercises to practice new concepts.And that is the place for a volume such as Azar's. The exercises are varied (from cloze passages to fill-in-the-blanks to identifying errors to oral conversation to open-ended essays and more), and the book is thick with page after page of exercises that are extensive and repetitive - exactly as language learning should be.Because most of the exercises are written, in my case I do save this material for use only once or twice a week, or as supplementary homework for students to practice what they have already covered and practiced orally in class. In that case Azar is an excellent reinforcement for what students already know, and need be little more.Teachers of introductory English will need to be aware that the vocabulary in the exercises may be broader than their students are presently familiar with. Also, those teaching in non-English-speaking countries should be aware that some aspects of American culture found in the exercises may be difficult for their students to understand, and therefore the instructor will need to make adjustments accordingly.Overall, this is a helpful and enjoyable tool for training in good grammar skills."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"Azar's series of grammar books have a way of explaining grammar that shows the functions of the various grammar points, the way they are used, and the forms they are supposed to resemble, clearly and concisely. Both deductive and inductive learners can benefit from the examples and exercises given in the series of books. It's also a joy to teach with the Azar series of books because they are so clearly explained, that an experienced teacher can deduce in a glance what the exercise is trying to accomplish. Lengthy preparation time isn't necessary, which leaves more time for working with the students."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"I used this book last year as a supplement in the Intermediate ESL class I was teaching. The book contains thorough explanations as to why we do and say certain things. For example, I especially liked the explanation of voiced and voiceless sounds when using -ed and -s. The exercises were very good. The book didn't quickly skip from one topic to the next, as many ESL books do. This book contained several exercises for each topic, so the students had a lot of practice before being shown something new. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"I have looked many grammar books for my children. This one is outstanding. Many parents do not pay much attention to formal grammar study. You don't have to if writing just so so is OK for you. If you want your child to have above average English, you want him to use a grammar book like this one. Betty Azar did an outstanding job compiling this clear, easy to use book. Its step-by-step introduction to English grammar and well-designed drills are perfect for elementary students. My children benefit a lot from it. Now, they know precisely how sentences should work, not just feel kind of right or wrong. Their good command of English grammar shows up in their impressive writing.Good writing and grammar cannot be achieved in a short time. Looking for more practice, we also use Beestar ELA programs (a very good web site at http://www.beestar.org). Overall, this is a thoughtful fine book that delivers results. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"I have purchased this book and I assure you ,It really helped.I found it so easy to understand I couldn't think of something easier or better."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"Very good manual for teaching the foreign student basic conversation and written skills."},{"Title":"Basic English Grammar, Second Edition (Full Student Textbook)","review":"This text was actually chosen by a second year student in my ESL class. I use a variety of texts with students, as well as a great deal of oral language exercises and discussion using pictures, classroom demonstrations, and so on. One thing I really like about this text are the oral practice exercises in each section. I think a student who has an English speaking friend, tutor, or teacher to practice these with him, check over completed practice, and to explain any lesson that the student questions would GREATLY benefit from this book. Teachers would find plenty of exercises to pull out and use to meet specific classroom practice needs. Students who expect to teach themselves to SPEAK English thru this--or any other text--will be disappointed.

(During the years I was a member of the Caltech Wargaming Society, we experimented with various rules modifications.)Of all the sword and sorcery RPG systems I'd seen up to that point (and even afterwards), the Warlock system seemed to have the best balance of \\"realism\\" and playability. As an engineer, I appreciated the thought that went into making the system as self-consistent as possible.Character generation is fairly simple, yet provides a wide range of character possibilities: eight 3D6 characteristics, gender, character class, hit points, special characteristics (or \\"weirdnesses\\"), alignment, and starting gold on hand. From these primary characteristics, additional characteristics were derived: weight, carrying capacity, and various saving throws.I liked several things about the combat system: the use of percentile dice, with adjustments as small as 1% (as opposed to 5% in RPG systems using D20s), when factoring in differences in attack/defense levels, magic bonuses/penalties; the use of a matrix to determine the basic chance of success when using a particular weapon against a particular class of armor; the critical/fumble tables, which add spice to combat by introducing side effects of particularly good/bad attacks; the prorated spacing of multiple melee blows; and the dex count for determining the firing sequence during ranged combat. The breakdown and sequencing of each combat phase into movement, magic & archery, and melee parts seems unrealistic, but works well as far as game mechanics go.I liked several things about the magic system: the use of spell points to act as a budget for how many spells a mage can cast on a given day, although which spells can be cast successfully is limited to those the mage has memorized (with the maximum number they can learn in each spell level being determined by the mage's experience level), or has access to in the form of spell books, scrolls, wands, and/or staves (assuming the mage has the appropriate activation spell!); the classification of spells according to magic type, and using magic type specialization as a way to reduce spell point cost (with the associated increase in spell point cost when casting spells of the opposite type); the spells, for the most part, \\"obeyed\\" the laws of physics (so make sure your mage doesn't throw a fire ball into a room that doesn't have enough space to accommodate its full volume, or else the mage may be fried by the backdraft!).In constrast to the magic system, the clerical spell system allows clerics to cast any \\"known\\" clerical spell, but the quantity they can cast of each clerical spell level on any given day is based on a cleric's experience level.The thievish skill set allows thieves to replace superseded skills with another of a similar level (e.g., a thief who acquires the third-level dagger +4 skill may replace the first-level dagger +2 skill with a different first-level skill). At higher experience levels, this cascading effect can lead to abuse, but if a character managed to get to such high levels, they deserve it!As with most RPGs, my one gripe would be that the Warlock system awarded experience points only for defeating monsters and collecting treasure; no one earned experience points (directly, anyway) by simply using their noodle to overcome obstacles."},{"Title":"A Parliament of Owls","review":"A Parliament of OwlsPatrick BuchananStein and Day, 1971I was very enthusiastic in my review of the first Ben Shock and Charity Tucker mystery I read,A requiem of sharks;: A novel of suspense(the third in the brief series). Unfortunately, its predecessor \\"A Parliament of Owls\\" is not quite as good, not quite the simple fun, though not by any means a total dog.\\"Owls\\" begins with a similar slam-bang opener, when Ben and Charity arrive in her home town of Pilgrim's Pride, a bit north of Boston: Before the end of the second page, as they are watching her father's yacht \\"Channel Nine\\", there is a mysterious whooshing sound and the boat explodes and sinks. Ben (with scuba gear conveniently in his trunk) jumps in and attempts rescue. [A definite pattern here, consistent with \\"Sharks\\".]Soon, Ben (who is still a New York cop at this point ... by \\"Sharks\\" he and Charity are private investigators) is embroiled in the investigation, caught between the demands of the local police and the family, in a decidedly odd sleepy coastal small town. Was the motive personal or political? Was it the violent \\"hippy\\" gang, or the right wing nutjob enclave (who between them are holding the town close to hostage), or someone closer to the family? What other secrets will be revealed?This is a good setup, but the whole does not measure up to \\"Sharks\\". Perhaps it's partly lack of practice. Perhaps it's the personal involvement with Charity's family. Perhaps even more it's the poorly stereotyped groups of left and right wing extremists who are central to the action. Still worth a read, but not something I'd pass on with an \\"oh, you're going to love this one.\\"Note on the title: Amazon has \\"The Parliament....\\", but I'm pretty sure the library copy I read was \\"A Parliament...\\".

They are aware that they should provide the basics of the field and not delve into the specifics. They understand that people will use their textbook to learn the basics of a subject, not to be lectured at about touchy subjects. Most textbook writers provide information from all perspectives of the field, not just theirs while bashing all other perspectives.Kalat does not understand any of that.This textbook is horrible. The author (Kalat) takes a massively one-sided perspective on what types of Psychology are valid (he promotes Behaviorism and condemns all others). He even goes out of his way to bash religious peoples and non-Evolutionists, which given the subject is completely uncalled for. This guy is about as pompous and self-glorifying as they come, and that kind of attitude I cannot stand. Not only is it rude and unprofessional, but it also damages the reader's understanding of the subject and his open-mindedness. I truly feel bad for any Psychology majors whose beliefs he bashes needlessly--their enthusiasm for the subject will certainly be hurt by Kalat's self-exalted attitude.I would not suggest this textbook to anyone. In fact, even if it is required for a course, I would suggest buying a different textbook instead, especially if Psychology is truly a field that interests you. It would be better to learn about all different approaches to Psychological studies rather than hear that all approaches other than Behaviorism is complete nonsense.

Applying the techniques of acting to the business world makes for better public speakers is the thesis of this book and it's a good one. I'm a coach and have done a lot of public speaking, and this book pointed out many ways I could improve my presentation. I also coach other people about public speaking, and I'll be recommending this book to them.Rehearsing well ahead of time, they recommend, so that you aren't 'rehearsing nervousness' which is what will happen if you go on stage unrehearsed each time. Good point!The parts I really enjoyed were their treatments of the kind of phoniness you sometimes feel. They point out that there's nothing phony about real acting -- it's not cheap theatrics. A real actor finds the truth in the situation and brings many different aspects of himself to his role and lives it as honestly as he can within the fictional parameters of the play. &quot;A good speaker does the same within the parameters of the speech.&quot;&quot;Play the full range,&quot; they say. &quot;Every human being possesses all 88 keys on the piano, but most of us restrict our melodies to the middle octave.&quot; This book will show you how to play all over the keyboard!

This book shows how the South African Police, during the late 70's deceided to fight SWAPO on its own terms. A fighting vehicle capable of withstanding small arms fire and landmines was developed. This new Vehicle, the Casspir, was armed and gave the Police mobility and fire power. Every vehicle was manned by a Car Commander (initially a white South African) and 8-10 black special policeman. Casspirs worked in groups of 4 and was supported by a logistic vehicle. Operations ussaully lasted a week to 2 weeks in the bush. Leads where followed and as soon as track where picked up, the Wambo trackers started following the tracks. The end result was in most cases a violent but uneven shootout, between the SWAPO insurgents and the 40 odd policeman and their heavily armed fighting vehicles. Needless to say the international press and anti-South African lobby were soon to brand the Policemen as the vilans. What this book is doing, is to tell the story about policemen doing soldier's jobs. No mercy was given by both sides, and black and white fought and died together to resist the communist onslaught from Angola, being run under the blanket of African nationalism. Fortunately the cold war ended and the communist approach died with it. Today Namibia is a independant and prosperous country, but if it was not for these brave Policemen Namibia could have looked much different from what it is now. Reading the book also raises a number of questions. Why did SWAPO invaded Namibia in 1989? Why did SWAPO after 15 years of independance not claimed it's dead from the mass graves they were buried in? How big was the intimidation before and during the 1990 elections? It seems it must have been substantial. Firstly huge numbers of the Wambo people supporting the Police and volunteering to fight SWAPO & weeks later everybody voteing for SWAPO!!! This a unique book in its approach and a must read for people with a tac for military history and tactics- although these men where mostly policemen. This book also gives a face to ordaniry policemen, not being interested in politics but rather in doing an outstanding and committed job. There is also another side to the Namibian Border War. Read this book and experience what you did not read in the Anti-Apartheid literature."},{"Title":"The Covert War: Koevoet Operations in Namibia, 1979-1989","review":"This book, the third in a trilogy (The Silent WarandWarfare by Other Means), stands alone as a masterful account of South Africa's operations to quell the insurgency in Namibia between 1967 and 1989 and provides an in depth hundred page description of events between March 31st, 1989 and April 9th, 1989 when 1,700 SWAPO guerillas invaded Namibia on the eve of independence.This book is a personal account dealing with individuals that fought in Namibia and the story is based almost entirely on interviews with key participants such as the founder of Koevet, Lt-general Hans Dreyer. A huge number of people were interviewed and this means that much of the storytelling is as close to being there as possible for the reader. This is not an academic book, it is an adventure from the first page to the last presenting, in the end, the history of Namibia during this period and presenting text-book lessons in counter-insurgency warfare that many nations could well learn from. Excellent color pictures complete the story.The story begins with the \\"stirring of black nationalism\\" in Northern Namibia, known as Owamboland because of the tribe that resided there. With the Portuguese flight from Angola, Operation Savannah and the intervention of South Africa and Cuba in that country in 1974 the \`frontline' of insurgency now came to the doorstep of Namibia which was being administered by South Africa. The first counter-insurgency school was opened in South Africa in 1968 but it was not until 1978 that \`Operation K' or Koevet, Afrikaans for crowbar, would be put into action in Namibia to quell the insurgency launched by SWAPO guerillas. However what distinguished operations in Owamboland was the use of local black Africans to work alongside the South Africans. In addition the use of landmines by the guerillas necessitated the creation of special armored vehicles to deal with them. The book then becomes a story about operations in the north along the Angolan border. Maps and diagrams complete the stories so the reader is rarely lost and his attention is always drawn to what will happen next. Peter Stiff is a first class storyteller in this respect. This book is yet another masterpiece in his trilogy. Another must read for all South Africans.Seth J.

Someone complained that there were too many love scenes (how can there ever be too many!!?) but this is &quot;All About Passion&quot;, after all, and the passion these two feel for each other is a critical part of the story. All the Cyntser books are really good reads and this is one of the best. Next the twins. Cynster women. Now that will be interesting."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This historical romance, set in 1820 Britain just after the Prince Regent had finally ascended to the throne as George IV, fits into the author's \\"Bar Cynster\\" series. The hero, Gyles Rawlings (Earl of Chillingworth) is a friend of the Cynster family and appears as a minor character in earlier books of the series such as \\"Devil's Bride (Bar Cynster)\\" and \\"A Secret Love (Bar Cynster)\\", and has even been elected by Devil Cynster (the duke of St Ives and head of the Cynster family) and his cousins as an \\"Honorary Cynster.\\"In the bible, Jacob lost his heart to his patron's beautiful younger daughter Rachel and asked for her hand in marriage, but found when his bride lifted her veil that instead of the woman who stirred his blood he had been given instead her sister Leah. This is a story of a man who finds himself in exactly the opposite position ...In this book Gyles Rawlings has seen all his Cynster friends and fellow rakes smitten by, and marry for love: and finding that he needs a bride, is determined not to go the same way. He wants a calm, placid marriage which will not interfere with his other pursuits.So the Earl goes to a distant cousin who is responsible for two young ladies of marriagable age - a daughter and a niece - and negotiates for the hand of one of the women concerned. One of the cousins appears to be calm and placid, well behaved and reasonably good looking without being a great beauty. The other is a fiery, tempestuous and voluptuous beauty who sets his pulse racing. Wanting a docile wife rather than a passionate marriage, Chillingworth offers for the former - or so he thinks.However - and I'm not giving away anything here which isn't clearly stated on the back of the book - Gyles has offered for the wrong woman. Through a series of ironic chances he does not get formally introduced to either cousin before the wedding. Having thought he was offering for the placid girl who doesn't set him on fire, he looks around as his bride is coming up the aisle - to see the girl he thought he was marrying sitting in the front row while the girl who drives him mad with desire is the bride who is taking her place beside him. And she's obviously completely furious with him ...Ridiculously unlikely but highly amusing and entertaining. Definately one of Stephanie Laurens' better books."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"First of all, this book started off horribly in my opinion. The 'hero' sounds like an idiot and a jerk. The 'heroine' makes assumptions all over the place and then winds up in a position she isn't happy with. However, in my opinion, at least her assumptions and actions were mostly justified, while the 'hero' comes off looking like pond scum.Towards the middle of the book, our 'hero' is looking up. He isn't so alpha and stupid. The 'heroine' decides to make the best of the situations, and I think she does a pretty good job.There wasn't much of a mystery, and by that I mean it was pretty obviouos who the bad guy was. And the ending was predictable. However, the book definately got better as it went on.All in all, this isn't my favorite book by any means, but it was a nice distraction once we got past the 'hero' being an idiot. Pick it up if you are a fan of the Cynster books or Stephanie Laurens in general, because while this isn't the best example of her work, it isn't the worst either."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I loved the book right from the start I could not put it down, every chance that I had I read. My goodness the love scenes were incredible all the passion that Francesca and Chilinsworth had for each other was enough to make anybody hot... and I loved it every hot moment after the other. I loved the book so much I had suggested my bestfriend read it(and she hates reading but I got her to read it) well, she loved it she says that she could never put the book down and kept her wanting to know what was going to happen next at every moment and is reading like never before! She is now a romance novel fanatic and is always looking for a good book to read so SHE can suggest it to me."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This book was one of the best books I've read in awhile.I like everything by this writer.I think all the cynster books are great but she out did herself this time .The love scenes where just great very hot and heavy just like I like them.I cant't wait for the next 2 books about the twins to come out."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I've loved all the books in this series, but this one was beautiful and magical. By far one of the best. I had low expectations, feeling that maybe the series storyline was being stretched to the limit - but Laurens tells a wonderful and heartwarming story here. The characters will really make you root for them."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Frankly I am not a devout reader to Ms. Lauren's Cynster series but gathering from the laudable accolades - I decided to give All about Passion a try. Gyles Rawling, earl of Chillingworth has planned to marry a decorated wife of status without love - and opportunity arises when Francesca, his distant relative possesses the dowry of the lands of his desired estate. He meets a gypsy at her estate and is struck by passionate love - little did he know the gypsy would his future bride Francesca.Francesca is determined to peel off Gyle's control - for she knows inside Gyles is capable of passion and love. However, he is afraid to let his heart go - for in his past his trust was unreciprocated. When someone sabotages and threatens Francesca's life, Gyles feels his protectiveness translates to a burning love...Stephanie Laurens has done an incredible job with Francesca and Gyles - All about passion is wildly passionate as it promises - with incendiary romps and smoldering desires. Yet, one wish it isn't all about passion. The mystery element with the whodunit and red herring comes poorly executed as a poor excuse to explore Gyle's chivalry. It is lucidly predictible and it's amazing how the tale of their passion can sustain 400 over pages.It is at its rudiment - a story of how love conquers all. Ms. Laurens has bestowed a great love story but for those looking beyond passion - it turns out a tad disppointed."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"...This book has it all-and yes, it's true, he's not a Cynster, but he's hot, handsome, and absolutely fun. Laurens finally breaks the Cynster mold-I don't think anyone \\"harrummphed\\" the whole book. She used some different language-thank you, and kept us out of the tons' ballrooms for most of the book-thanks again.It's as good as Devil's Bride and A Secret Love-the best of the Cynster series.It's a fun book-total escape-and a great read."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Since the first book of the Cynster series, I have waited for a book about Chillingworth. I wasn't disappointed. Gyles was what a hero should be--stubborn. Francesca is high spirited (that might be a bit of an understatement), funny, and set on getting Gyles right where she knows he should be. The secondary characters played an important part throughout the story and were wonderfully written. I do wish that Franni had had more of a part in the first of the book. This is another must read from Stephanie Laurens who makes her characters come alive."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I read this book in one day; I was so thrilled that the author finally wrote a story worthy of Devil's Bride. It is fun and sexy and a great read. Please give us more like this!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Lots of tension between both characters. Lots of passion. I really liked Chillingworth and Franchesca. She was so outwardly passionate and he was pretty smoldering under a smooth veneer. Yes it's a silly suspense story -- but the love story more than makes up for it!! Definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Chillingworth is every woman's dream man adamant never to fall in love and ends up marrying sensual headstrong Francesca. I was unable to put the book down from the moment I started reading it. A big thumbs up for Stephanie Laurens for delivering such a fab romantic novel. I've read all her novels except for Promise in a Kiss, the next one on my list."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Stephanie Laurens newest addition to the Bar Cynster series is fabulous. I am very impressed with the excellent writing and wonderful storylines which continue from book to book. I can't wait to read the next book about Sebastian &amp; Helena and also the books about Amanda, Amelia and Simon."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I've enjoyed all of Stephanie Laurens' Cynsters and can't wait for the next one. This was a good story about Chillingworth and his Lady love, Fransceca. Chillingworth was somewhat cold toward his love not like the other Cynsters at all, except maybe Demon in A Rogue's Proposal, which is one of the reasons I gave it a 4 instead of a 5! But still a very good book! The ending was great!!!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles or Chillingworth was a character in the first six Bar Cynster novels. He is called an honorary Bar Cynster because he was a school friend, similar in personality and is a friendly rival toward some of the Bar Cynster's in their pursuits of their wives.Chillingworth decides he will marry but will never fall in love with his wife. His will be an arranged marriage. Upon finding out the owner of the land adjacent his is a young woman of marriagable age and the land will pass onto her husband as a dowry, he makes an offer of marriage to her uncle sight unseen. Chillingworth spots a boring young woman sitting in the garden and assumes it is his intended bride. He then runs into a brazen young woman with an Italian accent and is immediately attracted. He thinks she would make an excellent mistress after he marries. Surprise, surprise, he finds out on his wedding day the attractive Italian woman is his fiance. They have no choice but to marry.When Chillingworth tells his young wife that he only wants a marriage of convenience with a couple of heirs they make an agreement, that after their heirs are born they may have discreet affairs. Of course, she doesn't really want that and sets out to change his mind. Also, an unknown enemy is trying to kill her.I think I liked this book better than some of the Bar Cynster novels. Francesca is not a boring leading lady content to be an old maid, Chillingworth is stubborn but has that special appeal that keeps him from being unlikable. If you enjoy the Cynster novels, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Laurens storyline held my attention, however it wasn't as good as 'Devils Bride.' Laurens stories are quite predictable, but if you want to forget the outside world for a while and indulge in pure romance then they are a jolly good read."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"There arn't many books I don't finish but this is one, not because the writing is bad, this author is a master at what she does and the plot is good just too much sexual detail for my taste. I like more outside the bedroom narrative and some things left to the imagination. Still Lauren's is talented with what she pens and you might find the novel highly entertaining.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at this story. I had not been overwhelmed by the last of the Cynster saga, and was pleasd with Gyles and reading his story. I just did get a little weary toward the end of his being afraid to love. Plus I could spot the antagonist immediately and couldn't believe that Francesca could not spot that person (I won't divulge any clue as to the person). Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read, despite a letdown at an unexciting end.I am looking forward to the twins and the Bar's reaction to them with their beaus!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I don't know how she could marry someone who propositioned her when he thought she was his brides companion. Also I understand intimicy livens up a romance novel but give me a break, I felt the need to wash my hands half way through the book. I doubt I will even read any additional book by Laurens after this."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Exactly as the title suggests. All about passion is a story all about passion and intrigue and what a man should be. Very whorthwile reading this book."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"What can I say except that Stephanie Laurens does it again. This is another great regency romance by this talented author with all of her trademark sensuatlity and wit.This is the story of Gyles Rawlings the Earl of Chillingworth.

What he finds out is that what he thinks he wants is wrong.Francesa is a bold and wonderful person and sparks feelings in Glyes that he can't forget.

This is a great story you won't want to miss it."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I have not quit a book halfway through in years and years, but this one I did - after getting tired of skipping the innumerable sexual trysts. Actually, I found there were some bits of plot between the various sexual acts in various places. I have nothing against sex, but a little substance is required as well. This was my first Stephanie Laurens book, and will be my last."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles Rawlings must marry in order to gain an heir for his title. He sets out to find a paragon of a lady who understands that this is no love match--simply a business deal. He thinks he's found the perfect woman in Francesca Rawlings. But rather than marrying a quiet woman who will fade into the woodwork and not upset the order of his life, he gets a siren who sets his blood on fire. This isn't what he wanted, this sort of passion, and yet, it may just be what he's lucky enough to get.Francesca wants love and she thinks she can find it with Gyles, if she waits patiently. But patience isn't one of Francesca's virtues...Laurens crafts a splendid story about two people who end up getting just what they deserve...each other.

But will he be able to protect her from her veiledenemy?The fairly obvious villain does not at all detract fromStephanie Laurens' smooth, delicious writing style, and thecharacter of Francesca is a fiery delight."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This wasn't a bad book. In fact, if I hadn't so happily anticipated the newest Cynster book because of how wonderful all the previous ones have been, I might have thought it to be good. But it is not, in my opinion, nearly as well-written and engaging as all other Stephanie Laurens books. The plot was relatively boring, and about a quarter of the way through the reader has already determined who will be threatening the lives of the main character (most romance novels, of course, contain a subplot of someone wishing to do away with one or both of the two main characters), which is is the reason I usually am enticed to read all the way to the end without putting a book down. But there is no mystery and the continuous sex becomes redundant. Laurens might also have added some other contact with her previous characters in her book, something that, unlike (again, my opinion) Catherine Coulter, she does quite well and in a non irritating manner.So overall, it is not a bad read, and if someone else had written it I might not have been disappointed, but I did not feel it was as well written or as engaging as Stephanie Laurens other books."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles Rawlings, Earl of Chillingworth, appeared in Laurens' earlier Cynster novels (especially Gabriel's story, A Secret Love) as a delightful man with a truly sly and wicked sense of humor -- and no objection whatsoever to marrying a woman he liked and whose company and wit he enjoyed. Unfortunately, he was elected an honorary Cynster, which apparently resulted in a personality amputation, because none of his charm carried over into the book dedicated to his own romance. He shows up with a paralyzing determination to have a bloodless, conventional, marriage but otherwise blah.This is really too bad. The heroine deserved better treatment from her author."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I've often read the reviews in the front of novels where reviewers claim 'If it has so-and-so's name on it, I'll buy it!'I've often thought of those as publicity, but after reading the Bar Cynster series, and now the story of Chillingworth, I can assure you that I've now purched 2 Laurens books sight unseen through Amazon before they've even been released. I haven't been so consistently pleased by an author's abilities since the early days of Kathleen Woodiwiss.Let's just hope Stephanie doesn't succumb to the same strange malady that later afflicted Woodiwiss' writing.These characters are real, they're sensual, they're interesting, and despite the aforementioned obvious dearth of a good mystery, this romance propels you through 400+ pages with little thought for anything that might be missing.I'm a Laurens fan for life."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I thought that this book was going to be a fun read and kept reading, hoping that it would get better. However, there were just many things I didn't like about this book that I gave up. First of all, the love scenes in this book were extremely long. I find it strange that the love scences in this book were several pages long, yet the sentences that the characters spoke to eachother were so short. The author focuses on sex and perfecting what is going on through them during that time, but when these two characters are talking to eachother, it seems so boring that it was as if the author was half awake writing what they were saying. I mean how can the love scenes be so detailed but their conversations be so dull!!! Also, what I didn't like was how Gyles thought that Francesca was a gypsy and not the woman that he was going to marry and treated her like a mistress. The hero was a jerk! (An example would be on page 90.) The heroine was also crazy for agreeing to marry a man who told her the reason he was marrying her was for many reasons other than love. I don't think any intelligent woman would agree to marrying this guy. Well, I know I wouldn't. Also, the book was just extremely slow. It took more than a hundred of pages just for Gyles to find out that he was actually marrying the \\"gypsy\\". This was my first book written by Laurens and I think that it will be my last."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Stephanie Laurens has created a wonderful series of great dashing male characters with her Bar Cynster series. This is book 7 in the series.All About Passions is a wonderful addition to the series. Gyles Rawlings (a cousin this time) is the handsome Earl of Chillingworth but he is determined to not be a member of the Bar Cynster. He's watched all his friends fall to a fate he finds worse than anything \\"LOVE\\". Refusing to let that emotion overtake his destiny he decides to arrange a marriage based on property and bloodlines rather than love. Luckily for him he discovers that the heiress to a piece of property that he desires is just what he is looking for. He sends his man to investigate the girl to discover she is of breeding and sounds like the meek woman he needs to give him an heir and a spare. Francesca Rawlings is just what he's looking for, but when he stumbles upon a wild gypsy girl at the estate he finds himself drawn to her even though he has offered for her Francesca. Unlike Frannie the blond, fair creature he sees sitting in the garden this gypsy stirs other things in him.He wants nothing more than to marry Frannie and at the same time wants to fulfill his desires with the wild dark haired beauty who stirs his passions. On his wedding day though he finds a very big surprise when the woman he sees at the alter isn't the mild mannered Frannie, but his gypsy Francesca Rawlings. Gyles had no idea that there were two Frannie's or Francesca's as he soon finds out. How can he ever explain to Francesca that while he was trying to seduce her he'd planned on marrying her cousin?Stephanie does a wonderful job of creating a very well written romantic story. This is my favorite Bar Cynster story so far. The scenes between Francesca and Gyles are electric and very erotic. Their passion erupts from the pages. Add in the discovery that someone is trying to kill one of them and the search for a killer only adds to a wonderful romantic novel.This story doesn't end at the bedroom door so if you don't like spice in your romance then this isn't the book for you. If you do, well, Gyles is a very wonderful leading man and the chemisty between him and the fiery Francesca/His Gypsy is wonderful.Beyond the romance/erotic/seductive storyline is a tale of family bloodlines, madness and a wonderful family of Rakes who think LOVE is a dirty word until they find it for themselves.Stephanie Laurens keeps continuing to write about a wonderful family of men with great strong female counterparts. Add in a little mystery and you've got a fun romance with lots of passion.A perfect way to spend time with a book.5 Stars for the Bar Cynster and hopes that Stephanie Laurens will find even more family members to add to the series!You must read the others as well Devil's Bride, A Rake's Vow, Scandal's Bride, A Rogue's Proposal, A Secret Love, All About Love and the upcoming The Promise in a Kiss: A Cynster Christmas Novel."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"You know, I've been a Stephanie Laurens fan since devouring her first book several years ago, but this one struck me as more erotic than romantic. Gyles holds out too long before admitting his feelings for Francesca, and frankly, I still don't understand why. His parents obviously were a very loving and happy couple, and the tragic accident that took his father's life doesn't give him a good reason to fear love the way he does. Francesca is an admirable character with depth and wisdom beyond her years, but Gyles comes across as a typical male chauvinist determined to have his own way no matter who it hurts. Not very lovable, unless you consider his prowess in the bedroom...which, apparently, Francesca does. But Francesca's love chips away and eventually melts her husband's cold heart, leaving him nearly human in the end. An enjoyable read, but far too dependent on sexual gymnastics to earn five stars from me."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This is a romance novel. If you're looking for passion as the name implies, you will get it. Thats why the love scenes are so long. And by the way, they arent boring either. If you have nothing to do and love historical romances you can curl up in the bed with this one. I didnt get bored and her writing is easy to follow."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Full of mystery and romance. I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast paced page turner any romance lover would enjoy. It is one of my favorites of late along with Fantasy Lover by Kenyon and Anything, My Love by Cynthia Simmons. All great reads that should not be missed."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Sorry to see this was the last of the Cynsters to be written about. It is her usual romantic love story. I loved his character. Didn't like her as well. But there is a lot of great sex and sexy men. One thing I like about all the Cynsters is when they do decide to make a commitment they stay true to their spouses. This is probably an unreality at that time but is nice to dream about."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"What a great book. Chillingworth well lives up to the nickname of being an honorary Cynster. What a great series, and to have Chillingworth get the same kind of woman that he scoffed the Cynsters for getting was ideal. I compare all I read to this one and the Cynster series."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Loved Chillingworth! One of my favs in the Cynster series. I have them all!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I've read it more than once and will read it again. Awesome. Love those Cynsters."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This is a wonderful addition to the Cynster series. Chillingworth is mentioned in almost all the Cynster novels. It was wonderful to learn more about him and get to know what makes him tick. He is so like the &quot;bar cynster.&quot; He is a strong, noble man who is ready and willing to jump to the aid of those in need. Just like the bar cynster. He was determined to not fall in love like the rest of his cynster peers, but someone so like them couldn't really expect to escape the fate the fell upon the rest?His story was fun to read with the same flare and excitement Stephanie instilled in each of her previous cyster novels. I just with that their was more of the &quot;bar cynster&quot; in this novel. I know he wasn't a part of their family, but being that he was a honorary cynster, I wish that she would have written a better connection in this novel. I read the series, not only for the new story, but because she does so well at keeping the reader updated on the other characters. This novel really didn't do that. It was very enjoyable, and well worth the purchase, though."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This book as many tantalizing scenes! If it's passion you want this book has it. I hadn't heard of Stephanie Laurens when I purchased All About Passion so I didn't know of The Bar Cynster Series. After reading All About Passion I went and bought the whole series. I throughly enjoy her writing and how she truly uses real emotions and feelings in her stories. I think this book and all of The Bar Cynster Series are truly about passion. Great job Stephanie!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I very much enjoyed this book and Gyles and Francesca's story.It really tells you about the power of love and how it can bestronger than anything. I thought that the story was alittleshort of a secondary story line,but the romantic scenes veryhot and often. I was very glad to see Devil and the Bar Cynsterfamily again, and I understand they will be back soon, but notsoon enough for me. I really did enjoy this story immensely.So if you have not read any of the Bar Cynster family story'sby Stephanie Lauren I highly recommend that you do. Keep up thegood work Stephanie Lauren."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This was the first of the Bar Cynster series that I read. After reading this book I read all of the other books in the series. I enjoy Stephanie Laurens characters and their committment to home and family. She writes these sensual stories filled with believable characters.Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"You've all read the editorial reviews so I don't have to elaborate on the plot. I'm an avid reader and I don't waste my time on something that is not enjoyable. Ms. Laurens has written another &quot;very enjoyable read.&quot; I'll give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I haven't been reading the Cynster series, primarily because the name reminds me of \\"Simon Bar Sinister\\" from Rocky and Bullwinkle. And the names are just a little too overdone. This book was ok. I don't highly recommend it, but I wouldn't turn a reader away from it either (hence 3 stars). Surprisingly, the plot was pretty good, but the romance scenes were odd.There were about a dozen too many \\"ruthless, devouring kisses.\\" Give it up and get some new adjectives. Or better yet, toss out adjectives such as ruthless, devouring, rapacious, plundering, overpowering, relentless, etc... especially after they've been used once or twice in similar scenes. I found myself getting turned off by these scenes rather than the reverse. Minus 1 star for irritating, badly described kisses that drag on and on.What I did like about the book: The lady was great - grown up, quick witted, friendly, able to take good advice, and honest both to herself and others. The hero was able to learn from his and other's experiences and finally changed his mind about some things - he grew up. And depite his relentless kisses, he treated his wife very well. I also liked how there were several minor characters that kept popping up in the story with whom the main characters interacted in quality scenes. Strangely, the exception to this was the Cynsters with whom they had almost no interaction. I also liked how the characters spent time with each other growing closer and learning more about each other, rather than apart and pining.A couple other negatives which knocked it from 4 stars to 3. I was never really certain why the hero was so set on not falling in love. The sudden death of his father didn't do it for me- it might have had it been explained better, but it wasn't. Or a better definition of what the hero thought 'being in love' meant. Also, despite the minor \\"accidents\\" their lives went remarkably smoothly. They had the midas touch - every thing they attempted went off smoothly and made everyone love them. This is all well and good up to the \\"family get together ball.\\" I absolutely refuse to believe that someone could gather up a couple hundred of their long lost relatives for a party with the notice of a week and a half. Can't be done, not even in fiction if you're dealing with the early 1800's. Especially when it would take the invitations about a week to reach some of them. If the party was given a month from when the invitations went out, sure. But not 10 days or so. It was too fakey for me to feel that the accomplishment was anything more than a plot device thrown in to make us love them more. It would have been great as a christmas ball, though.Ah well. If you like Stephanie Laurens, you'll probably like this too. As it is, I'm debating how many more of her novels I should try - are her plots interesting enough without being too forced? Are her heroes less \\"ruthless and devouring\\" in the other novels? I hope so."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Compared to all the other Cynster Chillingworth was a child. The book did lack in story and character. Hardly any motivation, but I did happen to like Francesca. She was great. She saw what she wanted and fought for what she knew was there. She to me was more of a Cynster. And I agree with another reviewer who said that Chillingworth had no motive for not being able to love. A good read if you're looking for good love scenes, otherwise you might want to skip it and what for &quot;The Promise in a Kiss.&quot;"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I absolutely love the Cynster series-the characters in the first six books were absolutely amazing and the plots full of suspense and the inevitable love. This one, however, was a complete disappointment.It's not that I don't like Chillingworth, in fact, he was a great character when Devil meets his match in an earlier book. But what I loved most about this series is that the surrounding characters add to the story and keep it from being just a romance story, I think it's nice to see humor and intrigue as well. In this book, its only the only familiar face is Chillingworth. No Cynsters (well, Devil is in it for the length of about 6 paragraphs but I don't count that because it was more taling about him, not him talking). Other than the lack of Cynsters, the story was fairly boring. They spend the first half of the book fighting then the second half having sex. The identity of the bad guy in the book who's making attempts on the lives of the new couple is so obvious that its irritating that no one even considers it.Overall I was just disappointed and left wishing I still had my money. I am still looking forward to the next in the series because it involves the twins and I'm assuming her guardians, the Bar Cynster, will have to make appearances."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles is ready to take the plunge into marriage, on his own terms, of course.

She sences the heat in him, the fire and vows to turn his tepid offer into one of blazing passion."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel currently in its initial release, I read a wide variety of fiction. I genuinely enjoyed Stephanie Laurens' ALL ABOUT PASSION. Gyles Rawlings, an honorary Cynster, decides that the time has come for the Fifth Earl of Chillingworth, himself, to marry. Living in Regency England, he elects to marry for dynastic reasons, not love. He selects a distant relative named Francesca whom he believes will provide him with heirs yet not engage his heart. To the best of his knowledge, she is supposedly a docile blonde who will honor her obligations meekly and not trouble his soul. This dynastic marriage is arranged, sight unseen. Upon his wedding day, he discovers he's contracted to marry the wrong woman. The Francesca he has mistakenly agreed to marry is a passionate woman who will challenge his heart. The other woman was her cousin with the same name. Sexual tension saturates this work, and Gyles finds himself reluctantly drawn to his wife and her loving passion. Things don't work out exactly the way the Earl planned, especially when Francesca's life becomes threatened. ALL ABOUT PASSION is a fun read."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I read half the book and decided it really was not holding my interest, so, I quit reading it. This was my first and last experience with Ms. Laurens. I felt her main characters didn't grab the reader and cause you to care about them. They had no depth to them. There was too much detail involved in the conversations with servants, etc. that was boring. The intimacy was described in detail but their behavior during each act was repetitious. The acts went on for many pages but during those pages nothing new was said or done that couldn't have been covered in two paragraphs. I found that I wanted to start skipping sentences. I have never felt that way in any other book I have read. Basically the intimacy was not moving. In my opinion it needs to be moving in order to have the reader care about the characters working their lives with each other out, discovering their love, etc. Read books by Madeline Hunter if you want to know how scenes of intimacy should be written. I have read many good authors that write a mature love story. Ms. Laurens doesn't live up to them."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I read this author for the first time recently, and was encouraged to buy a second book, this one. I'm no prude, but in this \\"romance\\" the story was a distant second to an excessive amount of soft pornography. I resent having wasted the purchase price. If the sex adds to the story fine, but if it is the story then let the buyer know up front."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Due to bad weather my connecting flight was cancelled. So, left with 5 hours to kill in the middle of the Atlanta airport I went to the bookstore and picked up this book. I was enthralled! I had never read Stephanie Laurens before. I spent the whole 5 hours sitting at my gate reading this book!! I never took a break! The book was sensual and fun! Others have wrote very nice storylines so I won't do that but I will say that I enjoyed this book so much that as soon as I got home I ordered all the rest in Stephanie Lauren's Cynster series and her new Bastion Club series!!!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles Rawlings, Earl of Chillingworth, is ready formarriage.

Although I admit the story suit the title. However, the story line is quiet boring. The sparks actually worn off... for me it is. The bedroom scenes are passionate, but it is just that. I honestly don't know how the hero and heroine could develop that kind of realtionship.. especially in the 18th century.
