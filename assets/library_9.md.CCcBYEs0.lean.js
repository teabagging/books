A large portion of the text is devoted to detailed information about common conditions and illnesses. The book concludes by going over different therapies; how they are done, what they correct, and the authors are careful to caution the reader where appropriate.

In part 1, the authors discusses the basics of nutrition, vitamins from A to Z including its food sources, the ABC's of minerals including its food sources, a section on water, amino acids, antioxidants, enzymes, natural food supplements, and a chart on herbs and their uses. In part 2, the authors discusses the common disorders a person may face such as athma, brusing, or insomia. The disorder is explained then is given a list of nutrients or supplements that are very important, or helpful in combating or preventing the disorder. Then a list of herbs, recommendations on what to do and considerations on what to do are given about that disorder. In part 3, remedies and therapies are discussed. Some of the remedies and therapies which are discussed in the book are acupressure, acupuncture, aromathera[y, essential oils, blood perification, colon cleansing, enemas, exercise, fasting, juicing and preparing for and recovering from surgery.

Packed with accurate information, I have cured most of my ailments and have also learned more about many specific health problems. Not only does it give information on what the specific vitamins, minerals, and nutrients do, it tells you where they can be found naturally in the foods you eat, instead of always resorting to pill supplements. If you have an ailment (like a skin infection for example) it tells you what nutrients are needed in order to cure the problem. I am tired of having the doctor medicate me with costly prescriptions only to create more problems for me (ex. Erythromycin for my bronchitis burned my stomach and gave me a yeast infection) Had I known about this book before I got that prescription, I would have been a lot more comfortable. I highly recommend this book. Great reference manual."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I have recommended and used this book for years. It is a wonderful resource, but only if teamed with common sense and additional research. Much of the dietary advice is extreme, seeming to encourage a vegetarian diet. I am not sure how realistic that approach is, and advise anyone reading the book to temper its advice with moderation. I also follow up with additional research on supplements, although this book does make the reader aware of possible side-effects. I look forward to reading the related books, as I can honestly say that this has been an aid to dealing with many health issues."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I must thank the Balch's for their fine research and well written books.

I am free from the long list of drugs that I was told were keeping me from getting worse...not better! I still refer to this book often and even bought the updated edition.You will not regret buying this book.

You can feel better!"},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I acknowledge the Amazon reviewer who pointed out that there is flawed information in this book. We are finding out new things all the time about health and supplements--so I give the authors some slack here as it's hard for a book published in 2000 (the 3rd edition) to be completely on top of everything. Also, readers have the personal responsibility to cross reference this info and do research on the Internet before taking any new supplement (pharmacists, herbalists, and nutritionists can give the final go-ahead). But as a general reference book, I think this book is extremely helpful. I use this book along with Dr. Nicholas Perricone's \\"The Perricone Promise\\" (and Perricone's on-line newsletters) to get a lot of my general nutritional info. My allergies have much improved since I've started taking MSM & St. John's Wort. And unlike pharmaceutical drugs, many natural supplements do double-duty (MSM-joints & St. John's Wort outperformed Paxil in a recent study) without mind-numbing side effects. I checked into 5-HTP after reading this book, and I cannot sing its praises enough. I also like that the authors (a husband and wife team) will tell you which vitamins to take along with a particular supplement in order to enhance its efficacy (or tell you what to avoid--like protein when taking free-form amino acids like L-Tyrosine or 5-HTP. The labels on many supplements will tell you to take these supplements with a meal--unhelpful and misguiding in certain situations. For example, if you take 5-HTP with a meal that includes protein, you will cancel out the maximum benefit as tryptophan will be absorbed along with the other amino acids that constitute a complete protein. Then people will complain that this product didn't work for them...)(Let me include the caveat that if you suffer from bipolar mood disorder, you should always check with your doctor and pharmacist b/f using any natural mood enhancer...some products may contraindicate your treatment plan. Fish oil (purifed) and flax seed oil are generally very safe for mood disorders.)I actually will sit down for half an hour or so at a time and read different portions of this book. This book is very well-organized and readable."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I find this book an essential part of life. When the doctors were unable to diagnose my 8 year old and referred her to a psychiatrist, it was through reading and researching many ailments that led us to an understanding and solution for her problem. This book offers descriptive information on many diseases and disorders as well as supplemental and dietary information that pertain to them.In fact, this book contained a few tidbits that I have not seen elsewhere but that portray the realistic disease progression as it has happened in my family.This book has proven itself over and over in assisting us to understand, identify and relieve symptoms for many problems in my extended family. I love this book so much, I have given it as a gift on more than one occasion."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I absolutely love this book! It has become my reference guide for every ailment that I have ever had. I don't particularly like going to doctors, because of the cost and high rate of misdiagnosis, so I relied heavily on this book for nutritional guidelines as well as for prevention and treatment of disorders. The result was that I rarely got sick, and when I did I knew exactly what it was and how to treat it. Now, I am living in China, and I foolishly thought that the book would not be useful for me here because it would be difficult to find the supplements needed for certain treatments. Boy, was I wrong--I realized that I relied on the book mostly for diagnostic purposes, and here it is even more difficult to go to the doctor for a clinical diagnosis. I really wish I had brought it with me, but am glad that I read it so thoroughly before I left that I have it practically memorized.

I started taking Zinc to boost my immune system, and after looking at recommended daily allowances of ZInc in other sources, I've decided to decrease my intake of it to every other day.That being said, she recommends a lot of great vitamin/herbal supplements that I had never heard of, which I love. The \\"Conditions\\" section is huge and is a great reference for almost any disorder. I do, however, find it impractical for someone to take the 30 different pills she recommends for any given ailment every day...In sum, I dont regret buying the book (herbal/nutritional healing is underestimated/ignored in our modern society) and will use it as a reference, but not a nutritional bible."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"PNH has always been one of the most responsible reference guides to nutrition.

However, lately I use it simply to look up symptoms, and not necessarily for nutritional advice. This is because some of the nutritional advice goes a bit overboard. I have no problems with people taking megadoses of vitamins (except B6). The problem I do have with certain parts of this book is the Authors' recommendations to take large amounts of minerals. A person can take 10, 100, or even 1000 times the U.S. R.D.A. of most vitamins and be fine. But if a person takes only 2-5 times the R.D.A. of certain minerals (ex. potassium, chromium, selenium, magnesium, manganese, zinc), they can suffer adverse reactions that more than cancel out any positive effect that the mineral may give. Some of the recommendations for minerals in this book are simply too high for the dosage. Also, they seem to recommend herbs along with vitamins and minerals without always checking to see if there have been documented interactions in the past between an herb and a vitamin/mineral. The public needs to realize that most herbs have many different active ingredients that can interact with many other ingested substances, especially pharmaceutical drugs, but not excluding vitamins and minerals. Some of these interactions are found in my book, The Failures of American Medicine, available at Amazon..."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I bought this book, after borrowing my Grandmother's copy.

If I can heal myself or prevent problems with diet, exercise, therapies, vitamins, minerals, or herbal supplements, then I would prefer to!I wanted one natural healing book. Just one- for reference. So I read through a TON of books at 2 different bookstores and at Whole Foods. I choose this one because it covered SO much.It has sections on almost 300 ailments (for example: anxiety, hair loss, hypoglycemia, arthritis, stress, migraine, depression, indigestion, flu and bee-sting) and it lists the vitamins, minerals, and herbs good to use for each problem. Compared to my internet research, it recommends many of the same things and more. I love that it also gives advice on what not to take, what not to mix, how much, and what problems can arise (no other book seemed to do this as well). In addition, there is info on diet, exercise, and alternative therapies. In the front of the book, she explains herbs, minerals, the different types of enzymes, and more. I also enjoy the essential oils list in the back.It is a little confusing when she lists some supplements by Brand Name (I don't like that). And the herbs are more of a post script to each list, but if you want more on herbs she does have a separate book just for that (\\"Prescription for Herbal Healing\\").I am happy with just this one book- plus the advice of the wonderful folks at Erewhon and Whole Foods (who, as it turns out, reference this same book!)."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This is the fourth edition of this book and I have owned or do owneach of the prior three editions.

If it weren't for this book, I would still be using those dangerous and eventually addicting, asthmatic drugs such as the inhaler. It is amazing & alarming that doctors today treat many common chest colds with this dangerous product and give it to little children. Sure it opens your lungs rapidly, but the long term effects are devastating. The inhaler is not just one of the main reasons for obesity in some children as well as adults today, it causes male infertility & I will go as far as to say that may also be one of the main reasons for the rising heart attack deaths in this country. It should be considered as dangerous as the ill fated Phen Phen, since it uses an ephedra like steroid, albuterol. As I said before, were it not for this book, I may not be alive today since asthmatics do not have a long life span. My father died at the age of 58 and he used many of the asthma medicines of today as well as some that were stronger but were banned years ago. I myself, came close to dying from asthma attack going to my doctor. Since I went alone, I had no one to catch me if I had fallen, which I almost did, and only a couple of blocks away from my doctor. It felt like I was drowning as I could barely breathe and the temperature that day was 90 degrees! All I could do was pray to God to give me strength to make it to the doctors and thanks to him I made it. After the usual checkup, the doctor would give me the usual strong injection of some steroid medicine to open up my lungs, and render me useless for about 15 minutes or until the nervousness in my body would subside. It was at this point that I had made up my mind NOT to let this disease take over my life as it did my father's. I saw how badly his health deteriorated as his asthma got worse and I knew I wasn't going to be it's NEXT VICTIM! So I did a little research and found this book, called \\"Prescriptions for Nutritional Healing\\" and the rest is as they say, history as well as my asthma. I no longer have to worry about allergies either which is a common fear for asthmatics. Whenever certain times of the year such as when the pollen count is high, or if there are cats in area, whether they are there or not, EITHER OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD TRIGGER AN ASTHMA ATTACK. You cannot imagine how frustrating it is to go to a friend's home and because they may have a pet cat, you would have to cut your visit short or risk getting an attack. Let's not forget other asthma triggering products such as sodas like Pepsi and honestly most sodas in general. Pepsi was the one that did it for me to trigger some asthma symtoms because it is LOADED with sugar, more than Coca-Cola! Another drink that I had to be carefull of was orange juice, ESPECIALLY the ones that contained pulp! For some reason, besides the sugar content, the pulp made me get asthma symtoms as well. Thanks to this book though, I can drink orange juice now, as much as I want, but I still stay away from the one that contains the pulp. That is why this book is SOOOooo important for any asthma sufferers out there who are looking for a cure. Sure, there are many books out there, such as kevin trudeau's book that says the government won't let you know about such cures. This book to put it mildly, was a load of Bull menure! (Heavy on the menure!) I have gone on too long about my former condition and I apologize. This book has many other excellent remedies which I can honestly say, may be the cures for whatever it is that ails you or someone you love. It even gives you information on other deadly diseases such as Alzeimer's disease as well as some forms of cancers. I know in my heart, that if I had discovered this book years earlier, my father, who I miss immensely, would probably still be alive today. I urge anyone who has an illness such as the one I had or worse, to buy this book. Read it's remedies and USE THEM FAITHFULLY and don't be afraid. Taking them just once or twice a week WILL NOT WORK so you MUST FOLLOW the books directions. You've followed the doctor's directions for his medicines without hesitation, now follow this book's directions. It will not only make you or your loved one healthier, it may just save you or your loved one's life.

Given the right food and nourishment from the same environment of which the human being is a part, there's really no need for synthetic medicine, drugs with harmful side-effects or the overwhelming array of steroid laden, high-tech treatments which modern man is forever introducing. It makes no sense that the master plan of our existence would have been incomplete all these millions of years desperately awaiting the arrival of some magic green pill to make it right.

Often medical books or doctors only treat you with a pill and send you on your way. This book will give you a list of things you can do from diet to vitamins to \\"mom's old rememdy\\" to do's and don't. When you are sick I think it is worth trying everything, don't you think? For instance, I have dry eye and this book goes on to say get a humidifier, limit use of hair dryers, take primrose oil capsules, and take Vit. A for deficiency, check for auto-immune disorders, wear wraparound glasses, avoid products that \\"get the red out\\", etc., etc.. What doctor tells you all that, unless you have a really good doctor. They just give you eye drops and send you on your way. Get this book... you may not take all their suggestions, since they have huge lists that extends to what to eat and not eat which often seems extreme, but you might as well do all you can from their recommendations to feel better.

Especially if you have been disappointed with your Dr. This book is jam-packed with good stuff. Its divided into 3 parts. The first part is a basic overview on being healthy, and describes the different vitamins, minerals, herbs and other nutrients. Part two is the biggest part, and that is the various disorders. It starts out with a section on what your symptoms could be of. Each disorder has an explanation, what could be causing it, etc. Then the book lists what nutrients you should be taking, such as vitamins or amino acids or herbs. It also lists any treatments you should be doing, foods you should be eating or avoiding, or precautions. The final part talks about the various treatments, these include everything from massage(it explains the various kinds) to accupuncture to colour therapy.While the book won't replace doctors, its a good book to have for help with any minor complaints or as support during medical treatment for major illness. Its very very thorough, and has helped me out countless times."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"After reading this book from cover to cover, I can say that the information is so comprehensive, filled with information on every possible vitamin, mineral, grain, etc. that you may need to support and enhance your health based on whatever health condition you may be facing, or in my case, just wanting the greatest health possible.This book had a genuine impact on my life. After reading it, there is not a chance that I will consume anything that is not organic. No more sprayed pesticides that are in the soil, that grows the plants, or antibiotic and hormone fed animals that literally destroy our health.No matter what ailment you may have, it is covered in alphabetical order, along with a comprehensive list of what you can take, and what you should avoid, which is very helpful when one vitamin or mineral can counteract another. There are great recommendations, other resources, and this book always suggests that you consult with your health practitioner in addition to the suggestions given. It clearly states that this is not a \\"cure\\" however, I have found that since reading it and implementing the suggestions, I feel a lot more energy, and \`diet' has now become a healthy eating routine, filled with nourishment.The book is something that can only add benefit to your life, and one that you can consult at any time over the years to achieve the greatest health possible.Barbara Rose, author of Stop Being the String Along: A relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"In Prescription for Nutritional Healing, M.D. Balch tackles most illnesses with a description of the illness from a medical standpoint and then explains in an easy-to-read method how to treat it with decidedly non-medical means. Herbs like echinacea for colds and as a natural antibiotic, and supplements like zinc gluconate for colds and sinus infections are just some of the remedies the book mentions. But obscure illnesses many of us might suffer from, like &quot;acidosis&quot; and little known forms of thyroid disease, plus discussion of depression and other mental illness also are described, with supplements to help sufferers of these. Since reading this book, echinacea extract can always be found in my kitchen, as can vitamin C, zinc gluconate lozenges and garlic pills. Garlic also is described as a natural antibiotic as well as having cholesterol-lowering abilities. Whether or not readers believe these supplements can do what he says they can (so many media and other reviews have conflicting info), I'm convinced. I always have had allergies turn into sinus infections, and just a few doses of echinacea extract stops it, as do zinc lozenges. When I've gotten a full-blown sinus infection, in which I've in past years had to go on antibiotics to cure, echinacea and zinc lozenges have gotten me through with no drugs. Anyone with questions about supplements and herbs and all the hype should buy this book and take some of the doc's advice. Make up your own mind.

Then follows part 2, which lists out various body problems in alphabetical order and gives an explanation of the illness, suggestions as to which herbs, vitamins etc to take and how they will help, followed by general giodelines about nutrition, possible causes, etc. Part 3 contains various methods used to bring good healthy, such as fasting, colonics, etc.I suggest this book to anyone.

It is very useful for minor ailments for which one would not want to see a doctor, or for chronic conditions such as endometriosis or chronic fatigue syndrome, which traditional medical practitioners are unable to easily cure.I can highly recommend this one to anyone who takes supplements and wants more information on how to heal the body with natural remedies."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"When I have no information on a certain ailment, then this book is the first place I go to.

The doctors shrugged and told him it was old age. The caregivers at his facility began a food regimen that came from this book. (They did not discontinue his only medical prescription, which was for high blood pressure.) Two months later, he has stopped losing weight and is able to get out of bed and eat at the table. He enjoys the food he eats, has gone off daily laxatives, and can sit up by himself for longer and longer periods of time.

Perhaps the 870 packed full pages could be cut into two volumes. But as for the real review, this book and its author(s) have somehow managed to keep pace with the changing times. I had the first book way back in the mid to late 80's and it was remarkably well done and help me and my family immensely. This book is just a bigger volume, meaning it is up to date. As before, it is well organized, easy to read and understand, and very educational. I'm glad I got it.

This publication shows clearly the tremendous advances in the health industry in the last twenty, ten and even five years. The Balch's are to be commended, and the ailing public stands to benefit. Very well written and organized.As a complement to Prescription for Nutritional Healing, I highly recommend Dr. Ralph Golan's Optimal Wellness. Optimal Wellness has one advantage: while remaining very much an &quot;alternative health book,&quot; Dr. Golan shows a little more of a medical background and leaning than do the Balchs. For instance, he clearly admits that normally the most effective treatment for hypothyroidism is prescription thyroid. Likewise he often recommends prescription cortisone (in low, sub-pharmaceutical doses) to assist those with hypoglycemia and adrenal exhaustion. This is brilliant thinking, and shows a bias not toward one branch of healing or the other, but toward getting the patient much needed relief.This is not to take away from the value of Prescription for Nutritional Healing. It is an excellent book and deserves, unquestionably, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"On a scale of 1-10, this is a 55! Belongs in every home library, right there next to the Merck Manual. Common diseases/symptoms are clearly explained and linked to possible nutritional deficiencies. For beer lovers like me, this book is a God-send. Its recommendations cured the numbness in my hands, decreased the age-spots on my skin and strengthened my hair and nails. Although I'm fortunate to have a doctor in my house, I've noticed that nutritional healing is lost on them (credits in Nutrition were not required in medical school). Use this book to learn about nutrients, examine your own diet, and be your own doctor with dietary changes and supplements. Your body will thank you."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"First day I owned this book I noticed under &quot;Honey&quot; (page 73) the claim that honey was 35% protein! Are the authors insane? Honey contains no protein whatsover. It is sugar, has always been sugar and will always be sugar. (Look at the label on any honey you have ever purchased). With misinfomation like this on such basic elements as honey I shudder to think of the other bad advice I'll find beyond."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"My only qualm about this well-organized book is that the authors do not seem to state anywhere that they are not paid anything and do not receive any substantial gifts from the supplement companies recommended in the book. At least I couldn't find any such statement. If the authors are not paid or gifted by the supplement companies recommended by the book, that fact should be explicitly stated in the introduction or somewhere prominent, so readers can be sure there is no conflict of interest involved in the recommendations the authors make."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This book is a great book to get information on physical problems and what you can do for your ailments. There are lots of suggestions. You don't need to use them all. Everything doesn't work for everyone. People know their own body and have learned what works for them and what doesn't. To get information on what psychological problems you are having which is manifesting in the physical, get Louise L. Hay's book Heal Your Body.

The information is presented in a simple enough format for laypeople, but in enough detail for health care practitioners. A very good reference for anyone intersted in natural health.It is important to realize that nutrition is very individualized. Many recommendations are presented, however each person must have a nutrition plan tailored to their own needs."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"Years ago there was Dr. Carlton Fredericks on WOR radio in New York. He was anti -establishment then. A lot of what he said over 15 years ago is first coming out today. Every household should have this book. It's a wonderfuful book about common sense ways to deal or help prevent almost any physical problem. Most of the stuff I have known about for over 15 years however the book has updated the science of natural medicine as I like to call it.To give you an idea where I come from I once broke my finger in 1978 the Dr. said it would take 3-4weeks to heal, however 9 days later it was perfectly healed. I read everything I could get my hands on for broken bones and formulated a broken bone diet, The Dr, was astounded. This book deals with over 300 problems of health that people can use and help themselves achieve optimum health for the rest of their lives. And that's the truth."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"The book's biggest weakness is that it has no list of references. So you can either take its health claims on faith or get on the Internet and start searching MEDLINE yourself. In that case, this book will work as a point of departure for doing your own research."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I have purchased every edition of this book since it first came out as a much slimmer volume.The problem is, everyone thinks they should take all the vitamins, minerals and herbs explained in the book to get better. I suspect the title, \\"Prescription...\\" is the catch, as Americans especially believe in prescriptions for quick fixes. I agree with Byrnes' review up to a point. He suggests we should go to a therapist such as himself to REALLY learn what we should and shouldn't take. I know several dozen alternative \\"therapists\\" who believe they know the answers, most of them believe they were thoroughly educated in massage school or through reflexology certifications. No doubt they know more than the average layman, but most know just about nothing. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels a little better being educated about the many aspects of disease and cures that we hear about, and caution them to use it only as an educational tool and a basic resource. For optimal education, add this to your collection of Andrew Weil, Louise Hay, Rayna Gangi, and Deepak Chopra. Only then will you be able to discern and find the appropriate therapist."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"We bought this book looking for a natural way to treat a problem all four members of our family have, a late-afternoon slump we've been told is probably hypoglycemia. We took the book with us to the health food store and started to load up on just the supplements that it lists as &quot;very important&quot; and &quot;important.&quot;A 15-day supply of supplements for the four of us cost $454.69, including tax. And this was shopping at a discount place. Even worse, none of us felt all that much better after trying them for a couple of weeks--although to be fair, at least we parents may have been stressed out by the dent to our budget.Somehow it isn't surprising that one of the authors of this book runs her own health food store.We didn't give up on the idea of using a natural approach, however, and we found a more effective--and much, much less expensive ($38.07 a week for the family)--way to deal with our problem naturally in Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine by Michael Murray and Joseph Pizzorno."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"If you can get past the the fact the we should all stop drinking/eating coffee, diet drinks, sugar, salt, smoking, yada, yada, yada--which this great reference book relentlessly hammers home (not that I heed it)--there is STILL some great advice and insights on vitamins and supplements to take as well as general health tips.Nobody in their right mind can take them all (their recommended vitamins, minerals, supplements). But if you pick and choose, the general advice is great and has definitely helped me in many health areas.Guess that's why I just bought the latest (4th) edition of the invaluable reference book. Many doctors are too quick to prescribe a medication. This book gives you holistic alternatives, many of which work. Trust me."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I just ordered my 4th copy.

I've been using Balch's books as reference guides since the 90's. This is an excellent resource that details 99% of all the supplements (herbs, vitamins, minerals)-- their uses and the symptoms you might experience if you are deficient. Most importantly, how do they all interact with eachother, what amounts are most beneficial, and what do you need to take with what. The herbariums and supplement stores around use this book as a reference themselves!

Our people have used this book (the previous version) for years to help understand issues regarding health and nutrition. This new version is just as valuable as the previous version. It's one of the vital resources we use daily. I especially like how part of the book is devoted to ingredients (grouped by type, like herbs, etc) and all the things they do, while the other part focuses on health problems themselves. It's easy to understand, seems thoroughly researched, and is fun to read.

Yet pharmaceutical drugs -- whose side effects are often harmful, and can be fatal -- are what the orthodox medical establishment prescribes for most modern ailments. But such drugs are only rarely necessary. As this book points out, the vast majority of modern ailments can be prevented and cured with a healthy lifestyle combined with appropriate vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. As an 80 year old man in good health who takes vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients, I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This invaluable resource is not just for the over the top \\"I won't go near western medicine raw foods only vegan\\" types.

It is easy to use as an encyclopedia. Just look up what bothers you and learn a little about the topic. Each ailment comes with a brief discussion; including discussion on herbs, vitamins, food, etc, that will assist in healing and treatment.

You don't have to be medically trained to recognize your symptoms of a headache and to take an aspirin for relief. The same for the ailments that you experience in your journey through life. Not only will this book help you possibly pinpoint your issues, but will also give you information that will help you have a better understanding as to what is happening to your body, suggestions of how to safely combat those issues and, if necessary, to have an intelligent conversation with your doctor. I can assure you that your doctor will NOT be a fountain of information; only to diagnose and prescribe pharmaceuticals to treat.....notice, I didn't say 'cure'.... [IMHO]pharmaceuticals don't cure, they just make you a dependant junkie for life; pharmaceuticals disguise your discomfort for time, then it's time to administer the pharmaceutical once again, then again, then again.... If ever, or whatever, reactions you may experience with Vitamins/Minerals/Herbs, they won't be as catastrophic as the Pharmaceuticals....."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This is one of the best gifts I have ever received! I have had rheumatoid arthritis since I was 2 yrs. old, I am now 45. As I age, my flare ups have become more frequent. The very toxic prescription drugs for this condition only quiet the symptoms and wreak havoc on other parts of the body and immune system. I decided to quit the prescription drug therapy, change my diet, and use some of the recommended supplements for arthritis in this book. It has taken several months, but I am in remission again and drug free! The authors' research and knowledge are outstanding!

It is very informative and helps one to live a long and productive life. I have the original and the updated volume, I use both, depending on the subject matter. I did not give it five stars since I like a little more of an 'Asian' flair to my health remedies.

I have had a copy of the second edition for years and refer to it regularly on many subjects. What I really appreciate about this book is:1. It is comprehensive and lists many different drug-free remedies for various disorders and health conditions including vitamins, minerals, herbs, food supplements, exercise and meditation.2. It is realistic about the role of herbs in healing. Unlike other materials and books it does not advocate the exclusive usage of herbs for healing or view herbs as a &quot;cure-all.&quot; It is also quite honest and very straightforward about the dangers of some herb usage (for example, the regular use of licorice root, which has been determined to cause a sudden and unexpected rise in the blood pressure of some individuals.)3. The book lists diseases, illnesses and disorders in alphabetical order (along with recommended treatment) for quick reference. There are other chapters which specifically explore vitamins, minerals, herbs, the role of food supplements, nutrition and good water.A copy of &quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing&quot;, now in its third edition, is highly recommended for every household."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"Alot of health books treat the beginner to a healthy life as though they know the basics for nutrition.

Also this book provides great information on supplements and their uses."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I was suffering from a lack of energy and enthusiasm. I had heard about Chronic Fatigue but everytime I asked my doctor about it, he just told me to get more exercise. Exercise! I couldn't even get the energy to get up in the morning. After a friend showed me this book, I started taking the vitamins, minerals and herbs it recommended. Within the first two days I had 100% more energy; and within a few weeks I'm ready to start exercising again. Also, when I described to my doctor other symptoms for other problems, he recommended fresh fruits and veggies. After reading the book topic, what he recommended was the exact opposite of the book. I tried the book's remedy, and it worked! I bought my own copy of the book. Instead of going to my doctor, my medical co-payment would have payed for the book. I'll read it first from now on."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This book is very helpful, but it would be fantastic if it were on CD where it could be searched for key words.

I have the 4th edition, and was hoping to find new information on tryptophan. Nope, same mistakes as the previous edition, and same dated material regarding it still being banned in the US. This book comes from the estate of Phyllis, and I suppose that explains why the info is incorrect about the tyrptophan - tryptophan is currently available at most vitamin shops."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I have been using this book since the early 90's (earlier editions) and always upgrade to the new ones when they come out. Why? It is a fantastic guide to start you on your way to good health. I started using this to heal my chronic bronchitis in the 90's after bad reactions to worthless drugs given me. With no health insurance, your options are limited in traditional medicine, so turning to this book is a Godsend for me! However, as another commenter stated, do full research on all the \\"prescriptions\\" given in the book. If you are taking prescription drugs, you MUST check with a pharmacist to be sure there is no bad interactions. While this is the first book I turn to, I also check several other books in my library and a few online resources to make sure I get updated information."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I just purchased the 4th edition of the book. I am not a medical professional. I have a BA in business.I plan to use this book as a jumping off point for more research on how to stay healthy using as few prescription pharmaceutical products as possible.Having been in the pharma industry for the last 18 years I have a birdseye view into the front and back office of medical care. While doctors are certainly well trained and dedicated to helping you when ill, I need to be comfortable with any treatment being recommended for me. This book gives me additoinal non prescription INSIGHT. I would never take info from this book and run out and start implementing it without additional input.HOW I THINK THIS BOOK CAN BE USED SAFELY AND SUCCESSFULLY.NO INSURANCE: In a time where many do not have healthcare insurance, I feel you can use this as a jumping off point for additional research. Go to the library and do some additional internet browsing to support or refute what the book is saying. This book is not to be used in a critical care or acute illness situations. Example: chest pain, BROKEN anything, fevers (adults and children), dizziness etc need immediate treatment.If you don't have insurance and can only see a doctor occassionally, use this book to bring up alternatives to medicines perhaps you can't afford. I have been without insurance and we have children. In that situation, we would go to the doc for the children only. To that end, I would NEVER use information straight from this book on my kids.BETTER DOCTOR VISITS: When you do get a chance to visit the doctor you can come armed with your info from the book and other sources to get better care from your doctor. After your acute situation has been treated perhaps some information from this book can be substituted for prescriptions. But you still have to be willing to exercise and eat better. This book is not the natural version of a cure all.PHARMACEUTICALS: I find many people want to be healthy AFTER the doctor wants to prescrbe medicine. Example: When your blood pressure is 150/110, beets are not going to lower it fast enough and you need prescription drugs. Now, once the blood pressure is down you can then talk with your doctor about alternative ways to keep your blood pressure low. In the short term, drugs are not the enemy but are your friend in reducing the amount of permanent damage the high blood pressure is causing.I do recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I have used this book for years (I have a copy of the first edition) to manage my nutritional health.

It's a great resource guide to nutritional healing. Her organization and presentation of the material is so easy to read. In part one she offers the basic building blocks of health, (nutrition, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, engymes, herbs, natural foods, etc.) In the second part of her book, she lists a fairly complete listing of the disorders with descriptions of each and the remedies and therapies, and in the last part of her book she summarizes various other alternative therapies (like aryuvedic medicine, the use of music and sound, blood purification, color therapy, the use of crystals, the use of magnets, exercise, yoga, and hormonal treatments, and she also includes a nice listing of pain management alternatives. I love the no-nonsense, quick reference organizational quality and especially how informative it is for a lay person and how she sometimes offers not just one or two modalities of remedies or therapies, but several. She also indicates her favorite, good quality products that one can purchase at most quality health food stores. While there are some products that will need to be ordered online or directly from the company, her suggestions are rich and varied and one is bound to find what one needs.There's also a nice quick reference section towards the front of the book around/approximately page 70-110 that list various herbs and their uses. Although, I'd like to see this section much expanded to include more of the listed herbs' uses, but also to include many more herbs listed as well, along with any 'warnings' on all the herbs too.She has a nice glossary at the back, plus generous listings of product mfg and distributors, medical and health organizations, and a strong index.I'd like to see her ad more illnesses and disorders and go into greater depth on some of the ones that she lists that are currently somewhat abbreviated. I'd like to see an even stronger glossary, and for the index to be updated.Nevertheless, this is a great book to have, whether one is just learning or is an informed reader about natural and alternative remedies.

So much information A to Z on diseases and the separate sections on vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other alternatives helps provide a possible guideline of choices to research when dealing with my family or friends health issues. Good information for nearly every ailment and truly my favorite human reference book because it has so much great information. I'll still read up on things in other books and online, but this is my first \\"go to\\" reference book.Their recommendations for Alzheimer's helps greatly. Try to keep those with dementia and Alzheimer's off the traditional drugs, as it just causes them to decline much more quickly - we tried one of the dementia drugs for 4-5 weeks in Jan. 2009 on my grandmother with dementia who was 96 years old then. Her appetite had declined severely so she lost weight, was constipated, and when I visited her one day - she was eating her cats food and calling the cat a window! That's when I picked up my Prescription for Nutritional Healing book and started photocopying pages and a nutritional program for her caregivers to administer and stopped the drug and found her a new physician that practiced natural and conventional medicine that I liked!Started her on this program when she turned 97 in March 2009 that consisted of 3x/week injectible methylcobalamine form of B12 instead of the cheaper form most commonly used, as indicated in their book, B-Complex injections, along with numerous other vitamin and mineral supplements and some cleanses: kidney (she was starting to have incontinence issues), blood, liver, and lymphatic system. Stopped ALL flu, pneumonia, and other vaccinations that she'd been getting until I became her health care power of attorney Oct 2008. She improved greatly - remembering people's names (including mine, which she hadn't remembered in over a year), how to drive home, and her communication skills got infinitely better. Very thankful for this info in the Balch's book. She'll be 100 this March 2013 and still gets her B12 and B-Complex shots once/week, vitamins, minerals, no drugs and is doing pretty darn well!Nov-Dec 2012, she was put on 5 mg. of Ambien to help her sleep. Seemed only to keep her awake most of the night terrorizing her caregivers, made her constipated, lowered her appetite (likely due to the constipation) and her mental health horribly declined and she only spoke when she was mad. I had her 24/7 caregiver ask her physician about Hyland's homeopathic remedies to replace the Ambien. He agreed and reminded her caregiver that traditional drugs will kill her more quickly. We put her on Hyland's Calms Forte and Nerve Tonic before bed instead of the Ambien and she immediately went back to her old happy, talkative, feisty self, cleaning all the food on her plate 3x/day, no longer constipated, and sleeping like a baby through the night! All the nurses noticed the difference in her when she came in for her weekly B injections, saying Merry Christmas to everyone, smiling, etc! Such a night and day difference in her from just removing that half tablet of Ambien at night!This is a great book, IMO. Every home that uses or is considering the use of natural healing remedies should own it!"},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I like the intelligent writing.

Since I am personally a great believer in herbal medicine, this book was of particular interest to me. However, like any medication, one must be cautious of what herbs they are using and how they may interact with each other.While there are many positive sides to the book, there are also negative aspects of the book; mainly, it is &quot;information overload.&quot; It is certainly not a book you would pick up and spend hours reading in one session, but I do not believe that was ever the intent of the authors. From sports nutrition, cancer and heart disease risk factors, filtered versus non-filtered water, the list of topics goes on and on, particularly when it comes to various diseases. While the book is certainly factual, I did give it a four star rating because in some respects, it was just &quot;too much of a good thing.&quot; Some components made for very dry reading, and others could have been cross-referenced in a better manner. I must admit, there were one or two sections that I skipped entirely; the book just seemed to go on and on.

This book goes into detail and discussions about all of the specific minerals and vitamins that yor body needs to survive. It also has great information about supplements. It also explains the RDA, RDI and ODI figures in excellent detail as well. After reading this book you will be able to actually map out your own vitamin, mineral and supplement program.

If the book merely made the viable and credible claim that diet might improve health or reduce disease (not an uncontroversial claim, btw), one would have agree: It cannot hurt. But the book makes a preposterous leap that defies credibility: That the ingestion of certain foods heals. Nutritional deficiencies, yes; otherwise, no.A closer examination, however, suggests just how implausible, and entirely improbable, these \\"cures\\" are. Focusing on only one claim, which then can be extrapolated to all the other claims, considier their \\"cures\\" for depression, both of which \\"borrow\\" from psychiatry's actual science. Various biochemical depressions involve the neurotransmitters (hormones) dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Let's look at the last two, which are identical, except for the neurotransmitter targeted.According to the Balches, 5-HTP, a precursor to the hormone-neurotransmitter serotonin, is ingested, and depression flees. Or, if you subscribe to the norepinephrine basis of depression, just ingest more norepinephrine. (The problem with the latter is that the FDA restricts its use to critically-ill patients only.) So, circumventing the FDA, consume tyrosine, since the neurotransmitter norepinephrine is synthesized by a series of enzymatic steps in the adrenal medulla from the amino acid tyrosine. In other words, ingest the \\"natural\\" precursor or amino acid that might become the desired neurotransmitter, the same neurotransmitters that drugs like Prosac, Paxil, Effextor, etc. target, and the individual gets the same relief \\"naturally\\" without having to buy the prescription. (Note: The \\"natural \\" neurotransmitter norepinephrine is available by prescription for critically-ill patients as a vasopressor. If \\"ingestion\\" of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine itself affected depression, why don't physicians simply give patients Levophed, norepinephrine in its purest form?) This question is significant, because it goes to the whole theses presented by the Balches.Anyone with a simulacrum of intelligence knows that simply \\"ingesting\\" an ingredient is not how the effect is achieved. In chemistry, every action has an equal reaction. But the mere increase or presence of a substance is not in itself suggestive of anything. Besides, one of the first chemical reactions of \\"ingestion\\" occurs in metabolism, which can alter the substance signficantly. If depression (or any medical situation) was treated by ingesting substances that putatively increases the presence of a substance (here, neurotransmitters), medicine would have thousands of cures more than it does now. But that is precisely how it does not work.Prescription antidepressants SNRI and SSRI act as \\"reuptake inhibitors,\\" which through their inhibitory action, provoke the brain to increase production of the neurotransmitter in question, which act synergistically - and only in the brain - to have an effect on the nerve impulse as it leaves the dendrite, crosses the synaptic cleft, and reaches the axon on the other side. This dynamic is localized entirely within the neurons of the brain, solely at the synaptic cleft, by what can only be described as an \\"indirect\\" route. The drugs do not inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitters in the peripheral nervous system, but only at certain brain sites, and it is the stimulus-response mechanism that produces the effect which itself is the subsequent stimulus for the next response. Ingesting directly, or substances that metabolize indirectly, into the neurotransmitter will not have the intended effect, and in the case of Levophed (norepinephrine), could be letha.It parallels antibiotics; antibiotics don't heal or attack the pathogen. They cause the body to react to the antibiotic \\"as if\\" it is a pathogen, and the chimera pathogen (the drug) simply produces increased antibodies, that in turn fight the infection. One doesn't ingest or increase white blood cells, or add more lymphatic juices to the diet, that themselves fight the infection. The antibiotic works as a \\"surrogate\\" pathogen, which provokes the body to respond to a \\"chimera pathogen,\\" and this response results in increased white blood cells and the lymph glands that do the actual work, not the antibiotic itself.Again, nutritional deficiencies cause disease. Other diseases, like diabetes, can use nutrional strategies to adapt. But basic foodstuffs -- proteins (nucleic acids), lipids (fats), and carbohydrates -- \\"heal\\" only hunger and malnutrition. It is incoherent to believe that the ingestion of certain foods can \\"heal\\" anything. Compensate for other disorders, definitely. But foods as the primary cause of disease (except for deficiency and malnutrition), and foods as \\"cures\\" of disease is so contrary to elementary knowledge of physiology, pathogenesis, and commonsense."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"the book was listed as new, it was not what i expected.

I stumbled by accident upon this book and have slowly been making my way through it (It's 869 pages!).I view the book as a 'starter' for many conditions, rather than one that has definitive and detailed advice or recommendations. That's not a bad thing, but it means the reader will need to do a bit more research on some of the supplements/herbs/treatments that are recommended. As an example, the author frequently suggests Colloidal Silver (for everything from ear infections to rattlesnake bites). If you look this up online, however, there is a HUGE split between the traditional and non-traditional health/medical communities as to whether this is safe to use. Granted, this isn't uncommon, but it's particularly prounonced with this supplement.Anyhow, the book is well-organized and covers a lot of topics. If you have a certain condition and have looked into common causes and treatments, this book probably won't tell you more than you already know. But if you're looking for a good overview of how to treat a whole variety of conditions, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I have an older edition of the Prescription for Nutritional Healing Book for years and it is such a life saver for me.

And while there are drugs now for even the flu, I find it far more comforting to turn to more natural remedies for these ailments, that will strengthen our bodies so that we can resist illness.This book is heavy and big, but author Phyllis Balch has tried to cover every illness out there.

Hospital. I was a widowed mother with three children in college & high school. My health was great, I loved my career and the security it gave us and my life revolved around my career and children. I worked circles around younger nurses, when I SUDDENLY became so exhausted that I couldn't push myself out of a chair. My doctor & friend, ran tests that revealed Acute Hepatitis B. Long story short, after 3 months - I remained bed ridden and my liver specialist gave me 1 to 2 month life expectancy. My life and my childrens lives had turned upside down. Out of desparation, (the medical field could not help me as the acute hepatitis became chronic), my oldest daughter bought this book. She bought all the vit., mineral, dietary supplements, etc. listed under \\"esential\\" and \\"very important\\" and started force feeding me. I felt like I was being tortured these last days of my life as I already battled nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and a type of exhaustion beyond explaination. It took all my concentration to force an eyelid open or to ask my tongue to move in order to speak. I knew she and the book were nuts but I saw the desparation in her eyes as she would beg me to swallow the beet juice, alevea juice or some capsule. Never-the-less, she continued to insist, three weeks later - I was out of the bed. Three months later I was able to work one night a week and soon a full week. 13 years later - the good news - I am health, happy, active and alive. The bad news - the Acute Hepatitis B became chronic, (which happens in a low % of cases and though I FELT like I overcame the disease, my doctor says the liver is still being destroyed. I truely believe this book saved my life. I have 30 years in the health field as a nurse, and a teacher but this is the book I most frequently use for information. It lists diseases and disorders from \\"Acme\\" to serious diseases like \\"Cancer\\". They are listed in alphebetical order, making them fast to find. First a very accurate describtion of the disease is given. Then a simple and consice list of things to use. I have bought copies for friends and families and lent my copies to many. Happy ending: Shortly after my close to death experience, I changed jobs, for fewer hours, leaving time for more activities: hiking, biking, swiming, working out, learned ballroom dancing, and I continued the recommended changes in nutritional eating. I met a wonderful man, we married, and I kept cutting back my work hours till I reluctantly retired from my wonderful position at the hospital last year because our travels, projects, hobbies and activities just didn't leave me time to work. We share an absultely fantastic lifestyle. My health is very dependent on how I eat and drink - even now. I have learned to really \\"listen\\" to my body and I can enjoy perfect health if I avoid the foods and drinks that do not leave me feeling well. Pepsi, fats in moderation and sugars are my challenge. I gave out my last copy of this book and am buying another because I fractured my ankle while hiking near our home in Southern Baja, Mexico, last week. Again, I will do EVERYTHING Dr. Balch and Phyllis Balch reccommends and heal rapidly."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"This is an excellent book in that it contains, in one place, an enormous amount of information about supplements and their use in treating various medical conditions. It also goes through all of the vitamins and minerals, amino acids, digestive enzymes, herbs, etc., explaining their function.But do your own homework after consulting this book. Under AIDS, St. John's Wort is noted as containing \\"two substances, hypericin and pseudohypericin, that inhibit retroviral infections and could be useful in the treatment of AIDS.\\" This is bad advice, because one of the most widely known herbal/drug interactions--and widely known since about 1997--is that St. John's Wort and protease inhibitors don't mix. This might actually be THE most widely known and infamous interaction. If you're a person living with HIV/AIDS, and you're taking a protease inhibitor, you should not take St. John's Wort UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. It is proven fact that St. John's Wort decreases the levels of the PIs in your blood, making them less effective. Meaning that if you have AIDS, are taking a protease inhibitor and St. John's Wort, you could very well be shortening your life expectancy. This is serious stuff, and not to be taken lightly.Glutathione is also mentioned throughout this book. When introduced, the book does say that \\"the effectiveness of oral formulas [of glutathione] is questionable. To raise glutathione levels, it is better to supply the body with the raw materials it uses to make this compound: cysteine, glutamic acid...glycine...and N-acetylcysteine\\". But when this is recommended for use in \\"The Disorders\\" section of the book, little mention is made of the ineffectiveness of oral glutathione, and indeed recommends specific amounts of glutathione one should take.Let me be clearer than this book has been: oral glutathione is worthless. If you're using it, you're not getting any benefit, and the companies that sell oral glutathione know this well. It's frustrating to see reputable companies produce a product just to make money when they know *for a fact* that it has zero benefit. If they really wanted to make money, they should instead put sugar pills in the glutathione bottles. That would be cost-effective! Interestingly enough, my partner is in pharmacy school and they just had a lecture on glutathione yesterday. I won't try to translate the medical techy stuff, but the gist of it is this: it won't be absorbed by the cells.So why does this book recommend glutathione (by itself, with no disclaimer) throughout? That's a good question, and I'd love to know the answer.Still, the book has its uses. As I noted, nowhere else will you find such a wealth of information in one place, and so easily accessible and understood. Just be prepared to do your homework."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I am amazed at the information available in this book. I have given copies to anyone interested in learning how to improve their overall health and well-being. This is my \\"Go to\\" book. I highly recommend this book to anyone truely interested in making positive changes in their life."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"\\"Prescription For Nutritional Healing\\" is perhaps the most condensed dictionary of practical alternative medicine available. The book contains so much information that it actually boggles the mind it can fit into one book. The book starts out with a large section entitled \\"Elements of Health.\\" In this section, the Balch team discusses vitamins, amino acids, enzymes, herbs, natural food supplements and their history and uses. There is a helpful herb chart that lists the herb, the effective parts of the herb, most of its phytonutrients, its uses, and comments such as toxicity. This section is a primer for those who want to know a little bit about the nutrients they will be taking.The next section, which makes up the bulk of the book, is the \\"Disorders\\" section. It goes from Abscesses to Yeast Infections, covering a host of common and rare disorders in between. For each disorder, a treatment plan is outlined by name and dose, and nutrients are grouped according to how helpful they are in treating each disorder. For instance, with regard to the common cold, Zinc lozenges are listed as \\"essential,\\" while Olive Leaf extract is only listed as \\"helpful\\" (mind you, I disagree with their evaluation of olive leaf). Then they list effective herbs, followed by \\"recommendations.\\" These recommendations are often common sense suggestions and additional useful information written in an easy to understand manner. Finally, there is a \\"consideration\\" section for each disease. Here the authors report on recent research and possible other helpful ideas. Many charts and tables are dispersed throughout the disease section, such as poison control center numbers, STD symptoms, pregnancy tests, and nutrient robbing chemicals and foods.The book ends with a brief description of therapies, a glossary of terms, and a list of supplement manufacturers. Overall this is an extremely useful book, which lists virtually every alternative therapy that has been found effective in clinical and controlled studies. Some of the recommendations are based on shaky evidence, and sometimes the authors confuse certain facts (for instance they suggest cancer patients eat almonds because of their laetrile content, but sweet almonds contain no laetrile; only bitter almonds do) but nonetheless, most of their claims are backed by competent studies.The third edition came out very soon after the second edition. This demonstrates how fast research into alternative therapies is moving. Also, the third edition integrates a lot of mainstream medicine into its pages, making it extremely helpful and useful to those who might only dabble with alternative medicine on occasion. I bought the first edition in the early 1990s, and whenever I have a basic question or get sick, I usually go to this book first. I am not a doctor, and obviously nobody should forsake his or her doctor and simply follow the suggestions in this book! Kudos to the Balch team for setting the standard and keeping up with recent research!"},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"Look at all the &quot;5 Star&quot; reviews... that says it all.

It has proven to be of great help to me in some cases, others, not as much. So, let it be known that I do value this book, I do appreciate the work put into collecting this data and making it available to the general public, and the idea of empowering people to make smart choices about their health. I have utilized some of the information in this book myself.But I do have criticisms. I will focus more heavily on those than on the positives because the positives are mostly covered in others reviews, but remember, I am giving this 4 stars, not 2.Someone pointed out that my criticisms were more geared toward the earlier edition, but I looked over the newest one and still found examples of what I was talking about.Some of the upper limits (ULs) for supplements are highly questionable, or whether such high doses or necessary or provide any benefit at all. For example, in some conditions the book calls for 3 doses of Vitamin B-50 a day. 3 doses? I would not do that. You take 3 doses of B-50 a day and you're overdosing on B-6, you're probably overdosing on Folic Acid, and you're getting more B-3 (niacin) than I'm comfortable with. Moreover, riboflavin is reported to have no benefit at doses over 20 mg and doses over that may contribute to cataracts. Excessive riboflavin causes your urine to turn a neon green - that's wasted riboflavin passing through your urine. It's not doing you any good. Now, I'm a huge fan of pantothenic acid, B-12, and biotin, but 150 mg of the rest of the vitamins (or 1200 of Folic Acid) is too much. Every doctor I've talked to agrees. It's simply a wasted mega dose for most people. There's probably cases where it isn't, but I'll allow for that. I can't think of any case possible where you'd need 150 mg of B-6. It's kind of crazy.The worst case of all is the author's love affair with doses of Retinol (Vitamin A) that make me cringe. I've seen him advocate some frighteningly high doses. Go talk to your doctor, and ask him if you need 10,000 IU or more of Retinol a day. He's going to say no. That much Retinol is asking for serious liver problems. It's almost scary he didn't put some kind of larger disclaimer in there, I wouldn't take that much even in this \\"emulsion\\" form he's so quick to tout. 5,000 IU of Retinol a day should be plenty. It's like if you've got 1st degree burns all over your body 5,000 IU of Retinol is going to leave you a mess and 10,000 IU won't. Some of this is oversimplified.Some of the recommended doses of Vitamin C are preposterous. 10,000 mg of Vitamin C a day? I believe for some conditions he advocates even more. Many studies show your body can't use more than 500 mg of Vitamin C at a time. So the authors could do a better job explaining what they mean by divided doses. I could see, for some conditions, taking 500 mg of buffered Vitamin C with some food every 2 waking hours or so for maximum Vitamin C supplementation. But even that is too high for some doctors, one doctor says that anything over 2000 mg of Vitamin C a day produces a kind of toxin that attacks your system. I currently don't have the report handy that states the name of the toxin. 1500-3000 mg of Vitamin C seems to be the recommended amount for maximum Vitamin C supplementation, according to the experts and doctors. 10,000 mg (10 grams!) a day to me seems mind-boggling.Some of the brand names he uses can be substituted, and this is not made clear. Kyolic Garlic is not the only quality garlic formula - the Imperial 6500 sold by Vitamin World and Puritan's Pride is a good value, which may be a nice alternative for people not willing to plunk down (...)for Kyolic's 30 day supply.Lastly, some poor interactions might be better pointed out - the inadvisable situation of combining inorganic iron and Vitamin E, for example.Some of the lists of vitamins and supplements to take are incredibly long - many doctors have expressed concern over the strain on your organs such as kidneys in processing 50 or more supplemental tablets, capsules, etc. a day.My biggest criticism is the sometimes outrageous upper limits on vitamins, as I have stated above. DO OTHER RESEARCH. A LOT OF OTHER RESEARCH. CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR. Don't just just quaffing down 150 mg of B-6 just because the book says so. And be sure you're aware of other supplements you might be taking without knowing it, like fortified cereals or breads. This is why I stop well short of ULs.Just be safe and know what you are doing."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"I've been referencing the PFNH book for so long, I can't remember when I purchased my original one (2nd Edition).

Touted as a \\"self-help approach to good health\\", the PFNH guide offers natural remedies for fever, headaches, common pregnancy woes and more, from \\"abcess\\" to \\"yeast infection\\". PFNH also discusses serious diseases, such as AIDS, cancer, diabetes, heart and kidney disease, and gives advice on remedies and diets that can help aid a person who may be suffering from one of these. But wait- there's more! Includes a table of herbs, their origin, and the maladies they can help relieve, an entire section on color therapy (a fave of mine), chelation therapy, fasting, sitz baths and pain control. The back of the book holds an impressive glossary (to help define ailments that you heard about and never truly understood) and a list of manufacturers and distributors, health and medical hotlines and organizations, and even a list of suggested reading to continue your natural medicine education.

It is comprehensive and lists many different drug-free remedies for various disorders and health conditions including vitamins, minerals, herbs, food supplements, exercise and meditation.2. It is realistic about the role of herbs in healing. Unlike other materials and books it does not advocate the exclusive usage of herbs for healing or view herbs as a &quot;cure-all.&quot; It is also quite honest and very straightforward about the dangers of some herb usage (for example, the regular use of licorice root, which has been determined to cause a sudden and unexpected rise in the blood pressure of some individuals.)3. The book lists diseases, illnesses and disorders in alphabetical order (along with recommended treatment) for quick reference.

I did find easy-to-follow, easy-to-read recommendations, but I won't use them. My confidence in this book is zip. Here's why.If you just read the sections that apply to you--as I did first--you won't notice that the authors' motto could have been one nutrient treats all. For instance, the authors recommend supplemental vitamin B for abscesses, acidosis, acne, adrenal disorders, age spots, aging, AIDS, alcoholism, alkalosis, allergies, Alzheimer's, anemia, anorexia, anxiety, poor appetite, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, asthma, athlete's foot, and autism. For whatever reasons, they skip arsenic poisoning. I didn't thumb through the rest of the book to see if vitamin B shows up on virtually every page as it does for the &quot;A's,&quot; but either vitamin B is a miracle drug or they are just telling us whatever supplement we're already using is fine.Another problem with the book is the lack of references. The fact of the matter is I wouldn't read all the references, maybe just one or two of the references that were a propos of the topic that concerns me. But Balch and Balch don't give any references at all. Is that because we're just supposed to trust them, the author is a doctor, after all, or is that because they made this stuff up?I believe in nutritional healing. I see a naturopath. I take vitamins. I'd go for nutrition before I'd go for any kind of heavy-duty doctor-prescribed drug treatment. But I'll have to use this book for a 600-page doorstop.

Many other nutritional tips have caused me to change my eating habits as well."},{"Title":"Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs & Food Supplements","review":"EVERYBODY should have this book in their library. I mean EVERBODY!!! This is can't-live-without-it reference material. I have Editions 2 and 3 that I've been using for years. When I saw a 4th edition was out, I ordered it immediately and ordered one for a relative who does caregiver-work. She's like a nurse without the degree and seems to know more than some nurses, especially about people who have serious and terminal illnesses.With that said, the book is in 3 sections: 1) Understanding the Elements of Health, 2) The Disorders, and 3) Remedies and Therapies. The primary section is the middle section (#2). In #2 you basically look up a disorder, for example \\"Arthritis\\". The book provides a detailed explanation of it, lists the various types with an explanation of each (e.g. Osteoarthritis), lists nutritional supplements, doseage, and comments, lists beneficial herbs with comments, lists recommendations, and lists considerations. There are about 9 full pages devoted to \\"arthritis\\" alone. The information provided is extensive.I keep this book at work and frequently look up disorders for people so they can read the information to help themselves, friends, and family members. There is a great deal of natural information in this book that doctors just don't usually tell you. Not to suggest for a minute that you hesitiate seeing or ignore a doctor, no way! But I am suggesting that you supplement what he/she tells you with reading in this book. If nothing else, you will leave with a better understanding of your condition and be better prepared to discuss follow up visits with your health care professional. And maybe, you'll find out something nutritional to help with (like eating cherries to help with gout) that the doctor doesn't know about, because he deals with prescription meds not foods.Section 1 provides information on nutrition, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, herbs, drug interactions. Section 3 talks about remedies and therapies, such as Qi Gong, Steam Inhalation, Sitz Bath, Magnet Therapy, Chinese Medicine, Aromatherapy, and so many others.I'm not even remotely kidding when I tell you that if you have any interest at all in your health, you should get this book. I cannot even imagine not having a copy of it handy.

This is not to say that the book is no longer scholarly, France does make generous use of footnotes and refers to the original languages of scripture. But it is more layman friendly than was originally the case.France asserts that Daniel 7:13 was one of the most influential OT scriptures on the thinking of Jesus as he reflected on his message and mission. He also says that Isaiah 53 was a very influential chapter in Jesus' life. With these two passages always in mind, France takes us through the four gospels and shows just how much the Old tesament influenced Christ. Not all of his interpretations will satisy: His reference to Mark 13 as a prediction of the Son of Man coming in a first century judgment on Israel rather than a future second coming of the Lord will not command assent amongst all interpreters. In fact, my gut instinct is that not many will follow France's interpretation of Mark 13 at all.Outside of this lapse, the book was a very strong presentation of Christ's use of the Hebrew Scriptures. Recommended."},{"Title":"Jesus and the Old Testament","review":"\\"I first read this study in its earlier incarnation as a PhD thesis, and have read it again with increasing pleasure in this revised form. In his detailed examination of Jesus' use of the Old Testament, as recorded in the Gospels, Dr. France shows himself a sure-footed expert in criticism and exegesis. He lets us see how crucial Jesus' Old Testament interpretation was to his understanding of his central place in the history of salvation and the accomplishment of God's purpose. In addition to his special concentration on Daniel 7 and Zechariah 9-14, I have been impressed by his defense of the thesis that the fourth Isaianic Servant Song exercised a profound influence in Jesus' thinking about his own service and sacrifice.\\" - From the Forward of F.F. Bruce.At the time of the publication of the first reprint of Jesus and the Old Testament, R.T. France was Principal of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, and a member of the Oxford University Faculty of Theology. ..."},{"Title":"Jesus and the Old Testament","review":"More than anything, this book revealed that my hermeneutical method would be well informed and molded if I patterned it after the only, truly revealed hermeneutic the church has-Jesus' life, teachings, and especially His use of Old Testament Scripture. If one wonders who gave the New Testament writers their hermeneutic principles, who taught them how to use, interpret, and apply Old Testament revelation-it was Jesus. It is pretty academic. But worth it for the serious student of the Word."},{"Title":"Jesus and the Old Testament","review":"Yes, you need this splendid book for your library.'France points out that Jesus \\"applied Old Testament in a way which was quite unparalleled\\" (p 223) and further suggests that if we ignore the way the Old Testament is applied in early Christianity, we cannot understand how the early Christians thought, anymore than we can find the truth of Jesus.Jesus claimed that many passages in the Old Testament were written about him, and that his life would be a completion of various prophecies. For example, in Mark 1:15 \\"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand.\\"Again in Mark 14:62 Jesus combines \\"Daniel 13 with the words 'sitting at the right hand of Power...a clear allusion to Psalm 110:1 'Sit at my right hand'The old covenant with only one group, the Jews, is fulfilled. A new and expanded covenant will include all the peoples of the earth. Again and again, Jesus drew on the prophecies in Daniel.He used those prophecies in startling ways. His use of the 'Son of Man' goes far beyond Second Temple Jews expectations about the title. \\"Jesus used it...as a title with Messianic implications\\" (p 138), a Messiah without the political import hoped for by Jews.Every chapter is rich with insight. For example, France points out that typology is an underused element in New Testament scholarship, although it appears to have been basic to early Christianity, starting with Paul. Or better, starting with Jesus.For example, regarding the Jesus' claims to alter Sabbath rules, the \\"argument from the authority of David to the greater authority of Jesus is best explained by an underlying typology. If David , the type, had the authority to reinterpret the law, Jesus, the greater antitype, must have have that authority in a higher degree\\" (p 47).Typology was not prophecy. Yet seeing elements in the Old Testament as types - types which were fulfilled or completed, or at least very much greater, in the new - proved the truth of early Christian beliefs to Christians.France actually develops too many lines of argument for me to go into all of them. But here are two that should intrigue you: \\"These twelve passages...give the lie to any suggestion that the Old Testament quotations in the Synoptic Gospels are drawn entirely from LXX\\" (p 28) and \\"In no case is it impossible, or even improbable, that Jesus' use of quotations could be based on the MT or some related Semitic text\\" (p 36)."},{"Title":"Jesus and the Old Testament","review":"I like it!

Hello? SOAP works along EDI and Corba. It's a simplified version of both that makes it easier and language/platform independent for those cases that don't need the full functionality of EDI or Corba.2.SELF ASSERTIONS - Well, then there is a quote, where the author blankly asserts that posts are more useful then gets. I'm familiar with the debate about the pros and cons. But, an author just asserting one is better and putting as a reason 'trust me, baby, I'm smart', is just so pretentious.3.ZERO SCOPE: To put it plain from flipping around in the book, I didn't find any good information - very broad but Zero scope; and the authors just disgusted me with their way of writing and assertions.4.INCOMPLETE 1: There is very little to zero coverage on XML RPC when compared to SOAP; but i can understand that it is more out of the point 2 syndrome.5.INCOMPLETE 2: Coverage of automatically generating interface descriptions/ a server implementation to do the same, is surprisingly incompleteOutside of all this, the lack of practical treatment is altogether amiss except for the big cheese example at the back, which in all probabilities fail to summarise the book.This book would have received a bigger readership if all these disparate articles (use of 'articles' in lieu of 'chapters' intended) are pinned up online.

With stops in Miami, Germany, Dallas and the wilds of the Florida Everglades.The action never skips a beat, although your heart may; in several chapters, you'll be on the edge of your chair. Plaisted doesn't fumble with the plot. He has a winning game plan. His characters are so vividly, skillfully and realistically drawn that you'll soon forget its fiction.There's the troubled pro quarterback and his team, the kindly priest, the grizzled sports columnist, the hated team owner, his golddigging wife, her dapper Ivy League boy-toy, enough slimy criminals to fill the county jail on a Saturday night, and the quick-thinking \\"Sky Princess\\" flight attendant.All have their secrets -- and their stories weave together in a twisting, turning plot that will keep you guessing.This is not a book for the high school library or your Great-Auntie Grizelda who thinks TV today is too dirty. Plaisted's characters are a lusty bunch; there are two rapes and innumerable steamy sex scenes. But, the book's main focus is the mystery behind the deaths of the Miami Sharks players.Plaisted pickles the plot with enough red herrings to stuff in a can of sardines. Each suspect could have been the one whodunnit. As the columnist unravels the mystery, the stakes get even higher.Hollywood would love this tale -- it's an airplane disaster movie, a gritty look at steamy South Florida, a crime thriller, a gangster flick, a love story, a sports movie, a murder mystery and a tale of intrique all in one. It could star an ensemble cast of your favorite stars.(Are you listening, George Clooney?).But don't wait for the movie; this is such a good book, you should rush out and read it right away.

His show -- \\"Pete Smythe's General Store\\" -- was a kind of Prairie Home Companion of its day, set in the fictitious town of East Tincup, Colorado, and broadcasting over the \\"bobwire network.\\"Before his radio fame, however, Smythe tried his hand at the dude ranch business, and this book chronicles his efforts to do so. Pete, with a wife and two young kids, bought an old ranch outside the town of Bailey, Colorado, in 1946, and moved the family there from the Denver suburbs. With the help of some very colorful local characters, much effort went in to modernizing the property, building new structures, acquiring and maintaining a stable of horses and marketing to potential guests in an era when a number of supplies -- everything from lumber to sugar -- were in short supply because World War II rationing restrictions were still in place. Bailey was not on the main Colorado tourist grid -- it still isn't, not being near a ski resort; that the ranch enjoyed any success at all is remarkable, and the story makes for a genuinely interesting and often very funny read."},{"Title":"Return to the Same City","review":"Paco Ignacio Taibo's existence-beleaguered private eye continues to roam the streets of Mexico City in search of good sense and moral behavior even after his apparent death. The P.I.'s name, Shayne, plays off the traditional P.I. -- represented by Brett Halliday's character Mike Shayne -- and the lone-outsider-as-hero -- represented by Jack Schaeffer's/Alan Ladd's cowboy Shane. With none of the boisterous control of the former and never quite attaining the quiet dignity of the latter, Taibo's Shayne feels the weight of his Mexico City -- one part Chaos Theory, one part Entropy, one part gritty-greedy-urban-monster -- as it bears down on its inhabitants, who look for fun and hope in every unlikely place. Shayne wants things to be simple and to make sense, but they rarely do in his world, no matter how hard he tries to make it so. World weary, witty, and marvelously funny, I'm glad Shayne came back from the dead. I hope we see more of his adventures in translation."},{"Title":"Return to the Same City","review":"This book will make you laugh and cry . . . but if you are a conservative aging white male you won't appreciate PI Taibo II's extravagant sense of humour."},{"Title":"Return to the Same City","review":"Surreal and funny, this book is full of atmosphere and presence.

Tranlsated from Spanish, \\"Return to the Same City\\" isn't about the physical Mexico City and Acapulco (although it helps to be familiar with their respective politics). Instead, \\"Return to the Same City\\" is about Shayne's reacquaint with himself - his life after his death in 1993's \\"No Happy Ending\\".His first case after some recuperation, Shayne (half-Irish, on his mother's side) investigates a woman's claim that her brother-in-law is involved in some shady business. Under multiple pseudonyms, the criminal makes deals with politicians, government agents, and drug dealers. With the help of an alcoholic American reporter, Shayne follows the mysterious man to Acapulco. What's really going on here? Who is this mysterious man? Even better: who is the client?Allusions to the hard-boiled fiction masters are scattered throughout Taibo's novel, especially that of Raymond Chandler. Shayne thinks to himself that \\"Chandler forgot to prohibit detectives from getting metaphysical\\". Well, that's plenty made up for in \\"Return to the Same City\\"; Shayne often waxes poetic on his rebirth and on returning to Mexico City.It's an engaging read, even if the previous novels about Shayne have not been read. It can stand on its own, and may work best this way since his resurrection is glossed over by both author and character."},{"Title":"Return to the Same City","review":"Unfortunately, this doesn't live up to the admiring blurb on its cover from the author of &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; which calls the author's work &quot;intelligent.&quot; The main character is a one-eyed Mexican detective with some far-fetched quirks who thinks in Marxist slogans. This would be fine, except the author has placed him in a predictable Communist morality tale, where the bad guy is an evil Cuban-American &quot;gusano&quot; with ties to the CIA, being pursued by an alcoholic-but-heroic left-wing gringo reporter and our hero. It turns out they are being guided and manipulated by the Castro-Cuban and Sandinista secret police (one of the few realistic touches) to do their dirty work for them. When he discovers this (somewhat after the reader) instead of giving our hero second thoughts this delights him, since he sees it as joining forces with fellow travelers in the global anti-imperialist struggle.

In between the stories Hemingway includes even shorter vignettes of cruelty. Brief comments on the stories (with some plot spoilers) follow:\\"On the Quai at Smyrna\\" - An American encounters casual cruelty among the Turks and Greeks during World War I.\\"Indian Camp\\" - Nick Adams and his father, a scientific man who is quite detached from other people, visit an Indian camp where his father performs a Caesarian without anesthetic. While he performs the operation, the baby's father kills himself by cutting his throat with a straight razor.\\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife\\" - Nick's mother is revealed to be weak willed and self-deceiving, and we are not too surprised to learn that Nick prefers his father's company.\\"The End of Something\\" - The adolescent Nick ends a relationship with a girl. Before the end comes, Hemingway provides a typically economical but touching depiction of Marjorie, his girlfriend, as they row across a lake with their lines in the water: \\"She was intent on the rod all the time they trolled, even while she talked. She loved to fish. She loved to fish with Nick.\\"\\"The Three-Day Blow\\" - Nick and his friend Bill drink quietly in front of a fireplace during a storm - they are just learning to drink - and later disregard an important gun safety precaution.\\"The Battler\\" - Nick encounters a damaged former prizefighter.\\"A Very Short Story\\" - (Well, they almost all are.)

I can only suggest that you develop the habit of reading the entire book, cover to cover. If you did, you'd notice that Hemingway thanks SEVERAL magazines for permission to REPRINT some of the stories. Of course there's no overall theme. He wrote the stories at different times, for different audiences, and gave them the appropriate slant for the periodical he hoped would publish them. This is an anthology of his early works, each of which was meant to stand on its own. Even the Nick Adams stories can be read on a stand alone basis.Some of the stories do, in fact, reflect his love of outdoor sports such as fishing, camping, hiking, skiing, etc. In these, along with his bull-fighting vignettes, you can certainly see the beginnings of the Hemingway style of terse, to the point writing which accounts for much of his later fame.

H. Lawrence (b1885-d1930) as I read it in the book 'Selected Literary Criticism', edited by Anthony Beal. I'm copying Lawrence's review of Hemingway's 'In Our Time' here because it is an outstanding review others who come to Amazon ought to read:\\" In Our Time is the last of the four American books, and Mr. Hemingway has accepted the goal. He keeps on making flights, but he has no illusion about landing anywhere. He knows it will be nowhere every time.In Our Time calls itself a book of stories, but it isn't that. It is a series of successive sketches from a man's life, and makes a fragmentary novel. The first scenes, by one of the big lakes in America--probably Superior--are the best; when Nick is a boy. Then come fragments of war--on the Italian front. Then a soldier back home, very late, in the little town way west in Oklahoma. Then a young American and wife in post-war Europe; a long sketch about an American jockey in Milan and Paris; then Nick is back again in the Lake Superior region, getting off the train at a burnt-out town, and tramping across the empty country to camp by a trout-stream. Trout is the one passion life has him--and this won't last long.It is a short book: and it does not pretend to be about one man. But it is. It is as much as we need know of the man's life. The sketches are short, sharp, vivid, and most of them excellent. (The 'mottoes' in front seem a little affected.) And these few sketches are enough to create the man and all his history: we need know no more.Nick is a type one meets in the more wild and woolly regions of the United States. He is the remains of the lone trapper and cowboy. Nowadays he is educated, and through with everything. It is a state of conscious, accepted indifference to everything except freedom from work and the moment's interest. Mr. Hemingway does it extremely well. Nothing matters. Everything happens. Pne wants to keep oneself loose. Avoid one thing only: getting connected up. Don't get connected up. If oyu get held by anything, break it. Don't be held. Break it, and get away. Don't get away with the idea of getting somewhere else. Just get away, for the sake of getting away. Beat it! \`Well, boy, I guess I'll beat it.\\" Ah, the pleasure in saying that!Mr. Hemingway's sketches, for this reason, are excellent: so short, like striking a match, lighting a brief sensational cigarette, and it's over. His young love-affair ends as one throws a cigarette-end away. \`It isn't fun any more.'--\`Everything's gone to hell inside me.'It is really honest. And it explains a great deal of sentimentality. When a thing has gone to hell inside you, your sentimentalism tries to pretend it hasn't. But Mr. Hemingway is through with the sentimentalism. \`It isn't fun any more. I guess I'll beat it.'And he beats it, to somewhere else. In the end he'll be a sort of tramp, endlessly moving on for the sake of moving away from where he is. This is a negative goal, and Mr. Hemingway is really good, because he's perfectly straight about it. He is like Krebs, in that devastating Oklahoma sketch: he doesn't love anybody, and it nauseates him to have to pretend he does. He doesn't even want to love anybody; he doesn't want to go anywhere, he doesn't want to do anything. He wants just to lounge around and maintain a healthy state of nothingness inside himself. And why shouldn't he, since that is exactly and sincerely what he feels? If he really doesn't care, then why should he care? Anyhow, he doesn't.\\""},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Reviewer Sam Stinson said:\\"Buy a bigger collection of Hemingway stories and save some money.\\"I would say that this is only a helpful suggestion if the reader is aware of which succession of stories belongs to In Our Time.

Well, I did and I didn't.In honesty, the first six or seven stories, in my opinion, are somewhat worthless and don't necessarily possess any more writing skill than the average person maintains. I thought to myself, how on earth was this the book that made Hemingway famous in America? Wow! But then I came to a little story called \\"A Cat in the Rain\\" and it was at this point that the book became enjoyable.It was at this point that the text started to become multi-faceted with more than just what you get at face value, and while I have nothing against tough and terse prose, I want to get the feeling that it actually means something, that it is more than just the sum of its parts. There were three stories in this collection that somewhat redeemed Hemingway's work for me: \\"A Cat in the Rain,\\" \\"Mr. and Mrs. Elliot,\\" and \\"My Old Man.\\" Thanks to these stories, I will not look down my nose so much when I come across another Hemingway read.

Each story in the book is set around the time of World War 1. Although some of the stories deal with the trauma that verterans suffer, Hemingway's minimalistic writing style tends to downplay the emotional aspect of what his characters are going through. A few of Hemingway's short stories sparked my interest, but for the most part, I was filled with a sort of indifference while reading the other stories. I would recommend this book, because it does give certain insight into characteristics of people living around the time of World War 1. However, the reader should be warned to take this book for what it is, and not expect anything extraordinary."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Buy a bigger collection of Hemingway stories and save some money."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Compared to his other great works of art , this book fell very short of the mark .

Every writer craves stories as full of real moments and real people. Great book. Great approach to writing short stories.

They can be read and re-read and, despite a style of which the simplicity and spareness is merely apparent, provide a richer experience upon each re-read. They are a nice introduction to the works of Hemingway.The themes of the stories are generally somber, painful, and full of loss. Not only in terms of content, but in style, Hemingway conveys a detached and painful experience--and the ability to convey pain in not only what is described, but what the author finds too painful to describe directly. The stories, which may seem spare to some contemporary readers, are also noteworthy in displaying that literary style Malcolm Cowley called The Middle American Prose Style--simple Anglo Saxon words, action, and repetition of certain words for effect.Some stories also have an autobiographical tone such as \\"Indian Camp\\", describing growing up with his father, a doctor, who eventually committed suicide. Other stories (The Battler) continue the Nick Adams line of stories, while others (The Elliots), describe, somewhat cynically the dilettantes among the ex patriots after the war. The story \\"Soldier's Home\\" is particularly notable, and tells the story of a young man, whom we would now recognize as suffering some effects of PTSD, coming home from France after the armistice, changed, detached, a puzzle to his parents, wanting to interact but lacking the motivation, and estranged from the past simpleness of his former small town life. Damon G. LaBarbera, PhD"},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Hemingway probably put these early short stories together himself when he was only 26. So these are early writings from which one can foresee his later development. His clean prose style already evident combines with acute observations of relationships and an attention to nature. His misogyny,already a hallmark, is more apparent to us today than it was in 1925."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Short stories are beautiful bedtime reading, enough to slow your thoughts and remove you from the stresses of the day. This collection is Hemingway's very best, his American debut from 1925. The stories are concise, yet rich with detail and feeling. My personal favorite, \\"A Very Short Story,\\" is less than two pages, but it expresses everything it needs to. As is Hemingway's style, he doesn't hand stories to the reader. You jump in head first and have to figure out where you are and what you're doing there. Each one of these tales is truly an adventure not to be missed."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Published in 1925, it is an early collection of Hemingway's short stories and the establishment of his clean, precise and simple style of writing. I like his clearcut style and entertaining way of writing - he makes the pages come alive, especially with his Nick Adams stories. His insights also have historical value in his observations of life in the earlier 20th Century, colloquially and culturally. A fast read and a nice way to catch up on the classics."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Hemingway is the master of the understated short story. He takes simple themes and without use of superlatives, makes it real. This book is a collection of short stories where most feature a man name Nick, from his time as a young boy to manhood as it closes with two stories about him fishing. There is one story where no male name is given, so it may also be about Nick.The most gripping story is \\"Soldier's Home\\", which features a character called Krebs. He is back in Kansas after serving in the European theater in World War I. Unlike many of his fellow Americans, he did not return until the middle of 1919, so he missed most of the ecstasy of the welcome-home parades. Krebs has difficulty coming back to what he left in Kansas. He has no interest in women, a job or anything that could lead to a bettering of his current condition. Living with his parents, they are growing disturbed at his listlessness, his mother sits down with him and wants to pray for his changing. While Krebs vows to change, it is not a heartfelt pronouncement, rather it is more of a \\"whatever\\" change in his attitude.Given his experience, Hemingway knew war. But he also knew the difficulties of peace for men of war and a great deal about the simpler challenges of life. Much of that knowledge and experience is demonstrated in these stories."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"It is not true that Hemingway would go on to create works better than some of the stories in this work. In some of these short pieces we have the essential Hemingway, the best that he has to give. In fact his whole picture of the world, the emphasis on 'grace under pressure' the devastating effect of war and violence, the presentation of a kind of code hero, above all the simplicity and beauty of the language are here.This is the beginning of Hemingway but it is also the essence and the best."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Reading the assembled vignettes and short stories of In Our Time, \\"Hemingway's American debut,\\" is like taking a look at an artist's working sketches that eventually evolve into masterpieces. The reader finds all of the usual denizens of Hemingway's world: anglers, ex-patriates, toreadors, soldiers, men and women who are in love, and those who have fallen out. And, of course, Nick Adams. In these tales, Hemingway demonstrates the superfluousness of semicolons and the superiority of spartan sentences for which he is famous.While it isn't my favorite of Hemingway's works, it makes a good sampler for those wishing to get short doses of Hemingway, especially for those whose only exposure to Hemingway was reading The Old Man and The Sea in high school."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"This is quite nearly a perfect collection of short stories. Hemingway has enamored me, because of this collection: i've never read anything that is written in this way.

Very good."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"This is not my favorite or what I would could consider his best work but I would STILL recommend it. \\"Soldier's Home\\" is by far my favorite and it seems to ring especially true at this time in our country's history.

Good gift for a high school or college student. An excellent collection of subtle stories."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"I think this book was the best effort from Hemingway. Both the structure, with the stories interspersed with the bits of commentary, and the style seem far beyond any of his other work, in my opinion.The Nick stories are particularly apt and the overall emotional impact of the book almost makes one forget Hemingway's irritating personality. Yes, this is not a socially-correct work but I think it defines the general American (and probably Canadian) mentality of the time.McGuane has tried to revive the Hemingway tradition - see &quot;To Skin a Cat&quot; - but doesn't quite come to the same level as this book."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"The book arrived in a timely manner and is in excellent condition.

ARE these stories supposed to be &quot;connected&quot; (ie, written to one identifiable theme) or more a chaotic spectrum of emotion?

It seemed the main character was a guy named Nick, who had fought in the war. Each chapter was a whole story by itself, and the author seemed to skip around between the US and Europe quite frequently.My favorite parts in the book were the short introductions at the beginning of each chapter. To me, they were the most interesting sections in the book. My favorite story in the book was the one where he gets pushed off of the train and meets up with the two travelers.

What I loved about this version of the book is the simplicity. I do not mean his writing style, but the physical book itself. There is no book jacket or photo on the cover, just the title and the author. This is what made me buy the version in the first place. However, the pages of the book are a little cheap. It appears that the original text was scanned and the book was bound with the copies of this scan. Some of the text of the pages is very crooked, slanting almost off the page. The binding was solid but not leather which I would have enjoyed even more. My only issue was with how the text was scanned and copied. It was not a real printing of the book. Four stars out of five because of this. Overall, a good purchase."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"In Our Time is a collection of short stories by Hemingway that are more or less fragments of a person's life. They were written early in his career and he brought them together as a collection. Each story is an easy read. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Plain and simply the greatest collection of short stories ever written by an American. Among them the greatest American short story of all time &quot;&quot;Big Two-Hearted River.&quot;"},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Ernest Hemingway's book, In Our Time, is a collection of short stories, both short and long at length. These stories portray situations that a reader can often relate to, which helps him/her understand more of a story's true meaning. Hemingway's use of everyday language, which contains rough words, leaves the reader in suspense, always making him/her wonder what will happen next. Also, this style of writing is easy to comprehend for the average reader.Although all the short stories are not connected to each other, the reader can sense a connection between the stories anyway, which makes this book more enjoyable to read. The interchapters are often confusing but the reader eventually understands the purpose and the meaning of them.Because of Hemingway's style of writing, a reader may not expect that he could include an abundance of literary devices, such as imagery and metaphor. However, Hemingway uses a beautiful variety of words to enhance the reader's imagination throughout the book, thus making Hemingway one of the best writers ever existed."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"The collection of short stories, In Our Time, by Ernest Hemingway are all quick to the point and full of meaning, containing thier own theme. These stories, Hemingway's first published pieces, all contain such perfection that they are of a nature all to themselves. Through these stories, Hemingway proves that he fully understands the cliched saying &quot;quality not quantity.&quot; The length of these stories vary from two pages to fifteen pages, but the themes all have the same sensible qualities. Stories such as &quot;Indian Camp&quot; and &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Elliot&quot; hold the strongest message, because of the characters they posess. Although each of the stories do have thier own setting and usually include thier own separate characters, one of the characters, Nick, makes a constant appearance in half of the stories. Before each short story, a little novelette pops up, containing no theme or reference to any of the stories. These &quot;chapters&quot;, as Hemingway refers to them, should be recognized to the reader as embodying pure imagery. The graphic words, should also make the reader express a certain sensation, such as anger, sadness or fear. All of the stories, and the &quot;chapters&quot; seperating them, make the reader experience a certain emotion. Since these stories mostly focus on the problems around the world, they usually cause the reader to feel blue with sadness. This collection should only be read for enjoyment, so that the reader can get a distinct sense of emotion Hemingway inspired his readers to have."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"In Our Time is a book written by Ernest Hemingway, and explores the things that are wrong in life. It is not the type of book to consider as a good bedtime story or a joyful fairy tale. This is a book of death and depression, and will cause one's mood to fall in a downward spiral. There are a total of fifteen stories, and all of them convey an abundant variety of negative emotions. Hemingway creates these stories to open the reader's mind, and expose them to real life. This book is for readers who want to explore the obstacles of life and how they effect someone. With the unanticipated endings to many of the stories, the constant use of bad language, and the abilities to create a feeling of disgust, the stories become interesting and engaging to the reader."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"In Our Time is a great collection of Ernest Hemingway's early short stories, which he wrote when he was at his peak as a writer. I love the way he uses simple descriptions and dialogue to narrate them, giving a more natural feel to the stories. You can see his tough writing style beginning to show already at this point of his career. Most parts will be confusing to the novice reader because Hemingway really wants you to infer what the stories are about - he will not go right out and tell you. There really is no single theme to this whole book, but it basically shows how life was back in the 1920's. Many of Hemingway's works were based on his own experiences in life, which is very interesting. &quot;The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife&quot; was based on the author's own father, who was, in Hemingway's mind, a coward. &quot;Soldier's Home&quot; is an excellent story of a distressed soldier coming home from The Great War. &quot;A Very Short Story&quot; was based on Hemingway's own romance with a nurse while he was overseas during the war. &quot;Indian Camp&quot; and &quot;The Battler&quot; are two of my favorites. It has been said that the character Nick Adams was really Hemingway, and when you read the Nick Adams stories along with a biography on Hemingway's life, it is easy to see why. Each story in this collection has a meaning unto itself, and I highly recommend that you read all of them."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"This is by far my favorite Hemingway. To the newcomer: please don't be fooled by the simple style and the often elliptical exposition. There is so much more here than is evident on a first reading. It takes a while to discover the complexity of Hemingway's themes and the emotional strings he pulls because his style is so spare, strong, and perfect. Like small, meticulously arranged blocks, with brilliant vignettes between them as mortar, he builds a stirring and often frightening image of the twentieth century. Everything is here--young love, political violence, adolescent confusion, social displacement, racial conflict, industrial hegemony and decline, every sort of relationship fissure.Sometimes his genuis is almost eerie--read &quot;Soldier's Home,&quot; and try to analyse how such basic words and sentences can weave such a poignant, aching emotional web. His work had an almost magical presence in those early years, before egotism and the media made him self-conscious.Even if you are familiar with his more celebrated novels, read this collection and you will be overwhelmed by the beauty, power, and honesty of Hemingway at his best."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"These short pages contain simply (but less simply than some readers realize) some of the best short stories by an American writer in the entire twentieth century. Hemingway is certainly lauded enough by high-minded literary types, but it would be a mistake to assume that those are the only people that can enjoy him. It is tough to get a handle on what he is doing in this book, particularly because of the interchapers (which are NOT lead-ins to the stories following them, but a separate bit of impressionist writing of their own), but as in all great writing, the point is to make you ask yourself questions, not answer them for you. My personal favorite from this book (and maybe of any book by anybody) is &quot;Soldier's Home&quot; Hemingway's style, which is often criticized for being &quot;too simple&quot;, thus ignorant, is to leave the most important details unsaid, letting the reader create most of the image in his or her mind. When in &quot;Soldier's Home&quot; Krebs' mother says &quot;There can be no idle hands in God's Kingdom&quot; Hemingway writes Krebs' reply as simply &quot;I'm not in His kingdom.&quot; No description of his voice, no laying of scene, nothing but that pure powerful statement, which would have been ruined by a long dramatic monologue on the horrors of war. If you enter this book with an open mind, Hemingway won't disappoint. And you'll have plenty to argue about with your high-minded literary friends."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"In Our Time by Ernest Hemingway is a collection of short stories set amidst a time after the period of World War I. Several of Hemingway's early classics are included in this incredible novel such as &quot;Indian Camp,&quot; &quot;The Battler,&quot; and &quot;The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife.&quot; If the reader can look past the drinking scenes, each individual story presents a variety of characters, themes and plots, all of which deal with different aspects of life. His unique style of short, simple and declarative sentences enables easy reading for any person. Hemingway, as a man, writes with dignity and a genuine mansculine charm. The stories of love lost, relationships, nature and war are intense-- recommended In Our Time, a classic."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"\\"In Our Time,\\" the first published work of fiction by Ernest Hemingway, reads like a sketchpad at times, notes toward a novel. In fact, the seeds for two of Hemingway's earliest novels, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"A Farewell To Arms,\\" can be found here, but \\"In Our Time\\" works better than either of those classics when it comes to showing why Hemingway mattered, and still does.Hemingway is a writer prized for his economic writing style, and he doesn't get more economical than here. The stories in this collection sometimes run just two or three pages, and are broken up by even briefer story nuggets that read like brushwork haikus.Included are three of Hemingway's most celebrated shorts, \\"Soldier's Home,\\" \\"Indian Camp,\\" and \\"Big Two-Hearted River,\\" but while these and a couple of others (\\"The Battler\\" \\"My Old Man\\") are gripping enough read alone, they really come alive here in tandem with \\"In Our Time's\\" other stories and anecdotes. The mood of \\"In Our Time\\" seems more important than any message, and is certainly easier to discern.First published in 1925, \\"In Our Time\\" expresses a world-weariness typical of the generation that came home from the First World War, \\"The War To End All Wars,\\" to find their glorious dreams and beliefs shattered. Cynicism was a newer thing in Hemingway's time, and harder for his generation to digest. Presenting himself in slightly fictionalized form as one Nick Adams, Hemingway looks backward to moments of nausea in his youth, bitter breakups and parental failures, before dealing with how the war itself left him shattered. Sometimes the lens of the book moves to characters other than Nick, but it never leaves aside that spirit of disillusion and loss.\\"He did not want any consequences,\\" he writes of Krebs, the protagonist of \\"Soldier's Home.\\" \\"He did not want any consequences ever again.\\"Hemingway writes beautifully and sparingly throughout \\"In Our Time,\\" showing generations of writers how much more effective an idea can be when a writer leaves it to a reader to work it out. No story better illustrates his singular command than \\"Big Two-Hearted River,\\" an elegy and grace note in two parts for all that comes before, as Nick recaptures a sense of peace fishing for trout on a river. It's one of the longest stories, and may seem aimless to a first-time reader as it focuses on the nitty-gritty of Nick's routine, but the more you read it, the more drawn in you become, until you feel like you are on that river with Nick, plucking black grasshoppers off the tall grass.People say Frank Sinatra did the first concept album with \\"In The Wee Small Hours,\\" but it seems to me Hemingway had him beat by some 30 years with these tone poems of stunning narrative craft."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"I bought a collection of short stories (This is My Time) that made reference to Hemingway's In Our Time, when I realized I had somehow managed to wend my way through school never having encountered Hemingway.I looked up the book, In Our Time, and after recovering from the initial shock of seeing Simon and Schuster's shameful price of $10.99 for a slim volume of short stories, bought the volume.I read the first story, On the River Quai at Smyrna, and was a bit perplexed as the story begins abruptly without a clear setting, plot, or defined characters. It ends as it began. Next I found under the heading of Chapter 1 a sort of military vignette in but a single paragraph. Then a story titled Indian Camp began. This was an interesting story of a doctor and his young son coming to the aid of a pregnant Indian woman. This is more along the lines of what I had expected. I was pleased until the heading Chapter 2 appeared, yet again with another military vignette in a single paragraph.Okay, now I knew the author was toying with me and this collection was purposeful and complex. I would need some help to understand the author's plan and methodology. To this end I bought a dead tree book (Hemingway's Short Stories (Cliffs Notes)) to help me. I also found an online site called SparkNotes. These were indispensable to fully appreciate this collection of stories.The main insights gained were that the stories present the chaos and terror of World War I and that the character Nick Adams is partially autobiographical.There is much to commend this small collection and I encourage others to dig in and discover Hemingway."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"I admit, when I first read The Sun Also Rises for a class on Mondern Literature, I was not enamored. It struck me as overly minimalistic and angst-ridden.Now that I'm taking another Modern Literature class, four years later, I actually found I enjoyed Hemingway this time around. I read the book through twice before writing an essay on it and found I had a much better grip on it for the redundant reading. Some of the fifteen stories in particular are more striking than others (I personally was drawn to \\"The Three Day Blow,\\" \\"Soldier's Home,\\" \\"The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife,\\" \\"Mr. and Mrs. Eliott,\\" and \\"Big Two-Hearted River\\"), but really it takes the collection taken as a whole to achieve its full effect.Really, each story is made up of two parts: there's the main story, then there is a 40-200 word italicized section at the beginning of each story. The two sections are in no way related to each other plotwise, but they seem to very subtly comment, inform, and enhance each one another.Hemingway comes at the reader with a plethora of voices, rhythms, and issues that, while they are not always related to one another (though about half the stories employ the same character, Nick Adams), are necessary to be taken as a whole to get the entire experience of what he's trying to say. His favorite themes seem to be war, violence (not necessarily always the war kind), loss (in many, many forms), the healing power of nature, and the right way to live. Each story generally has a little bit to inform the reader about each, and then the last story, \\"Big Two-Hearted River,\\" picks up and completes all these threads. Especially the second time through, this culmination was quite an experience.Overall, In Our Time is a very quick and painless read, but rewards deeper contemplation. If the themes I listed above are of interest, then I recommend. If contemplative, minimalist writing is favored, then I recommend. If you're looking for excitement or an obvious message, then I don't recomment. It's as simple and complex as that."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"In 1925, a relatively unknown World War I veteran named Ernest Hemingway released a collection of short stories entitled In Our Time. This new author was a treat to the readers, as he wrote with a style very different than what the readers were accustomed to. Instead of long, flowing prose, Hemingway's stories were written in short, declarative sentences, with an oblique style of emotions for the characters. This new minimalist approach to literature would become one of the greatest changes in literary style, influencing the entire literary scene until - and much past - World War II.The book consists of many short stories, separated by short vignettes. Many of the short stories contain the character Nick Adams, initially a young boy learning about death in the company of his father who is a doctor. Then, he begins growing up. He has relationships with young women and great friends. These stories are divided by very short vignettes portraying the violence and emotions suffered in World War I. Very notable is Chapter VII,...he lay very flat and sweated and prayed oh jesus christ get me out of here. Dear jesus please get me out. Christ please please please christ. If you'll only keep me from getting killed I'll do anything you say...Please please dear jesus...The next night back at Mestre he did not tell the girl he went upstairs with at the Villa Rossa about Jesus. And he never told anybody.The Nick Adams stories come to a close at the end of the book with the two part Big Two-Hearted River, which shows an older, more mature Nick Adams, returned from the war and returning to the calming lifestyle of his youth by camping and fly-fishing in an amazingly described river and meadow.In Our Time set the stage for Ernest Hemingway to become one of the most influential writers (some would argue he was the most influential) of the twentieth century. His short, terse, masculine prose would set the literary world on fire and paved the way for Hemingway's other masterpieces, including The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and The Old Man and the Sea. In Our Time is an excellent introductory work to the writing of Hemingway and is a classic sure to be enjoyed by many."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"The story goes, that when Ernest Hemingway's parents first received copies of In Our Time, they were horrified and furious. His old man sent the books back to the publisher. A year later, in a letter to his father, Hemingway explained to his father what it was he was attempting as a young writer: \\"You see I am trying in all my stories to get the feeling of the actual life across - not to just depict life - or criticize it - but to actually make it alive. So that when you have read something by me you actually experience the thing. You can't do this without putting in the bad and the ugly as well as what is beautiful.\\"We know Hemingway more for his off-the-page exploits than those he published, but in these short pieces, peppered with very short (mostly one page) pieces, Hemingway first introduces his hard-boiled style to an American audience. An earlier, much shorter version of this book was published the year before in Paris. Hemingway expects something of his readers. Much remembered for his belief that a good writer can say much more by employing omission than by saying too much, he leaves the job of applying sentiment and emotion to the reader."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"After a few clicks, the book was on its way. The courier's engine could still be heard in the distance when I ripped Hemingway's old text from its enclosure. I immediately began reading it on the porch.

This collection of &quot;sketches&quot; are the rough beginnings of Hemingway's later, more developed novels. There is a certain purity in these incomplete works. Although each story has its conclusion, the reader feels, as Hemingway did, a need to explore more fully the amazing characters he introduces.The true power of this small collection are the vignettes. At first they confuse the reader since they do not serve as bridges connecting one story to the next. They are pure emotion, telling no story. A contradiction to Hemingway's tight, nonsuperfilous style, they scream for attention, just as we later hoped many of his well guarded character would. For those familiar with his works, they are the true gems of this collection. Our questions are finally answered, for the intensity of his characters are finally expressed."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Please read this book on your own credence.

This book can be thought-provoking or flat-out boring.

Thank you."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Ernest Hemingway's book, In Our Time, is a collection of short stories, both short and long at length. These stories portray situations that a reader can often relate to, which helps him/her understand more of a story's true meaning. Hemingway's use of everyday language, which contains rough words, leaves the reader in suspense, always making him/her wonder what will happen next. Also, this style of writing is easy to comprehend for the average reader.Although all the short stories are not connected to each other, the reader can sense a connection between the stories anyway, which makes this book more enjoyable to read. The interchapters are often confusing but the reader eventually understands the purpose and the meaning of them.Because of Hemingway's style of writing, a reader may not expect that he could include an abundance of literary devices, such as imagery and metaphor. However, Hemingway uses a beautiful variety of words to enhance the reader's imagination throughout the book, thus making Hemingway one of the best writers ever existed."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"I appreciate this collection for what it is: the beginning of an American literary legend. Some of the Hemingway stories are truly moving and timeless. Through this collection of stories, we see the Hemingway style of terse, concrete, powerful prose as already fully developed. We see inklings of what will become The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, Green Hills of Africa, and his other longer works of prose through these short stories' focus on bullfighting, Italy, Spain, World War I, and other macho pursuits. It is these longer works, and not this initial offering of short stories, that makes Hemingway really worth reading."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"If you're looking for an introduction to Hemingway's shorter works, I'd recommend getting the whole collection at once. Even anthologized, the complete short stories don't make too large a book, and you'll have a much better range of work to peruse. Some of Hemingway's favorite works (The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Clean Well-Lighted Place, The Light of the World) and some of the most frequently referenced in high school and college lit classes (Hills Like White Elephants) are not to be found in this slimmer volume. While this book represents Hemingway's important debut, you can achieve the same understanding of his first stories by reading them chronologically from an anthology.A complete anthology also provides something that this collection of early work does not explore in detail: Hemingway's obsession with \\"sea change\\" and gender-bending. This is a major theme in his life and writing that challenges most readers' conception of him as ultra-masculine.If you're sour on Hemingway because this is your only taste of his writing, I'd urge you to check out some of his later works, which are more stylistically his own, and also perhaps more accessible."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Hemingway is a master of the short story. His style is so succinct, and easy. Great stories, all. If you like this book, try &quot;It's All Chaos&quot; by Hugh Aaron. His style is glass sharp like Hemingway's, but these are contemporary stories about the young, the old and the middle aged, many of which are bound to touch you. He learned from Hemingway how to do it."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"Reading Ernest Hemingway's In Our Time was both an adventure and a puzzlement at the same time. Withing the simply written pages lies a number of short stories, each containg a rainbow of themes leading in different directions from one another. Because of this, an overall concept of theme is almost impossible. to achieve. Each individual story is quite amusing and enganging but any attempt to combine the stories and direct them all in just one direction proves to be a complicated task. Despite this fact, Hemingways's writing style still cradles the reader's attention and interest. An easy to read book, his short paragraphs get to the point while simultaneously shedding impressive description into each chapter. The short paragraqphs between chapters are perplexing yet incredibly fascination, containing the same, if not more, intrigue as the full chapters themeselves. These, perhaps, are the perfect example of Hemingway's ability to fit an amazing, elaborate situation into a single paragraph. All in all, In Our Time is a wonderful book to read. Although an overall theme is hard to identify, the will-written sections are interesting enough to keep an active reade's nose buried inside its pages. In Our Time will prove beneficial to any reader's receiving their first taste of classic literature. It will also provide a good contrast between ths classic's simple writing style, to the usual, more complex style of most classic authors."},{"Title":"In our time;: Stories","review":"I had to get this book for my AP Literature class.

Author is extremely knowlegeable about topic yet makes it very understandable to everyone. Buy this book! Trust me."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"This is one of the most heart-wrenching books in the series, no longer just action stories but studies in personality. It is intensely personal amidst the usual carnage. It's fascinating to watch Bolitho struggle with his promotion to Commodore and his new, enforced aloofness from shipboard affairs and his officers. Bolitho's typical concern for his crew is now extended to an entire squadron of some 2000 men, their faces no longer known but their fates wracking poor Bolitho. Particularly affecting is his struggle to contend with the failing nerve of his closest friend and proteg&eacute;, flag captain Herrick, who has been with him from early days. The waters of personality move into the deeps as Bolitho rises in rank and others reach their limits. Bolitho suffers a relapse of the malarial fever at a critical junction in the cruise from Gibralter to Egypt, and rivalries among his subordinates come to the fore. Just another source of the immense tension Kent builds in this novel of the desperate British attempt to fathom Napoleon's intent for his vast Mediterranean fleet buildup. Kent again avoids including Bolitho in one of the great historical fleet actions, this time at Aboukir Bay. While he does give Bolitho a role in directing the French into a weaker position, and does explain the battle's great importance, that climactic battle passes much too remotely and quickly to satisfy.The suspense in this series is partly the eventual goal and task set to Bolitho and mostly how Bolitho is ever going to solve impossible tactical situations at sea. The usual solution he proposes is a surprise maneuver, but what form will it take this time? Like many of Kent's book titles, &quot;Signal - Close Action!&quot; is a stirring phrase but barely hints at the situations and solutions to be found within. Conversely, his chapter titles too often prefigure the event. As usual it's easy to spot who will be &quot;good&quot; officers and who &quot;bad,&quot; so thorough are the differences, but Kent does provide one surprising development. As always, it is absolutely vital to pay closest attention to the sailing directions (wind, tack, etc.) if you want to visualize the sea maneuvers, because Kent won't tell us in lubber's terms. The cover bears an excellent wrap-around picture, &quot;ripped from the living text.&quot;"},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"The series continues with plenty of action and suspense. The Bolitho novels have given me an insight into Enlish as well as nautical history that I never learned in school."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"If you loved Forester's \\"Hornblower\\" series, as I did, then you will also appreciate Alexander Kent's \\"Richard Bolitho\\" tales. You do not get the sense that they are derivative of Forester's work, for they stand on their own original merit. The action flows nonstop and logically with hardly a calm or doldrum. The author clearly understands the complexities of handling and fighting a ship under sail. He doesn't just use nautical terminology and commands as colorful filler- he uses them accurately as a fundamental part of the narrative. In fact, as a secondary feature, these books are a decent primer on 18th century seamanship.As much as the author excels at technical accuracy, his character development and knowledge of human nature is even stronger. He shows that the politics, gameplaying, and back-stabbing aboard a warship can be every bit as complex as that in a Turkish harem. Yet, there is the underlying sense of the imperative of setting a positive example as an officer, of showing your people that you can truly LEAD as well as you can simply COMMAND their daily lives.In this volume Bolitho has been promoted to Commodore and given command of a squadron (three seventy-fours, a thirty-two gun frigate, and a sloop of war.) He takes command with orders to find out what Napoleon is up to in the Mediterrean- and then to handle it as best he sees fit. As the majority of the British fleet is tied up on blockade duty in the Atlantic, he will be the sole projection of British naval might this side of Gibraltar. The details of commanding an entire task force instead of a single vessel, as in the earlier volumes, is fascinating in and of itself. Ultimately, Bolitho finds that he must place his command between the Nile and an entire French fleet...."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"I've yet to read a Richard Bolitho book that I did not thoroughly enjoy. This one is my favorite one so far. It's full of the attention to detail, superb phrasing, and outstanding character description and development that Kent/Reeman's readers have grown accustomed to.This work is a glittering example of why Bolitho is one of the most well-crafted and developed characters I've read. He is truly a classic hero, and with it is truly human with no trace of the superman tendencies which a lesser writer would use with the resulting lack of believability. Bolitho's foibles and imperfections are used here to great advantage.The result is that I look forward to setting sail again with Bolitho more than ever. Any admirer of good fiction should be greatly pleased that the entire series is being reprinted and being made available in U.S. editions."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"It is with relief that admirers of Richard Bolitho learn that when Bonaparte launched his invasion of Egypt, the dashing sea-officer was not found wanting and was in the thick of efforts to frustrate the future Emperor's knavish tricks. As Mr.Kent tells the story in this splendid addition to the Bolitho Chronicles, the experience was however a far from pleasant one, and though Bolitho deservedly flies his flag at last, he must weather illness, conflict with his old friend Herrick , betrayal by an old colleague and a ferocious battle with a French squadron in the Corfu Channel before he can lay his ship alongside the enemy in the climactic Battle of the Nile. As always the historical and technical details add colour to the story and the faithful reader gets considerable satisfaction from following the fortunes and developing characters of the hero and his colleagues. Those who enjoy this book will also find satisfaction in Brian Lavery's excellent &quot;Nelson and the Nile&quot;, which describes the entire 1798 Mediterranean Campaign from both the British and French viewpoints in lively and entertaining prose. One is only disappointed that t omits any mention of Bolitho's pivotal role. One wonders why!"},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come. I like it."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"The continuing saga of Richard Bolitho in this the 13th book about him is very exciting and well written. I am not sure how Bolitho keeps surviving all the harrowing experiences but he always seems to come through heroicly but scarred."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"It's 1798, and Richard Bolitho hoists a commodore's broad pendant on the Lysander. At first he finds it comforting to have his dearest friend, Thomas Herrick, as his flag captain. But as his squadron begins its work, the difficult job of finding out what Napolean's navy is up to in the Mediterranean, both Bolitho and Herrick realize that Herrick's most recent battle experiences have left him scarred in ways not physical. The squadron's other captains, all known to Bolitho from earlier assignments in his already long career, have strengths and weaknesses that he understands; but he learns as he commands them as commodore that he does not know everything about them that he ought. Nor does he understand why Herrick's first lieutenant, who stands high in the flag captain's regard, seems bent on driving a wedge between Herrick and Bolitho.As with any other military fiction (including the military science fiction that is this genre's direct descendant), a good story's need to have its hero in the thick of the action sometimes requires the author to have that hero do things a real commodore, admiral, etc. would not be apt to do at all. Such as leading a small shore party in person...but Kent's writing of Richard Bolitho always makes these episodes seem plausible, and his flawed heroes are so much more interesting because of those flaws and their resulting struggles. For me this novel was a re-read after a good 30 years since the first time, and I enjoyed it from a different perspective. The action, the battles and the strategies behind them, still worked well; but the human interactions interested me even more. I definitely want to re-read the other early books from this series, as well as track down the later ones.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I have had to get my own maps, and that's ok too.I recommend this book to everyone and encourage everyone to collect the whole series."},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"In this, the twelfth book of the Richard Bolitho series, Bolitho has risen to the rank of Commodore and is dispatched to the Mediteranean to try and figure out what the French navy is up to. England's Admiralty is rivetted on this question as the deployment of the whole British Fleet depends on the answer to that question. So, who better to send than ... Nelson! Oh, but there is a problem you see. Nelson just lost his arm in an engagement and is still recovering. Hmmm... Who is the next most trustworthy commander on the seas ... Aha! Richard Bolitho!Bolitho assumes command of a squadron that is surprisingly populated by most all of the characters that have survived the previous eleven novels. The Captains of the 74 gun ship of the line are Thomas Herrick (Bolitho's closes friend), Charles Farquhar (who was a Lieutenant under Bolitho), Charles Probyn (served as a Lieutenant senior to Bolitho), Inch (was a midshipman in one of Bolitho's ships), etc. In addition, Adam Pascoe, Bolitho's nephew is on the flagship serving as a Lieutenant. I suppose the British navy of that time was quite closely knit, and perhaps it was not surprising to have all the senior officers having served with one another in the past, but it seemed too convenient and pat to me.Bolitho starts on his mission and almost immediately finds out that his real struggle will be the petty jealousies and serious disruptions caused by the relationships of his subordinates to each other. As the book narrative continues, most of the senior commanders make decisions that affect the outcomes of complete naval battles based purely on how they view their colleagues and what possibilities for advancement these actions might have on their careers. This is quite different than Richard Bolitho's own experiences as a Captain of his ship and he is quite taken back by it. In addition, some of these officers have reached the end of their abilities and may even be cracking under the strains of command - even some who are quite close to Bolitho which makes it trebly difficult for the Commodore.As far as naval action goes, there is something going on non-stop. From cutting out expeditions, to shore attacks, to handling storms, to pitched battles among large ships, they are all there. Bolitho is not handling the individual ship but is trying to focus on the strategic direction he's been given as well as rule his unruly crew and that provides its own set of challenges to our hero. He comes through it with flying colors even though he tries to do a bit too much fighting in the front lines to what one would expect of senior officers. Of course, this is noted across the squadron and appreciated by the typical seaman who responds by putting out much more than is expected of them including doing some very outrageous actions which change the course of battles. (The subtheme of having the officers treat the men decently so they do better is a general one in this whole series)As Bolitho figures out what the French intentions are, he immediately moves to counter them. So, one of the subplots in this story is how Bolitho's actions changed the course of history. As the book progresses, you read about what he is doing and at the end realize that one reason why Nelson was able to win the decisive Battle of the Nile and thereby change the course of world history was because Bolitho and his small squadron took risks and gave their blood and lives for England.With so much going on and so much happening in the book, it was also nice to see how well written the book is. Although there is much technical jargon associated with the art of sailing ships in the late 18th century, that same jargon is a key element of the story and adds, rather than distracts, from the pleasure of it. the characters that are regulars in these books continue to develop - sometimes in surprising ways. Since this book is happening almost completely at sea with the British Navy, it is not surprising that there are not many elements of sexual relationships (with the exception of Bolitho's recent escapades in London) or romantic involvement. Therefore it is kind of jarring when the author introduces a woman to Herrick who falls in love with Herrick after speaking with him for one hour (ONE hour!). This has been a significant failing of many of these books in that the man - woman relationships are being portrayed in a completely unrealistic manner. But, never mind, these are minor matters for this kind of book.A further disappointment for me was that Bolitho and Nelson manage to be at the same place and time for only the second time in this series in this book. According to the Epilogue, Bolitho and his squadron fought in the Battle of the Nile. That is glossed over in a few paragraphs and then Bolitho is sent back to Gibraltar and England. Since the last two books were all gearing up to this point in history, it was kind of deflating to not have at least a complete chapter devoted to that famous battle. I suppose that since Bolitho and his mates are all fictional, it was kind of difficult to place him in any kind of context that made sense in a famous battle like this one. It also brings to mind a question: How will Bolitho participate in the Battle of Trafalgar?"},{"Title":"Signal - Close Action","review":"In this Bolitho adventure, Post Captain Richard Bolitho is made a Commodore and given a small squadron consisting of three 74-gun ships-of-the-line and a couple of smaller vessels and ordered to the Mediterannean to discover the French Fleet's intentions.Eventually he is instrumental in getting rear admiral Horatio Nelson's attention, and bringing a full-fledged British Fleet into the Med, leading to the Battle of the Nile.This story has the usual hard fought sea battles, as well as cutting out action and other forays onto foreign soil, with only minimal love interest this time.Bolitho is faced with a couple of subordinate captains' jealousy, and in one case hatred, but manages to pull it off anyway.Alexander Kent has written another winner, and provided us with another great vicarious adventure.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"},{"Title":"My learn to cook book","review":"This was a book that I had used as a child which sparked a life long love of cooking.

The book has two stories, the first of which is pretty good and almost holds up the quality of the first book. However, the second falls to pieces, bringing the entire series down with it.The first book in this series was so well written and exciting, that I was really looking forward to a riveting conclusion. One of the minor gripes with the entire series, like all of the Star Trek book series that incorporate all of the television crews, is that it became a little bit too much of a coincidence that the same things would happen to all of our familiar crew members. Candido alleviated that a little bit by having other crews involved as well: in the first book, it was Decker and his ship and then the crew of the Odyssey. Further along those lines, Candido provides even more distance by making Tuvok and Chakotay the only two familiar characters in the Voyager story. I found that this helped considerably.The first story is really well-told, as DeCandido does a good job of fleshing out some characters that we saw only briefly in the TV series (Cal Hudson) as well as creating some very interesting characters for the Hood. The Hood doesn't have as much to do as the ships did in the previous book, but the characters that DeCandido creates for it, especially Captain DeSoto, are vivid. DeSoto is a champion at the game of Go, and he has created a monster by teaching his first officer the game (and now she constantly beats him). It becomes a running gag throughout the story. It seems a bit superfluous, but it adds greatly to the character, as we feel we know him. DeCandido doesn't do as good of a job with the villain of the piece, though. The Andorian is very two-dimensional, going crazy because of the death of his family. He becomes very boring after awhile, and it's good that the story is short. The Maquis characters that DeCandido creates fulfill their roles well, but are rather basic otherwise. The distrust of Tuvok is understandable, but that's pretty much all there is.While the Voyager story is pretty good, the Next Generation story that ends the book just completely falls apart. One of the problems with it is that it seems to be a showcase for DeCandido's new series of books about the IKS Gorkon and less a Next Generation story. That's fine in and of itself, but that's not really the way the book was sold. They do seem like an interesting crew, and DeCandido makes them intriguing to read about, but Picard and the rest of the Enterprise crew are bit players in their own story.The second problem, and the one that made me almost want to put this book down in frustration many times in its short 140 page duration, was the constant explanation of continuity references. In many Star Trek books, there are so many references to past episodes that it can strangle a story. Others handle this very deftly, by either not including many references or by the author being very capable of explaining just enough of the references to not leave the new reader confused without bogging down the story. Throughout the first three stories in this series, DeCandido did a really good job of this. They were not intrusive, but they also weren't mystifying. Even better, a lot of these \\"references\\" were actually references to things that we haven't seen before, because they dealt with the new characters that DeCandido had created. That made them interesting. Unfortunately, in this final story, the continuity references come at the reader fast and furious, and DeCandido uses paragraph after paragraph to explain them. Most of them only need one paragraph, but when there are multiple references on each page, it starts to add up and get very messy. Not only are there references to television episodes, but there are multiple references to other books, as well (especially concerning the Gorkon, which has appeared on one of DeCandido's previous books).The story also feels very staged and ends up being anti-climactic. DeCandido moves all of the pieces around, has them do their assigned jobs, and then has the book end within one page in a very boring way. Finally, there is fifteen pages of story after the ending, which makes the rest of the story seem very inconsequential. I understand that this is the conclusion to the two-book series, and thus needs to be there, but when the story itself is only 140 pages, it doesn't add much to the final story. I wouldn't mind so much if the story itself were actually good, but this really needed a bit more to it.On a positive note, though, the crew of the Gorkon is very interesting, and I'm looking forward to their series. DeCandido is a good writer (this story not-withstanding) and I think he'll do a good job with it. It highlights the differences between Klingon ships and the Federation ships that we're all familiar with, as well as containing good characters to boot. I have to admit I was surprised by one of the deaths, because I thought that this character was one of the more interesting ones and I was looking forward to seeing the character in the new series. I was touched by the character, and really sorry to see the death. In such a short story that contains so much, that's a rare feat.Overall, the series is very good, but it the final story is a big let down. Speaking specifically about this book, it contains a 4-star story and a 2-star story. Thus, I'll split the difference and make it 3-stars. What a waste.David Roy"},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 2 (Star Trek)","review":"For Voyager fans seeing the pic of Capt Janeway on the cover taking up a full quarter of the front would lead them to believe that 25% or so of the story was decided to her. Not so. For Star Trek fans who have to read EVERY single book, it's a must, but for most, just a mishmash and rehash of old story lines."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 2 (Star Trek)","review":"Star Trek: The Brave and the Bold-Book Two written by Keith R.A.DeCandido is the continuation of the story about four extremely powerful weapons that when they are in the hands of one they wield almost unlimited power.This portion of the story, (part three: The Third Artifact, 2371), takes place several weeks before the Star Trek: Voyager pilot episode \\"Caretaker,\\" and shortly before the Star Trek: The Next Generation novel Double Helix Book four: \\"Quarantine. What I like about this series is that it is fast paced and fills in some timeline gaps and does some character fleshing out, along with a story that spans the whole Trek genre.The artifacts are now called the Malkus Artifacts after an all powerful dictator that rules the Alpha Quadrant some ninety thousand of years ago. Malkus had four items constructed which served as the intruments of his rule. They were devices of impressive power. The devices were able to resist the gravitational forces of the Sun and were unscathed so this ancient culture spread them to remote locations so no one else could use them.Ah, now, comes Starfleet as two of the impressive weapons were found in the first book the second series of two weapons will be found in this book. Part Three involves Captain Kathryn Janeway and the Starship Voyager as they find the third artifact in the demilitarized zone on a shakedown cruise. This device is now in the hands of the Maquis, so Janeway enlists some help from Captain Robert DeSoto of the U.S.S. Hood as Voyager's security chief Lieutenant Tuvok infiltrates the Maquis. This segment moves very quickly and it get your attention till the end.The fourth and final Malkus artifact,(2376), leads to several disappearances throughout the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The fourth part takes place two years prior to Star Trek: Nemesis; it also takes place shortly after the Star Trek: Gateways book series, and a couple of months after the Star Trek-The Next Generation novel \\"Diplomatic Implausibility.\\" Again the author tell a tale well as Captain Jean-Luc Picard joins forces with Captain Klag of the I.K.S. Gorkon and the Ambassadors Spock and Worf are in this book.This book is action-packed-adventure only as DeCandido can deliver. Good reading for the Trek reader, also there are technical specifications for a Qang-Class Defense Vessel and a whole bunch of other story related stuff found in the back of the book.My next book arrived today Star Trek: Nemesis...

It is a hokey premise about the discovery of mysterious alien artifacts, &quot;Malkus Artifacts&quot;, which are the last vestiges of a power-hungry ruler and a civilization dating from 90,000 years before the 24th Century. The first half is a somewhat engaging look at the discovery of the third of these artifacts, featuring Captain Robert DeSoto of the USS Hood and Lieutenant Tuvok from USS Yoyager a few weeks prior to Voyager's ill-fated mission in the Badlands. It also includes some riveting scenes with members of the Maquis. The second half is a disappointing reunion of Colonel Kira Nerys, Ambassador Worf, Ambassador Spock and Admiral McCoy as they fall under the spell of the fourth artifact, found on the Klingon colony world Narendra III. This was a quick diversion on a long New York City subway ride."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 2 (Star Trek)","review":"In this one we get to see how Tuvok and Chakotay got involved with the Maquis.

I found the Voyager section (which was first, not second, as I had assumed it would be) made me miss the show a little. For the final section (TNG) I wasn't so certain about the all powerful artifact everyone was so afraid of. A mind control device should have been very threatening... but it really wasn't. I felt more worry over some of the other devices in some of the other timelines. But the section concludes the books well and wraps everything up near the end. It also has some very good character exchanges and I was happy to have a good portion of the book take place from a Klingon perspective.This was a good, easy read that will take you back into memories of shows you hadn't realized you'd missed."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 2 (Star Trek)","review":"Although I have rated each book of this series at 4 stars, I have to say that this one was noticeably the better of the two; while book one was closer to three stars than five, this is just the reverse. If you're going to read just one of these two books, it should definitely be this one rather than book one; entirely aside from the fact that one can much more easily do without reading book one, and treat the events there as \\"offscreen\\" background to this book than one can deal with missing the ending provided here, this is just generally a better-written book with better plots. I dock it a star (barely) for the fact that the success of the heroes seems a bit improbable given what they were facing; the power of the opposition should, by all rights, have been insuperable. The explanations as to why this was possible seemed a stretch. Still, the story was a good one."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 2 (Star Trek)","review":"This book was awesome! If you had always wanted to know what happened in the weeks prior to Star Trek: Voyager's pilot episode &quot;Caretaker,&quot; this is the book for you.

It often takes three readings of a Mandelstam poem to get why it was written---not what it is about, please---but WHY it was written. That is what you look for. After that the sense of the poem will appear. Well, Robert Lowell's imitations of Mandelstam are impressive, especially of the Stalin poem. However, in THE COMPLETE POEMS OF ROBERT LOWELL, there are only a dozen or so Mandelstam poems while the Brown/Merwin book has 97 pages of poems, along with a long forward. If you have any sense you will leap from this book to Nadezhda Mandelstam's HOPE AGAINST HOPE and HOPE ABANDONED---the story of her husband Osip's murder by Stalin. These two books have an inner light beyond praise and are two of the last century's greatest prose works---and they are marvelously translated by Max Hayward (who elsewhere has been battered for his early first English translation of ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH; nonetheless his Nadezhda Mandelstam works could not be bettered). A warning: once you get into twentieth-century Russian poetry and especially Marina Tsvetaeva and Anna Akhmatova you will find yourself drunk with agonies. These poets lived through societal horrors under Stalin that you can't grasp without reading Nadezhda Mandelstam. We have nothing in English like twentieth century Russian poetry. By the way, you will want the New York Review of Books Classics paperback edition of OSIP MANDELSTAM: SELECTED POEMS (by Merwin/Brown expanded). Well, while I'm at it let me say THE COMPLETE POETRY OF OSIP EMILIEVICH MANDELSTAM in English by Burton Raffel and Alla Burago from State University of New York Press (353 pages) has literal translations---perhaps closest of anyone's to Mandelstam's Russian originals---and yet the least poetic versions. But I should tell you as well that when Mandelstam himself translated Petrarch's sonnets, the Russian reader couldn't find any Petrarch after the first lines, the poems had been so Mandelstamized in Russian. So Mandelstam would have nothing against Merwin's Merwinized English versions (or Lowell's imitations). Here are a few lines of Merwin for you to compare with the Raffel/Burago literal verses. This poem is called \\"The Last Supper\\" and is about Da Vinci's great fresco:The heaven of the supper fell in love with the wall.It filled it with cracks. It fills them with light.It fell into the wall. It shines out therein the form of 13 heads. (Merwin/Browm)Supper-sky adoring the wall--wounded, scar-bright sky--falling into her, flaring,turned into 13 heads. (Raffel/Burago)This is just the first stanza of the poem. I am happy indeed to have the COMPLETE MANDELSTAM from Raffel/Burago but I find the literal short lines too crowded; like fruitcake, enough's enough---although as I say these sharp-cut lines may be closer to the original. And the WHY of why did Mandelstam write this poem may come through more strongly in these brilliant little facets rather than in the longer lyrical line of Merwin/Brown. Take your choice!--although it's grand to have both. And let me end on one last note: Nadezha Mandelstam, who admireed Solzynitsin's IVAN DENISOVICH thought the death camp described in this work (drawn from Solzynitsin's imprisonment in the middle forties) is a day at the beach beside the camp Mandelstam was sent to in the late thirties."},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Reading poetry in translation is somewhat risky. This widely praised selection covers much of Mandelshtam's career and represents much of his most important poetry. These are fluent English versions of the originals with many striking turns of phrase. Mandelshtam's work, however, is not easy to read. Sometimes cryptic and densely allusive, often with classical allusions, quite a few poems are hard to follow. Many of the later poems from the 30s are more direct."},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"These translations of Mandelstam's poems are not so much Mandelstam as they are W.S. Merwin channelling Mandelstam. I prefer Clarence Brown's translations in his critical study of 1972, Mandelstam. The problem with Brown's book is that it doesn't include any of Mandelstam's poems written in the 1930s. This book, on which Brown and Merwin collaborated, does, and for that reason it is valuable. It is valuable for another very good reason. It includes Mandelstam's very interesting long critical essay on \\"The Divine Comedy,\\" \\"Conversation About Dante,\\" translated by Clarence Brown and Robert Hughs. This essay struck me as being important, not because of what it says about Dante whom I have not read, but because it seems to me to offer insight into understanding Mandelstam's own poetry or at least his method. Here are a few suggestive quotations:Poetic speech is a crossbred process, and it consists of two sonorities.The first of these is the change that we hear and sense in the veryinstruments of poetic speech, which arise in the process of its impulse.The second sonority is the speech proper . . . . (103)Understood thus, poetry is not a part of nature . . . . Still less is ita reflection of nature, . . . but it is something that . . . settles downin a new extraspatial field of action, not so much narrating nature asacting it out by means of its instruments, which are commonly calledimages. (103)In poetry only the executory understanding has any importance, and notthe passive, the reproducing, the paraphrasing understanding. (104)External explanatory imagery is incompatible with the practice ofinstruments. (104)I hope these few quotes give you some idea of what Mandelstam was doing or trying to do when he created poems and will inspire you to want to read more of what he had to say in this essay. I will leave you with one last tidbit, which Mandelstam applied to Dante, but which I will apply to Mandelstam: \\"The labor of reading [Mandelstam] is above all endless, and the more we succeed at it the farther we are from our goal.\\" (107)"},{"Title":"The Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"MANDELSTAMWe do not know the way to the darkness of the wordor the excellent silenceconcealed inside our poemswe only know the drumbeat of our own painand the flickering madness of a land's best lights lostAll we are and can beis a poemthat will never come home again.Stalin's death is Russia's lifeThe man Mandelstam murderedHis poems living still."},{"Title":"The Elm and the Expert: Mentalese and Its Semantics (Jean Nicod Lectures)","review":"Fodor's task in EAE is to try and harmonize the following three beliefs: (1) Psychological laws exist and they necessarily include reference to entities like beliefs, desires, and the like; (2) The semantic content of such entities is determined by the causal relations that exist between intentional states and whatever object in the external world reliably causes them; and (3) Mental processes are computational processes; i.e., our minds are just very complicated symbol manipulators. The problem that arises for whoever holds all three of these views is that, apparently, (3) requires that intentional states be fixed by their *internal* relations, and (2) requires that intentional states (or at least their content anyway) be individuated by *external* relations. Oops. So, Fodor tries to find a way in which mental content can be externally fixed and reliably computationally implemented.He claims that the coinstantiation of broad content with its computational implementers is both reliable and explicable, but metaphysically contingent. The book is divided into four lectures. In the first lecture, Fodor outlines the above problem and his proposal. In the second lecture, Fodor argues that it is plausible to believe that a mechanism exists which keeps broad mental content stuck to its computational implementers. He further claims that one who holds a broad view of content ought to treat Putnam and Frege cases as accidents. In fact, he claims that both broad and narrow views of content must maintain that Frege cases, though common, are unsystematic and exceptional in terms of how people normally behave. Put differently, both internalist and externalist views of content must allow that people tend to recognize the relevant identities in cases that are relevant to their behavior (e.g., Smith wants to go to Chicago, Chicago is where air tedium flies to...).Fodor devotes the third lecture to treating cases in which it is not true that concepts that carry the same information are always coextensive. Most specifically, he deals with Quine's question of why \\"rabbit: means \\"rabbit\\" and not \\"undetached proper parts of a rabbit.\\" In the final lecture, Fodor applies his theory to epistemology Here (and only here) does the reader get a sense of why Fodor is trying to make these theories work. Basically, he thinks that eliminativism is obviously false and a serious dualism is miraculous- but Fodor doesn't believe in miracles. So, a naturalized theory of mental representation is the only way out. (On a side note, he *does* believe that minds are \\"hopeful monsters\\"- see chapters 14 and 15 of his \\"In Critical Condition\\" and also his chapter in James K. Beilby, ed., \\"Naturalism Defeated?\\")Given my purposes in this review I won't provide arguments against Fodor's view. However, I don't buy (2) and (3) above, and thus don't need to answer the same kinds of problems Fodor does. Overall, the read-worthiness of the book is directly proportional to the degree that one: (a) is a fan of an informational semantics and a computational psychology and wants to see how they *might* be harmonized, (b) disagrees with either or both of these views but wants to see a rigorous argument for an opposing view, and (c) is generally interested in the relationship between mind and language, and has a high degree of aptitude (or at least ambition) for reading analytic philosophy. Also, depending on one's interests, different readers will derive differing degrees of benefit from any given chapter. Personally, I am very interested in the material covered in chapters one, three, and four but couldn't give a rip about the material in the third chapter.As for the presentation itself, I thought Fodor could have done a better job of explaining the dilemma for (2) and (3) above. I'm pretty new to this particular area of the philosophy of mind, and it took me about four read-throughs and some close outlining before I really began to get what Fodor was saying. Maybe I'm not as sharp as most who will read this book, but either way, the subject material is difficult enough. Being as pedantic as possible might've helped here.At any rate, The Elm and the Expert is a high-quality, high-level work in analytic philosophy of mind and language. It definitely isn't for everybody-not even for most philosophers, I think-but it should prove illuminating for those willing and able to give it a careful reading."},{"Title":"The crossing","review":"if you like the A&amp;E movie, this book answers lots of questions left unanswered and is quite interesting--by the same writer as the screenplay"},{"Title":"The crossing","review":"if you remember freedom road, you'll like this retelling of washington's recrossing the delaware river--with a new introduction by 85 year old howard fast"},{"Title":"The crossing","review":"I bought this after seeing the A&amp;E movie and I really enjoyed it.

If Howard Fast could write such great dialogue for the screenplay, I'm not sure why he didn't do it for the book itself. I believe it would have had a more readable flow to it. It couldn't seem to decide if it was a novel or a factual narrative. His historical notes in the back were more interestingly told than the &quot;story&quot; itself.

Yet it provides readers with a view of Liberace's personal life as seen through the eyes of former lover Scott Thorson, only 18 years old when he met the famous entertainer. Liberace went to outrageous lengths to protect his public image as that of a confirmed heterosexual bachelor entertainer, yet ironically Thorson and the gay community watching one of Lee's Vegas shows knew the truth right off the bat. I believe Thorson's book is the first one that spoke of Lee's lifestyle, dispelling all the carefully constructed myths by Lee's PR people and by the entertainer himself. Thorson writes about how Liberace's circle of friends and employees always jostled for position with the entertainer; how these cronies resented Scott's position with the famous star. You can see that Thorson developed a great affection and love for Liberace; however, Liberace, ever the Svengali, goes to extremes to remake Scott in his own image with fancy clothes, jewelry, and plastic surgery, which proves to be Thorson's undoing. A life of excitement, mega-shopping sprees, expensive gifts and largesse, turns into one of isolation, betrayal and drug addiction. Thorson was responsible for exposing Lee's true lifestyle to the public and was entangled in a 4-year lawsuit which he settled, upon learning that Lee had HIV. It would be easy to look upon this book as a celebrity trashing by a bitter lover, but fortunately Thorson never stoops that low. He still maintains great affection for Lee, even when he details the bitterness and battles of their relationship."},{"Title":"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace","review":"The book is closer to the truth than one might think. I first met Scott and Liberace through one of my dearest friends, Ray Arnett, who produced and directed the Liberace Show for 30 years. He said he always felt sorry for Scott and that he (Scott) was treated very badly by Liberace, who had foolish and unrealistic expectations of a young, well spoken, handsome boy less than half his age.The book is specifically NOT about the Liberace Show, nor does it pretend to be great literature. It tells honestly, the story of how a 10 year relationship between a closeted super-star and a teenaged dog-sitter came to be, how it survived and how it finally devolved amidst a backdrop of the glitz & whirl of the '80s and a society decimated by a poorly understood disease called AIDS. It would be a common and uninteresting tale had it not involved two men, a great deal of money, mob connections and, by the standards of Europe and Canada today, constituted a 10 year marriage.The movie (of the same name) is shooting right now and is due to be released in 2013. It stars Matt Damon as Scott and Michael Douglas as Liberace. If it sticks to the book as intended, it will be both a conscientious statement on gay marriage rights in the US as well as an entertaining event.I paid $14.00 for the hard cover and it is signed by the author.Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace"},{"Title":"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace","review":"\\"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace\\" is the involving book written by Scott Thorson who was at first Lberace's driver then ultimate lover. Few in the 1980's will ever forget the scandal that erupted when Scott filed suit against Liberace for wrongfully firing him in 1982. That suit finally brought public attention to Liberace's true sexuality, something Liberace tried hard to hide for most of his life either because he was ashamed of who he was or he didn't want the public to turn on him.The book is a well-written story of how Liberace met in 1977, their eventual relationship and how Scott was thrown out of Liberace's life not just by the legendary singer, but those miscreants who worked for him.Scott writes the book with fondess of the star, yet truthfully tells the true story of what happened between them both and how leaving Lee (as Liberace was called) probably saved Scott's life as Liberace died from AIDS in 1987.In 2013 HBO will air an amazing movie with the same title as this book starring Oscar winners Michael Douglas as Liberace and Matt Damon as Scott Thorson that has already started people talking."},{"Title":"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace","review":"I don't know how much of the information in this book is true or just seen from Scott Thorson's point of view, but it was a very interesting read.

It's hard to believe so many years have passed since Liberace's death."},{"Title":"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace","review":"This review refers to \\"Behind The Candelabra: My Life With Liberace\\" by Scott Thorson with Alex Thorleifson...Reading this book was like reading the journal of some jilted lover who could not move on with their life. Liberace died in 1987. This book was first published in 1988. Scott Thorson, Liberace's young lover for five years, did not waste much time in selling his \\"story\\" to publishers. And as he said in this book, he did it for the money.Thorson starts off with some good biographical info on the life of Liberace. His family and background quite interesting. He then tells about how he met and spent 5 years living with Liberace, often making himself out to be a martyr for putting up with the great and beloved entertainer. He tells of the good years, when all was fresh and new. How he took the place of Liberace's former \\"friend\\", how he was lavished with gifts from the man, became part of the act, and even had plastic surgery so he would be the image of Liberace(this according to Thorson at the request Liberace). He goes into quite some detail on the lifestyle and what it was like to be the lover of a man so adored by millions.He also manages to make it read as if he were complimenting Liberace, and then in the very next sentence would throw in some snipe, all the time saying, that he really loved the man and still does as of the writing of the book.He talks of intimate details of Liberace's life that should have remained private. This occurred quite often. He tells of his own fall into drug abuse towards the end of the relationship, and seems to make it sound like it wasn't his fault that he became an addict, or that he couldn't get a job on his own because of it. He blames everyone around him and gives the impression that that is what had become of him after living with the star for almost 5 years. I mean, doesn't Thorson have a mind of his own; otherwise, how did he manage to write this book?The breakup was tough and messy. He was strong-armed out of the penthouse apartment of Liberace's where he was holed up. Thorson claiming Liberace was holding his things ransom in order to get him to sign legal documents that he would then leave the entertainer alone. This may be true, but one also has to remember that he had nothing when he met Liberace in the first place. A slew of Legal battles went on for 5 years, with more suits then I can remember being filed by anyone and everyone involved, even as Liberace was dyeing of AIDS. An undisclosed settlement finally reached.If you are a fan of Liberace, you will be quite put off by this book. If you are looking for an Enquirer type vengeful and gossipy story(Thorson also mentions other entertainers and their private affairs as well) you will certainly find that here.A bitter tell-all,and frankly one that may be a little hard to swallow.

I've always loved reading about the entertainment world and Lees books were a wonderful source of joy. His great enthusiasm for life and his showbiz world were a delight to read about as well as the great joy Lee gave to his audiences during his performances which I have been fortunate to attend. His story about recovering from illness early in his career and his continued rise in the entertainment world is a great read. Scott Thornson opens up this world through his book. Scott tells his story both candidly and with great feeling. His love and respect come through. It was a fascinating look 'behind the candelabra'...and I enjoyed reading the book immensely. I felt the book was written in a most professional and human way...and I read his story with an open mind. What Lee, or Scott for that matter, did is now in the past and doesnt take away from the great legacy Lee left. I very much enjoyed reading Scotts book for a peak into a world where 'too much of a good thing..is wonderful'' As Scott says in the final pages...there is a lesson here to learn...and Scott tells how he learned some serious lessons himself. Yes, Lee should have never ended on such a 'sour note'...not for one as giving as he....not for one with such a zest for life and a great talent to give....and Scott shared those few years with us telling us both the good, bad and sometimes shocking elements."},{"Title":"Behind the Candelabra: My Life With Liberace","review":"I bought this book (used) via this website, following a brief research of the man and his music. It was one of those books that was hard to put down once I started reading it. It gives you everything you'd want to know - and then some. It is better than the best of the juicy, scandalous of stories filled with illicit drugs, sex, and prostitution; the \\"National Enquirer\\" at its' scandalous best.One of the things I found the most ludicrous about the book and its author is the fact that Thorson, who spared no detail in providing us with the most detailed account of his sexual escapades with Liberace - the only detail spared were the actual measurements of Liberace's 'manhood'. Yet, in stark contrast, just a mere 13 years following the release of this book, Thorson appeared on Larry King Live and told how he, not surprisingly, has \\"found God\\" - as though God were a child lost in the woods in need of rescue.One cannot help but to feel somewhat sorry for the book's author. After all, at the young and impressionable age of 18, he was lured into the lair through an expanse expression of fame, wealth, and power. One cannot help but to come away from reading this book and feel (aside from the great overwhelming sense that you need to take a shower after reading something so downright dirty) that Liberace was nothing short of a pedophile in disguise. His insatiable desire for sex with men who were scores of decades younger than he is proof enough for me that he'd have gotten it on with a very young boy if it were legal to do so.Definitely not the book you'd want to choose for your 'family reading library', nor is it a book that you should read if you're offended by graphic details of sordid homosexual sex and accompanying affairs.Conclusion: It sheds the truest light possible on one of the most prominent figures in entertainment history - but is one that I wished that I'd let slip by.Thank you for reading my take on the book.

But gradually, Binding draws us closer to the center of his story -- the tragedy that existed behind the quiet walls of his childhood home and the seething restlessness of the ordinary working-folk who were his neighbors. The second half of the novel gels, picks up speed, and the reader forgets all the apparent blind alleys and red herrings of the first chapters. The flashbacks are relentless, but skillfully employed.Truthfully, this was probably meant to be several novels, or perhaps several short stories ... but they work together to paint a vivid portrait of English life in the post-war decades, up to the present time."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","review":"Washington Irving's A Knickerbocker's History of New York is the single funniest book in American literature. Despite a weak and too-lengthy opening segment on the origin of life and other awkward philosophical questions (the merits of this section are addressed by Irving/Knickerbocker in volume two), once the Dutch colonize the ancient island of Manhattoes (present-day Manhattan), Irving hits a rollicking gallop, going full stride at full speed and doesn't stop until the dubious William the Testy is vanquished at the first volume's end.\\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\" was arguably the greatest of the several personae Irving adopted during the course of his long writing career. 'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentances Irving/Knickerbocker could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature and our early writers, we turn to names like Hawthorne and Poe, forgetting that Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans. (It was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe.) Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined). Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. As Americans, we owe the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade we neglect to pay or acknowledge.Knickerbocker's History of New York is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating. Humorists will find it a page-turning delight, and send their volumes of Twain back to the library post-haste...."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","review":"In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A history of New York: From the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","review":"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book. However, today, the average reader will find it to be long-winded. The introduction is actually the first 5 chapters, at least. I gave up after chapter 5."},{"Title":"A Hasty Marriage","review":"First why I liked the book - Although Lord Arundale (Simon) is the typical Regency hero - bitter from unrequited love - there are some non-typical situations. He is trying to look out for the wife of his friend (Helene) and to avoid being caught sneaking around he slips into an empty room. Only it's not empty - it's inhabited by Alexandrina (Drina) Alcott, poor relation to other houseguests. Guess who gets caught? Simon offers a marriage of convenience. Thoroughly compromised, Drina has no alternative but to accept the man she is secretly fond of. Drina, with the help of Helene, becomes fashionable and Simon continues breeding his horses. She hosts wonderful parties attended by the cream of the ton and Simon is proud of her but maintains his distance. Drina comes to believe Simon's mistress is Helene and how that affects her relationship to both husband and friend is interesting. Helene is harboring a secret - a secret that brings intrigue and danger to Lord Arundale's estate. Throw in a severe grandmother and some situations become downright unbearable for our heroine.Remember this book was written in the 70s and contains some gratuitous violence towards women. Thank goodness more recent books of this genre are no longer like this. Drina confronts Simon about something his grandmother said to her and calls the grandmother a witch. (Really two pages later and I still didn't get what she was so insulted about!) Simon slaps her and off Drina runs to her room. Enter Simon, repentant with a cool rag for her face and there are mutual apologies -which leads to a kiss which leads to consummation of the marriage. Would you feel loving after a good slap & what did she have to apologize for???Good for a quick read. If not for the slap, would have enjoyed it better."},{"Title":"Cook Japanese","review":"This is a great cookbook from 1964. There are no fusion techniques, no photos of dishes that you could never match at home, and really no bells and whistles.So what does it have?Real Japanese cooking that is simple and practical to prepare and serve. Its an old Japanese cookbook so the recipes haven't been changed or localized for Western tastes.Here's what is has.Chapters onParty FoodAppetizersEgg DishesRice DishesFishChickenBeefPorkGround MeatDessertsand small sections in the back on origami, basic sauce recipes, and a short glossary.It starts off with what is generally viewed as everyone's favorite, Sukiyaki.The recipe is on one page and a photo of two people cooking and eating Sukiyaki is on the other page. When you viewed both, you get a complete picture.Each recipe follows the same pattern.The name, followed by a brief introduction, ingredients, Untensils and equipment, method, and variations.This book covers a wide variety of Japanese recipes such as yakitori to takara-mushi (pumpkin soup served inside a small Japanese pumpkin.)The photos actually help in this cookbook. They show the many different types of plates to use, as well as, how to garnish each dish. Of coarse you can add your own artistic touches but its still nice to get an idea of presentation.There are a few recipes missing that I love like Hiroshima Okonomiyaki and Unagi-don and all the different don buri. Still, you do get a nice selection.The author is Doi Masaru from Shikoku who studied at the nearby Osaka Cooking school. He was a chef for the Japanese Navy during World War II. After that he stated the Kansai Kappo Gakuin (which has changed its name to Doi Masaru Ryori Gakko (Doi Mararu's Cooking School.)This is a nice little compact hardcover book published by Kodansha International and it won the International Kochkunst Ausstellung Prize.I think that anyone who wants to start cooking Japanese food should take a look at this book. Its not as thorough as Tsuji's Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art, is more of a introduction."},{"Title":"Paris Babylon: The Story of the Paris Commune","review":"Rupert Christiansen has written an historical account that is also a &quot;great read&quot;; hard to put down and very enlightening.

This is incorrect; only a relatively small part of the book deals with the Commune, while the major part describes life in the Second Empire of Louis Napoleon and the Siege of Paris during the war. I couldn't help but draw parallels to current Western culture while reading about Paris in the 1860s: creation of incredible wealth and its ostentatious display, pioneering techniques of entrepreneurship, rapid developments in transportation and communication, rampant cynicism among the intellectuals, popular fascination by the news media with private lives and notorious murders, and a very public decline in sexual morality. The author covers the sociology, the history, and the politics in a very smooth combination of original sources and his own narrative.

The commune's ascendancy and collapseis related as a compelling chronology. His fine writingbrings out the french pompousness that lead to the franco-prussian war; the siege of Paris; the state of denial thatheld to the last days among the upper class; the state of terrorand famine of the lower class; and the ultimate collapseof the commune and eventual slaughter of the communards.As one who has lived in Paris, I highly recommend it even ifyou don't traditionally read history books."},{"Title":"Paris Babylon: The Story of the Paris Commune","review":"I found this book lacking. The author spends an inordinate amount of time on a murder which was okay reading but way too long. I read on and on and on... I became very annoyed as I kept reading about the sensationalist murder. Some of the book was very interesting, but if you want to read about the Paris Commune itself you will be very disappointed, as only one chapter or so deals with it. I came away feeling ripped off."},{"Title":"Paris Babylon: The Story of the Paris Commune","review":"March 18th every year is the anniversary of the establishment of the Paris Commune in 1871. That event rightly takes its place in an honored position in the revolutionary pantheon and is commemorated, especially in Paris, as such. Why? As the founder of scientific socialism, Karl Marx, noted in his spirited defense of the Commune against the raging reaction of capitalist Europe and the faint-hearted in the international labor movement at the time this was the first, trembling expression of the \`dictatorship of the proletariat'-the time of working class rule. That it was crushed quickly by that same capitalist Europe and repressed thoroughly does not take away from the grandeur of the experience. Historians have rightly taken it as a seminal event in late 19th century European history. The book under review takes up the narrative around the establishment of the Commune in an interesting way.The study of history like other major scholarly disciplines goes through cycles and, frankly, fads concerning the important lessons of any period and about what and who to emphasize or not emphasize. This book belongs in the camp of the social micro-history school where setting up the milieu is decisive for interpreting the sequence of events. The author has done a creditable job of setting the milieu of the Second Empire in France under the dyspeptic Louis Bonaparte and his entourage, including his demanding and, at times, bizarre wife. Moreover he sets the scene by a rather vivid, and perhaps too vivid, detailing of Parisian manners, mores, cuisine, architecture and other cultural phenomena which point menacingly to the disastrous military overconfidence and woeful under preparedness that was about to occur in 1870 when confronted by the Prussians.Less satisfactory is his analysis of the enigmatic but politically clever Louis Bonaparte and the social base on which his regime rested. Karl Marx did a much more thorough, if more polemical, analysis on that base of mainly rural farmers and their political dependents who stuck by Bonaparte to the end in his classic exposition of historical materialism, the 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. Also the author's narrative of the establishment and crushing of the Paris Commune does not lend itself to drawing any lessons from the experience. While the author is notovertly hostile to the Commune he is clearly no friend, and makes no bones about it. Seemingly the Communards got what they deserved, or at least what they should have expected. If you want to get an in-depth analysis of those lessons you must look elsewhere, especially if you are looking for the implications for future revolution strategy for the 20th century Marxist movement. With those shortcomings in mind if you want a good literary Inside Edition-like social travelogue of Paris in the third quarter of the 19th century this is as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"Paris Babylon: The Story of the Paris Commune","review":"Wittily told and extensively researched, this brief account of the Second Empire, the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune has two special merits. First, it is more sociological than ideological: Christiansen aims neither to condemn nor exalt the revolutionary Communards or the Versaillais who tried (and ultimately succeeded) to destroy them, but rather to understand all sides. He is of course appalled by the atrocities, a few by the communards (much exaggerated by Versailles propaganda, but there were some) and far more by the Versailles government troops, especially during the semaine sanglante and following, but such horrors by one side do not necessarily justify the decisions and confusions by the other. The book's second great virtue is its descriptions of curious aspects of Paris and Louis Napoleon's II Empire on the eve of the series of disasters that destroyed it: war with Prussia, then the siege of Paris and finally the Commune. There is a brief account of Baron Haussmann's transformation of the city's space, and its unintended social and economic consequences. And the chapter, \\"The Spermal Economy,\\" on French medical opinion and prejudices about sex (how much to indulge and how, and how upper-class men used the Op&eacute;ra as their exclusive brothel) is very amusing, though of doubtful relevance to the Commune, whose proletarian defenders' sexual behavior surely had little to do with such official notions. The account of the war is too brief to understand it, and the intense debates among Blanquistes, Prudhonniens and Marxistes, R&eacute;publicains, and monarchists and other conservatives, are merely alluded to.For readers new to the subject, this book provides a lively and fair overview of events, with bibliographic notes for those who want to understand more. And for anyone, its anecdotes and portraits, e.g. of the Empress Eug&eacute;nie and of the pathetic and mysteriously uncommunicative Emperor, or Haussmann and even of the young and insolent Rimbaud (who may or may not have got to Paris during the Commune -- we don't really know) make it a lively and suggestive addition to the bibliography."},{"Title":"Paris Babylon: The Story of the Paris Commune","review":"This book has been described as a \\"social history of the late Second Empire\\" by its publisher, but that may not be the best way to describe the book. It is really the story of the decay and subsequent collapse of the Emperor Louis-Napoleon and Empress Eugenie's Second Empire, the ill-fated Franco Prussian War, the Siege of Paris, the Paris Communes and then the rebuilding and recovery of newly re-republicanized Paris. Christiansen is an excellent writer and seems to have no particular axe to grind, something rare in studies of this era of French history. He describes the authoritarian dictatorship of the Second Empire, its rebuilding and modernization of Paris under Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine, and the combination of decadence, poverty and glamor that marked the day. Christiansen is a gifted story-teller and the book moves briskly to the rioting in the streets, the brief life and sudden death of the communards and the rebirth of the city. He has an ear for the telling anecdote and so the stories included in the text are colorful and vivid. Paris-Babylon is aptly titled and is perhaps the most readable account of the end of the Second Empire I have yet come across."},{"Title":"Old Testament Theology: Israel's Gospel (Vol. 1)","review":"Now that the third and final volume of John Goldingay's tremendous work is now available, one can properly assess just what he has left us with. The short answer is this: it is simply a magisterial effort. It is a first class work which will be irreplaceable for many years to come.It is simply amazing for a variety of reasons, not least of which is its massive length. The three volumes comprise over 2,500 pages (2743 pages to be exact). Bear in mind that in the decade he took to pen this, he also produced a number of other important works, including his equally impressive 3-volume commentary on the Psalms, which totals over 2200 pages! Talk about prolific.This OT theology is simply superb. Goldingay is just utterly steeped in the Old Testament, and has done a superlative job of elucidating its themes, its theology, its vision, its grandeur, and its contents. Almost every aspect of OT studies is entered into here, and he is always up to the task.The first volume focuses on \\"Israel's Gospel\\". It examines the OT narratives from creation to the first coming of Christ. The second volume deals with \\"Israel's Faith\\". This concentrates on the Prophets, the Wisdom writings, and the Psalms. Volume three centres on \\"Israel's Life\\". It examines the ethical, spiritual and worshipping life of Israel.Goldingay is of course a Christian but he argues that we must consider the OT on its own terms. He rightly notes that \\"the Old Testament's insights must be seen in light of those of the New, but only as long as we immediately add that it is just as essential to see the New Testament's insights in light of those of the Old.\\"Or as he says further on, \\"It is inappropriate to describe the New Testament as the \`authoritative interpretation' of the Old without adding that the Old Testament is the authoritative interpretation of the New.\\"Indeed, he reminds us of the vital importance of the OT: \\"only when people have learned to take the Old Testament really seriously can they be entrusted with the story of Jesus.\\" We fail to properly understand the NT gospel unless we have a firm grasp of the OT.Goldingay is more than qualified to tackle this job. He has been for many years Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary, and is one of the world's leading evangelical OT scholars. He has penned numerous important works on OT topics, and this trilogy is in many ways his magnum opus, capping off a distinguished career.Of course other helpful OT theologies written from an evangelical/conservative viewpoint have appeared over recent times. One thinks of John Sailhamer's Introduction to Old Testament Theology (1996); Paul House's Old Testament Theology (1998); and Bruce Waltke's An Old Testament Theology (2007), for example.But this is by far the most comprehensive, the most detailed and the most incisive work going. Anyone wanting to master the OT needs this superb set. Mind you, I find myself disagreeing with the author on a regular basis. For example, he is quite open to freewill theism, and thus his take on such areas as divine omniscience and impassibility will not please everyone.But he certainly gets one thinking, and he is always careful to tentatively - and respectfully - push what might be considered controversial topics. His many decades of careful scholarship and theological awareness, combined with a more than capable writing style, make this work a pleasure to read and a joy to contemplate.If you get only one Old Testament theology, get this three volume work."},{"Title":"Old Testament Theology: Israel's Gospel (Vol. 1)","review":"I would like to thank InterVarsity Press Academic for graciously providing these review copies.John Goldingay is the David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary. His other other works include Theological Diversity and the Authority of the Old Testament, God's Prophet, God's Servant: A Study in Jeremiah 40-55, a three volume commentary on the Psalms (V. 1, V. 2, V. 3) in the Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms, a commentary on the Minor Prophets in the New International Bible Commentary series, a two volume lay level commentary on Genesis (V. 2), a commentary on Daniel in the WBC series, and the other volume in the Old Testament Theology series Vol. 3: Israel's Life.This is the first of three volumes that will certainly be remembered as Goldingay's magnum opus. This first installment, Israel's Gospel traces the story of Israel from Genesis to the Return from Exile to examine the history and its narrative interpretation by the scribes of Israel. We see not only in the title of this work, but also in Goldingay's explicit discussion and the final chapter concerning the coming of Jesus that he is interested in writing a Christian Old Testament theology. This does not mean a theology where the text of the Old Testament is read to affirm one's theological or exegetical convictions about the New Testament, but one that does not pretend to be a objective reader and interpreter. He also seeks to construct the proper understanding of the Old Testament as the lens through which Jesus and the rest of the New Testament is read. Overall, Goldingay's purpose is to write his understanding of Old Testament theology, not to argue against or provide substantial interaction with others, though he certainly seems aware and understanding of them. In addition, both of the first two volumes are written in what you might call a Hebrew way. It is clear that Goldingay has been deeply influenced in his writing by his reading and immersion of the \`First Testament' and his style of description is reminiscent of the narrators themselves.In forming his description of Israel's Gospel Goldingay uses the built in plot markers of the Old Testament narrative to form his own chapters: \\"Creation\\", \\"From Eden to Babel\\", \\"Israel's Ancestors\\", \\"The Exodus\\", \\"Sinai\\", \\"The Land\\", \\"From Joshua to Solomon\\", \\"From Solomon to Exile\\" and \\"Exile and Restoration.\\" In his introductory chapter Goldingay does an excellent job of summarizing this storyline \\"God began. Humanity turned its back on God's instructions, and God started over. God promised, and a family grew. Israel cried out, and God delivered. God sealed, and Israel imperiled. God gave, and Israel took. Israel equivocated, and God accommodated. Israel turned away, and God wrestled. God preserved, and Israel turned back\\" (36).There are two things in particular I found superior about his volume. First, this volume can serve as both a introduction to the history and story of Israel for less educated readers. Most books that deal with the history of Israel are done from either an apologetic stand point or a critical stand point and include much technical, which is important to the scholar, but less relevant to the pastor of educated laymen. Therefore I think it right to call this book a Theological History of Israel, and one that is first rate. Second, Goldingay's commitment to exegesis is clear throughout. He does not allow systematic theological statements to push individual texts beyond what they themselves say and he focuses on the actual contextual meaning of the text for Israel in that time for its meaning without looking for some later typology or cross reference that it may affirm. This is certainly not to say that these are not important areas themselves, but they should grow out of a previous theological reading of the text that focuses on its exegetical meaning. And that is precisely what Goldingay has given us.As a note of critique, I am not sure if Goldingay would identify himself as an evangelical (which is not itself a critique at all), there was a certain lack of engagement with works by mainstream evangelical authors such as Tremper Longman III or Bruce Waltke. After reading I checked and neither appear in bibliography. Much of these two titans of the OT work has been in the poetic and prophetic books, but I know a few times reading where I thought that Waltke could have been considered on Genesis or Longman's work on divine warfare.In the second volume, Israel' Faith, Goldingay focuses on the wisdom books and Psalms. While the first volume tells the story of God and Israel, Goldingay explains the identity of God and Israel in this volume. The fundamental goal of identifying God and Israel is seen in the second and third chapters, but this task overflows into others, which seem to be widely based on the conclusions made in \\"God\\" and \\"Israel\\". These include a chapter on the Exile \\"The Nightmare\\", the Return and beyond \\"The Vision\\", \\"Humanity\\", \\"The World\\", and \\"The Nations.\\"Again, I would bring up two notes of praise and one of critique. In praise, as in the first volume, Goldingay focuses primarily on the final form of the text and its historical situation. Again, this is excellent work. But in this volume, dealing with the material of wisdom and the Psalms Goldingay rightly sees more area to make broader statements of truth and identity. However, curiously with all the wonderful material available in the poetic canon I found \\"The World\\" chapter a bit short. This may be personal preference or the need to not make an already big book even bigger, but the relationship between God and his creation seem to be a large theme of the poetics that could have been discussed in greater detail."},{"Title":"Old Testament Theology: Israel's Gospel (Vol. 1)","review":"This is a lengthy book that is a part of a monumental three volume set. Each text has a different purpose, not just flowing \\"chronologically\\" or \\"canonically\\" through the Old Testament (somewhat ironically, the title of the book is \\"Old Testament Theology,\\" though throughout he calls it the \\"First Testament\\"). Volume 1 focuses on the main story line of the Old Testament all the way through the life of Jesus and the early Church. Rather than \\"seeing Christ in the Old Testament,\\" Goldingay shows the life of Christ and the early Church as flowing from the Old Testament story.I can see two noticeable effects of this approach. First, in telling the story, Goldingay treats texts together that some readers may not customarily think of together. For example, when discussing creation, he brings to bear all of the Old Testament material concerning creation, such as the early chapters of Genesis along with texts about creation in places like Job and Psalms. This may seem pretty standard to some; however, other circles tend to treat Genesis 1 and 2 in isolation from the rest of the Biblical material about creation. Of course, this introduces the reader to some tensions in the creation accounts. Yet Goldingay is comfortable with this (as am I).Another effect is that the main story line is kept in tact without getting caught up in too many details. Those of us who work within a church context are all too familiar with either making commitments ourselves or working with those who make commitments to read through the Bible in a certain time period, whether it be 90 days, one year, or three years. People often abandon these commitments by the time they get to Leviticus if they even make it that far. I think part of the problem is that the overarching story line \\"stalls\\" a bit from roughly midway through Exodus to midway through Numbers. In my own opinion, this material, though important, is less captivating than the overarching narrative.Goldingay's aim is to leave that material for another volume and to attempt to follow the overarching story as closely as possible in this first volume. For many, I think this will be a breath of fresh air."},{"Title":"Old Testament Theology: Israel's Gospel (Vol. 1)","review":"This book presents an idealogy which is very much evangelical.

Not everyone thinks he is right (though I, like most mainstream Edwards scholars, think he is) but every knowledgable scholar realizes that the path to understanding Edwards's metaphysics lies through Lee's work and not around it. The book is densely and carefully written, and at least one graduate student has embarrassed himself in print through failure to read as carefully as Lee wrote. In sum, it is a difficult but totally indispensable book, and whoever is seeking to understand Jonathan Edwards as a thinker must digest it."},{"Title":"The Philosophical Theology of Jonathan Edwards","review":"Sang Hyun Lee's book is the essential text on Edwards's metaphysics.

It deals largely with his relationship with his mother as she deals with cancer (ultimately dying of the disease) and with his homosexuality. It is a very personal and well written book. It does talk some about the experience of being in Rent but focuses more on his family than on the show itself; if your interest is in the show Rent, this might not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I'm a fan of the show... not really a \\"renthead\\" but have seen it a few times (3 I think to be exact) over the past 10 years. I did see Anthony in the orignal cast (SRO) and the original west coast cast.. then again in NYC about 4 years ago. So.. I think I can say I like it... a lot. Anyone reading this review probably has a history with the show.. and a favorable one at that. I read Anthony's book and found him to be a credible author (I wonder if he received any assistance from his brother with the manuscript.. I don't see any acknolwedgement of such in the book). I didn't find the narrative to be smooth and enjoyed the interweaving of his past into this present but he never lost focus on the crux of his story - his relationship with a mother who was dieing way too soon. Added to that were snippets of his growing up, coming out, and Rent story. I wanted more of each of those... how he came to be this child actor... that seems to come out of nowhere but is somewhat extraordinary for a kid from Joliet don't you think. And.. I really wanted more about the evolution of Rent. He was there from the beginning. Where was the story of the evolution of the show? That said.. it's a good read for fans of the genre - musical theater, theater, coming of age and coming out stories and love and loss of a loved one."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I've always enjoyed the way that Anthony Rapp wrote. It was always honest, and beautiful. This book is no exception. I've been eagerly waiting for the release of this book for months. I knew it would just be an amazing read, and I was right. For anybody whose seen Anthony, or read something he wrote, or had the pleasure of speaking with him, you know he is just an amazing, down to earth person, who tries to keep his fans close. This book really lets you in, and share cherished memories. For any fans of RENT, this is a must-read. I had such trouble putting this book down. It is such an emotional book, both happy and sad. Buy this book!!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I initially started to read this memoir because I wanted to get inside of the head of the beloved \\"Mark\\" from RENT. But I got so much more from this incredible life story. The memoir starts of with his RENT audition so it immediately grasps any fans attention and keeps you flipping the pages, but the memoir tells about so much more than just RENT. You learn that Anthony actually had a really hard life. You also learn just how strong of a person he is for being able to deal with. His relationship with his family was always a bit strained, and him moving to New York to pursue an acting career only increased the tension. You really get a feel for just how hard the life of a struggling actor is. He tells about the days where he would wait tables all day waiting for that one call to come in to see if he got the part, or how he hated not being able to fly out as often and be there for his cancer diagnosed mother because he just couldn't afford it. You also develop a really good feel for the many different relationships that he has/had in is life. From his family members, to friends, to past lovers, he does a really great job of SHOWING you the types of relationships he had with people, and not just flat out telling you. I liked that because at times, it felt like you were actually living through him. I love how even though he had an extremely hard and depressing life, the one thing that always brought a bit of joy to it was acting. You always got a sense of true happiness and content whenever he would describe his time with any particular show that he was involved in. That's another thing I love about this memoir, Anthony really goes into detail when he describes his time with the many shows that he was in. He gave a true \\"insiders scoop\\" as to what really goes on behind the curtain, the good, and the bad. He didn't censor anything in this memoir, everything is raw and real, which is one of the reasons why I enjoyed it so much. There was no fluff. Overall, this memoir was extremely enjoyable. I feel that I have a better understanding for the extremely talented Anthony Rapp. This memoir made me feel certain things that I have never felt while reading a book before. I would definitely recommend it, not just for fans of the theater, but for anyone."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This is a very honest, touching memoir. For a fan of the show Rent, it was especially moving to learn more about Jonathon Larson and how the show came to be. I so wish I could have been a fly on the wall to experience those first days of the show and knowing Jonathon. What an amazing story!!! I found Anthony's writing about his relationship with his mother raw, honest and touching. There were moments that I felt as if I was in the room. Not being gay, I find it hard to comment on the gay aspects of the book, but I admire his honesty and I imagine his words may be helpful to other young men dealing with their lives as gay men. The book reads as if Anthony opened his heart and poured it onto the page."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"As a fan of Anthony's work, especially his role as Mark in RENT, I was looking forward to reading his memoir. I must say that I am very glad I bought the book, and very glad I got to meet the man behind it.Anthony can add Author to his list of talents. He's a great actor, a wonderful singer, and his writing keeops you hooked from cover to cover. His narrative is honest, touching, heartbreaking and inspiring all at the same time. I cried as he shared how he felt after Jonathan died, and I could relate to his emotions about his mother.This book is a must read for anyone who has had to deal with losing a loved one, and for anyone who is a fan of RENT. It's also good for those who are struggling with coming out. Anthony's honesty is refreshing, you can tell he's not hiding here and I feel like I know him a lot better now."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Mr. Rapp's story of his experience with the musical Rent, his bittersweet relationship with his mother, and hispersonal journey through trying times is very well written and produces extreme emotional responses in the reader.I read this book through in one sitting and greatly enjoyed re-reading it at a slower pace to abosorb the detail of the narrative.As a Rent fan for the past ten years, this book was a wonderful way to celebrate the show's tenth anniversary. I think anyone that has been touched by the show will be moved by reading Mr. Rapp's personal story. Because of the easy narrative style Mr. Rapp employs, all readers will find themselves engrossed in the tale whether they are familiar with the show and its history or not.Well done Mr. Rapp!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I read the book in 2 days and loved it. I can relate to Anthony in so many ways. My mother has cancer and I am like Anthony was. I hold it all inside and really do not let anyone see that I am huting over it. What am I afraid of? I am not sure. I just know it's not healthy.As a Rent Fan...I was amazed at how much passion Anthony put into his shows. I wish I had a chance to see him. That is why I love the movie so much. It's like I was there.This quote from his book written by his brother will always stay with me. \\"Grief does not expire like a candle or the beacon of a lighthouse. It simply changes temperature\\" - Adam Rapp"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I saw rent and have the dvd and watch it constantly, and I got this book in february. I finished it in one night. Anthony is so honest about everything, he doesnt glorify what he did he just tells people about it. Losing a parent to cancer myself, i know how awful he must have felt. He seems like some one you can just walk up and talk to for like an hour. I am a total musical nut as well. He really writes well. I recommend this book to anyone over about 15, only bvecause of the mature content he writes about, but it is a very good book"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I loved this book. Give it 4 /2 stars actually. Very interesting story of how Anthony joined the cast of RENT. Especially good for us \\"RENTheads\\". Any person intrested in the theatre will be facinated in the process RENT took from a theatre workshop to be a smash Broadway show with comand performances by the President.I was moved to tears by his words as his raw emotions came out in dealing with Jonathan's death.Also included is a very open and honest account of Anthony's sexuality. (a bit to graphic for me at times which is the only reason this is not getting 5 stars) and a very real and moving account of his relationshop with his mother.While I think those involved in the theatre and RENTheads will get the most out of this book. It is a good, very emotional read."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"A truly remarkable life story. Very well written and easy to read.

It touched me!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I had never gotten to see Anthony Rapp in Rent until the movie came out and it was great to finally see him as Mark. Rapp's book is wonderful and touching. It's very well written and made me respect Anthony Rapp even more for what he's done in his life and how he's managed to stay true to himself and stand up for everything he believes.If you like Anthony Rapp or love Rent, you should definitely read this book! I very highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Great book! I loved the style. The flashbacks developed the story wonderfully. I was amazed that this was Anthony's first book. It moved me to tears several times. I believe two of those incidents were on the SUBWAY! Anthony gets extra credit for getting me to show emotion in public :)I took exception to some comments expressing disappointment that this book was too light on RENT content. I don't think that's very fair. I'm a huge RENT fan myself, but this is an autobiography. It reads true to the title - \\"...A Memoir of Life, Love, and the Musical RENT\\". It was amazing to read insights about the development of RENT from a cast member that was there from the workshop days all the way through its tremendous success. However, the book was really about Anthony Rapp's life. RENT was only a part of the whole picture, naturally.I absolutely loved getting to know Anthony. He lets the reader in on very personal moments in his past. The honesty and raw emotion are truly refreshing.Unfortunately, shortly after I finished this book, my cat peed on it. I wish I were joking, but that's why it's on my wishlist! I want to read it again and this is not one I'd be satisfied to borrow.Write us another one, Anthony!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This book brought me to tears several times. There were countless times where i literally had to push the book away from me mid-sentence. I couldn't continue reading because my eyes were just full of tears. This book is just so special and raw and brutally honest, I read it all in one sitting, something I only do when a book completely captures me. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Do yourselves a favour and read this book."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I bought the audio version of this book a few months ago and I enjoyed it immensely. It is exactly what the title says it is: a memoir of Anthony Rapp's life as it has unfolded so far, focusing on his relationship with his mother as she fights a several year-long battle with terminal cancer. Her final illness occurs at the same time Anthony is starring as Mark Cohen in the musical Rent, so there is quite a bit of information on what is going on behind the scenes there, too. Just be aware that this is more of an autobiography with a lot of personal introspection than a book of little-known trivia about \\"Rent\\".The information about Anthony's childhood and adolescence is particularly moving and vivid, as it seems his entire family has a penchant for both denial and bottling up anger and grievances until they reach a boiling point and then explode - sometimes after months or years of fuming. He charts this history back to his maternal grandmother, whom he never knew well but feared all the same, from stories his mother told him about her violent outbursts.Rapp talks about how he wants his mother to accept his bisexuality before she dies, and he has a good deal of material about conversations that they have together in which they dance around as well as actually confront the subject, but it also seems the author himself is in some denial about his true sexual identity. Throughout the book he often talks about how he is attracted to women as well as men, but it seems that with the exception of some adolescent dalliances in high school, almost all of his relationships are long term and all of them are with men, not women. Even in the postscript, Rapp talks about how he and his male partner are living in New York City and hoping to adopt a child. Other than this one issue, though, the author seems to have very good insight into his and his somewhat dysfunctional family's behavior, and he is brutally honest about the various aspects of his life.The parts about the musical \\"Rent\\" itself are very good too. The author talks about the audition process, the evolution of \\"Rent\\" from workshop to Broadway musical, his personal impressions of Jonathan Larson, the author of \\"Rent\\", about how he found out about Larson's death and how it impacted him, about the first performance of the musical after Larson died and the resulting improvisation, the subsequent success of the musical, and the loss of fast friendships as one by one various members of the original cast left the show for other opportunities. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This book is so amazing. In an age when actors and actresses do all they can to keep their past in the past, it is refreshing to see someone who is willing to bare their soul for the entire world to see.As a newly converted RENThead, I love this book for its vivid description of the excitement that is a Broadway production.As an aspiring actor, I appreciate the honesty about what really happens in a production.As a person who has lost a loved one to cancer, I can sympathize with his fear and regret over the death of his mother.I have to admit, it takes a lot to make me cry (I've never cried during Titanic... ever), and there were several times throughout the book when I found myself in tears because I could understand exactly what he was talking about, having been there myself."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This is a great book. I bought it because I've loved Anthony Rapp since the late 80's when I first saw him in one of my absolute favourite movies Adventures in Babysitting (A Night On The Town) as Darryl, the geeky yet loveable best friend of the main character. Little did I know back then he'd become such a great talent on stage and again in film with a terrific voice. His book is emotional and warm and heartbreaking in parts. Very very hard to put down. It's enjoyable and moving and I read it in record time for me - 4 days. I highly recommend it to EVERYONE. There's something in it for everyone and he's written it very well. For anyone who's ever gone through a loss, will be able to relate on some level to this. I really love this (can't stress this enough) and recommend it to you all."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I believe this is a book for a troubled soul who's been through AIDS and cancer. I couldn't help but feel the same fear from when I was only 11 years old. My mother is a 9-year survivor of Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and I guess I'm lucky. It must be harsh to see someone you know going through both AIDS and cancer, both can be a pretty big blow. I believe that love heals a troubled soul, it really does. A remarkable book."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I think this is a great book. It's well-written and emotional. It's a fairly quick read and is better understood if you are familiar with the plot of Rent."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I purchased this book, along with \\"RENT\\" for my daughter's 8th grade graduation, as we are RENT addicts. We love it all. She has now read this book as her requirement for her Summer Reading list for High School - one of which needed to be a biography/autobiography. We were very taken by the story of Anthony Rapp, about his \\"coming out\\" to his beloved Mom, whom he later lost - and all that surrounds this compelling story about Love and Loss. There are important lessons here for everyone, and I felt my adolescent age daughter could appreciate these lessons and issues we all face at different times in our lives. I look forward to other works by Anthony Rapp and wish him, as well as other RENT cast members, who have contributed to our love and understanding of an important segment of our current society."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I'm a Renthead so I was so excited to read this book. I was a little disappointed at first because I found parts of it a little boring. But ultimately I got sucked into Anthony's story and really felt for the losses he had to endure.Worth a read."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"It is easy to say that as a Rent fan, I am completely biased, and this would be true. However, Anthony Rapp has written a memoir that is able to appeal to EVERYONE, which is extremely rare. What I loved most about this book is how refreshingly honest he was about his experiences, and how he told his story in such a way that a friend would. After reading his book, I am an ever bigger fan of Rapp's and look forward to any literary work he may publish in the future.You simply have to read it."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Seller was great in getting this book to me in a timely manner and in gread conditin!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"\\"Without You\\" caught me off guard. I originally picked it up because I am a fan of RENT, and I always like to read books a bit off the beaten path. I discovered a memoir that was much deeper and raw than I had anticipated. Anthony's honesty really fueled the book. His tales of growing up, and the unique family dynamics really made me think about my own familiar relationships. The rise to the Broadway stage is in stark contrast to his increasingly difficult home life. It has quickly become a personal favorite, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a meaningful read."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I expected more about Rent when I bought this book, however it is more about dealing with loss and the experiance Anthony Rapp had during Rent losing his mother. It's still a powerful story - just not the one I expected to read."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"When my friend gave me this book, she threw it at me and said \\"Whatever, I thought it was going to be about RENT, but it's all about him being gay and his mom dying. boo hoo.\\" So I did know it would be less about the actual show, which I was fine with, since I've pretty much memorized the story of RENT and Jonathan Larson.The story is very powerful and moving, and really shows how intense and relevant Anthony's involvement with the show was. This book was a wonderful light into his personal life, emotions, and struggle with his mother's illness. I learned a lot about him, and gained a new respect for him in addition to the love I already had.The writing could've been a little stronger, but alas, he is not a writer. It was well written for the most part, but there was an occasional metaphor that made me go \\"what!?!?\\" and I think the book could've been probably about 50 pages shorter. It did feel like it dragged in places, but overall this was a very powerful story, and I admire Anthony for sharing it with the world as he does."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"What a fantastically written book"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Somewhat hard to follow . . . Had its good and bad moments. Hated that Rapp jumped around, talking about his fame during Rent, his childhood and then back to Rent. Went into graphic details about his sexual life. Very touching moments about his mother and her battle with cancer and the tragic sudden death of Jonathan Larson."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Great read for all of the Rent Heads out there . This book tells the personal side of Anthony Rapp as well as his interaction with the Rent cast ,including Johnathan Larson."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I just finished Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical RENT by Anthony Rapp. Anyone who knows me will testify that I'm a devout RENThead. And as much as I love Jesse, both on Law & Order and his role as Collins in RENT, and as much as I think Adam Pascal is a total hottie, I've always loved Anthony Rapp. There's something so approachable about him. So reading his autobiography was interesting.The title was aptly chosen. Besides being one of the most mournful songs of RENT, Without You is also the theme of the book in general, the parts of Anthony's life he's choosing to show the world. The book begins with Anthony being late to his audition for RENT because he was at a friend's memorial -- the first real loss of his life. Then, the night the play previewed, Jonathan Larson (the writer, and Anthony's friend)died. Throughout the book, Anthony is dealing with the impending death of his mother from cancer, the inability to communicate adequately with any of his family members, and watching the original members of the cast of RENT -- his adopted family, in a way -- all leave the show to pursue other venues. Also, a little more abstractly, he deals with his own problems with adult loving relationships, his bout of self-destructive behavior after his mother's death, his need to not be alone while all this was happening, not for a single night.The whole book was very touching, very real, and most of all -- it was totally unglamorized. Anthony was NOT afraid to show the times he messed up, the times he was uncertain, the times he let people down. This is the story of a normal man, living his personal life as best as he can. His status as a Broadway A-Lister is never mentioned -- in fact, once the show becomes a hit, he avoids mentioning it or his own popularity at all, prefering to focus on his internal and personal life, retreating the book from the stage where it began.I'm now actually kind of upset that I missed the chance to go to the NYC Borders for his book signing. I wish I could sit and chat with him, even for ten minutes, get to know this really amazing man."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I don't even know where to start. Anthony Rapp's book is wonderful! I began reading it between classes and wanted to skip my last class to continue reading! It was so easy to read and so interesting. I was sobbing through the last chapters. This book makes me ashamed of the way our society treats gay people. I just keep thinking about everything and saying wow. I have passed my copy along for friends to read. I can't wait until I have someone to talk about it with. This is a MUST read! It is AMAZING!!!!!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"What a fabulous spilling of the sould. Anthony let it all come out in such stark detail that you could feel his joy but also feel all the pain with him. It is a very easy read, very well written. Thank you Anthony! You have bore your sole in a way that people can relate your feelings to situations in their own lives."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Though his raw and open prose was heartfelt, at times I hoped for a little less repetition of the same words and themes. The repeated mention of crying, sobbing, and slick, hot tears covering his face, for instance, soon left me numb to the real pain behind those tears because it happened so often throughout the book.The detail on his string of former love interests seemed verbose at times. Rapp's description of his tumultuous relationship with Todd seemed especially belabored. The same themes and ideas surrounding the relationship would be present even if some of the prose was cut.Despite this criticism, I would recommend this book to fans of RENT, individuals dealing with grief, adolescents dealing with the confusion of sexual identity, and especially fans of Anthony Rapp."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I have been a fan of Anthony's since I laid eyes on him in RENT on Broadway. He's a wonderful actor who's blessed with a gorgeous and emotive voice, which is now on display in the written word. This is a terrific biogrpahy that's very honest, heartfelt and emotionally involving. I think Anthony's story will inspire anyone who is tyring to find their own way in the world and realize that even with great success comes monumental sorrow and pain--it's ALL in there as part of the human condition.Anthony remains one of the most original people I've ever met--THANK GOD we have him in our lives today!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"80's film buffs will remember Anthony Rapp as Daryl Coopersmith from the cult classic film Adventures in Babysitting. He is now best known for his role as Mark in the play and film Rent. He has written a memoir titled Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent.Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent.It's a very personal book, and as you read it you feel like you are reading from Anthony's personal journal.Anthony grew up just south of Chicago in Joliet, Illinois. He grew up in a close tight knit family held firmly together by his mother Mary. His mother nourished his acting spirit and was very proud of his early stage work in an early production of Oliver. It was also his mother who supported him when he filmed Adventures In Babysitting.The book begins with Anthony living in New York with his brother pursuing his acting career. Anthony is pleased to quit his Starbucks job when he is offered a role in an early incarnation of Rent. The pay is not very good, but Anthony is glad to be working in theater again. The play is great and when it ends Anthony wishes the experience could have lasted. In the midst of early Rent, Anthony has to deal with his mother's sudden illness. Anthony's mother is fighting cancer. When Rent goes back into production Anthony jumps at the chance and is pleased that Jonathon Larson, the plays writer, has written new songs with his voice in mind. Anthony is living well and good and looking forward to Rent opening again when suddenly Jonathon dies suddenly the night before the play opens. Despite the tragedy, Anthony and the Rent cast continue the production.Without You isn't a book just about Rent. However, if you are a Rent fan Anthony shares intimate details about his affiliation with the play. In addition to detailing the grief of dealing with his mother's cancer and eventual death, Anthony also shares intimate details about his sexuality, including when he realized he was gay, and early stories of teenage experimentation."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I wasn't sure what I expected out of this book I just new I had recently saw the movie Rent and loved it. Anthony was the main character in the movie so I thought I would find out a lot of backstage gossip about the play. I did find out some nice information about the making of the play and about Jonathan Larson the creator. Mr Rapp has had an interesting life I didn't know he had started acting at a young age. He went though a lot with the death of his mother. I think a lot of people will understand the things he went through.In all I found the whole book very interesting."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I was blown away by this book! I thought that it would be just boring, and that I'd get 12 pages in, put it down, and never read it again. But it was quite the opposite. In only 2 days, I had red to page 120! Anthony Rapp has a way of drawing you in with his writing and not letting you go. Putting it down was one of the biggest challenges with this book! It is a surprisingly easy and fast read, but it hooks you from page one."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I was really excited to read this book since I love RENT and most autobiographies. It's a fast, easy read, but I had to put it down for a couple of months before I picked it up again. I found myself needing a break from it. It contains just what the front page says: a lot of loss. My favorite parts are when he talks about his friends in the show, but most of the book is about bad relationships and his mother's illness. I would not suggest young teens read it as there is a ton of profanity and some inappropriate bedroom scenes. If you like RENT, you'll probably want to read it, but I'm sorry to say it's just okay."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I loved this book I read through it in 3 days! I coulnd't put it down. I am losing my Grandma to lung cancer and was able to relate to Anthony Rapp's feelings on so many levels. AWESOME BOOK!! (read on android kindle)"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Anthony Rapp is best known for his wonderful portrayal of Mark, the frustrated filmmaker trying to make the ends of his life meet in the groundbreaking musical, \\"Rent\\". Also a film celebrity, Anthony can now proudly add to his resume the word \\"author\\". \\"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent\\" is a magical, wonderous, heartbreaking journey of discover of life and of oneself.\\"Without you\\" is a gift to many different groups. First, us \\"Rentheads\\" who love and have every musical syllable memorized, will absolutely devour Anthony's recollections on the making of the musical, both the stage version and a brief mention at the end of the book of the new movie version. Secondly, people who have suffered the loss of a loved one will treasure Anthony's story of his mother's brave battle with cancer. Third, those who love a good coming out story will apprecaite Anthony's amazingly honest recollections of his growing up years as he came to terms with himself. This is a book for everyone.I was struck by Anthony's gentle and honest prose. His writing is vivid, accurate, and honest. There were times, especially when he discusses his relationships, that it was painful to read; I felt as if I were there, listening to him recount these painful stories. Rarely does writing bring me to tears, but Anthony's remembrances of the loss of Jonathan Larson was stunning and heartbreaking, and I required a box of Kleenex right next to me. The same for the story of his mother's last days.It's not normal for me to read a book cover to cover in the course of a couple of days. The last one I remember doing it for was the most recent Harry Potter. But Anthony Rapp has written a memoir of love and loss that I simply could not put down. Whereas Jonathan Larson's gift to us was Rent, Anthony Rapp's gift to us are his memories, and his recollection of them in \\"Without You\\".You simply have to read this book."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Perhaps it's best to preface this by saying that I have had in the past year the pleasure, privilege and honor of getting to know the author of this book. Anthony, aside from being an actor of immense talent and accomplishment, is eloquent, intelligent and has a heart of gold. I speak so highly of his personality in this review only to go on and say that it shows in the heartfelt nature of his memoir.The book reads incredibly quickly; it's just that good. The raw emotion keeps coming and coming, and pushes you to keep reading. But what's most astounding about the book's raw emotion is its flat-out honesty, without fear of telling truths, even if they're ugly. I think it's rare for a show business memoir to be as up front and honest as this, while at the same time being so intensely personal. Anthony's not afraid to bare his faults, a brave and admirable leap. Anthony's voice throughout the book is gentle and accessible, only adding to the book's readability.It's rare to read a book and to actively feel. There's a finite difference between recognizing emotion in a story and actually, truly feeling for it. When you read any story, you can recognize it as a happy one or a sad one, but it's another step entirely to actively experience the impacts of those emotions -- to laugh and to cry as your turn the pages. Without You doesn't only simply ask its readers for such a cathartic response; it commands it.Catharsis in tragedy brings to the fore the notion of universality. When I bought my copy of Without You, the person who helped me find it at the store said \\"oh, is that the Rent guy?\\" Sure, Anthony's \\"the Rent guy,\\" and yes, this book unlocks so many secrets that many Rent fans can only wish they had been part of, as Anthony puts into words so many things about the beloved show that fans -- myself included -- long to be able to express. But the Rent connection is far from all there is to be found here, and impact is not contingent upon familiarity with the show. The focus of the book is Anthony's loss of his mother, after her long, hard battle with cancer. Anthony's voice in his book puts this on a level so personal that not only is it a book for anyone who has experienced loss, but a book simply not to be missed. Even if you haven't experienced a loss of that magnitude, you will find something in this book of which to grab hold -- something that will cause you to re-evaluate your choices, past and present.Art's job is to hold a mirror to reality; this book is art made of a reality, making the mirror image that much clearer. I don't hesitate to assert that people will take this moving, well-written book to heart. Check it out -- you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I have a feeling most people will think that Without You is a behind the scenes look at Rent, almost like a book parallel to the infamous Rent \\"bible\\". This is not the case at all. While touching on Anthony Rapp's journey through Rent, Without You delves much deeper than the show itself. Without You is a great read, and shouldn't, in my opinion, only be read by \\"Rentheads\\".I'm not the type of person who usually is deeply affected by books. But, wow, did this one hit me hard. It was just so emotionally charged - you can easily tell that the words came pouring right out of Anthony's heart. Anthony has a great narrative voice, and although not known as a writer, he's got such an entrancing way with words. He's such a talented writer with so many great stories to tell.The book is so touching, and at times, truly tragic. It's honest and raw and enthralling and pure and most of all, it's so brave. It's quite personal and at times I almost felt like I shouldn't be reading what was sitting in front of me. Anthony just laid his flesh out on the table. He held nothing back, and it took a lot of courage for him to do that. There are things that I didn't expect, that surprised me a little bit about his character, but if anything, seeing Anthony come through all of these situations only upped my respect for him as an actor, as a writer, and as a person.I think this is the type of book you can pick up ten times, and still be affected and find something different that pulls you in. Obviously, I extremely enjoyed it - and I think most other people will too, regardless of whether or not they are familiar with Anthony's other work."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"If you are a RENTHEAD then this book is a must. This is Anthony Rapp's first book and I was quite impressed. He has the gift of insite into the human soul. This is a unique and great gift for someone to have.His gives details that no one else knows about RENT. I especially enjoyed the story of the day Jonathan Larson died. He goes into specific details and gives a us a climps of what it was like to be in RENT.He also goes into vivid detail about his sexuality and his mother coming to terms with him being as he prefers be called a \\"queer.\\" The mother-son relationship is the deep foundation of this entire book. The events leading up to his mothers death and the success of RENT go hand in hand in his life. It shows what it must have been like to watch you mother die while fame and fortune are coming upon you.Overall this book was great. I bought it the day it came out and read it in 3 days. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 15 probably. But its a great read. I'm rereading it all ready"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Without you, by Anthony Rapp is a touching story of the best moments and the worst moments in life. I was excited to read this book, thinking that it would be all about the musical Rent, but it was so much more than that. Rapp describes much of his life and captivates the reader in an emotional way. This is a tell-all book revealing a side to Rapp that many people can connect with and it shows that although he played Mark Cohen on stage, behind the scenes was a tough journey for Anthony. I truly connected with all he had to say in his biography and read the entire thing cover to cover in under one day because I was so captivated by his use of language and emotional lure.This book is a must read not only for 'Rentheads\\" but those of us strugging with loved ones loss, sexuality, pain, and life in general. So many emotions went into writing this story and the reader will go through so many emotions reading this. This is an amazing story of a man's journey with not only Rent, but with issues many other people go throguh and some even more difficult."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I loved this book. There. That's out of the way. So any criticism that follows has now been properly qualified.So I bought this book, like so many others, because of its promise to take us behind the scenes of Rent, riding along with someone who has been with the show nearly from its conception. Anthony Rapp is a person who knew and worked with Jonathan Larson, so I fully expected to be treated to glimpses of their many interactions, etc. Well, I would say that, although there is a lot of material that focuses on the earliest versions of the play, there is very little material that deals with the show's creator or, in fact, any of the creative process at all. I think that little factoid is important for anyone who might be considering buying this book with that particular expectation in mind.Instead, what this book does focus on are the very personal experiences of one of the lead players, Anthony Rapp. It is not an autobiography but, rather, it is a memoir - and it is written very much like one. If you took your personal journal and turned it into a novel, this would be the result. So, where does that leave the reader? Well, Mr. Rapp does a very nice job of telling his audience what it's like to be a cast member of an unknown musical that turns into a smash hit. He takes us through his audition, through opening night, and through all of his experiences along the road to becoming more and more popular. But the book tells us much more than that...Interspersed between the pages filled with Rent, the author tells us of another very personal experience that was going on in his life at the time - the long illness and ultimate untimely death of his mother. Through this struggle, Mr. Rapp also spills out about his very open life as a gay man, and of his relationships with his boyfriends, and of his insecurities with his family, and on and on. The way in which he intertwines these feelings with his experiences with Rent keeps us interested and engaged, and allows him to tell us the otherwise uninteresting story of his life. This is not meant to be a negative comment, just that, let's face it, if he were not part of the cast of Rent, nobody would really care about his homosexual experiences or his family's illnesses, or anything else about him. In fact, there is really nothing unique about what he has gone through. But, by brilliantly weaving these stories with his somewhat more interesting stories about Rent, we somehow seem to care about what he has to say. And that's probably a good thing.So, the good and the bad: The good is that Mr. Rapp invites us into his life and gives people something to relate to. And if you canot relate, then you are somehow educated. For example, his earliest homosexual relationships are not something that I can personally relate to, but I am glad to have been introduced to what he went through and how comfortable he is with himself. On the other hand, his experiences with his dying mother is something that many of us have gone through, but he tells the story and evokes feelings that are spot-on. And, through this, we can relate and feel his emotion and be comforted by the fact that we are not alone. Overall, I would say that the book is very rewarding in these aspects.Now, for the bad: There are a few things that I will mention here. The first is that the front half of the book is very heavily loaded with Rent, but the back half is much less so. It is a good technique to draw readers into what he wants them to hear, but it also comes off as a little deceptive - especially when the logo of Rent is plastered all over the cover of the book. I was certainly hoping for a little more than his personal diary in this respect, given the way in which the book is advertised. The second problem is the way in which Mr. Rapp, as a central charater, changes throughout the course of the book. In the beginning, because of the overwhelming focus on Rent, Mr. Rapp comes off as being humble, sweet, and likeable. But, as the book goes on, we begin to see him as self-absorbed, self-indulgent, preachy, and overly dramatic. Maybe that's what really happened to him over that period of time. But I suspect that this does not represent a true transformation of character but, rather, a reflection of the subject matter about which he writes - which, as I stated earlier, shifts drastically as the book progresses onward. I personally did not like the way I felt about the author when I put the book down, half as much as I liked the way I felt about him when I picked the book up. This is probably not such a good thing.The last issue I have with the book is that it focuses entirely too much around a fairly narrow window of the author's life. He references his childhood acting experiences many times, but never takes us through that process or through that time in his life. In fact, the only childhood experiences that he chooses to focus on completely are those which relate to his realizing that he is gay. I guess it is his choice to decide what he will reveal to us, but I would have personally liked to have known more about his progression toward becoming an actor and an artist.OK, so I've said all that I wanted to say. But, again, let me clarify the point that I really did enjoy this book. In fact, I couldn't put it down. The writing is heartfelt and, I think, rather good, and the story is captivating enough to hold our attention. And, that in and of itself is a testament to this book because, in reality, the author is not introducing us to any really new experiences. He has just found a way to make us care about his life. And I think that is a tremendous feat."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I purchased the book thinking that it would be another memoir about being in a show. \\"Without You\\" is so much more than that. Rapp talks about RENT, but the book focuses mainly on his struggle with his mother's cancer--his need to have her accept him (and his homosexuality) before she passed away. A very emotional book, well-written and vivid."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"At first I was a bit hesitant to read \\"Without You\\". I was afraid it was going to be one of the memoirs full of name-dropping and compliments toward the author, or worse yet, just plain bad writing. As I'm sure you know, Anthony is an incredible actor and musician but I was still skeptical. Needless to say, he totally won me over. His writing was sensitive and intelligent. He drew you into the story in an incredible way, making you feel as if you had met him for coffee and he was telling you the story of his life.Instead of dwelling completely on the story of Rent, Anthony gives you a look at his life, the people he loves and his struggles. I think that anyone whether or not they are a fan of Rent should read this book. It completely changes your perspective on life, love and death."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Mr. Rapp leaves no personal stone unturned in this beautiful memoir. He tells his story from an honest and fresh perspective, even if he is occasionally cast in a less than perfect light. Through this memoir he dissects his soul and bares it to the world. His prose is engaging making this novel a very quick read.On a personal level, I found this read to be a suprisingly enlightening experience. I saw so much of myself in the author that reading of his struggles and internal conflicts helped me to better understand my experiences as well as how to continue to cope with them. I found myself in tears several times throughout the course of the book, but the tears were always of the cleansing type.Bravo Mr. Rapp. Your openness in this memoir is a true example of how we should all live and love."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I was only peripherally aware of Rent's first splash because of the media storm surrounding Johnathan Larson's untimely death. I was halfway through the DVD when I immediately started looking up the cast and found out about Anthony's book. I ordered it on the spot and stayed up all night to finish it the day it arrived.The honesty is brutal. He pulls no punches on himself, his feelings, or his behaviour although I have a feeling he pulled a few concerning some of his ex-lovers. I can only imagine that the writing of this was both cathartic and nerveracking. Nothing is held back.I agree with another poster that I would like to know more about how Anthony became a child actor, but the book never claimed to be about that. It covers exactly what it says it does. The evolution of Rent from Workshop, to Broadway Hit, to successful film; and his own personal experiences dealing with his love life and the loss of his mother.I would recommend this book to anyone who feels that life's challenges should be met head on rather than swept under the rug."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I am a fan of Rent. I've seen it twice live, watched the movie twice, and I own the soundtrack for both the Broadway musical and the movie. I had read good reviews about the book, so I bought it. I found it to be easy to read, interesting and entertaining. I especially enjoyed reading about the very early days of the production.Anthony did an excellent job of story-telling and pulling me into his experience. His descriptions of events concerning his mother and his relationships were very good. I was pleased I bought the book and took the time to read it. Rent fans will enjoy his account."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"If you love Rent. If you love Jonathan Larson, read this. It will bringyou so many emotions. I will read it again. I saw Anthony Rapp on stagequite a few times and this book is a wonderful tribute. Bravo!!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"As a former performer (amateur at best), I really thought Rapp did a particularly good job describing the feelings one gets on and off stage.-The feeling of loss as cast members leave.-How the music can somehow always relate to your life.-The power that comes over you under the stage lights.All in all this book written in a way that seemed very honest and well thought out. Sharing personal moments and public ones.The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was I was hoping to hear more of the \\"Rent\\" life. I was looking for more interaction and stories between cast members. Having said that though, it was still a very interesting story of Rapp's world during the period of the show Rent.When I first saw Anthony Rapp perform in the Fall of 1997 I had waited to meet him outside the stage door. He was friendly and always smiling. I had no idea at that time he was grieving over personal loss and struggles. It is kind of amazing how it has changed my perspective on a memory I had from so long ago."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Anthony Rapp tells an emotional story about personal life, love, and loss as he describes the years surrounding the phenomenon that is Rent. This is a book no Renthead should be without. Afer reading this book, I feel like I have gotten to know Anthony as a person, and gotten a rare glimpse through Anthony's eyes of the man that was Jonathan Larson."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Anthony Rapp was in on the creation of the masterpiece which became the Broadway sensation \\"Rent,\\" almost from the beginning. He has written his memoir of that experience with great sensitivity and insight.This book is a riveting tale about the creative process, how a play goes through its evolution to get to Broadway, and how every once in awhile a theatrical miracle can happen which changes everyone's lives. \\"Rent\\" is such a miracle. I just saw the play once again on Broadway this past weekend. I took my teenaged daughters to see it. After eleven years, it is finally closing down some time this year. If you cannot get to New York to see the play, rent the movie. It's not as good, but almost.I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who has ever overcome adversity to pursue a dream."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This book is amazing. It's a great read, easy to follow and really hits at your heart. I would reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I am a fan of Anthony Rapp's and a major fan of Rent, so I felt the need to pick up this book. It gives you such great insight into Anthony as a person and there was a lot in here to which I could relate. Plus, you get to follow along with the backstory behind Rent, which I also found very informative and entertaining. But above all, Anthony pleasantly surprised me with his writing talent. I thoroughly enjoyed this read and I hope he continues to write in the future."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"At first when I wanted to get this audio book I went to Barnes and Nobles. Figured, Hey, might as well save on shipping and handling. They never told me a price and told me it'd be in soon. TWO months go by and still no book! I go in every week and ask them, do you have my audio book yet?? they say No, we can't find it in any warehouse anywhere. Finally I say take me off the list, I'm going to Amazon.com. I also ask them what was the price? They say \\"about $70\\" I am so glad that I never got it from them!! I saved FIFTY bucks with amazon.com and also got it in TWO DAYS!! And that was with the cheapest shipping they have! It made the entire process worth it. And the audio book is simply amazing, I read the book about two years ago and now I listen to the Audio Book in the car while I'm driving. It's extremely relaxing and Anthony's voice is so soothing and I don't feel alone when I drive alone at night."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Since I'm a big fan of Rent, I enjoyed this a lot. A revealing look at Jon Larson and his cast in the early days."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Anthony Rapp has set the bar on many characters on Broadway. This novel introduces its readers to the man behind the song. It's remarkable to discover someone who has the talent to act and can find the words to express what we all long to share. Wonderful book for any fan or any person interested in good writing."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Ever since he was a child, Anthony Rapp has been acting. When he was young, his mother was at his side, escorting him to auditions and attending his performances. Then he grew up - and she grew ill.He portrayed Mark in the original production of the Broadway musical Rent a decade ago, then stepped back into Mark's shoes for the film version last year. Between the time that he auditioned for that fateful show and now, he lost his mother to cancer. Now he has combined his love of writing with his loss and created a memoir that is emotional and engrossing.Without You will appeal to Rapp's fans as well as anyone who can relate to various facets of his life: performing, auditioning, trying to make it as an actor; coming out; struggling with relationships; and, of course, losing a loved one. It is written in a lively, real tone, so much so that I could \\"hear\\" him talking as I read it. From the first few paragraphs, I knew I was going to love it. He is a brilliant communicator, able to detail and relay his experiences without sugarcoating them nor neutralizing them.This book is Rapp's memoir, yes, but it honors so many others. He mourns the passing of multiple friends, including Rent creator Jonathan Larsen, as well as the passing of his mother, but in doing so, he pays tribute to their lives. He also celebrates the successes and the journeys of his family members, his favorite friends, and his cast members.Without You is an unforgettable story told with honesty and compassion. Now Anthony Rapp can truly say his life is an open book."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I am a librarian and I was so excited to see this book on our order list. I immediately put my name down to check it out when it came in. I am a huge \\"Rent\\" fan, and I love anything about the original cast. I loved Mark and especially Anthony Rapp's Mark so I was very excited to read this.The book is full of emotion and he really seems to be writing from his heart. I do agree that you can't expect this to be a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at Rent- it is a memoir of a person who was in Rent and who went through an extroadinary time during the production. He wrote it well and seems to have all artistic ablilities now! I feel like I know more about him or like I grew up with him now. I almost feel like if I met him, I would feel like we were already friends.The only problem was, the copy we got in was missing 30 pages! So now I have to either wait for a new one or go ahead and buy it. I might just buy it because its so good so far. I hope this doesn't happen to anyone who orders it off of here- it clearly was a publishing mistake. Don't get discouraged and stop reading if that happens to you- just get one at your library or order a new one!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I picked up Anthony Rapp's WITHOUT YOU... because I have long been a fan of Anthony's. I finished it in a day and found it hard to put it down. His writing skills are raw, real and beautiful. He is definately a talent in more ways than he lets on. A great read for anyone who has ever loved.5 Stars - and a Standing ovation for this kid from the Chicago Suburbs who did just what he always wanted!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"There were moments when I learned things I wish I hadn't about this amazing actor, who I personally find to be literally one of the most gorgeous men alive. He is literarily gorgeous as well, though, with his descriptive and impassioned narrative of life in the theatre, dealing with death, and wading through the perils of serial monogamy.My fiance bought the book last Friday (sadly, for $25 at Borders--he should have come to Amazon) and we both read it, two-bookmark-style, within four days. It was the sort of can't-put-it-down read that made me call my husband-to-be angrily to say \\"did you take the book with you to work?--that's not fair!\\"Thoughtful and provokative, Rapp's catharsis is refreshing and raw, and if nothing else, real."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I knew of Anthony Rapp back in his days when one of my favorite movies was Adventures in Babysitting.

Congratulations Anthony to a job well done!!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Without You has got to be one of my favorite books, (which is saying something, considering I am a bookworm...). It takes you on an emotional journey through Anthony Rapp's life. The emotion in the book was so powerful that I cried during parts."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I highly recommend this book and commend Anthony for his bravery in making his past so public. His honesty in writing and overall experiences make you truly relate to him as person, not just as the RENT actor. Hearing tales about his family and relationships are both entertaining and touching, especially concerning his mother and her untimely death. His commentary on the nature of grief and his own emotions remind us just how alike we all are. I was moved to tears on several occasions.The book does mention Rapp's time in RENT's theater workshop and off and on-Broadway cast. He speaks candidly about his friendship with Jonathan Larson and his tragic death, but if you want the complete history of RENT and detailed commentary on all the original actors (though he does speak to closness with many of them), perhaps this isn't the place to look.But if you want a testimony of RENT's emotion power as a musical and a real life application of its message of love and loss, this is DEFINITELY a book worth checking out."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This memoir has a wonderful story and is incredibly well written.

I didn't want to put this book down. It is well written and a wonderful story. It is interesting to read about the early days of Rent and also about his relationship with his mother, brother, and sister. The audience will be able to relate to his experiences, even if their experiences are completely different. This is a story about family, relationships, hard times, grief, and theatre. Thank you Anthony for writing such a compelling piece!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I picked up this book and read it within a day. I've heard people describe it as an easy read - and they are right - but it is also so interesting that it's almost impossible to put down. The writing style is so vivid and descriptive that it brings the reader right into the moment - and because Anthony was so raw in exposing his thoughts I found myself able to deeply connect with the emotions described in the book. His insight into Jonathan Larson (and his involvement with RENT) was extremely moving - and I think readers will appreciate Anthony's honesty when writing of his personal experiences with regards to friends and family. This book is a gift to all who have had the honor of meeting him - and to all who have been affected by him as a performer. And to those that are not familiar with Anthony Rapp? I recommend that you start with this book."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"As a complete OBCR renthead, I was mildy enthused when I recieved the audiobook on loan from a friend. I quickly began listening to it, and became sucked in to the plot. However, that rapture was quickly underscored by other things.I found the plot mildly interesting. A memoir of love, loss, and RENT was really as advertised. It did not focus on anything but love, loss and RENT.I was also incredibly irritated by the frequent reuse of words, perhaps because I was hearing the book read. \\"Dilapidated,\\" for example, was obviously a favorite of Rapp's, since it was used at least three times in the hour that I payed attention.I was also dissapointed by the way he tangented. He began talking about his show, or something, and we somehow segwayed into a soft-core porn story of his first sexual experience with a man. No, pardon, a boy. He frequently refers to males as 'boys' and females as 'girls.' At thirty years old, I think Rapp can use the words 'man' and 'woman.'However, the book was not a complete loss. I found Rapp's description of Larson's death and the preceeding days very touching, and was moved by the freshness with which he wrote.Altogether, it was not a waste of the nine hour audiobook, but not worth a second read."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"For whatever reason I found myself somewhat dissapointed with the book. I was expecting to see more of \\"Rent\\" then I did. It's not written really well and in a lot of ways I think it makes Anthony come across different then what he really is, or so I hope. I have to remember that it is his memoir after all, and so if he wants to be self indulgent, I suppose he has the right to:)"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"Having just finished this book about 30 seconds ago, I couldn't decide whether to rate it 4 or 5 stars. I will list what I loved and what I didn't love as much, and you can decide if this book is for you.In all honesty, I wasn't crazy about the incredibly detailed descriptions of his sexual encounters. I believe some private things should be kept private, so that was difficult to read (though I wouldn't recommend skipping these pages, because you may miss something important). I also would have appreciated more stories about the people and production of Rent. Parts of the novel seemed to drag as he went on and on about some personal things.However, I couldn't help but admire Anthony Rapp's incredible honesty and profound sincerity. He definitely does not present himself as a perfect person, and shows absolute humility in presenting his flaws and missteps right along with his success. He always has a life lesson to share, and explains it without being \\"holier than thou.\\" In addition, the stories he DID share about the cast and production of Rent were very enjoyable, especially those about Jonathan Larson.I'm not sure if I would recommend this to anyone who is not a Rent fan.

In the book, Without you by Anthony Rapp, Anthony Rapp has. Anthony lives in New York City. Anthony has had experience in movies and other small Broadway shows including school productions. Anthony decides to audition for the musical Rent by Jonathan Larson. He ends up getting the part of Mark, one of the main characters in Rent. When trying to balance rehearsals of Rent and his mother sickness, when dealing with his sexuality and what his family thinks about it and relationships with his boyfriend, he tries he tries to deal with the death of Jonathan and creating friendship with the other cast members of Rent. This book is a non-fiction. I would definitely these book 5 stars.You probably would want to see rent the movie or the Broadway show to understand it more. I rated this book a 5 because I am such a rent head that I couldn't stop reading it and I could defiantly relate to what he was going through in his relationships and family. You could tell that Anthony loved living his life in every page that he wrote about himself. I would recommend this book to someone who is a rent head and loves Rent the musical. Also to someone who loves to read about life stories and what people go through because you can connect your life to others.-CAT"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"beautiful story about growing up and dealing with loss. it was such a sweet, sad story of anthony's career rising and his mother dying at the same time. i am a huge fan of rent and loved it! met him at a book signing and he seemed to be very nice!"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I love memoirs and \\"Rent\\" is my favorite musical.

He relays everything fron fun anecdotes to heart wrenching tales with ease. This book will help anyone dealing with their sexuality, or even more so, with grief. Not only is he an amazing writer, but when I met him at the signing for this book, he was one of the sweetest people ever.

I rarely find books that can keep me turning the pages for more than an hour or two, and as an avid reader I try to read as many books as I can. Rapp gives the reader a very interesting view on the broadway musical RENT, and his life throughout his time as an actor and son. A must read for any Renthead who loves the characters and the musical.I also went and visited the Borders near by, which was one of the stops on his book tour. He was so friendly and really showed his love for the music and people involved in his life."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"I'm a RENThead who has been looking forward to this book for a long time and expected it to be a pretty good read. When I actually started reading it, I was entralled by the emotional impact it had on me. This book has some very personal moments that make you feel for the author, Anthony Rapp.You can relate to him in so many ways. Grieving the deaths of his friends and family, losing and gaining lovers, nervousness of a performance, and other ways. When I was reading it, there was something in amost every chapter that reminded me of my life and my emotions towards my life. It's unbelivable how truthful he is about all of the dramatic and tear-jerking moments. It's hard to put down once you get into the very depth of the book because he's not afraid to share the most sorrowful, embarrassing and even awkward times of his life within these pages. This book will make many people cry and just think 'Whoa' at times and it's very hard not to even get a little teary, especially when talking about his mother and her fight against cancer.There are also many moments of joy and happiness that are very pleasing to read. When someone in the book is happy, you feel happiness for them. It's very refreshing to read after many pages of sorrow at a time.This is a book that can be, and should be read by anyone. It's not something to be passed up."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"You don't have to be a Renthead to delve into this memoir. It's a heartbreakingly beautiful story. Right about the time Anthony was selected to star in the off-broadway workshop production of RENT his mother was diagnosed with cancer. While \\"RENT\\" becomes an hit, Anthony's mother gets better, Jonathan Larson (RENT playwright and composer) dies unexpectedly on the eve of the off-Broadway debut of the show, and then his mother gets sick again. Between dealing with all of the trappings of becoming a broadway star, flying home to take care of his mother, and dealing with family he's trying to come to terms with his mother regarding his sexuality. It's an emotional wrenching, cathartic, bitter-sweet love story and also a testement to family and life. It's been a long time since I laughed *and* cried while reading a book! It also made me realize how much I miss my father.I highly recommend it.no day but today,maryintexas"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"As my amazing title says, this book is one wicked ride. I'm always skeptical when approaching certain things. A memior written by a great singer and actor is one of them. Who can really be good at all of these things? Well, apparently Anthony Rapp. This was an amazing book, I think. It's touching, honest, and brings up things that we all deal with but shove under the rug and perfer not to think about. I was amazed and almost moved to tears throughout the performance after Jonathan's death (I don't cry easily, so for me, this is a big accomplishment, for a book to bring out this reaction). It was painful to read sometimes and as I did I found myself cringing for him or feeling what he was going through.I am honestly impressed. The play swept me away, the great opener Rent, (even though my mother and I ran six blocks in heels to get there on time which is quite a feat, I think. Or I'm out of shape) was powerful and blows the mind. But to be apart of it? I never thought I'd get that chance and now I have, thanks to Anthony Rapp and his honest account of his life in this wicked awesome book ^_^"},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This book really moved me with Rapp's emotional honesty, and I echo the praises from previous reviewers. I rate it as 4 stars because, like a previous reviewer suggested, I feel it tended to drag a bit at the end and could have ended a chapter earlier. I strongly suggest the audio recording, especially for fans of Rent and of Anthony. Hearing him read the story himself (particularly for the small and poignant personal moments, like the frequent \\"Hi, Mama\\"--\\"Hi, Tonio\\" exchanges with his mother--it broke my heart every time) was an intimate and powerful experience, and when I finished I felt I had just had a long and passionate conversation with a friend--which i was very sorry to end."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"While reading the first page of Without You, I thought the book was going to contain mostly Anthony Rapp's memories and experiences with Rent. I was wrong. And I delighted in it.Being a Rent fan for 8 years, I was delighted that I was going to get to know about Anthony's life. And that's what you get here. His ups and downs, his struggles and his accomplishments, Anthony's most intimate thoughts and experiences are here.What's the most touching about Anthony Rapp is his honesty given in this book. After reading, I was amazed to see a man who is so comfortable in his own skin be able to write about what he did. He put his heart on his shoulder for all to see.Aside from this being his autobiography, I also see it being a dedication to two people. One of those being Rent's creator Jonathon Larson. It was heartbreaking yet inspirational to see how - from Anthony's point of view - Jonathon affected so many people around him. The other dedication had to be to Anthony's mother. His devotion to her was so relatable and tender, and in each page that dealt with his mother you could feel the love Anthony had for her.In addition to being an autobiography and a dedication, Anthony also gives inspiration and open arms to anyone dealing with the situations he has dealt with in the past.I truly have never been so moved by an autobiography. Anthony's soul shines through here. And at the end of the book, I closed it with a smile and teary eyes. I don't know why. It just amazed me at how much emotion and soul this man gave."},{"Title":"Without You: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Musical Rent","review":"This book was exactly what I was looking for.

I was not let down one bit, but a word of caution:>>YOU WILL (most likely) CRY, IF NOT BALL YOUR EYES OUT!&lt;&lt;Anthony was so very honest about his life and thoughts, his grieving and even his sexual history... At points making me feel like I was reading a personal diary rather than a published book. I admired his honesty because he didn't always portray himself in the most noble of lights, which made him all the more endearing by the time I finished the book.Having lost my father to cancer 2 years ago, reading about the long journey of Anthony's mother's illness broke my heart multiple times... There were points where I was beside myself and had to put the book down (to curse the day that I bought it!)Overall, I was very impressed by how Anthony expressed himself and wrote about his experiences honestly, painting his memories in true color... good and bad... I respect him for that.My one real criticism is that some of his photos are placed in the middle of the book, kind of giving away what was about to happen... Yes, I know that the outcome was inevitable (purposely being vague) but it was still suspenseful until I got to the picture section. I would have rather them been placed at the end of the book.Still a lovely look into the life of a real man who will forever be \\"Mark\\" in my heart..."},{"Title":"Angels in the Morning","review":"Quietly unassuming yet rich in descriptive prose &quot;Angels In The Morning&quot; is the story of one summer in the life of 10-year-old Gabriel. Anticipated as a happy, carefree time, Gabriel arrives with her family to spend the warmer months in the Loiret region of France, at a charming stone house they have occupied during summers past.In addition to Gabriel those eager for the countryside include her beautiful mother, not yet 30 years of age; her beloved Granny and great-aunt Ethel from South Africa; nanny Juliet, an Agatha Christie reading, moody, tippler; chauffeur Luis; and younger sister, Alex, who is almost deaf but quick at reading lips.They experience a less than auspicious arrival (the discovery that the housekeeper has died over the winter). Father, the children are told, has been detained but will join them shortly. His stay with them is brief - barely long enough to announce that he has fallen in love with another woman. This news perplexes the girls, and serves to make an already somewhat distant mother even further removed.For Gabriel's edification her father likens his predicament to the difficulty in choosing between chocolate and vanilla ice cream, assuming that one likes both the same. &quot;Perhaps my father's teasing,&quot; Gabriel thinks. &quot;He loves to tease us.&quot;As the doctor next door takes a romantic interest in Gabriel's mother, Granny steps in to lavish time and love on the young girl. They take long barefoot walks together and listen for the sound of larks as the older woman enjoys one of her forbidden cigarettes. Regrettably their days together come to an end when Granny suddenly dies. Upon being told her grandmother is now in heaven, the precocious young girl harbors thoughts of her own: &quot;I think she's sitting in another vegetable garden eating tomatoes and smoking cigarettes.&quot;As the summer draws to a close so do the days of Gabriel's and Alex's tranquil innocence as they are left to face their tomorrows virtually alone.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Angels in the Morning","review":"This is a book to take your breath away. The prose is beautiful, exact, and subtle. The story is layered so skillfully that multiple readings reveal the profundity hidden inside a deceptively simple narrative.

Troyan deserves better, and I have no doubt at all thatwith her next book she'll get it.)"},{"Title":"Angels in the Morning","review":"...with apologies to Jerry McGuire. I mention Monet because the book jacket blurb compares the descriptions the author paints in words of the French countryside in summer to Monet's art. Troyan's descriptive talents are noteworthy - but Monet she's not. That being said, I can't blame the author for something her publisher has chosen to print inside the cover.The story told her is one that is all too common - adults so wrapped up in leading (and unraveling) their own lives that the children with whom they have been bless are left to fend for themselves emotionally. In this case, the children are sisters, Gabriel (our ten-year-old narrator) and her younger sister Alex. Their family is seemingly wealthy, accustomed to summering in a rural French cottage. Populating this story, besides the girls and their mother, are several other characters: their maternal grandmother (Gabriel's best friend) and her constantly befuddled, fussy sister, both visiting from South Africa; their stuffy and emotionally frustrated English nanny Juliet; the chauffeur from Spain; a doctor who lives across the road; and a tramp who stumbles in and out of the scene from time to time. The girls' father shows up and announces to his wife - and then to the girls - that he loves her, but that he is also in love with another woman. Too typically, he also expresses his desire to keep both women as lovers. His wife at first appears to be completely spineless in the face of such a ridiculous suggestion, holding out hope that he will \`come to his senses' and return to her alone. The aforementioned doctor, their neighbor, begins to offer romantic attention to the slighted wife - and she begins to let go of the idea that her husband will return.The girls are pretty much left to their own devices in dealing with all of this. The person who offers Gabriel the most support and insight is her granny - and she's very elderly and frail, and this interaction is thus limited. The nanny is hopeless - she seems to be in lust with the chauffeur (who is married and has a family in Spain), and when she feels let down by or disappointed in him - or in her life in general - she tends to sit in her room by herself and get drunk.When the children aren't being ignored or passed from one \`caregiver' to another, they're being spoiled - and this factor in their upbringing is painfully obvious in many of Gabriel's narrative comments and observations. Her sister Alex is deaf and wears hearing aids - and somehow this aspect of Alex's personality and life comes across as being trivialized. Gabriel plays with Alex's hearing aids from time to time, wearing one so that the girls can be more like twins. This is a bit perplexing, because Gabriel also complains now and then about her nanny or mother dressing the sisters alike.As the story progresses, Gabriel (more than Alex) goes through the start of her coming-of-age process - she begins to see herself as less and less of a child over the course of the summer. Unfortunately, she has no one around who is able or willing to give her any of the valuable guidance that an adolescent needs at this time - she is left with her own limited understanding and powers of reasoning (which are, in truth, still those of a child) to assist her in this summer of passage.The story is an interesting one - but I felt that the setting superceded the plot. Also, I felt that most of the characters were unlikable in the extreme - even the children, who should always be given all due consideration and not blamed for their upbringing (or lack of it) were almost completely without charm. Their grandmother was the most likable persona presented here - and she was so close to the end of her days, so frail physically, that she had very little to offer them.On a final note - does The Permanent Press (the book's publisher) even employ an editor? At several locations in the text, an unjustified paragraph would suddenly pop up in the midst of the others. Now and then a line would end with a long space, and what appeared to be intended as the next paragraph continued below without any indentation - upon reading further, it was clear that this line should have followed the sentence above within the same paragraph. There was even one place where a quotation ran to the end of a line, with the closing quotation marks sitting alone on the line below.

No introductory text can be all things to all people, but this one is still remarkable in its ability to address the most pressing issues. If Amazon allowed half stars I might have gone with 4 1/2 instead of 5, but it is closer to 5 stars than 4. The things that Rosenwein does VERY well include:1) Chapter one is background on the Classical/Roman era to give students some perspective on the origin of the Middle Ages.2) Inclusion of cultures beyond Western Europe is a huge plus. There is adequate coverage of events in Byzantium, the Islamic World, and later, of the Ottomans.3) Includes excellent discussion of the art of the times. This includes the excellent, full page, high quality color pictures of relevent art and architecture.4) A quality book overall. The maps are also often in full color, with a few in black in white.5) A very readable academic style. The edge between being \\"unacademic\\" and being so scholarly as to be unaccessable is a fine one. Rosenwein sticks to it very well, seldom falling to either side.There are, of course, areas of interest where I wish that she would go into more detail, but as other reviewers and commenters have noted, this IS an intro text, designed to be \\"short\\" and also it is aimed at the average undergrad who may not have a strong background in history. Professors constantly struggle with finding good quality books that students will actually read! A good professor will be able to adequately augment in the places where more depth is needed.Overall, I would highly recommend this book for the classroom, and for anyone who is interested in a broad view of 1200 years of history, this is an enjoyable introduction, although if military/political history of only Western Europe (France, England, Germany, Italy) is your only interest, this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Middle Ages, third edition","review":"This book, a college text, is a sad commentary on the state of education today. In her summation, Rosenwein asks what remains of the Middle Ages, and answers\`colonialism' (I'm not making this up) but leaves out the birth of the national state, the birth of capitalism, the development of the Catholic Church, the Orthodox Church and Islam - which is perhaps why she can say that only little \`bits and pieces' of the middles ages remain, mostly changed beyond recognition, but the past is interesting because it is \`not us.'What complete and utter nonsense. Oh yes, and her assessment of the fall of Rome and disappearance of cities is: \\"the rich won.\\" The rich won? Yes, they refused to pay taxes, while the middle class Roman townspeople of the 4th century had to make themselves serfs because the Roman taxes had become ruinous. Taxes are the only cause for the disappearance of cities she mentions. This is not only weak history, it is weak education. She didn't mention the loss of literacy, a money economy, and law and order, because she's busy telling us the barbarians were just like Romans. She also states that the Roman elites were not surprised or upset when Rome fell, as they were used to barbarian leaders.Here's an example of her viewpoint and prose style: \\"In other respects as well, the new rulers took over Roman institutions; they issued laws, for example.\\" It's discouraging to think this is considered college level history.I've just read two other fascinating and intelligent histories of this period, which illuminate the tremendous importance of medieval economic and political developments to the modern world: \\"Dawn of a New Era: 1250-1453\\" by E. Cheyney, and The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950-1350\\" by Robert S.

However, many details are left out while discussing kings and battles. Much is said about the thriving arts, and a great selection of paintings and works from the medieval period have been chosen for this text. However, None of the chapters flow easily, and jump from the west to the east, from the thriving univeristy concept to what is seldom said about popes at this time. Important information is discussed with limited detail. Large text and frequent large pictures take up much room in the text which could be used for more text.

The primary defect is the emotional block: the inability to connect to and feel one's own emotions. This renders the sufferer a prisoner in a &quot;black-and-white&quot; world, compared to the full &quot;color&quot; world of the person with a healthy emotional life.What Stern does is look at a variety of ways that people break through the wall (originating in the rejection of the child's emotional life by the parent) that blocks them from their feelings. One such way is psychosis, where the blocked feelings pour out in a psychotic break, so intense that it seems to come from someone else. Another person may resort to violence: in the midst of a barroom fight, an intense emotional attachment, or an experience of vividness of life may emerge, whereas at other times life reverts to the black-and-white tedium of emotional deadness. Others may use LSD to break through this wall and feel more vivid aliveness.Stern explores how these, and other, forms of madness may actually be beneficial, a way in which the unconscious is forcing the conscious mind to acknowledge and deal with these hidden, rejected and lost feelings. It is a remarkable and novel way of looking at the inner emotional terrain and &quot;solutions&quot; the psyche uses to solve this particular type of problem."},{"Title":"Command at Sea: Naval Command and Control since the Sixteenth Century","review":"Palmer has writtem an supberb account of the development of naval tactics. According to Palmer there was an debate about whether intiative should be left to individual captains or the commanding admiral. Palmer believes that the British used decentralized tactics effectively against the French who were tied to centralized command during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Pamler writes that the use of decentralized tactics depended on an educated officer corps since when the French admiral Suffren tried British tactics he failed miserably due to an lack of individual intiative among the French officers. During the First World War, the British adopted centralized tactics and this hampered their performance during the Battle of Jutland. However in the Second World War, the British used decentralized tactics successfully against the Italians. Both the Americans and the Japanese used decentralized tactics during the Pacific War, but the Germans used a centralized approach that left them vulnerable to allied radio interception. The only weakness of this book is that Palmer leaves out the curriculum of naval officer cadet schools and how this influenced the tactical approach of opposing fleets. Nevertheless this book is an excellent account of different types of naval leadership."},{"Title":"Command at Sea: Naval Command and Control since the Sixteenth Century","review":"The title should read \\"Command at Sea in the Royal Navy from English-language sources until Navarino, and then in the US navy\\". There is nothing wrong with that, as long as you are aware of the limitation. Luckily I read a library copy and didn't buy it.The first chapter is on the period up to 1650. The second covers the first three Anglo-Dutch wars. 3-6 covers the rest of the wooden sailing navy. 7 is the Age of Steam to the end of the Great War. 8 is from 1918 to the end of the Second World War, and 9 covers the Cold War and first Gulf War.The Author's theme is the development of naval command and control, and its use and abuse. The story really begins in the Anglo-Dutch wars with the earliest sets of Fighting Instructions, and in the first two-thirds of the book we follow their development through to the end of the sailing navies. We examine the problems of their use in battle, and the author's view is that there are two basic types of commander - the controller and the delegator. The controller attempts to micro-manage the action, and the delegator recognises the impossiblity of controlling a battle, and lets his subordinates decide what to do. The fun comes in looking at the examples. The book actually opens with a description of the Battle of the Nile. Nelson is the epitome of the delegator, and he is shown as having thoroughly discussed his intentions with his captains, so they know what his overall intentions are in the forthcoming battle. Nelson planned to concentrate his attack on the first two-thirds of the French line. The captain of the leading British ship noticed that there was room to pass along the inside of the French line, and took his ship along that route, and was followed by several more. He knew what was expected of him, and behaved accordingly. The problem in many of the Royal Navy's battles in the 18th century, was that not all the admirals discussed their intentions with their subordinates, and in some cases, were not even on speaking terms with them.The development of the Line of Battle is also examined. Basically, the line is to allow the projection of broadside firepower, and is a very powerful defensive formation. In order to defeat it, you must somehow break up the enemy formation, or outnumber or outgun it, or concentrate your force on part of the line. It is very difficult to win a battle in line if your opponent is as strong as you are. The Royal Navy has been accused by some writers of being hide-bound and sticking too closely to the line in battles. The author demonstrates that this is not the case. The line is used for manoeuvreing before battle, especially if you don't know what you are facing, but is frequently abandoned when circumstances allow. However, is some cases, the admiral was unable, due to the limitations of the signaling system, to make his subordinates understand what he intended. Two of the most famous examples were Graves at the Chesapake (Disaster), and Jervis at St. Vincent (Glorious Victory), where only Nelson understood what was required - or at least, was prepared to act on his own initiative. I don't know whether the Author's excellent descriptions of the various actions are fully accurate, or biased in favour of his theories, but they do sound credible.Some examples:1718 - Cape Passero - Sir George Byng - general chase1744 - Toulon - Matthews and Lestock - Matthews attempted to bring on a general engagement from line, but had confusing signals flying. Had not discussed intentions beforehand, and had even refused to speak to Admiral Lestock the night before. Courts martials all round.1747 - 1st Finisterre - Anson - general chase1747 - 2ndt Finisterre - Hawke - general chase1748 - Havanna - Knowles - general chase, but left it too late in the day to achieve anything.1756 - Minorca - Sir John Byng - subordinates didn't understand his signals, and followed the 'line' order to the letter. He lost control of the battle. Byng requested a court martial. Lost.1758 - Lagos - Boscawen - general melee1759 - Quiberon Bay - Hawke - kept van in line, close action for the rest of the fleet.1778 - Ushant - Keppel - admirals on both sides lost control of the battle, leading to an inconclusive engagement. Courts martials all round.1779 - Grenada - Byron - started as a general chase, then discovered the enemy had been reinforced and were in superior numbers - formed line, but was defeated. No punishment for failiure.1779 - 'Moonlight Battle' off Cape St. Vincent - Rodney - general melee, though captains did this themselves without orders.1780 - Martinique - Rodney - manoeuvred in line to concentrate against part of the emeny line, then ordered an attack but subordinates apread out to engage along the whole enemy line.1781 - Chesapeke - Graves - signals couldn't cope with situation; subordinates waited for orders.1782 - the Saintes - Rodney - after much manoeuvreing the French line collapsed due to change of wind direction - English break the line with 2 out of 3 divisions sailing in formation. Rodney's First Captain (chief of staff) Sir Charles Douglas kept badgering Rodney to break formation - \\"Well, well, do as you like\\". Line break ordered, but as the British were down-wind, they passed through the line and the French were eventually able to escape downwind; Rodney failed to pursue.1794 - Glorious First of June - Howe - ordered his fleet to penetrate the French line, but only 7 out of 26 ships succeeded. 6 French taken.1797 - St Vincent - Jervis - 15 British versus 27 Spanish who were in a confused formation. Jervis sent his van to chase and formed line with remainder of his ships and split the Spanish fleet. Signals failed, only Nelson used his initiative. Eventually Jervis orders general close action.1797 - Camperdown - Duncan - a bit of manoeuvreing in line, then Duncan ordered his fleet ot break the Dutch line. General melee.As you can see, not many line to line engagements there. The author's view that control freaks were generally unsuccessful is borne out by his descriptions, and those commanders who relied on their fully-briefed subordinates were more successful. The later chapters cover much the same ground, but with better equipment, faster ships, and more deadly weapons. The command & control centralisation moves up the hierarchy in the Battle of the Atlantic, and even further up in Vietnam and the Gulf, with people in Washington deciding in real-time what weapons their front-line forces should use in engagements. The British in WW2 seem to have adopted decentralization to the extreme.To be honest, most of what the Author suggests is pure common-sense, but until someone actually says it, it seldom occurs to people.From page 45:\\"To be sure, the line ahead was not an entirely novel formation. One of its earliest and best documented combat uses occured at the battle of Dunkirk on 16th September 1639. A small force of seventeen Dutch ships, twelve of them commanded by Tromp, deployed and fought in a close-hauled line ahead against a Spanish fleet of sixty-seven ships. Tromp reputedly told his commanders before the battle: \\"Work in such a manner that these our ships unite so closely, that by no chance will they allow any contrary force to penetrate between them.\\"But Tromp's use of the line at Dunkirk was a tactical aberation, a desperate defensive measure to hold off a much larger enemy force. At the Downs on 21 October 1639, where Tromp commanded a heavily reinforced Dutch fleet of more than a hundred ships, he reverted to group tactics and the melee against the Spanish. The Dutch were still using such tactics when the First Anglo-Dutch War began, and there is no evidence that the English \\"stole\\" the idea for the line-ahead formation from their enemy.\\""},{"Title":"A cookbook for poor poets (and others)","review":"One need not be poor, nor a poet, to relish this highly readable book.

He talks about &quot;White Americans as racial beings&quot; and sheds light on their intra- and intergroup workings. Hitchcock takes pains to be respectful of all, then moves quickly into the hard discussion of White people and their innocent perpetuation of racism. He knows about this dynamic intimately as he is a White person himself. Hitchcock states that he believes White people are in fact trying to achieve a unified American society where race does not determine a person's standing. He goes on in &quot;Unraveling the White Cocoon&quot; to address how White people's intentions are undermined by their natural inclination to look at life through the privilege status of a White person, which without a great deal of effort, makes it impossible to compehend daily life as a person of color might experience. A multiracial society is the positive end result for America as described by Hitchcock. As long as Whites are the center of America versus being just another race in America, it will be impossible to achieve the multiracial society that Hitchcock speaks about. Power, institutionalized discrimination, monoracial thinking generally will need to be examined and corrected in order to attain the society in which race does not determine a person's standing. Overall Jeff Hitchcock's book takes one through a journey that unravels the White cocoon, thread by thread. It is required reading for all people seeking to achieve a racially just American society.Levonne Gaddy, President Association of MultiEthnic Americans April 16, 2001"},{"Title":"Unraveling the White Cocoon","review":"REVIEW OF UNRAVELING THE WHITE COCOON BY JEFF HITCHOCK Kathleen Korgen, Ph.D. (Author of From Black to Biracial, Praeger 1998, 1999)\\"Decentering whiteness\\" is at the center of Unraveling the White Cocoon, a new book by Jeff Hitchcock. Unlike much recent academic literature that focuses on whiteness, Hitchcock provides a straightforward, personal, and often moving argument for the need to study whiteness as one culture among many race-based cultures in the United States. Hitchcock lays out a vision of a multiracial America in which white culture will no longer be seen as simply \\"normal\\" but one of a mosaic of racial cultures each occupying decentered positions in a society with a multiracial/multicultural center.Unraveling the White Cocoon will be an essential tool for academic classes covering issues of culture and racial/ethnic diversity in the United States, activists, and all persons seeking to understand whiteness as one of multiple race-based cultures in American society. Hitchcock provides an excellent overview of the history of whiteness in U.S. society and the still recent birth and development of examinations of whiteness by both academics and activists. His captivating description of his own transformation from a \\"colorblind\\" young man to a leader in the field of white studies provides lively as well as informative reading for readers of all backgrounds. Rather than preach, Hitchcock shares frank and often brutally honest reflections on his own struggles with racism. In doing so, he eloquently drives home the point that an examination of white culture is, while at times painful, possible and worthwhile for all white Americans."},{"Title":"Unraveling the White Cocoon","review":"Although the topics might be dificult for some, I found it to be easy to read and something I could reccommend to someone \\"starting out\\". It's short and not too academic. There are a lot of good points and interesting facts which help to destroy some of the myths of being white (meaning things white people often took for granted which are not true). It was the first book I read (thanks Cessie) that empowered me as a white person that I needed to do something about racism. Before one of the myths which I held (eventhough I didn't realize it) was that racism was an African American problem and not mine.It has been many years since I read the book and started on this journey, but I am so grateful I did. This book will not give you all the answers, but it will get you thinking. It is also alot better to read books like this than to corner an African American and ask them to speak on behalf of their race (which we white people often do in some form). I grew up in a colorblind house, which was better than some alternatives, but if you think that you should be colorblind this book will help you understand that we need to see more. If your African American, this is a great book to give a white friend. If your white- read it and pass it on!!!!"},{"Title":"Unraveling the White Cocoon","review":"While Jeff Hitchcock's motives are laudable, his discourse lacks any semblance of a basis in current American social reality. Like most of the other \\"White Studies\\" literature, this piece too suffers from being too abstract and suspended in the unreality of not knowing from whence the real power of whiteness lies: It lies in the fact that all of the fruits of white supremacy have been \\"grandfathered-in.\\" We cannot connect the dots from here: \\"good-feelings,\\" \\"more racial tolerance,\\" and better \\"cross-racial communications (including even marriage)\\" alone won't get us there. The span is too great.The very ground in which the author's well meaning feet are planted to make his grand gestures of racial magnanimity is \\"consolidated and consecrated white supremacist ground.\\" Not that I have anything against grand gestures. For sure they are very much to be desired, but when they fail to chop away at the real root causes of racism, sometimes they just have the unintended consequence of making matters worse.Whites, who have had the luxury of being racially innocent, that is who have had the luxury of pretending to ignore their own profound and exquisitely sensitive \\"race consciousness,\\" (or white tribalism based on a \\"false race consciousness,\\") cannot suddenly wake up; get the anti-racist religion -- as Hitchcock has done; marry a black woman and then declare that racism would be over, if only everyone would follow his example?Would that it were so.But the true evil of racism lies not just in \\"pretend white racial ignorance,\\" but the fact that whites continue to \\"live off the illicit land,\\" off the illicit fruits of racism, all the while pretending that the problem of race is just one of better communications, and being more tolerant towards darker skinned people; that is pretending that it is not a deep systemic psychological problem with white people themselves, but one of better communication, etc.No sir: It is not true. Awareness and changing white consciousness is just Step 1, of a three-step process. Step 2 is teaching whites how to live without all of the \\"grandfathered-in\\" and otherwise built in advantages of white privileges, perks, and prerogatives. And step 3 is dismantling and eliminating all of those accumulated advantages. Without steps 2 and 3, as well meaning as Hitchcock's motives are, his formula is just more whistling pass the racist graveyard, once again.By marrying a black woman, he has just turned himself into a black, nothing more. He has just lost his white voice.There are deeply moral and psychological issues here that white America must inevitably face up to about its reliance on a fraudulent identity based on dehumanizing others. This is a conversation that each white must first have with himself, and then one that all whites must have with each other. And this time, we will be patiently and willingly awaiting outside the room to hear what your verdict is. This book is a good fist step.Five stars"},{"Title":"Unraveling the White Cocoon","review":"Great book. I especially appreciate the wisdom and humility you bring to the subject. The book is engaging and I have already shared it with several friends. Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"Unraveling the White Cocoon","review":"So what is Hitchcock really trying to say? First of all he is a white male whose guilt is so great that he marries a black woman and adopts 2 multi-racial children. Hitchcock's statement that \\"whites have a natural inclination to look at life through the priviliged status of a white person\\" is just another racist piece of rhetoric. It reminds me of such racist verbage as\\" Blacks are by nature lazy, or Jews have a natural inclination to be greedy. Of course Hitchcock and his ilk dont believe that minorities are capable of racism. Thus he feels free to say that whites must give up any semblance of white culture while insisting that whites must recognize the wonderful unique culturers of others, without comment. Hitchcock forgets that in any society, that the dominant culture; the culture whose language, religion, art, philosophy, political system and history has been adopted by the majority is the culture which sets the standards of that society. Japanese culture, using Hitchcocks theory, would rate as one of the worlds more racists societies. Of course people of color cant be racist......Or can they????"},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"This is the Author's second book on the subject, and both books are excellent (they have written numerous journal articles on the subject). Their treatment of air fares and hubs is particularly good. Their bottom line findings: deregulation has increased economic welfare, and the financial turbulence the industry faced in the early 90 was the result of an oversupply of equipment (the major carriers didn't forecast the impending recession and consequently ordered too many planes). I highly recommend this book it is very well researched."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"I will admit that this book is not for everyone. The casual airline enthusiast may have some difficulty sifting through the econometrics. This book is written more for academics. However, the concise, clear, well-written style leads me to no other conclusion but to rate this as an excellent book. The hypotheses are clear. The data is explained. Economic reasoning is used to posit their point. If you wish to know how economists look at and measure deregulation, then this book is a good choice. Indispensable for grad students in economics studying transporattion and/or regulatory issues."},{"Title":"The Evolution of the Airline Industry","review":"Lots of facts, but not much depth to them.

By no means am I a Rumbero or an historian on Afro-Cuban folklorico music, which I do consider the author; nevertheless, I found that in an attempt to present a truly \\"interactive\\" and \\"self-study\\" approach to learning the history and various parts of Guaguanco, the author presents a book that is more complicated than it has to be. Also, the rhythm charts in \\"1e&a2e;&a3e;&a4;\\" form drove me nuts, when I was taught \\"1and2and3and..\\" I would suggest that the author used both matrixes as Alan Dworsky does in his books.Even though I was disappointed with this book, I gave it three stars because I did enjoy Mr. Rodriguez's writing style and the history that he gave about the development of the rhythm in pre-and post-revolutionary Cuba. Also, the songs at the end of the book are something that one does not usually finds in a drumming text, and to chart out how the words fit within clave is definitely a rarity.If you want a less convoluted discussion of Guaguanco, I strongly suggest Dworsky and Sansby's Conga book and Bobby Sanabria's series of videos on learning how to play the congas."},{"Title":"Mel Bay Rumba Guaguanco Conversations","review":"I have purchased many books and videos on hand drumming and they all teach too little of too much.

This book allows me to get much more depth on a subject, whose content has evaded most people living in the U.S. After mastering this book's contents I will not be able to consider myself a master of Guaguanco's rich tradition, but I will be conversant in its language; something few people can say.Thanks Arturo."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I was so excited to see a new Stephanie Laurens book but, as I read, I kept feeling that something was missing!! The book just didn't seem to enthrall me! The premise was interesting but the book just didn't measure up!! Amanda was way too cocky, Martin just wanted to have sex, in public, over and over again! Once she got him hooked, then she put him off... I don't know, just frustrating and formulated somehow! Not one of the best!! I guess even great authors have their \\"off days\\"! We'll just have to see how Amanda's twin sister, Amelia fares in the next one!! Happy reading!!!!! :-)"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I'm a big fan of the Bar Cynster series and firmly believe that Stephanie Laurens is the current queen of historical romance. However, I admit that I was more than a little dubious that she would be able to successfully continue the series with the female Cynster twins, Amanda and Amelia. They appeared in virtually all the other Cynster books as flighty husband-hunting debutantes. &quot;On a Wild Night&quot; begins on a less than promising note as the two refine their plots for finding acceptable husbands. This is not a premise that is likely to endear itself to most 21st century women. Much to my surprise, Laurens manages not only to quickly transform Amanda into a likeable and sympathetic heroine, but also to create a romance that is more than worthy of the Cynster series. The hero, Martin, is no fool and quickly spots Amanda's matrimonial intentions. Even though the two are powerfully attracted to one another and their relationship rapidly becomes intimate, there are two hurdles standing in their way: a scandal from Martin's past and his reluctance to admit the depth of his feeling for Amanda. The last is straight out of every other Cynster novel - alpha male selects his mate but she refuses to accept him without a complete emotional surrender - but as always Laurens fills the romance with plenty of sensuality and the plot remains compelling. Even though there are obvious similarities between all the Cynster romances, each one is still a unique and complete story unto itself. Bring on Amelia's story!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Favorite scene with Amanda-Letting Percival Lytton-Smythe have it.Favorite scene with Martin-Finding the unsent letters from his father. Being forgiven.Together-Discovering the truth about Martin while in Scotland.What did you like about Amanda-She was really the only person who stood by Martin. She was strong and stubborn (although too stubborn about marriage). And although it was stupid, I still admired her for taking risks and going places she shouldn't have gone and doing things she shouldn't have done.What didn't you like about Amanda-That she waited the whole book to tell Martin she'd marry him. Why was she so stubborn about marriage?What did you like about Martin-His love and protection for Amanda. Despite what his own father had done to him, Martin still loved him.What didn't you like about Martin-That he didn't believe that Edward could be the villain.If I had to cast Amanda, I'd cast Reese Witherspoon.If I had to cast Martin, I'd cast Julian McMahon."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is my second Laurens book, as anyone who has looked through my earlier reviews knows. I'm a firm believer in giving most authors a second glance, but this book is the absolute finito. Must Stephanie Laurens insist on page after page of the same old cliche' Regency England couples breeding like rabbits? It's good to know we'll always have bunnies but, my God anyway, her books wouldn't be so long if we didn't always have page after page of perfect interludes that always involve the same old terms like \\"total surrender,\\" \\"heated flesh,\\" and \\"plunging tongues.\\"The characters have no depth--in fact, I think Laurens drew them on cardboard and cut them out--and the murder plot involves everyone being guilty because they ALL look like Martin to Amanda (Everybody sing \\"You are Everything and Everything is You\\" now.). In fact the only deep thing in this book is how deep, deeper, and deeper still Martin plunges into her during those long, boring sex scenes. For God's sake, is this girl bottomless or something? YEESH!If nothing else, this book is a great example in how NOT to write a novel, and the fact that this Bar Cynster series has gone on way too long is proof positive that even the most stagnant, unoriginal authors can keep getting work. Great news for a late blooming upstart like yours truly. For more depth of character, I suggest old Dick and Jane books."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"ON A WILD NIGHT is a very enjoyable read!

Martin and Amanda really keep you jumping through the book. You know that they are in love, even though Martin doesn't want to admit it. If you enjoy really great romance and a little intrigue at the same time, you should buy this book, you will enjoy it. Amanda's scheming gets her into all kinds of problems and it's interesting to see how each character in this story will react to each situation that comes up in this story. If you like historical romance, with a twist, this is the story for you."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I loved the entire Cynster series, with only one exception, until now.The two main characters weren't at all interesting and by the second half of the book I couldn't care less what happened to them. There really weren't any secondary characters to speak of. Basically the book went like this: Woman trawling for an exciting husband meets man she wants, spends all of her time trying to manipulate him into admitting he loves her (not sure why as she didn't love him for quite awhile), they have sex (ad nauseam), he tries to manipulate her into marrying him without admitting he loves her, they are both always plotting against each other to get what they want.The \\"danger\\" in the book is him trying to overcome a \\"scandal\\" in his past & her acquiring a lukewarm warm stalker. All of that action is packed into about one tenth of the book. I knew who the killer was as soon as he was introduced into the book.While I love Stephanie Laurens sex scenes, these were so repetitious and constant that they were boring!It's time to put this series to rest. After this one I'm not wasting my time on Amelia's story."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"The twins raised in the shadow of uncles and cousins know as the Bar Cynster couldn't help but growing up to be independant, strong willed, and beautiful. From the first night they &quot;came out&quot; the &quot;Bar&quot; ran heard on everyone the girls came in contact with.making the young ladies feel helpless that they should never find a proper match. With nick-names like Demon, Gabrial, and Scandel that fit the former rakes to a tee, these young ladies learned from the best how to manipulate any situation to there own best end.My best recommendation is not to start the series with this book, but start from the beginning. Each book plays a little off the former, carring a subplot line all the way through, showing how this stong family from the Duke all the way though comes to the rescue of the others. A regal family that cares about all of it's members, even those born on the wrong side of th sheets.The woman are strong, they have to be to handle there men, but of the highest cut.

I'll be reading 'A Secret Love' after this. Hope it turns out to be good too!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is one of the better Stephanie Laurens books. I have read everything written by her. Martin and Amanda are perfect for each other.

It is a wonderful journey of discovery for both of them. I didn't want the book to end."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This book was well worth the wait.

The charm of the Cynsters completely escapes me."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Amanda's story is truly unbelievable. Of course, a gently reared woman (even a Cynster) would never really behave the way that she does in this book. But as a piece of lively fiction, this is one of the best! As usual, the relationships between the characters are well drawn out. Family, honor, real love, and passion are uppermost in importance. Laurens writes the best love scenes out there - steamy but never degrading or gratuitous. One teeny complaint - Laurens has always had a wonderful way with dialog, but it turns a bit turgid here - all seething passions and what have you. For those who insist on ranks and comparisons, I'd say that this rates about 3rd or 4th as my favorite in the entire Cynster series. And we find out a teeny bit about who Amelia has her sites set on and he looks very, very interesting - I can hardly wait for May!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I was looking forward to the continuation of the Cynster series and also to the notion of a female Cynster. If you are a fan of this series, and I am, then you will enjoy this one even with its flaws. The biggest problem that I found is one several other reviewers remarked upon - the ability for a young woman of Amanda's class to venture safely through the less savory edges of society is highly unlikely if not practically impossible for the time period. There was just enough explanation/excuse offered to enable me to suspend judgement enough to enjoy the plot. However, the larger fault to me was the lack of character development and the dependence on the sex scenes to carry the day -Laurens can do better than that, and has!So although I enjoyed Amanda's story and will buy and read (an hopefully enjoy Amelia's) I'm fairly sure that I won't want to re-read it down the road!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"So far, all we've read about are the Cynster men, the devilish rascals known as the Bar Cynster. Finally, we get to see what their women are like...Well, they're deserving of the Cynster name, that's for sure. They're beautiful, extremely intelligent, and determined to only marry for love. Only problem is, with six former rogues watching their every move, they're not meeting the sort of men they're looking for-men just like their cousins used to be. Now, at twenty-three, Amelia and Amanda have decided to take matters into their own hands.Amanda chooses to frequent the less-than-reputable haunts the Cynster men preferred in their hell-raiser days. On her first foray out she's \\"rescued\\" by Martin Fulbridge, Earl of Dexter, and decides he might be the one she's been looking for. Right away, she knows it will take a great deal of patience and all her wit if she wants to tame this particular lion. But she can play the game, and she's determined to win it.Accused ten years ago of a crime he didn't commit, Martin shuns the ton in favor of the demi-monde. However, his gargantuan protective streak makes him honor-bound to ensure that Miss Cynster doesn't land herself into any more scandals; grudgingly, he accepts that the best way to do this is to accompany her himself. Although it gets increasingly difficult each time they meet, Martin resists Amanda's charms-especially since he suspects she may be after more than a simple flirt. They have agreed to a certain number of outings, after which she is to return to the safe haven of the ton and he will wash his hands of her completely. Unfortunately, with Amanda, Martin is seldom in control of the situation.It was a pleasure to get to know Amanda, although she belongs more in the 21st century than the 19th. She is seductive, resolute and self-possessed. Unlike so many heroines in historicals today, she is never brainless or silly or melodramatic, neither unrealistic or a spoiled brat. She is a master of the social scene, and can run rings around just about anyone. And Martin isn't bad either. Together they create passages so sensual that they will leave you panting.There isn't much to the murder-mystery thrown in, but the appearance of characters like Lady Osbaldestone, the familiar old martinet, and impossible-to-shake Percival Lytton-Smythe, fiance in his own mind, more than make up for the paper-thin whodunit.ON A WILD NIGHT is also peppered with subtle hints about Amelia's pursuits, and leaves the reader little doubt as to her unsuspecting quarry. By the way, many who know her say that Amelia is just like Amanda, except quieter...and more stubborn."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I won't describe the plot since others have done that well. Rather I have a question:Is it just me or is it true that every Cynster male in every Cynster book (with the exception of Scandal's Bride) is exactly the same man? Moreover, the tension in every relationship in these books revolves around the man's refusal to say \\"I love you\\" and the woman's refusal to marry until he does so. And then of course there is the requisite attempted or actual murder or some mystery to solve.By the time I read this book, I felt like saying &#65533;Enough already! Come up with a new problem for the men or make the woman fearful of saying the words or...well, something, anything...this is getting really boring!\\" If I had not read the previous books, I would have enjoyed this book more, but since it is one in a long series, the lack of diversity in male character development was glaring.Moreover, I never felt that we \\"knew\\" Amanda &#65533; her entire goal from beginning to end was to marry a man just like her male cousins &#65533; this does not suffice for an entire character in a book of this length. Her ability to mislead her parents, or rather the lack of parental involvement in her life, seems a little unlikely in this time period. The couple's ability to find empty rooms for sex or to slip away to Martin's home for sexual assignations also seemed unbelievable. The scene I found most hard to believe was the swing scene in someone's conservatory while Amanda's male cousins guarded the room from the outside. If they are SO protective, why are they not only complacent about her premarital sexual escapades, but actually assist in the assignations? ( I just did not buy the argument that they did so to further Martin's courtship, for crying out loud just tell the guy he needs to say \\"I love you.\\".) Please, Ms. Laurens, devise some new male characters."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"On A Wild Night is the newest installment in the Bar Cynster series, the story of Amanda Cynster. Amanda and her twin sister Amelia are fed up with the insipid males society has had to offer since their coming out. At the ripe old age of 23, they are ready to take the bull by the horns, and do whatever it takes to find men who fit their ideas of the perfect man---much like their older cousins, those notorious Bar Cynsters.Amanda is the first to embark on her adventure, and she has just the idea of where to find a man who fits her ideal profile-in the shadows, the gaming hells and those balls and many places that are surely unsuited for an innocent such as herself. But she's determined, and so convinces a family friend to accompany her into the London nightlife, seeking to trap the man of her dreams.Rescuing Amanda from a situation she finds herself in is something Martin, Earl of Dexter, cannot resist. He hasn't rescued a damsel in distress, or even been exposed to any damsels, since he himself was a youngster at the age of 19, and found himself the center of a scandal that forced his father to exile him. Having not returned to London until after his father's passing, he's determined to keep to himself, and not enter back into society, risking the cut direct.Finding that Amanda has plans to engage in some of the wilder escapades that are known to the ton, and knowing of no way to save her from herself, he finds himself volunteering to escort her on her wild jaunts, never realizing that he himself is being set up like the fly by the spider. It's not long before he feels himself being tangled up in Amanda's web, but the question is, has she truly set out to trap him, or is he just falling for her? Finding the answer is no easy task, and Amanda truly leads Martin on a wild escapade through the London night life, all the way back to the ball rooms of the ton.Miss Laurens has out done herself!! This tale is a wild romp from page one; with me anxious to turn to the next page to see what Amanda will think up next. What a fun and wild romp! And with a few appearances of the Bar Cynster, this book delivered everything this reviewer could want, and left me salivating for more. The thrill is that the other twin, Amelia, has a book coming out at the end of this month, On A Wicked Dawn. This reviewer will definitely be standing in line for more of Miss Laurens superior writing!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I suppose that my biggest problem with this book is that the major characters never take the time to fall in love. Amanda meets Martin once and decides to pursue him. And the pursuit is so very predictable - rogue takes innocent to dens of iniquity. Then once Martin is &quot;caught&quot; the story is stretched out as Amanda tries to force him to admit that he loves her. Neither character receives more than surface development. This is book without Cynster fire and humor. Too bad."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is the first Laurens book I have ever read and it may be the last. There is not much of substance to keep one interested. The characters are not well developed, the relationship is shallow and the murder mystery is [bad].First of all, what did she see in Martin? Admittedly, he seemed promising at their first meeting when he rescues her during an ill-advised card game, but after that? Almost every facial description of him used the word \\"stony\\" or he was gritting his teeth or barely suppressing anger. Though he's handsome and sexy, what else is he? He has no sense of humor, does nothing but brood - sounds like fun! The author was a bit more generous with Amanda, but though she is smart and vivacious, she also comes off as completely calculating and shallow. Other than sex what was there between these two characters? Not much! Once the thrill of forbidden sex is gone, will these two have anything to say to each other? I never thought I'd say this but there were so many sex scenes in the book (though they were hot) it became boring!And what's with Amanda carrying on in such a \\"shocking\\" fashion for the times? How is she getting away with this? I hardly think her behavior would have been acceptable nor even possible for an aristocratic young lady of the day. How is she sneaking off with a houseful of family and servants? Where are her parents? And then when Martin tells her male cousins what has transpired between him and Amanda, they aren't even shocked! They immediately accept him as a part of the family!! It just all seems so unrealistic and even silly.Well, I guess I'll be reading the companion book about Amanda's twin Amelia anyway, since I've already bought it, but if it's anything like this one, it's going to be tough to finish! But at least Lucien Ashford seems to have more going for him than Martin - more personality, more humor. At least I hope so!!!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Whereas \\"Devil's Bride\\" remains one of my all-time, won't-ever-loan-it-out, dog-eared favorites, this was a sad disappointment.

This is 400 + pages devoted to the story of a spoiled brat manipulating a man into telling her he loves her. The hero, who has no emotional depth, demonstrates his feelings, overcoming his solitary, society-shunning bachelor ways which are poorly justified, and admits his willingness to marry the heroine (why, I don't know, she's completely self-centered) in the first 3rd of the book, leaving more than half of the book devoted to manipulating the actual words 'I love you' out of his mouth, which at this point is a foregone conclusion to the reader and the heroine, who knows he loves her but absolutely has to hear it. I read a lot of romances, and repetitive plot lines aren't a problem to genre-afficionados as long as they are emotionally compelling. But there was no emotional reality, so all the same old plot twists we've all seen a thousand times left me feeling used. There are great descriptions of lots of raunchy and completely anachronistic sex (as another reviewer pointed out, no unmarried lady in the 1820's can just regularly spend the night at a man's house), so if that's all you want from a romance novel, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have never written an online-review before, but I am inclined to do so now in order to warn others not to buy this book. It seems that one is reading the same pages over and over. The book seems computer-generated (just string all clich&eacute;s and platitudes together). The main characters are one-dimensional (she: blond, blue eyed, porcelain skin, he tall, dark, handsome as sin (yawn) and of course haunted by past injustice). She has no character at all, we only know about her that she tries with blatant come-ons to seduce him, he - of course - resists (yawn).

When she gets in over her head in a card game, Martin Fulbridge, earl of Dexter, steps in to champion her. Banished from England by his father ten years ago for a murder he did not commit, Dexter has made an art out of staying out of the light of the respectable world. Amanda and Dexter make an agreement, Dexter will take accompany her to four of the raciest spots in the ton, and while they're together, Amanda will steal his heart. Dexter just doesn't know it.This books was phenomenal-remember how Devil and Honoria's story stole your breath- prepare to be left breathless again.Lauren's trademark sensuality, combinmed with a spectacular cast of supporting characters, not to mention a virtual tour of the places in London we Regency readers don't often get to see makes this the absolute best of the Cynster series. There are some spectacular scenes where we get to revisit with some of the other Cynsters, in particular one where Dexter is grilled by all six members of the Bar Cynster. Lady Osbaldestone ( I really wish she had her own story about her youth) has a pivotal role throughout.While I had been dissapointed with some of the others stories, \\"Scandal's Bride\\" and \\" All About Passion\\" to be exact- in this one Laurens pulls out every stop- everything you ever loved about the Cynsters- the best of the Cynsters- is right here in Amanda and Martin's story.Don't pass this one up- really."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was my first Stephanie Laurens book and it will probably be my last. I couldn't even finish it, I was so bored. I didn't connect with Martin and Amanda at all and I'm not quite sure how they connected with each other because it was never really dealt with by the time I got 2/3 of the way through the book. I quit reading when all they did was meet on terrace after terrace and steal a kiss and then he'd go off into the night, promising to meet her at the next ball. For another kiss? And I wasn't quite sure if she really liked the man or if it was all a big game for her. She was much too sure of herself. I also didn't care for the detail. There was too much of it and this wasn't a \\"light read\\". It drove me crazy the way the author would carry on a sentence, like, \\"She kissed him long, lingeringly.\\" and \\"she laughed seductive, sultry.\\" Aren't these the same things? Long, lingeringly? Seductive, sultry? And sentences like \\"He found her reticence disconcerting. Disorienting.\\" I think they mean the same thing. Her sentences were much too choppy, didn't flow together at all. \\"He looked. Nodded.\\" It's a pretty drastic change to go from \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" to On A Wild Night. And what's with all the corny names? Vane, Demon, Patience?

Though Amanda's quest seems inappropriate for her class in that era, fans will enjoy her exploits. The story line is fun to follow due to the dueling duet. A subplot in which the amateur sleuths try to solve the decade old murder ties back to the prime romantic theme though historical mystery readers will not relish the rapid resolution of the case. Stephanie Laurens provides her audience with a strong tale that leaves fans anxiously awaiting Amelia's trek to find the light of love.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Yes, I've read all the other Cynster books and if this had been the first one that I'd read, it would be the only one. Basically, the plot comes down to Amanda setting out to \\"capture\\" a male similar to her Cynster cousins; once he's interested, then to keep the story going, he must yield and tell her that he loves her. There's also a minor mystery element that is all too easily solved. Laurens keeps the book going through Amanda's trysts with the AlphaMale. Sounds good in theory, but in fact, the \\"sex\\" scenes are boring. While reading the first, big, \\"she looses her viginity\\" scene, I found myself wondering what to put on my grocery list. not good. I'll admit that I will peak into Amelia's story, but it will be while standing up in the bookstore. I've asked myself why this story doesn't work and all I can think of is the heroine is NOT engaging, there is little chemistry between the major characters, and I got tired of reading about them having sex in public - repetition takes away the edge."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Amanda is likable, but I don't see much that would have inspired an obsession like the one Martin developed for her. She was pretty conniving, but I don't fault her for that. If I met a handsome rake at a gaming hell I might try and snag him too. But she snags him in such a BORING way. There's no pizzazz to the way she goads him into escorting her to all of these supposedly scandalous outings. There was so much potential for sexual sizzle at the various outings, but instead they were really boring.Stephanie Laurens is always wordy, but this book was out of control. The sex scenes were so boring and incredibly painful to get through. There's so much fluff that you can barely tell they are having sex! It's such flowery prose and totally pointless blather.After reading an author like Robin Schone, this was lame. I still like S.L., but she's definitely not my favorite."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have enjoyed each of the Cynster novels, and &quot;On a Wild Night&quot; delivered every bit as much as the others. I'm not sure what some other the other reviewers were expecting, but when I read a romance--especially historical romance--I expect some light escapist reading, and this is exactly what you get with Amanda Cynster's story.Laurens primed readers for Amanda's (and Amelia's) story in the previous Cynster books. The twins both decide it's time to make their match, and each devise a plan for achieving that goal. Amanda decides to search the places young misses are never allowed to go. And while this is not realistic, it is truly entertaining how Amanda manipulates Martin, Earl of Dexter, into courting her.I loved this book, and I look forward to Amelia's story."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Those Cynster men are hard to forget but now its the women's turn!

It was fun to read!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"It is nice to think that not ALL of the women in the regency era were weak enough to be pushed off into a marriage of the guardian's choosing.

This is the second book I've read of Stephanie Laurens. I really wanted to like this author because she's supposedly one of the best historical romance authors out there. However, I don't think I'll be reading anymore of her books. This book was really borring and unrealistic.

I DO hope it gets better."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I am so glad the Stephanie Laurens decided to keep the series going with the younger cynsters after she married off the last of the bar cynster. She is such a talented and captivating author. I don't want her to ever stop writing about the cynsters.As usual, a strong cynster has another falling at their feet. The cysnter men where all destined to fall head over heals in love with their wives, but the rest of the ton couldn't be expected to have the same &quot;problem&quot;. Of course, that wasn't stopping the cynster females from expecting nothing less from their husbands. Amanda over comes all obstacles in order to have the man she choses to wed fall in love with her. True to the Cynster path, she chose who she wanted and made them fall in love. It was fun to see it work for the women as well as the men in a society so prone to follow a man's whim.I love how Stephanie Laurens keeps the old characters active in each of her new novels and keeps us updated on all the new additions to the family. Her new cynster novels are worth reading just to catch up on the &quot;bar cynster.&quot;As always, she has the perfect mix of sensuality and adventure. I thoroughly enjoy reading her intimate moments as she can make you feel as though it were you living the moment. It is so romantic it takes your breath away."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I had to wonder if it was possible to write a Cynster novel with a woman as the central character - after all, the Cynster men just about define the alpha/testosterone hero!! But Stephanie Laurens has risen to the challenge and succeeded admirably with this book.Amanda and Amelia Cynster, twins and terrors, are now eligible, beautiful adults (well, physically anyway). But they're bored with the current crop of potential husbands and decide to make their own lists. Amanda finds her future mate, Lord Martin Dexter, in the dark underbelly of society. I was a little puzzled by the freedom Amanda obviously enjoyed to visit such places, but the charm of the story and the delightful characters offset this minor plot glitch.Amanda is a Cynster, through and through, intelligent, independent and manipulative to her own ends. Martin is the perfect foil - handsome, sensual, and controlling - sparks between these two are inevitable.As we have come to expect from this fine writer, the sex is hot, the plot exciting, and the strong sense of family permeates the book. It's a delight for any historical romance fan - for Cynster-lovers, it's a must-read!!!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Loved it - love how it carries on the Cynstar Dynasty - bringing former characters back to life and introducing new ones! Wonderful escapism!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is the first book of hers I have read. I LOVED it. Her characters are strong and well developed.

Also check out the historical romances by Julie Garwood."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"So often I have found even among my favorites authors atendency to present a slightly weaker character with a bitof overusage of the same plots when writing series,sequels, etc.....NOT SO with Stephenie Laurensand the Cynsters. I have to admit that I have enjoyed the lastthree books in the series even more than some of the first.Amanda's story is fresh with a superb plot and wonderfulcharaters, both new and old. It was great to be reaquaintedwith Devil, Vane, etc. and meet Luc and Reggie. The nextfew days are going to seem forever waiting for Amelia's book."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This was one of the best romances I've read in a while. The story kept me glued to the pages and the love scenes-wonderful! I did get a little frustrated with Amanda's drawn out refusal to marry Martin but the erotic rendezvous it generated more than made it worth while. Both characters were strong and intellegent and their mind games stimulating. I was also surprised at how easily Amanda was able to get around, but again, the story was so captivating I had little time to dwell on waht \\"reality\\" would have been. Fabulous read, my favorite Cynster novel yet. Can hardly wait to read Amelia's story."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Laurens is usually one of those authors that I buy without even reading the back of the book!!! I have to say that I am terribly disappointed with the last few books she has written!!! I keep buying them thinking that she is just going through a &quot;funk&quot; but, I'm sorry to say, I feel that she has &quot;lost it&quot;!!! I bought this one (On A Wild Night) and, of course its &quot;twin&quot;, (On A Wicked Dawn), and all I kept thinking about was: &quot;When were they going to stop having sex and tell a story&quot;? Now, I am definitely NOT a prude! I like a great sex scene the same as the next gal, but, I also need a great story to go with it!! I never felt like there was any plot. I never felt like they were in love. I found I didn't even care what happened to them!!! I did finish both books, and usually I'm sad when I finish a book, but I was just kind of glad when they were over. I also felt this way about &quot;The Secret Lover&quot;!! I bought a brand new hardcover (BIG BUCKS) and couldn't wait to get home to read it! What a let-down!!! Needless to say, I am hesitant to buy the new Bastion series!! I guess I'll be reading the backs of the books -- and the reviews -- from now on!!! Sorry, Stephanie!!! I'll keep hoping for the future!!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"While this book had great character development, i was very disapointed with it. I stuggled to make it though the entire book. The first 300 pages of this novel (3/4 of it) was nothing but interaction between the main characters. There was literaly NO significant secondary characters. In my opinion, secondary characters and their friendship/interaction with the main characters is what really makes them real to the reader.I think the only thing that kept me reading was knowing that there was a plot, as explained early in the book, but actually getting to it took the reader almost to the end if the novel!While romance, love, and sex are vital things in a romance novel, in my opinion, ON A WILD NIGHT could have done with a many number less love scenes! It got sooooo boring not to mention looooong, I actually had to flip through the pages until it ended, they were pointless to the story line and almost exactly the same each time.This is the first Stephanie Laurens novel I've read, and I'm sad to say, it will also be the last. I was shocked when I read the notes about the auther to discover that she's published 21 such novels! Wow... I didn't know the talentless could do so well."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Laurens has done it again. I think this book about Amanda Cynster and the Earl of Dexter is probably the best book in the whole series. I can't wait to read Amelia's story. Amanda is definitly a true Cynster, down to her tiny little feet and Martin, the Earl of Dexter is so very like the Bar Cynster that the melding of the two was riveting. If you have never read any of Ms. Laurens books, and I can't imagine there are many who have not, start with the first book and read all the way to On a Wild Night. Makes you wish there were Cynsterish men out there for real today."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Amanda Cynster, who with her twin sister has been on the Marriage Mart for five years without finding any man she could envisage marrying, has finally had enough: the type of men who attend balls and parties are not the type of men she would consider marrying. So she decides to go on her own husband-hunt, choosing the sort of location where men go to get away from husband-hunting women.Thus it is that she ends up in a gambling den, challenged to a game of whist by a notorious gamester. A mysterious stranger steps from the shadows and offers to partner her and together they win. It's only afterwards that she discovers his identity: Martin Fulbridge, Earl of Dexter, who has been away from Society for ten years due to a scandal in which he might have seduced an innocent girl and murdered her father.Of course, he didn't do it, as we're assured as soon as we meet Dexter, and of course if he wants to aspire to Amanda's hand he needs to prove it - so thus we have Laurens' usual dramatic plot. And once again this plot feels as if it was buttoned onto the story as an afterthought because she ran out of things to write about - other than occasional references to \`the scandal' and Dexter's need to clear his name, there is no mention of it for a couple of hundred pages, and the resolution is all dealt with in a great hurry.Why only one star? Well, to begin with I find it impossible to believe that this book is set in Regency England. I could just about believe it of Georgian England, but not the 1820s. Where was Amanda's chaperon? Regardless of how long she'd been \`out', she couldn't get away with running around gambling dens, orgies, meeting men at five o'clock in the morning and even going to what appeared to be brothels unnoticed. And, by the way, if she had been \`out' for that long, I couldn't see her or her sister still being sought after other than for their dowries: they'd be considered on the shelf by their age, 23.Second, I had thought that this book might be somewhat different from others in the series, in that the Cynster character is female; perhaps a hero not of that family might be an interesting character, for a change. But no; Dexter is depressingly Cynsterish in his traits: uninterested in marrying until he meets Amanda, whereupon he immediately wants her; he pretends he's not pursuing her, but his manner is oppressively protective; he proposes marriage - which she refuses - and insists that she will be his wife, and then conspires to ensure that she has to accept him by enlisting the help of her family. Yes, I've been here before. Yawn.Annoying errors riddle the book. First, Dexter introduces himself to Amanda in the gambling den as \`Martin'. Of course he wouldn't; he'd have introduced himself as \`Dexter'. Second, at one stage he is introduced at a party as \`Lord Martin Fulbridge, the Earl of Dexter'. Incorrect; he is Lord (or the Earl of) Dexter. His first name is Martin and his family name Fulbridge, and so if he wanted to be relatively incognito he could introduce himself as Martin Fulbridge, but never \`Lord Martin'.And what's with all those irritating sentence fragments and verbless sentences? This is a habit of Laurens' in her [romantic] scenes (of which, again, there are too many to be convincing for the period, and they are too long to be interesting), but in this book they seemed even more noticeable than usual. I note that she's finally using \`disinterested' correctly, but she's now using \`evocative' incorrectly. Apparently, Dexter's kisses and caresses are \`evocative' - of what, Ms Laurens? The word isn't an adjective akin to \`sensual' or \`arousing'!I have Amelia's story already, though I don't expect much from it; I can't see me buying anything else by Laurens after that."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This is twin Amanda's story and the first female cynster novel in this series. Amanda is now 23 and has not found her mate from among the ton, she is picky and wants someone like her infamous cousins. What does she do, but go into the least acceptable places for a young lady looking for her hero. She finds him in Martin, Earl of Dexter. He has long ago forsaken the ton because of a long ago scandal. When Amanda finds herself in a sticky situation, Martin comes to her rescue and agrees to squire her around the more scandalous parts of the ton to protect her from danger. Amanda schemes to get him to the altar but knows she can't be obvious or he will run in the other direction. There are lots of steamy sex scenes in this book, but they are tastefully written into the story.When Amanda finally suceeds in getting a proposal she finds she doesn't want to accept it without a declaration of love. Martin is afraid to declare love, because he was hurt by those he loved wrongly believing he murdered a man years ago.Amanda knows Martin must clear his name in order to be able to love her freely. What happens next is a whirlwind investigation into who the real murderer is.The only problem with this book is it tended to be a bit long and the real killer easy to predict. However, I think the female Cynster novels are as good as the others."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Let me just start this by saying that I LOOOOVE romance novels, and I love a good sex scene...but where was the emotion? I never thought Id say this, but this book had too much sex! It got boring after awhile, usually when Im reading a book and the tension is building, Im dying for some of the intimate scenes...but in this book, I actually found my self flipping ahead to read something besides all of this meaningless sex. Also, how in the heck did Amanda get away with such behavior back in the day? I think what got to me the most was..when I started this book..it began so well..I was immediately hooked into the fast pace..only to later be disappointed..all in all...not horrible, but it could stand to have about 150 pages knocked off."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"After reading the other Cynster novels, I had high hopes for Amelia's book. Even though she had seemed shallow in the other books, I figured she was young and would grow. I was disappointed.All of the Cynster novels are anarchronistic, then almost all regency historicals are. But this one WAS too anarchronistic for me. She runs around without a chaperone. She has sex in public places and she goes to a gaming hell. Hello!? In addition, she acts like a 15 year old high school freshman who desperately wants the senior quarterback who's not sure that she wants him. And to top it all off, she stamps her pretty foot like every chapter and announces that she won't marry him until he says he loves her.I'm so happy I got this from the library. Amelia Cynster needs a grow-up pill. If you want to read a really good Cynster novel, read Devil's Bride or A Secret Love."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I have been a fan of Stephanie Laurens for quite some time. Much like the quote from an author on the front of this book, I generally buy anything with her name on it. However, I struggled through this book for various reasons. First, after years of reading books where one's reputation is the end-all, be-all of one's existence, I was disconcerted by the haphazard care Amanda Cynster had for her reputation. Neither she, nor anyone else in her family, seemed to care one whit about her visiting gambling hells, private parties known to be meeting houses for people looking to carry on sexual liaisons...It was a struggle to believe that no one in society was talking about her and that her reputation was unblemished by her stubborn carelessness. Second, and this is a reflection of how bored and upset I was, I came to be increasingly distracted by Ms. Laurens overabundance of paragraphs with fragments. In many of the scenes, particularly love/sex scenes, Ms. Laurens seems to lose all sense of English grammar and haphazardly (a recurring theme in this book) drop verbs and leave sentence fragments littering the text. Why is this an issue for me? Because I was in such a state of frustration with the book by page 100, that I was noticing every flaw. I was so frustrated that my husband threatened to take the book away from me as I was muttering to myself every other minute (I promise this is not a regular occurrence).Ms. Lauren's editor would have done everyone more justice had she encouraged her to cut at least 150 pages from the text. Undoubtedly, this would have eliminated many of the sentence fragments and encouraged the story to seem less drawn out and endless. Indeed, the only reason I can see for the excess pages is the incredible price...Why am I giving this book 2 stars when I seem to have hated it? For all of the frustration and irritability it caused, I was fascinated to see how Amanda would manage to convince Martin to fall in love with her. For a young woman of 23, she had a much better grasp of the male psyche than the majority of women I know. Also, despite the distraction of the sentence fragments, the love/sex scenes were pretty intense and they kept me distracted on a very long drive.If you feel the need to own this book, whether to judge for yourself or to be able to at least say you read it, I highly recommend buying a used copy or purchasing one at a discount store.Sorry, Stephanie, I really wanted to like this one. I have enjoyed so many of your books until this."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"The beginning was promising, as always. But then, once Amanda managed to make him want her, and especially after they made love for the first time, she became SOOOOOO stubborn, annoying, mulish, irritating, infuriating!!! I couldn't stand her. OK, she wanted him to love her - not only love her, but also tell her so. So what? Wouldn't it be good enough if he told her that a little later - after he got to know her better? If he wouldn't be totally put off by her behavior before he had the chance. God, I couldn't stand her, and I don't know what he saw in her. So the sex was good, and? It is not enough if the woman is as awful as this one was. She was 23, she was supposed to be an adult, reasonable, intelligent. But she wasn't. She behaved as if she was 15 years old. Horrible.Furthermore, she could so easily go around the town on her own, without a chaperon, with a man who was not her relative, and her parents or her cousins never found out about it. Hmm. And then she had premarital sex - several times, and in situations where she could be easily discovered. Once she was even guarded by her 'overprotective' cousins. And all that in 1820. Yeah, right. Not to mention that the sex scenes were sooo long and so very boring I just skipped them. The hero had absolutely no back bone and danced to her every tune. And I honestly don't know what he saw in her.I've red three books written by this author, and I'm done with her! Can't stand her anymore! A total waste of time!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Whatever happened to being somewhat original & having an actual story with characters that you care about. It seems like S. Laurens wrote 20 pages of storyline & in the rest she copied the love scenes of her previous novels with some find & replace to change the surroundings around them. The book goes on & on about how he doesn't want to say I love you & how she needs him to say so & I don't know how Stepanie Laurens manages to write page after page saying the same premise. The love scenes are so boring, just way too wordy & without any build up to them so it is the same scene over & over again. Julia Quinn's novels have a lot more depth to them & an actual story line that she manages to make interesting even if she is using the old cliche cinderella story as she did in one of her novels."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I love the Bar Cynster series and have enjoyed each book that came after the initial 6. One of the truly strong points in a Laurens novel is that the supporting characters have been developed, loved, nurtured, and featured in such a way that you come to anticipate their own story. And yet the author has a remarkable talent for creating a story that will stand on its own and allow the reader to jump into the series without feeling lost.This particular book as all the fancy, romance and sensuality of a Laurens novel. It also had some new twists, intriguing hurdles for the characters to overcome. There does come a moment when you just want to hit the hero on the head and say, get over it already!, and yet just as you reach that pinnacle, Laurens does it for you through the witty dialogue and fast-paced story line.A good fun read!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Laurens continues her thriving Cynster saga with Amanda Cynster crossing the borders of convention to find her soul-mate in the debauched gambling hall at Mellors - and finds herself captivated by her saviour, Earl of Dexter who rescues her from being compromised to a rake. He makes Amanda promise that after he satisfies her whim for adventures - she will stop her foolish plans for husband-hunting. Yet in the process, Martin Dexter finds himself attracted to the energetic and totally irrepressible Amanda. After a night of wild passion, Amanda and Martin finds themselves conflicted by lust and ultimately love...Ms. Laurens tells the Regency romance with a passionate style - and her languid sensuality moves the bold characters along. Spiced with a muted mystery that makes Martin a murder suspect, On a wild night is Ms. Laurens at her most dazzling best. If only the wild repartee and witty dialog had manifested in this charming read, Ms. Laruens would have scored perfection. Nevertheless her sizzling narration has elevated to a wild feverish pitch here."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"If you read the description of this book ....Cynster family saga with this highly sensual tale featuring 23-year-old Amanda Cynster, cousin of the six former rogues who starred in Laurens's earlier entries...... Well, they are not kidding! This tale featuring Amanda Cynster is something else. Hard to believe that a young lady of that period could actually pull off some of the stunts she did to lasso her object of desire, the fabulously elusive Earl of Dexter! Amanda was bored with the men she was meeting out in the ton and was looking for something a bit more wild. She found it in Martin. From the first night she met him her feelings sizzled. The chase was on, and yet she had to make it seem that she was not one of the many who had set their sights on him. - Ladies, one could take lessons from this book on how to pursue without making it look as though you were!Martin actually was intrigued by Amanda, and his protective instincts came out even though he knew that it would come to naught as he was banished 10 years before by a deed that he was innocent of, but couldn't prove at the time.If you have read the other books from the Bar Cynster series, then this is a continuation of a feast that Ms. Laurens presents to you of a highly sensual nature. Nobody, does this better! Great book - another keeper!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I sometimes find myself rooting for the requisite \\"conniving other woman\\" in romance novels. These women know what (or who) they want and try to get him. Unfortunately, intelligent, motivated women in romance novels are almost always \\"the bad guy\\" (what does this say about the authors who write them?).Amanda Cynster is now one of my favorite heroine's of all time. She is intelligent, motivated, and looking for a husband. This is not a woman to let life happen around her, she is going to make things happen.Amanda Cynster has been looking for a husband in the ton for 5 years and hasn't found one who meets her requirements. So, she decides to look outside the ton, in private clubs and gaming hells. Her plan works when she meets Martin Fulbridge, Earl of Dextor in a gaming hell. She knows right away that he is the man she wants.In order to achieve her goal, Amanda begins to put herself in situations she knows will bring out Martin's protective instincts and drive him to rescue her. Using the same method, she goads him into bringing her places she wouldn't usually be able to go. When one plan fails, she comes up with another.Martin realizes from the beginning that Amanda is playing games with him, but he can't help himself from going along anyway. They are both smart characters that are aware of what the other is up to. No dimwitted heroine in this book! Amanda knows what she's doing throughout - she wants Martin, so she does what she can to get him! When Amanda does get Martin, she still doesn't settle, she'll take him only when her terms are met.There is a little mystery in this book, the solving of a ten year old murder. It is not enough to distract from the romance aspect of the book. If you are looking for a romantic suspense, the suspense aspect will disappoint you. If you are like me and don't mind if the mystery is (very) light, this book will be perfect for you!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Another wonderful Cynster novel! Amanda's story is every bit fun and sensual as her male cousins, although Devil's Bride is my all-time favorite romance novel.

Write on Ms Laurens!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I just started reading books by Stephanie Laurens a little over a year ago and this one had me hooked from the beginning. I love how Ms. Laurens portrayed Amanda as a &quot;virginal&quot;, yet sensual and headstrong woman. She did not shy around the fact that she wanted Martin, and set out to &quot;win&quot; him over. I loved the couples first romantic tryst and Ms. Laurens descriptions were right on target. I would highly recommend this book to all romance fans that love to read good sensual and exciting romantic books.I am anxiously awaiting for Amelia's story next!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Stephanie Laurens writes the standard for historical romance. Her heroes are wonderful, thrilling and not stupid. She has the subtleties just right -- with a glance, a character conveys volumes.The story of Amanda and Martin was hard to put down. I have read all of her novels to date and the Cynster series is a joy. I can't wait to read Amelia's story and more to come!!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I do have respect for Laurens' writing, but this novel, for all its steamy-sexcapades, left a bitter aftertaste, as the premise is somehow an insult to any woman of reasonable intellect; as well as an affirmation for misogynists.It wouldn't have been so bad, really, if it posed as a suspense novel that just happened to have an awful lot of naked scenes.Amanda came off like a spoiled, coldly calculating, I'll-have-it-all-laid-at-my-feet-or-no-deal tease of a woman. And the Cynster family, whom I adored in the 3 other novels I've read, became a clan that was not so much close-knit as being driven by snobbery and lack of wit. What the heck happened...For a family led by 6 strong-willed men who were infamous for their rakehell days, it became difficult to take in the fact that, in this installment, the reader is led to assume that this family is actually more concerned with reputations and appearances. This was supposed to be a coterie of very passionate people, who have had no qualms in claiming mates of their own with whom they have a mutual explosive chemistry, past lives be-damned. The matter of \\"professing avowals of love\\" is something that they would just subsequently work with after they have been assured of being exclusively committed to one another. Something in the lines of \`claim first, then surrender later.'I could not understand why, even after it was made clear that the Cynsters (apparently) had the sense of not believing rumors, Martin's past is such a huge obstacle for welcoming him in their family. I have always thought that, as long as the elder Cynsters were assured that there really is a core of honor in the man (and that there is a healthy dose of desire on both sides), they would not hesitate to use the full backing of their \`tonnish' power to clear the name of one whom they finally consider \`one of their own.' Everything in this novel is arse-backward.For Amanda to make a full-on declaration of love from Martin as an ultimatum is not something I would have expected of a Cynster. A true Cynster, as I have understood it from Devil, Gabriel, Chillingworth, *and* even from their mates, would have acknowledged the prospect of working for and evoking love AFTER being wed (how can it not when they only have eyes for each other). Working to have that love come out in the open after weeks or months of being married would have been the true measure of how a Cynster broke down any remaining barriers to love.It made no sense to me to have Amanda demand so much from Martin, who was made to practically act like a lovesick swain (despite descriptions to the contrary), while she herself barely surrendered anything at all. Hell, she did not even act like a thoroughly ravished female after that first night with him.The ironic thing is that, Amanda (with Amelia) admitted to settling for no less than husbands who were like the Bar Cynster men...and yet they could not understand why Martin (obviously Amanda's rendition of her 'Cynster-like' husband, else she would not have latched onto him) is acting as he is. They should have deduced that, in aiming for someone who were like their male cousins, they should have been braced for someone with similar temperament: apparently overbearing and possessive but who *can* be made to admit love later on.If Laurens wanted to send a message that Amanda will not stand as a doormat vis-&agrave;-vis a dominant male, then she has gone about it in the wrong way.And even the identity of the true killer was easy to deduce before one even reaches half of the book. All the time, I was like, \`huh?' and wondered if I was just being led to believe an *obvious* choice of who the killer is. I then tentatively hoped that Laurens was going to throw a curveball and twist everything around to make me sit back on my heels and wryly admit my wrong suppositions. But no, who I halfway guessed as the killer stubbornly kept the same identity even up the end. Darn it!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"The twins raised in the shadow of uncles and cousins know as the Bar Cynster couldn't help but growing up to be independant, strong willed, and beautiful. From the first night they &quot;came out&quot; the &quot;Bar&quot; ran heard on everyone the girls came in contact with.making the young ladies feel helpless that they should never find a proper match. With nick-names like Demon, Gabrial, and Scandel that fit the former rakes to a tee, these young ladies learned from the best how to manipulate any situation to there own best end.My best recommendation is not to start the series with this book, but start from the beginning. Each book plays a little off the former, carring a subplot line all the way through, showing how this stong family from the Duke all the way though comes to the rescue of the others. A regal family that cares about all of it's members, even those born on the wrong side of th sheets.The woman are strong, they have to be to handle there men, but of the highest cut. They are resourceful, and brave. Not some ninny that hides in cornes.A great series to read from beginning to end. I've recommended these to many of my friends who have gotten hours of pleasure from them."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I read all of the male Cynster books and they were hot and so were the Cynsters. However, I read this one about the first twin and it was boring to me and not as sexy. I read the reviews on the next book on the second twin and it was so bad I didn't buy it. So if we could go back to some more sexy Cynster men I would read all of them."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I really loved this book! As a fan of Stephanie Laurens's Cynster novels, I wasn't disappointed at all with On a Wild Night. I truly enjoyed it from start to finish, and found myself savoring it like one would a chocolate dessert. Amanda has the Cynster Spark that I really love and was excited to see manifested in a woman. She is very determined from the start to find her soulmate - and once she discovers it's Martin, she goes on a very-Cynsterlike quest for his total surrender of love! He was so perfect for her - he had the similar traits that have made me adore the Cynster males (charm, a certain amount of possessiveness, honor, intelligence, sensuality, and of course great looks). I enjoyed the backdrop of the \\"less-than-respectable\\" venues that happen 'underneath' the Ton's entertainments - fun places to steal a few stolen moments together! I was also intrigued with some of the secondary characters (ie. Amanda's twin, Amelia) who will be future characters in On a Wicked Dawn. Readers get a glimpse of the other Cynsters, but they don't overwhelm the story in any way. All in all a wonderful way to spend a weekend: cuddled up with the Cynsters!!"},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I had to struggle to finish this one. The Bar Cynster series has had its mix of good and bad, but at least you could sort of go along with the plot. Maybe I was expecting another hero like Chillingworth, not in this book. Yes Martin, (the hero) is big, strong, handsome, etc. but what a wimp. He has a murder hanging over his head for 10 years and does nothing about it! Amanda does all the running here. She is annoying, really. Not what I thought she would be like. She decides to go to the places in the ton where she will find someone like her cousins, not at the balls-at the gaming hells etc. Even if you go along with this, no one tells her male cousins she's there? You know the Bar Cynster guys have enemies and rivals that would love to let them know she's fooling around. This story wasn't even remotely believable. Oh, the sex--just about in every chapter--boring. I like to see sex in these stories, but as part of the plot, not instead of it. The best part of the book was on page 280 when Martin's cousin tells Amanda off. Way to go! What it really boils down to is that I wanted to like this book, tried and just couldn't. At a [money]cover price I feel cheated."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I agree with other readers that Amanda's careless behavior in going after Martin was really unbelievable. Ms. Laurens claims to have read Georgette Heyer, and how she could not have a sense of Ms. Heyer's more authentically rendered Regency stories is a real puzzle. Amanda is in no sense a Regency woman, or for that matter of any part of the 19th century. She pretty much believes herself to be pregnant, and still refuses to marry the man even after he's proposed (and it not because she doesn't love him) because once again in that now familar Laurens storyline, the male must admit his love, while the woman remains mum as well. I also agree that the so-called love scenes have become formulaic, boring, and perhaps too numerous. The one thing that keeps me buying these books is because I want see what's happened with characters from the earlier Cynster books. And, yes, Ms. Laurens could use a real editor."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I am generally a fan of Stephanie Laurens and the Cynster series but this book is so boring. It has almost no plot and no character development. It took me over a month to finish this book, usually I finish a book in a day or two, because I could always find something better to do."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"If you enjoyed the Bar Cynster books to date then this one will be no exception. Amanda Cynster after 6 years of being &quot;out&quot; in the ton has decided that her choices are rather bleak. Oh she has people that want her dowery but she longs for the &quot;love mate&quot; that all of her cousins and uncles have found. What would we expect.She and her twin decide to take different approaches and are basically separated for the first time in their man hunt. Amanda decided to take things into her own hands and live a bit on the wild side. Though she is tempting fire she decided to visit a few of the less approved of establishments. There she meets Martin (Dexter) who she doesn't even know is an Earl when she first meets him. But she decides he is the one for her.Following her &quot;game&quot; and watching her both learn and fall in love are fun. This is a true sensual Stephanie Laurens classic."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"I found both books - On A Wild Night and On a Wicked Dawn terribly disappointing. Both books seemed more like a catalogue on the different ways and places the couples could find to make love. I do like sexy romances but when chapter after chapter is devoted to sex,it does become rather boring.At least pump it up with a good story and interesting characteters - but even that fell short - disappointing for a author of a stature of Laurens.Also I just don't fall for the idea of how both Martin and Luc can't bring themselves to declare their love. It seems that in trying to bring out the strength of character of her heroes, Stephanie Laurens has compromised on their sensitivity. I think a blend of both makes a man more interesting and realistic."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"This book, my friends, can be best described as \\"same old, same old.\\" I think the Cynsters should be retired and SL should get on with something fresh. Amanda and Martin were both rather annoying. Their actions and behavior were tedious and juvenile. Rather like the head cheerleader scheming to catch the football hero. Amanda is in her twenties, but acts like she's fourteen.

Miss Laurens should take some lessons from Marsha Canham or Kathleen Woodiwiss and develop a decent story. Real life doesn't revolve around sex. It is an important part, but I couldn't even get through half this book before throwing it away. I wasted my money when I bought this book and I was wasting my time waiting for something interesting to happen. I won't buy anymore of her books. If I could I wouldn't give this book any stars. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"WOW! That's what I first thought when I read the Chapter 1 on her web-site...Stephanie Laurens has managed to make the long awaited love stories on the Twins as good as if not better than their cousins (except Gabriel...LOVE him and Richard). She has given us another strong heroine who is a Cynister by blood and actions... SHE was the so-called &quot;Wolf&quot; her cousins warned her away from and it was deliciously exciting and funny from page one... I loved the interaction between her and Dexter (Martin); no Big Misunderstandings or any of the other beloved Regency plots, just a strong story about a woman out to get her dream man and a hero who finds redemption in her love. The only thing that stops me from giving this a FIVE is how the mystery was quickly (and I mean quickly) resolved...I do have to give her credit for trying to throw red herrings in as well; made you think for a moment even though you KNEW there was only one option.....and though I LOVED every last love scene...sometimes you want the story...but, as always, she delivered with her trademark humor (the most laugh out loud scene involves a pewter jug)...I also was glad too see the men of the Bar Cynister show up...their roles were too adorable and the sympathy for Martin was funny... Plus, not only were you given Amanda's story, but you were also given a teasing glimpse of what's to come with her sister Amelia and the charming Luc.Once again, Ms. Laurens has out done herself with a STRONG heroine and hero that were PERFECTLY matched in EVERY way..."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"As always, Stephanie Laurens is an entertaining storyteller. However, this book deviates so far from the historical setting that it is more like time travel by a 21st Century young woman to the early 19th Century. Skipped over most of the middle to get to the end. Worth a read, but not a keeper."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"It seems to me that these writers need to read each other's work before producing another tale... I mean seriously this is the same story of A Marriage lesson by Victoria Alexander where the females wants excitement, forces the male to give it to her with the threat that she will go to someone else, falls in love, gets compromised and then goes on for more then 200 pages refusing to accept his marriage proposal because he has not said he loves her.... I mean SERIOUSLY? I bet I can find many other books the fill this exact outline. This story fails to give me something to enjoy, the only reason I kept reading was because I hate to start something and not finish it.

Amanda Cynster's story takes her into places where no lady of her kind would have dared venture into. After accepting a dare she couldn't back out of, Amanda is rescued by Martin Fulbridge, the Earl of Dexter. It goes without saying that Amanda is a typical Cynster - stubborn, haughty, and wilful; while Martin is pretty much like her male cousins, whom she has based her standards on. Intrigued by a scandal concerning his past and having decided after their first meeting that she wanted him to be her husband, Amanda works on seducing Martin, who eventually falls for her charms.The interaction between the two main characters isn't as exciting to read about. The lengthy love scenes were rather monotonous that I found myself skipping those pages. If there was one thing I enjoyed the most, it was those scenes involving Lady Osbaldestone and The Bar Cynster. I laughed and laughed on that part when Martin went to see Devil. That part was so well written that it was almost like being there and actually seeing the reactions of the 6 cousins. It was just brilliant! For that part alone, I'm giving this book 3 and a half stars."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Amanda Cynster, along with her twin sister Amelia, have been searching London ballrooms for six years looking for their perfect match. Each is bored with the uninteresting prospects, and both have decided to take matters into their own hands.Amanda has concluded there are suitable husbands who circulate along the fringes of the ton, and do not attend polite society's functions. So she sets out to explore places where young ladies are never to go, but interesting men would frequent. One night she sneaks out to a notorious gaming hell looking for just such a man, and quickly discovers she's in over her head. Unexpectedly, a man comes to her rescue. Martin Fulbridge, earl of Dexter, is tall, dark, and mysterious, and just the type of man she is searching for. Wrongly accused of murder and banished from England by his father, Martin has just recently returned from living abroad for the past ten years. Since his return, he has avoided the social activities of the respectable.Martin has no intention of courting the appealing but forbidden Amanda, nevertheless, he finds himself acting as her protector. Amanda is determined to experience adventure by frequenting scandalous venues no young lady should be attending. Eventually Martin succumbs to his growing desire for Amanda, then insists they marry. She will settle for no less than love, thus his honor-bound pursuit of her begins. Ultimately, their future together can only be secured by solving the ten-year old murder mystery.This was my second read by this author, as well as my second Cynster novel. I felt this particular book was okay, but not great. As for the main characters, I did like Martin who seemed quite sexy and mysterious, if not a little emotionally deficient. Amanda was okay, but just a little too flawless to be real. The intrigue plot did add some interest, although it was rather obvious who the culprit was. The love scenes were erotic and numerous. Overall, it was just an average read for me. As for a recommendation, if you're a Laurens and Cynster series fan, then you'll probably want to read it, otherwise, I'd skip it."},{"Title":"On a Wild Night (Cynster Novels)","review":"Not the kind you want to read again.

I hate that in a book..sex is fine, but not 75% of the book.

Home made pies are rare these days, so I am glad to have a new book with nothing but recipes for apple pies, 100 in all. Strictly speaking, some of the recipes are not pies, but close relatives.I like this cookbook very much. I appreciate the simple, direct instructions. I did not have any real problems with the recipes I tried. Note that the author prefers streusel toppings over the traditional 2-crust pie. I find the instructions to remove a blazing hot, half-baked pie out of the oven and pressing toppings onto it with your hands dangerous and not advisable. The author has not solved the problem of a giant air gap under the top crust of a baked pie; he sidesteps the issue by usually recommending a streusel topping, to be applied halfway through baking. The author also lives in the northeast, so much of his comments about different apple varieties apply to those not usually available on the west coast.On the other hand, there are a few missing elements, which is rather surprising for a book that is essentially only one recipe with 99 variations. One would expect some hints and problems that relate to most of the recipes in the book, yet none are forthcoming. Since all the recipes have apples, one would also expect an extended section about apples: seasons, different types, which to choose for which recipe, typical characteristics, etc. However, the information about apples is perfunctory. It should also have a section on preparing apples, rolling the crust, and how to flute the edges (some information on this does finally appear on p. 81 in an easily overlooked sidebar), but this information is mostly lacking; there are a few tips hopelessly scattered in random portions of the text where you will never find them when you need them. Information on slicing apples appears in a side bar on page 41. It would be helpful to have some sort of cross reference to tell you which recipe is best for different apples, for those who come home from the market with a bagful of a particular type of apple in peak season. I also object to the organization: the recipes are grouped into chapters, but the groupings do not make much sense. More disturbingly, all the ingredients are listed in volume measure, but do not include weight equivalents. The author lists flour amounts in cups only, but does describe what method he uses to fill the measuring cups (dip and sweep, spooning, sifting, etc.). The apple amounts are usually listed in cups of cut up apples; this is unfortunate, as one buys apples by the piece or pound, not by the cupful, in the market. The author does not supply equivalents or conversions.All in all, I enjoy having such a large number of recipes for just one thing: apple pies, since I like them very much; you will never run out of new recipes to try. However, any single subject cookbook must be more than just 100 similar recipes jumbled together; it must also cover its subject and its aspects thoroughly and in depth. This book does not meet that standard."},{"Title":"Apple Pie Perfect: 100 Delicious and Decidedly Different Recipes for America's Favorite Pie","review":"Ken Haedrich, a regular contributor to both BETTER HOMES & GARDENS and BON APPETIT, has struck a home run with his \\"Apple Pie Perfect\\"--the first all-apple-pie cookbook I've ever seen. Normally I shy away from cookbooks that are so narrowly focused, but as I like Haedrich's relaxed writing style and because apple pies are such wonderfully American desserts, I decided to take a look inside. I was astounded by what I saw.Haedrich has delivered here nearly every conceivable apple pie permutation you can imagine. The purely apple ones include Baked Apple Dumpling Pie, Grated Apple Pie, Apple Cobbler Pie, Apple Upside-Down Pan Pie, Shaker Boiled Apple Cider Pie, and dozens of others. Then there are the pies which fudge the title a little bit and branch out into other fruits: Apple Cherry Pie with Coconut Almond Crumb Topping, Apple and Champagne Grape Pie, several pies combining apples and tomatoes (yes!), Cottage Cheese-Cheesecake Apple Pie, Apple Pie with Prunes and Port, and more. Haedrich even gives us the official recipe for New York State's Official Apple Pie (using McIntosh apples, an apple most knowing bakers would shy away from for use in a pie, as it gets smushy--but he says it's delicious in this particular recipe).Of course Haedrich also supplies his readers with a broad variety of different pie crusts and gives, as always, all manner of helpful hints based on his extensive home-baking experience. He is a kindly and knowledgeable guide, and his avuncular voice is particularly well-suited to this book. The book boasts an attractive and easy-to-read graphic design (although I would prefer that the color used for headers and sidebars were something other than red, which can be hard on the eyes, it DOES make sense in a book about apples!)."},{"Title":"Apple Pie Perfect: 100 Delicious and Decidedly Different Recipes for America's Favorite Pie","review":"Ever wanted to know why you have to punch steam vents in your crust? Not sure how to tell when your pie is done? Does your bottom crust always come out soggy, not golden and firm? This book can solve your problems--never have the bottom crusts on our apple pies come out so well!The book includes &quot;A Pie Maker's Guide to Apple Varieties.&quot; It would help if I could actually find more than four or five apple varieties at our store, of course. But at least it tells me the characteristics of the various apple varieties so I can substitute an appropriate variety for the exotic ones called for in some of these recipes. (It also helps that recipes often include notes such as this one from the grated apple pie recipe: &quot;The original Pennsylvania Dutch recipe calls for Winesap apples, but any firm, juicy, tart apple, including Granny Smith, will do.&quot;) By the time you're done you'll be able to make whatever kind of apple pie you like best, whether that's mushy or firm, juicy or dry, sweet or tart. You'll also find little &quot;helper&quot; recipes in here, like various crust recipes, sauces, and so on.The layout is clean and clear. Ingredients are delineated by crust, filling, topping, and so on. Direction steps are numbered and broken down into short steps. There's one short spread of color photo pages in the middle of the book, so you can stare at the frozen apple and peanut butter cloud pie and die of sugar shock. We have stumbled across one instance of slightly confused directions so far, but it was easy to figure out how to fix it, and that was the only incident. There's a good index in the back of the book (you can look up recipes by type of apple), and the table of contents lists out each individual pie with page number.Every single recipe we've made from this book has come out completely and utterly delicious. I'm usually disappointed by apple pie, but not by the pies from this cookbook! Even when they aren't my favorite texture or taste, they're still so good that I don't mind! And they're creative and unusual, guaranteed to keep us from ever becoming bored with apple pie again (apple and brie hand pies, anyone?).

Well, I tried the Cheddar Cheese Crust and all I can say is...YUMMMM! As I perused the recipes, I kept returning to Apple Cheesecake Pie and I finally succumbed. What I was looking for was a simple recipe for a dessert to take to a party or to serve to guests. I must confess that the first time I made this, I did neither.

The crux of it is that you are dealing with bad or difficult behaviour, not necessarily bad people. If you understand what drives the behaviour you can be more successful in dealing with it.

I was a IT consultant for 10 years working with many different global coporate companiess, and now run my own business employing 15 people. I can recognise each and every behaviour type.

Isenberg's book on the Great John L. is among the best boxing books ever, a very well researched work that dwells into the smallest details of Sullivan both as a fighter and a sociological phenom of his time, the first blue collar sports hero in America..

Sullivan and His America (Sport and Society)","review":"A nicely written biography of a great champion. Isenberg begins with a scholarly discussion of the Irish-American background in which Sullivan was born and extends to the bare knuckle society were he reigned supreme for twelve years.

He's very knowledgible about Khmer Angkor and the architects. Now, if you want to know about Angkors (all of the monunents in Cambodia) you got to read it from the source--the director of Angkors himself!! You can't never go wrong with this book. Every Angkor monument in this guide has some illustrated picture. Surprisingly the monument names are both in English and Khmer. I got 4 copies and gave them to my Khmer friends. They love it, especially the Khmer character names of the monument !!"},{"Title":"Angkor: An Illustrated Guide to the Monuments","review":"I bought this years ago at an airport bookstore in Singapore and still read it now and again as it is such a lovely book that truly captures the ancient city of Angkor. The book contains meticulous descriptions of the ancient city [temples, palaces, monuments], with maps and even line drawings of bas-reliefs.The book also provides historical background on how the city came into being, with a focus on the Khmer civilisation. Khmer architecture is also dealt with in great detail. And of course, there are beautiful full color photographs that depict the ruins in all their ancient glory.A highly recommended book to those planning a trip to Angkor and for those who simply wish to 'escape' into the world of the ancient city."},{"Title":"Angkor: An Illustrated Guide to the Monuments","review":"I just recently returned from a visit to this amazing city.

If you're planning a visit, this book is essential."},{"Title":"Line of Sight","review":"There's nothing equivocal about Michele Gibbs. Her vision is clear, her analysis grounded and informed by a lifetime of struggle and study, her delivery one of quiet confidence, her goals well stated and without unnecessary compromise.Chicago born and raised, of a Jewish Communist mother and an Afro-American father who served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish civil war, to prevent a Fascist government from coming to power, Gibbs has known oppression from her earliest years (\\"...times when the sight of my face / was enough / for bosses to show my mom the gate: / no nigger lovers here\\": from \\"to begin\\").In later years, after time spent in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and other points in between, she found herself in Detroit, a place she keeps going back to both in person and in thought (\\"Someday / i'll write / my last Detroit poem ... And until then, / while there is witness to bear, / work to share, /and some people to care - / i'll be there.\\": from \\"Someday\\").Gone to Grenada in the '80s, to work in the newly elected progressive government of Maurice Bishop (\\"The arithmetic of justice, / The equation of participation, / The multiplication of mobilization, / The calculus, in sweat, / of transformation... Say it any way you like, / This is a working revolution\\": from \\"It's simple, but not easy\\"), she was imprisoned by anti-Bishop forces when the U.S. army, sent by Ronald Reagan, invaded (\\"...the heavy handed youths / obeying orders / came at midnight / of the day / they killed you, Maurice, / to come for me\\": from \\"Fragmentation bombs: scenes from a war\\").Forcibly deported by the U.S. invaders, Michele later lived on the Greek island of Lesbos, and in Oaxaca, Mexico, where we met some ten years ago. Sculptor, artist, essayist, poet and teacher, Michele Gibbs has never given up the struggle to make a better world. In a style that is spare, focused, and calm, she continues to be sometimes angry, sometimes sad, but never despairing or defeated.\\"Line of Sight\\", her latest book, contains poetry and essays from previous works and some new material, as well as a large selection of her drawings and sculpture. It opens with the capture and removal of African peoples for the slave trade, and follows their (and her) struggle for freedom, equality, and justice."},{"Title":"The Challenge of the Sea","review":"The Challenge of The Sea is a long-forgotten and, indeed, criminally-overlooked book in Arthur C. Clarke's vast repetoire. Of course, this may surprise many, as the first thing that one generally thinks of when hearing the name &quot;Arthur C. Clarke&quot; are visions of space and black monoliths. Those familar with Clarke's life, though, know that he harbors, if you will pardon the pun, a long-time fascination for the seas of earth as well as his well-known love for the depths and mystery of space. An enthusiastic skin diver, Clarke went on several diving expeditions and even helped excavate a genuine sunken treasure ship (see his &quot;The Treasure of The Great Reef.&quot;) Though such writings declined after the coming of the 1970's, the early part of Clarke's career featured numerous articles as well as a handful of books, both fact and fiction, focusing on the sea. The Challenge of The Sea belongs to the non-fiction category, and is perhaps the best of the bunch. As always with Clarke's books of this type, it is an encyclopedic, comprehensive look at the entire subject: its history, accomplishments, inherent challenges, as well as prospects and projections for the future -- think along the lines of some of his more well-known space books of the same sort, i.e., The Promise of Space and The Challenge of the Spaceship. With Clarke, you know that you're never in store for a dry, boring read of the subject at hand, no matter what the subject may be: this book is in his usual well-written, highly poetic, more-than-occasionally funny, immensely readable and ever-interesting style. I found several of these articles to be particularly interesting, as the sea is a subject with which I am not overly familar with. The beauty of the book, though, is that Clarke shows what a fundamentally interesting (and almost wholly unknown) place the sea inherently is. By the time you are finished with this book, you, too, will find it an interesting and fascinating place, regardless of your prior views on the subject -- if you happened to have any at all. One problem with much of Clarke's non-fiction work is that it often suffers from a general sameness, and the same articles appear numerous times in various different books. As a long-time Clarke reader who has read upwards of 50 of the author's books, I was refreshingly surprised to not come across a single article in this delightful little book that I had previously read. Another good thing about it is that, unlike some of Clarke's more popular non-fiction works on space, the passage of time has dated it very little. Despite the fact that it was published in 1960, it is practically as applicable and fresh now as it was then. Consequently, this book is a worthy read for even the Clarke fan who has read almost everything the author has to offer. It is also one of his better and most oft-overlooked works of the kind, and deserves to be read by fanatics and more casual fans alike."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"Someone referred me to this book for baking recipes.

I've only begun to explore the wonders it holds within. The number of apple recipes alone will keep me delightfully occupied. Once you leaf through it, you'll be scouring your kitchen for the needed ingredients to get started on one of the wonderful challahs or cakes or cookies. Opening this book is like opening the door to the Jewish bakeries of yore. What makes it even more appealing is the haimish (homey) way Marcy addresses each recipe. Her hints are a valuable asset.

Her introductory notes contain a wealth of information that proved useful to me, although I would consider myself a seasoned baker. I also enjoyed her anecdotes about her family and their holidays and baking experiences. The information she includes about where to purchase specialty or hard to find ingredients and baking items finally pointed me in the direction of a certain honey dish I have been searching for for years.The book is organized according by holiday according to the Jewish calendar including a brief description of each holiday as an introduction. Every section includes both recipes for the novice as well as more difficult and complicated ones. Some of her directions may prove too ambiguous for a novice baker (just how sticky is a sticky batter meant to be?) and I found I had to add more flour than was called for in her Mandelbroit recipe; but overall this is a very good general baking book."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"Marcy Goldman never fails me.

I bought it initially for the challah recipes when I was looking for the perfect challah. I kept it for the knowledgeable and entertaining writing throughout. The author shares her extensive knowledge in a very accessible way. Despite being a specialty cuisine baking cookbook, I've learned more from this book about baking in general than from any other book on baking that I've ever read. Additionally, it is a wonderful introduction into Jewish holiday traditions. It is a very personal and useful book. I cannot say enough about this book.

And the mock chestnut torte is worth twice the price of the book."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"Love this book. Tried so many recipes. Everyone a winner. The chocolate Chanukah layer cake is not to be missed, cocoa honey cake a real winner, I could go on and on."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"After several months of using this cookbook over and over and over, I decided to buy it for friends. It is extremely user-friendly, because many of the recipes use basic ingredients and are uncomplicated to make. The directions are well-written, and the final product turns out exactly as I visualize from the recipe, even when baking unfamiliar treats.I keep reaching for it, because there are so many wonderful cakes, that I can always find something different or unusual, without worrying because I've never tried the recipe before. Variations are often included, as well as cooking times for different pan types and sizes.It's one of those cookbooks where you can flip through it and consistently find something appropriate, without requiring a trip to the store for some odd ingredient. The honey cake is fantastic, but the double fudge cake on pg. 110 &quot;wows&quot; everybody every time. Bring that one to your next family get-together (I use a bundt pan and skip the glaze, or drizzle on a quick confectioner's sugar glaze after it's cooled), and they will think you stopped at a bakery (I'm not kidding).The only minor issue, is that on recipes where a range of flour is given (e.g. soufganiot), I sometimes need to add even more flour. This was the same with another (hamantaschen), where it was obvious that the dough was too sticky to shape. So while some experience is helpful, common sense can tell you if more flour is needed. This has never been an issue with any of the cake recipes, only those which are naturally more flexible on the ingredients.Good Shabbos!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"I checked this book out from the library several times before buying it. The Passover Chocolate Torte was a raving success at our family's seder. The honey cake is to die for. And the pareve cocoa cake is delicious!

They're wonderful to start with!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"This book is truly awesome ... tried-and-true specialties, each written very clearly to guarantee success, and each preceded by a brief description telling why it is so wonderful. The first recipe I tried was the Caramel Matzoh Crunch, which has now become a staple. I'm not Jewish; these wonderful recipes should appeal to anyone with taste buds. The only caveat is that the author apparently revised her Honey Cake after the book was published -- and even I, who previously despised honey cake, love Marcy Goldman's. (The revised version was published in the newspaper, and that's the one I tried.) Don't miss this book; it is absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"I collect, read, savor, and love reading cookbooks. This cookbook is a KEEPER. Every recipe in it is a 100% success. The one recipe that totally separated this book for all others is Bubbie's Orange and Oil Hamantaschen recipe. We've all tried to make hamantaschen with the dough collapsing or sticking all over. Not any more, with Ms Goldman's amazing recipe you too can make wonderful hamantaschen. I did it at home, with kids I teach, even made them at camp. Buy this cookbook, You'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"I love this book. Easy simple recipes that have superior taste. I have made banana cake,sticky buns,favorite apple cake and others. All came out great"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"Some Jewish cookbooks are haimish, some are personal, some give historical/religious/cultural background, some are long on good recipes for the experienced cook but short on practical advice for the neophyte: If your shelf is packed with all of the above, and you know your onions (or your onion bagels), you need Marcy's book. And if you are only going to buy one book on Jewish baking, this is the one to buy. I have been a flour-flinging semi-pro baker and sometimes food writer for more than twenty years, and from experience, I know that Marcy Goldman's recipes are the best. Before this book came out, I already had tried--with one-hundred-percent success--many of her recipes that were published in The Washington Post as well as in The Baking Sheet, a must-read-newsletter-for-bakers-of-all-persuasions-and-ethnic-backgrounds that is published by King Arthur Flour of Norwich, Vt. (disclaimer: I've also written for The Baking Sheet, but have never met Marcy and she is not bribing me to pen a rave of her book). With her warmth, technical expertise, and clear directions, she has something to offer bakers of all levels of experience. I especially appreciated her section on challah, a weekly Sabbath staple of my household (and of many of my friends, who just seem to know when to drop by). Many recipes by other authors concentrate on fancy braiding and presentation, which challah neophytes have confessed to me that they find intimidating, if not off-putting. Marcy focuses on the makings and bakings of wonderful challah; the bells and whistles can come later. I'd rather sink my teeth into an endearingly lumpily hand-fashioned, great-textured, great-tasting loaf than a gummy eye-pleaser. Marcy will not let you down. I could go on and on, but my copy is already gritty with flour. What better recommendation can I give--I own hundreds of cookbooks--than that?"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"After renewing The Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking at the library three times I decided it was time to purchase it. This is definately a purchase I haven't been disappointed with. The Sour Cream Coffee Cake is outstanding and has been given to several friends as a gift, with rave reviews I might add. The Tunnel of Fudge Cake was everything I expected and more, and made a spectacular Teacher Appreciation Week gift. You will enjoy the stories of the Jewish holidays and much as the recipes. I am going to buy the book for my two sister's, one of whom is a caterer. I know anyone who purchases this book or receives it as a gift will be thrilled."},{"Title":"A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking","review":"I have many Jewish cookbooks, and bake a lot for all the holidays and Shabbat, and this is by far my favorite book for desserts. Marcy Goldman's brownies recipe is quick and easy, and the resulting amazing, chewy brownies have become my Shabbat hallmark, with everyone requesting the \\"famous\\" brownies when they visit.Goldman also includes wonderful recipes for honey cake, bagels, apple cake, cookies, and more. One of my favorites is her unusual etrog cake: it's moist, tart, and divine, and an original way to use up the etrog after Sukkot. Last Passover, my mother used this cookbook, and baked a rich, creamy Passover chocolate cake. It tasted like cheesecake - though it was parve - and didn't taste \\"Passover\\" at all. We all tried to guess what was in it, but couldn't. When I got home, I looked it up, and was surprised to see the secret ingredient was sweet potatoes!

There is something for everyone -- beginner, novice or expert. And Marcy's Classic Cuisine d'Or Carrot Cake recipe alone is worth the price of the book.

The Kieso series became dominant but this remains a great textbook. I use it as a resource because I occasionally teach a university accounting course, particularly financial accounting I.

If you need pure &quot;study&quot;, this book is not for you. However, if you've been through the studies of Scripture and need time to reflect upon your everyday walk, this book is divine. Very simple written - short paragraphs, each ending with prayer and reflection. I had bought my wife the book &quot;Jesus as CEO&quot;, after she received a promotion to a management position where she works. She loved the book, which she still uses today as a tool in working with her fellow employees.

With two indexes (one for food references and another &quot;general&quot; for names and places) make this book indispensible for anyone who has an interest in anything Italian. This book, coupled with &quot;The Food of Southern Italy&quot; by Carlo Middione, and &quot;Italian Food&quot; by Elizebeth David, creates an complete library on the subject with nearly every stone tured."},{"Title":"The cooking of Italy","review":"The Foods of the World series is the best series I think that Time/Life has ever put out. Each book covers one country by region, and provides a general survey of food of the country and of each region. The recipes are good and the overview of each region interesting. The books can be used as travel guides and cookbooks and are without exception very well written.The Cooking of Italy is no exception. Reading it is like taking a virtual tour of that country. Everything from basic way of life to cheesemaking is discussed. Of course wines and cheeses are discussed in detail as are other regional variations (pasta shapes, use of butter vs olive oil as primary cooking oil, etc). You can learn a lot about Italy from this book.But more to the point, you can also learn a lot about making Italian food. This book taught me how to make pasta by hand (fettuccine, tortellini etc), and the section on pizza (Neapolitan, not American) is extremely good too.

Instead of allowing our thoughts giving us headache, we can use humor to keep us sane and to keep the headaches at bay. Martha takes the most mundane experiences in our lives and turn them into moments of hilarity. Martha Bolton is a full-time comedy writer and the author of 40+ books. She has received two Angel awards and an Emmy nomination.The cover page is the modern version of Auguste Rodin's famous sculpture \`The thinker'. As you must have seen, the man in the sculpture thinks as a full body exercise - not only with his brain, his knitted brow, nostrils, compressed lips, with every muscle of his arms, legs clenched first and gripping toes. Socrates allowed himself ample time and space to think. Thinking is hard work. No wonder it gives us a headache.Socrates never would have survived today's crowded schedules. There are too many meetings to go to, projects to work on, e-mails that need answering, and kids who need to be picked up from soccer practice, piano lessons, karate classes, and gymnastics. We're too busy living life to take any time to actually contemplate it.As proclaimed by Anton Chekhov \\"Any idiot can face a crisis-it's this day-to-day living that wears you out.\\" That's why this book is important-thinking and laughing for day-do-day living. Thinking about how much our world has changed over the years. And how much it has stayed the same. Thinking about both the tragedies and the comedies of life. Thinking about politics, faith, family, health food, exercise, air travel, modern conveniences, and more. Let us study Martha Bolton's refreshing take on life.Martha starts the connection of headaches to drugs (p 17), food (p19), work (p23), space (p29) name tags (p33). She describes brain exercises, brain concerts, brain speeches and brain skydiving (p37). Her delineation of Methuselah and Methuselah tree (p 41-44) is humorous and thought provoking. She points out nicely how by adapting to circumstances and shaping our attitudes we can survive easily. She recommends chocolate for healing and healthy life (p 53-54), stresses the importance of a penny (p 59-62), deals with noises (p 63-65). She says as a matter of fact that minds are never meant to be shrink wrapped. She traces the connection between words, meaning and language (p 77-79). We should put more thought into our words. She comments about inventions (p 81-83) and on e-speak (p 85-88). The sample email communication she mentions is pertinent and relevant. She emphasizes good listening skills (p 95-97),the hazards of air travel (103-105), the hazards of poor memory and the gifts of selective memory (p 111-113). The title \`borrowed thoughts' for headaches due to credit cards is excellent and apt. (p 115-117) She proves that children are the same from the days of Socrates (p 137 - 138). She describes nicely the idiosyncracies of instructions and announcements in public places (p 139-141). Even Queen Elizabeth II's family has eccentricities, family disagreements and wayward youngsters. But a family keeps life interesting. Martha wants to see a hypochondriac line of greeting cards (p 147-149). She elaborates how friends, parents, dieters and Christians can act as travel agents for guilt trips. She succinctly puts, \`Life is too short to carry heavy purses. Carrying a grudge is like being stung to death by one bee (p 155-158). She wants you to wear a hat if a meteor is headed your way. Imagination of worrying scenarios is borrowing trouble from tomorrow. The strength is not there - only the worry and stress (p 159-161). She humorously connects cloning and business group discounts (p 163-164). She stresses the importance of fun : We are afraid to use the laugh muscles that came with the original packaging. We allowed our smiles to sag and our negative outlook to drag us down. God intended each new dawning to be met with anticipation, not apprehension; wonder, not whining. Martha elucidates the common exercise of jumping to conclusions - how it can jeopardize the relationships, jobs and peace of mind (p 173-175). Martha's emphasis on laughter is illuminating : \\"It is perfectly legal to laugh and drive. Laughter does not have an expiration date. The average child laughs about 400 times per day. An average adult laughs 15 times a day. What happened to the other 385 laughs?The quotations underlying the title and the end of the passage are eye-openers and they amplify the experience. I liked this one in p 107 : \\"All our words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the mind\\"-- Khalil Gibran and the one in p 131 : \\"The difference between the right word and almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug\\" -- Mark Twain and the one in p 161 : \\"Don't worry about the world coming to an end today. It is already tomorrow in Australia.\\" - - Charles Schultz"},{"Title":"I Think, Therefore I Have a Headache!: A Laugh-Out-Loud Look at Life","review":"This is a great book for those that like to pick up something quick and get a good laugh in the middle of a crazy work week.

To this end, the author/missionary writes in an upbeat fashion and this short compact text is easy reading for anyone who wants first hand information on the challenges of missionary life in Roman Catholic dominated Colombia.Corley underwent back surgery, contracted malaria, typhoid fever, dengue fever, had numerous bouts with intestinal parasites and suffered 15 burglaries while serving in Colombia. Moreover, the majority of Colombia's Roman Catholics were not initially thrilled with his work and he was subjected to many icy receptions. However, it broke his heart to leave. It broke his heart because he and his family were able to overcome the many hardships and managed to use their strong Christian love to establish four churches and several missions inside the borders of Colombia.Corley is a truly special human being. He grew up very poor in Alabama. But overcame his poverty to reach great heights. Corley also has a great sense of humor and uses it to share many of his hair-raising experiences in Colombia. Clearly this is a book about faith...but Corley weaves his love of God into nearly every page of this book in a highly entertaining and yet very humble fashion. This is a serious book that provides excellent insights to what makes missionaries tick. Allow me to give you some hints...they certainly don't do it to \\"earn points\\" or to \\"accumlate wealth.\\" Recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"Since &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; can be rather daunting for the student, I think this is an exceptional way to garner more of the needed information. The definitions are to the point, and the summaries aren't lengthy and over-bearing. If this is something to be read in the classroom, I see no reason why this shouldn't accompany the text."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"The CliffsNotes booklet on THE CANTERBURY TALES is a helpful supplement which will lead the user to a deeper understanding of a fairly difficult subject. It contains information about Geoffrey Chaucer and his work in addition to an introduction, brief synopsis and character map. Critical commentaries on The Prologue, individual tales and Chaucer's Retraction are included as well as character analyses of Harry Bailey, the Host, the Knight, the Miller, the Wife of Bath and the Pardoner. Three critical essays are added plus an index. Properly used this guide will make the learning experience more meaningful as long as the student reads the entire literary work and completes all classroom assignments."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"The notes are really helpful as a supplement to the book.

However, when teaching the tales for the first time to my senior high school students, I realized there was a lot I had forgotten. The first place I went for assistance was CLIFFSNOTES: THE CANTERURY TALES by Dr. James L. Roberts. The book includes a brief biography about Chaucer's life, an introduction to the work, a list of characters, a summary and commentary about each one of the tales, character analysis of selected characters (Harry Bailey, the Knight, the Miller, the Wife of Bath, the Pardoner), a few selected essays, a review, and a list of further resources. I found Cliffsnotes extremely helpful in preparing to teach THE CANTERBURY TALES for the first time and I know that some of my students found it just as useful as well (Middle English and high school students don't mix very well together). A great tool to supplement one's reading, studying, and teaching of Chaucer's THE CANTERBURY TALES."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"It was pretty much exactly what I expected it to be. I bought it so I could read the notes first so when going through the story I would have a better idea what was going on. With middle English I find it easy to stop caring about what I am reading and seem to suddenly lose track of what's going on (I mean it's all quite important to literature, but I just don't care that much, I more care about progress).So I bought a used copy and it seemed pretty perfect. I don't know if the pages were always a bit dark or this copy was just weathered more than usual but that is the closest thing I could find to proof that the book was used. I may just be lucky with ordered used books supplied by Amazon but I will continue to for books that I am not too worried about.So yeah. This book will not get you out of actually reading the work, but if you just don't have the time to it is better than nothing. However if you read it AND the original you will probably pick up a bit more (unless you are a smarty pants and don't even need this)."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"An excellent book written and published first in the Middle Ages in England in Old English."},{"Title":"CliffsNotes on Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales","review":"Cliff Notes was purchased for my husband to try and get through \\"Canterbury Tales\\".

The author, born in Scotland, makes pointed, and sometimes caustic remarks about the land, the people, wildlife, politics and other topics. Students of Texas History will spot a number of inaccuracies throughout the text. Names are mispelled and some Spanish words are spelled they way they would sound to an Anglo. The author entertains a low opinion of the Mexican people, but also derides the dullards and loafers among the &quot;Yanquiz&quot;. (An equal opportunity offender perhaps?)The writer's sarcasm bubbles up often, which tends to become tiresome after several chapters. It is still worth browsing, but you'll need to compare it to other published works to get an accurate picture."},{"Title":"A history of New Testament times in Palestine, 175 B.C.-70 A.D., (New Testament handbooks)","review":"wanted more detail tho.. in this case I guess detail is the enire point and theres never enough...for the price it couldnt be beat..."},{"Title":"The bandit Joaquin: An orphaned Mexican's search for revenge in the California gold rush","review":"This book is a delight.

This book presents a good introduction to the major ideas of ethical thinking about the environment. He presents ideas on how rights might be derived as a gradation from purely human interest, rights based on whether animals suffer, and nature with its own right. Throughout the book questions of individual versus community rights are discussed. Each chapter starts with a short essay that highlights some of the complexities; for example whether Mountain Goats should be introduced or eliminated in Olympic National Park. Each chapter is concluded with discussion questions that also help the reader grapple with the issues.He presents many of the major ideas and criticisms of animal rights, energy use, the land ethic, deep ecology, and ecofeminism. Particularly in the areas of deep ecology he presents the diversity of views. Perhaps he is weak in presenting third world views and the impact that &quot;Deep ecology&quot; might have on poor and agrarian populations. He is lacking discussion of religious based environmental ethics (&quot;Theocentric ethics\\"). Christian Ecology seeks to develop a stewardship view, and Native American, and Eastern religions center on respect for nature. I think this book works best when read with selections from the authors discussed; for example read some of Leopold's &quot;Sand County Almanac&quot;, then read the chapter on &quot;The Land Ethic.&quot;"},{"Title":"Environmental Ethics: An Invitation to Environmental Philosophy","review":"I read the first edition of this book (1993) and have no doubt that the third edition will surpass its scope and clarity. In a few hundred pages, Joseph Des Jardins unspools the thread of western philosophical tradition and makes it relevant for today's urgent environmental issues. Each chapter begins with a timely case study--salmon and economic develoment, nuclear waste and the rights of future generations to a clean environment--then develops the philosophical arguments required to more deeply understand just what is at stake in these and similar issues. Des Jardins' style is easy-going and eminently accessible. He wastes no words, gets to heart of the matter, and leaves the reader wanting more. Footnotes and additional readings lead to original material if the reader wants to delve more thoroughly into the topics. But you can just stop with Des Jardins if you are not a scholar, and still gain a firm grasp on how the big thinkers of western philosophy brought us to a critical divide in our environmental future. Edition One included late-breaking news from the social environmental and eco-feminist fronts, and I am confident the 2000 edition will be just as current."},{"Title":"Environmental Ethics: An Invitation to Environmental Philosophy","review":"Wow, if you ever want to read a book that will really explain the ins and outs of ethics and how ethics relates to the environment - then you gotta get this book. I don't recommend reading this book curled up on the couch for a weekend. You are going to want to read it a chapter at a time and really reflect over what you have read - you know - mull it over a bit and really digest it. Be careful though - because it is one of those books that could change the way you view yourself and the world around you."},{"Title":"Environmental Ethics: An Invitation to Environmental Philosophy","review":"I purchased this book for an environmental ethics class, and found it to be very interesting!

I find the author's attempt to make the book long enough to be qualified as a text book down right PATHETIC. He adds way too many \\"big\\" words and unnecessary sentances. I'm sure he has some good points. But his endless babble will completely throw you off the trial, it's not worth the effort. It is a very difficult to read book, and even my professor admited that each chapter has to be read about 4 times to actually understand that point. Why my professor still uses this book is beyond me. By the way, this book is rediculously priced.

The hero in the story is the older brother of the heroine's best friend, he's always felt an attraction to her and thinks that using a sperm bank is an awful idea. His sister suggests that he could father the heroine's baby and at first he strongly objects but than the thought begins to take hold. The hero and heroine definitely have a strong attraction and over time it grows into something more.I think that the hero was a little bit old fashioned and pig headed but with the help of his siblings sees the light and amends his ways. The heroine was easy to relate to and I could empathize with her desire to have a baby before it was too late. Altogether a good story and a strong beginning to the Whittaker siblings series."},{"Title":"Having The Tycoon's Baby (Silhouette Desire)","review":"SHE NEEDED A BABY...and a sperm bank could be Liz Donovan's last chance.

There is quite a lot of valuable information packed into the book!There are sections on Basic Grammar and Writing Elements, the Art of Writing, Personal Writing (such as in a journal), Subject Writing (such as a news story), Creative writing (such as poetry), Thinking skills, etc.One of the most helpful parts of the book is the &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; section, which is basically a grammar tour de force that explains subordinate clauses and other potentially difficult elements of English Grammar. Perhaps the most useful part of this section is the &quot;Using the Right Word&quot; section. It has commonly misused words, such as &quot;Effect&quot; and &quot;Affect.&quot; It has each word properly defined and used correctly in a sentence as an example.Finally at the end is a tables of weights and measures, a periodic table, a Morse code alphabet, a world map set, historical documents such as the Emancipation Proclamation, etc.What more can I say? I am now 22 and I rediscovered this book a week ago, and it is still just as relevant today as it was then. The book also plenty of interesting illustrations to keep any student ages 8-17 satisfied, but it also has quite a lot of clearly explained writing guidelines. It is amazing, and should improve the writing power of whoever would use it."},{"Title":"Teacher's Guide to the handbook: Write Source 2000: A Guide to Writing, Thinking, and Learning","review":"Write Source 2000 is one of the most valuable tools in my sixth grade language arts classroom.

I teach seventh grade English, history, and a variety of other subjects, and have found Write Source 2000 to be an invaluable tool. It is clear, concise, and written in an age-appropriate style; yet at the same time it is marvelously comprehensive in its content. Consider this: it covers spelling rules; punctuation; grammar, including a lucid definitions of the different tenses; it explains paragraph structure; and it contains the complete texts of the U.S. Constitution, the Gettysburg Address, Susan B. Anthony's &quot;Women's Right to Vote&quot; speech, Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; oration, and as other significant historical documents. These are but a few of its offerings. My class and I refer to Write Source 2000 at least once or twice a week, no matter what we are studying.

It deserves every one of its five stars."},{"Title":"Teacher's Guide to the handbook: Write Source 2000: A Guide to Writing, Thinking, and Learning","review":"I have taught English with Write Source 2000 in classes ranging from seventh to twelfth grade. Once students realize that this user-friendly reference can save them time and give them autonomy, they prefer it. It is easy to generate lesson plans to get students started on using the books. Introduce a topic, such as subject-verb agreement or sentence-combining, use examples from Write Source 2000, help students find evidence in their own work of the the problem, and let them see how well the book works to support editing. You don't need a classroom set. One book per three students is about right. Let them check their work in groups of three.

Not only does artist/writer Will Eisner strive to establish comics as a mainstream art, he did it over 40 years ago with this awesome collection of dailies from yesteryear. This reprints the weekly Spirit newspaper sections that originally appeared from January 5 through June 29, 1941. This period saw writer/artist Eisner's storytelling talents continue to mature as he developed new levels of sophistication, introducing new characters such as Silk Satin (with her first two appearances included in this volume) and revealing new details of Denny Colt, Commissioner Dolan and his daughter, Ellen, in stories that find the war in Europe beginning to influence the Spirit's stateside adventures. All in all this is the pinnacle of storytelling and cartooning. Nowhere else will you find such a stirring account of characters, places and events than here. This is the original pioneer of the comics industry and he did it long before anyone ever thought of trying to mainstream comics. This is not just a bunch of funny books...its a huge chunk of americana. Our history and parts that should be recounted for generations to come!"},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 2: January 5 - June 29, 1941","review":"I COLLECT WHEN I RECEIVED WITH THE NEWSPAPER.NOW I HAVE THE OPORTUNITY TO HAVE ALL WITH THIS VERY GOOD QUALITY BOOKS.I WII LIKE TO HAVE A COLLECTION WITH LADY LUCK ,WENDY LA AUDAZ,SHERLITO HOLMES."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 2: January 5 - June 29, 1941","review":"What can one say about Will Eisner and the Spirit that has not already been discussed in length since his beginnings in the 1940s?

It has MUCH more information than other books on eBay I've read and even Help on the eBay site itself--the thoroughness of this author is going to help any eBayer who buys this book. It's an eBay encyclopedia but written as concisely and readably as the manual that it is. Every section introduced me to facts and tips I didn't know, such as how to \\"shadow\\" another bidder, and where to sell consulting services online. And there are a lot of \\"Bewares\\" for both buyers and sellers that really help (for instance, what feedback percentage ratings to be wary of). This book was the closest I got to the vast mechanism that is eBay. BUY THIS BOOK!!!--you'll be glad you did!!!"},{"Title":"eBay: The Missing Manual","review":"If there was one book I would suggest to anyone venturing into the waters of eBay, it'd end up being this one... eBay: The Missing Manual by Nancy Conner. This one covers it all.Contents:Part 1 - Buying on eBay: Ready, Set, Shop!; Bidding, Paying, and Following Up; Finding - and Getting - Bargains; Power Buying StrategiesPart 2 - Selling on eBay: Sell Stuff, Make Money; Honing Your Competitive Edge; Going from Hobby to Business; Specialty Selling; Cool Tools for SellersPart 3 - Finding Other eBayers and Getting Help; Finding HelpPart 4 - Appendixes: Where to Learn More; HTML for eBayers; Other Auction Sites; IndexLike all other eBay books, this one covers how to buy and sell on eBay. The writing's good, but there'd be nothing special if it stopped there. Where this book earns its keep is when it goes into areas I haven't seen covered in any other book. I've never seen a book go into any detail on other resources to learn about eBay, such as call-in internet radio shows and newsletters. I've never seen a book cover HTML in a small number of pages in order to allow the seller to create better auction pages. There's good coverage on third-party sites that give you more information on how to best price your auctions. There's even material on how to evolve from buying and selling as a hobby to running a business based on eBay. Package all this up with clear writing and numerous screen shots, and you really *have* found the missing eBay manual.To paraphrase eBay's latest ad campaign... \\"Whatever you're looking for, you'll find *it* in eBay: The Missing Manual\\"..."},{"Title":"eBay: The Missing Manual","review":"This is an excellent walkthrough of the basic features, along with some pro tips, for both the buying and selling aspects of eBay. There is more on the selling aspects, but that's only natural since there is more to do there. The writing is good. The screen shots demonstrate the points but aren't overused. And the author genuinely seems to know what she is talking about."},{"Title":"eBay: The Missing Manual","review":"eBay doesn't come with a manual, and the online help feature that eBay provides is inadequate and hard to navigate--sometimes you can't even find your way back to a page that you know exists.Enter Nancy Conner and O'Reilly Books with the latest in the \\"Missing Manual\\" series. If you are new to eBay, or know someone who would like to get started, the decision is simple: Buy the book. For the beginning to advanced eBay user, this is a very good introductory tutorial and reference. Most advanced users will not have the depth of knowledge in all areas that is available here, so for anyone wanting to become more proficient in using eBay, this book is also highly recommended.A lay-flat binding lets the reader keep the book open on the desktop for easy reference, and the profusion of screen shots and sidebars for important points are well organized. The beginner can use this book as an introduction to eBay, and the experienced user can find useful tips and techniques that are well worth the modest price.The two major parts of the book cover the fundamental yin and yang of eBay activities: Buying and Selling. Each activity is explained from the foundation up, with the how and why of each detail and its importance to the whole clearly explained. Even if your only interest in eBay is to buy, the section on Selling will explain why sellers do certain things and what the concerns are from their side of the transaction--both important insights.Two additional smaller sections deal with discussion boards and other resources useful to eBay users both on and off the site, and an appendix containing short chapters on Where To Learn More, HTML, and Other Auction Sites.One interesting feature of this and other O'Reilly books is a code that gives the buyer access to the online edition free for 45 days. If you're going to be traveling, you can leave the book at home and download some chapters to read.Since eBay is constantly changing, it presents a moving target, so one hopes that this first effort will be kept current with future releases. If they do, some of the weaker areas can be improved, too. Information on fees is sketchy in several areas, most particularly the eBay Stores section, which needs more depth across the board. Likewise, PayPal needs more than a few pages. And although the Appendix on HTML might be useful for beginners, it should be omitted in favor of URL's to some of the excellent online tutorials, freeing up the pages for a larger index and a glossary instead. eBay is heavy with jargon, and terms like phish, NARU, and pink slap should be easy for the beginner to find."},{"Title":"eBay: The Missing Manual","review":"Best book I have read about eBay.

It has helped us enormously."},{"Title":"Hesiod,: The Homeric hymns, and Homerica, (The Loeb classical library)","review":"Like all Loeb Classics, this edition is presented with the ancient greek text on the left page, and its english translation on the right, giving students of classical greek an easy cross-reference. The translations are easy to read and not too difficult to comprehend, while still at the same time accurately rendered (unlike many Loeb translations, which are frequently too literal a translation to be readable).But what makes this book of keen interest is not the attention paid to Hesiod's Theogony and Works &amp; Days, nor the anonymous &quot;Homeric&quot; Hymns, but rather to its meticulous compedium of the lesser-known works it presents. Especially, for those works for which no complete version has survived, only fragments and occassional (later) commentaries.In this volume you discover a wonderful epic poem called The Catalogue of Women and Eoie, of which only about half survives scattered among a hundred or so fragments. You also discover The Shield of Hercules, which some attribute to Hesiod. But most fascinating of all are the fragments of the Epic Cycle, poems written as a sort of &quot;history&quot; of the Greek people, of which the two great works by Homer (The Iliad and The Odyssey) were the most well-known and the only ones to survive intact. As far as I know, this is the only volume in english which gathers all of these fragments together and attempts to sort them out in some kind of order; for those interested in the ancient epics, this alone makes the edition worth the price.This book is a sobering reminder of just how much has been lost over the centuries, of just how little actually has survived. Sadly, this is now probably the closest anyone will ever get to being able to read The Cypriad or The Melampodia again, and that's a shame."},{"Title":"Hesiod,: The Homeric hymns, and Homerica, (The Loeb classical library)","review":"Sometimes when consulting the Loeb Library for a translation of a greek text one finds a version wildly different than the original. This volume of the Loeb niether betrays the text, nor translates with arcane vocabulary (e.g. thou, thee, etc.). All in all, a very useful tool."},{"Title":"The Icon Book: Visual Symbols for Computer Systems and Documentation","review":"This book is a great reference tool for people who have to design toolbar icons. I wouldn't try to design an icon without it.One note for people who may have seen the book before - only the book is available from Amazon - not the diskette with the set of starter icons. This leaves you with pictures of the starter icons in an appendix - which you can try to duplicate by hand in your icon editor of choice. Great reference book, too bad the disk isn't included. It's almost as valuable as the book itself."},{"Title":"The Icon Book: Visual Symbols for Computer Systems and Documentation","review":"This book is laid out nicely, with exercises and thought processes on how to develop effective icons. The author includes examples of icons he has developed for applications in the past, along with his workflow. For example, one section lists the name of each icon (Edit, Delete, Add quotation) and then has sketches of 5 different ideas a piece. This book also discusses why people associate certain symbols with certain phrases, as well as outlining when to use graying, broken lines, arrows, etc. to add meaning.One shipment of this book did not include the disks, I had to call back and get the disk shipped to me seperately."},{"Title":"The Icon Book: Visual Symbols for Computer Systems and Documentation","review":"If you need to do icon design this book is a must! Horton comes from the old school where you have to show the most in only a few pixels - and there is some very smart thinking here to pick up on. This book is great if you are just starting to learn about interactive design or an old pro looking for inspiration."},{"Title":"The Icon Book: Visual Symbols for Computer Systems and Documentation","review":"This book is an comprehensive beginner&#8217;s guide of designing computer icons, and I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in designing, because the introduced strategies to create icons are so deliberate that we can use them to design other creative works like home pages.The main purpose of this book is to discuss how to design icons that are easy to recognize, understand, and remember, including the concept of icons, strategies to design them, making processes, and even a case study. So if you read thorough this book, you can get an overview of designing process of useful icons.Although this book is for icons, it provides many useful strategies in designing not only icons but also any designing works. One of the most useful strategies is to make an iconic language. This means that it is more efficient and wiser way to prepare common element parts of icons and make complicated icons by combining them, instead of making them from nothing. I think this idea is so useful for many designing works that we can apply those ideas to other works like homepages or posters besides icons.Another good point of this book is that there are many example icons. Because this is an introductory book and written for beginners of designing, every discussion is accompanied by many recommended or anti examples in order for readers to understand clearly what the author wants to say. There is also a sample icon starter set.Thus this book is a beginner guide book of creating computer icons and discusses many so useful and fundamental ways of designing them that you can create other decent designing works by applying them. That is why I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Icon Book: Visual Symbols for Computer Systems and Documentation","review":"I haven't got the book, but just the diskette, which really disappointed me as these \\"starter icons\\" are absolutely basic and often ugly.I found it useless for anyone who already works with icons, Wingdrings are better."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"First, this book \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is NOT the same as Tannen's later \\"You Just Don't Understand.\\" The latter is about male/female communications. THIS BOOK is about interpersonal linguistic styles.I found this one a revelation -- little differences in loudness, pause length in conversation, the meaning of \\"polite apology\\" -- make all the difference in understanding people from different cultures, or even from different families in your own culture.This book helped me at work, in travel and at home, and I can't recommend it highly enough.For some reason the two titles are hard to distinguish -- quite a few reviewers seem to be referring to the later book. Again, \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is NOT primarily about male/female communication."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"If you were to tell me a tiny yellowed 20-year-old plus paperback that looks like it came from a B-rated garage sale would impact me in a hugely profound way, I would have laughed and not believed it at all. Then I might have humored you and bought it for a nickel and thrown it away when I got home.Well I sure learned the lesson of the ages: Never judge a book by its cover!Deborah Tannen presents an incredible and insightful objective analysis of the subtle nuances of \\"linguistics\\". Linguistics is the \\"firewood\\" of speech communication. I never, ever, realized the peculiar mechanics behind a \\"normal\\" conversation, much less a conversation that deteriorates into a major misunderstanding or conflict. This book stands at the gateway as an incredibly informative toolkit that can be used to positively revolutionize communicating within any type of personal relationship.The very instant I began understanding differences in communication styles and other mechanical aspects of communication, I was able to reclaim ground lost to arguments, mistrust, fear, and anger. This book gave me a full toolbox to not only repair broken communication, but to also adapt my conversation style to effectively speak and listen in situations and with people I never thought I could be possible. I don't have to change the world to get them to understand me, I learn how to change me and the way I present myself to the world. And miraculously, the world understands.Just as an example, imagine that you and your spouse have been at odds about something very important to you. Instead of insisting that there's something wrong with her or him, and struggling to make the point over and over so they understand, you were able to reach into a toolbox and pull out a wrench, make a few adjustments, then suddenly it's like talking to a different person. That's how profound conversational style can effect another person. Here's the irony: if you think the loose screws were in your spouse's head, better think again. You use these wrenches on your own loose screws.I approached a conversational topic with a loved one that had been like dropping a lit match into a box of roman candles. Before I started this next conversation, I picked up a handy tool from Tanner's kit. An opportunity presented itself rather suddenly, and I \\"framed\\" my idea with three simple words \\"I'm being direct\\". The worried expression literally fell from her face, she looked me dead in the eyes and said with a smile \\"OK.\\" I paused and thought to myself \\"what just happened?\\" I had her undivided attention AND a SMILE. How hard can it be to talk about anything with a loved one who's smiling at you and giving you her undivided attention?She listened attentively with her eyes square looking into mine, and I did just as I said. I was unquestionably direct. Not only did I get her approval, she became enthusiastic and eager to join me with this endeavor. My head was spinning. \\"Wait? Did I just hear you right?\\" was my first thought, but before I could say anything else, she had my hand and was pulling me out of my chair to start moving with my idea.This book is amazing. Not only has it drastically improved my communication ability, it's also enhanced my observations and \\"feelings\\" about the state of mind of the person I choose to talk with. It allows me to make small adjustments to keep communication forthright and on target.If you've ever spoken the title of this book in exasperation, you need to read it!"},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"That's Not What I Meant! Is a must read for anyone, whether you are gregarious and get along with everyone or if you are constantly at the center of disagreements.This isn't a how to book to solve all your conversational woes. Honestly, I would never expect something so simple as a step-by-step guide for something as complex as conversation. Considering that, Deborah Tannen does an excellent job of showing just how complex a simple conversation can be and how things can go wrong despite everyone's best intentions.This is the only one of Deborah Tannen's books that I have read. And it is the perfect mix of all relevant conversations that most people encounter in their lives. From talking with teenagers to business conversations to gripes from long-time spouses.The result of reading this book has especially helped me feel more comfortable about my conversation skills. Before I read this book, I thought I was the only one that was no good at getting my intentions across clearly, but now that I have learned that confusion is inevitable I finally believe everyone that has said that I'm actually pretty normal and surprisingly flexible in my style (most likely because I was so hard on myself before). It also gave me some ideas on how to better get along with some of the people that I previously thought were too pushy or quiet etc.I just finished this book for the first time(I'm planning on reading it again) and I am still absorbing much of the content. But I already feel as if I have gained a new understanding of the past misconceptions-turned-verbal-fights that I have had with friends and family. I'm planning on giving it to my parent's to read (their conversational styles are very different and they get into a lot of needless bickering matches because of it).I think this book is a great step into metacognition (thinking about thinking) and becoming more introspective (Looking inside yourself) for the purpose of being conscious of things that are subconscious and that you take for granted."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"This is a great book if you and your spouse are fighting over very minor things. Or if people take you the 'wrong way' when you say something."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Deborah Tannen's That's Not What I Meant: How Conversational Style Makes or Breaks Relationships (NY: Ballantine Books, c. 1986) addresses the totality of personal relationships; she suggests that all communication, to a degree, is cross-cultural. Thus the study of language--linguistics--may help us form and preserve more healthy relationships.Too often we assume that if we try to speak honestly and share our feelings, communication takes place. Unfortunately, we can be mutually unintelligible in our honesty! \\"The belief that sitting down and talking will ensure mutual understanding and solve problems is based on the assumption that we can say what we mean, and that what we say will be understood as we mean it. This is unlikely to happen if conversational styles differ\\" (p. 116).Unless we learn how to speak and listen accurately, we may never understand what others are actually saying. There's a difference, for example, between transmitting information and establishing an atmosphere of politeness, both of which may be accomplished through conversation.For the real \\"meaning\\" within a conversation resides in its \\"metamessage\\" rather than its apparent details. So we enshroud our words with signals, linguistic devices which serve as defense mechanisms as well as facilitate the frequently indirect messages we want heard. The tone of voice, the length of pauses, facial expressions, the use of questions, \\"ritual complaining,\\" jokes, teasing, all add texture to the metamessages of the most ordinary of conversations.Some of the most important metamessages which frame conversations deal with \\"power and solidarity.\\" Titles we use--Doctor, Professor--carry their own message. Whether or not we address a person by his first or last name sets parameters to what's sayable in a conversation. To try to establish solidarity, through the use of first names, where the relationships are clearly power-based, undercuts the legitimacy of the relationships.Thus, \\"Trying to be 'just folks' when you're not can seem hypocritical and provoke resentment when authority rears its head--for example, when a doctor insists that a patient or nurse follow his instructions about medical procedures.

This book opens up a world to understand all the problems in communication. It's very insightful."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Tannen addressed problems in interpersonal communication, which is caused by metamessages, cultural difference, disparate conversational styles and choices, and misunderstood intentions (especially between men and women). With no doubt this is quality and eye-opening information to know and to keep in mind. Yet Tannen's account also provokes widespread fear that people will no longer communicate with one another at the risk of hurting or misunderstanding others.I believe that we should all keep in mind cultural, gender, and ever age differences in using metamessages and communicating through body languages and facial expressions. People might choose to speak indrectly to avoid confrontation or be polite. Yet I don't agree with the fact that &quot;the more contact people have with each other, the more opportunities both have to do things in their own way and be misunderstood.&quot; In a way, Tannen is giving people (especially couples with problematic marriages), an excuse not to talk things out and express what's in mind and on their hearts.Conversations, if abiding all the rules and guidelines according to Tannen, will become manipulative. Everything becomes taboo in the household and people will only feel more isolated. People misunderstand others (in many occasions), because of unspoken bitterness, frustration, and shameful thoughts that don't want to be confronted. They let out frustrated emotions and blow out no small thing like &quot;Where do you want to go dinner?&quot; or some silly little argument that later on becomes fights. People will NOT be able to speak from the heart until they make a decision to be vulnerable and open. Think about why people feel frustrated - because they cannot be completely open about their lives. They are afraid to be confronted, challenged, and even asked how they are doing.Misunderstanding might play a little part, but you cannot solve relationship problem solely by casting the misunderstanding. Deal with deceit and fear in heart."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples. Dr. Tannen doesn't seem to give much if any of her own realizations, instead she consistantly refers to other experts. I constantly felt as though I was reading a report written for a social psychology class."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Tannen believes that men comunicate only in a report fassion. 'Only the facts, mame.' Women normally converse in a raport fassion, talking to build relationships. Tannen (a woman) doesn't understand that men build raport by talking the facts.

It is worth the work and time to admit this and ask for clarification.&quot;"},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Dr. Deborah Tannen's book, &quot;That's Not What I Meant,&quot; is another execise in her customized brand of Feminism: highly gullibe, overly-simplistic,and ultimately unconvincing. Even her book title's are segways to her despondent and indifferent ideals of how men and women really speak.Dr. Tannen, a Georgetown University professor, has written yet another over-hyped social commentator book attempting to make sense of linguistics between men and women. Her tired attempts to provoke men into speaking like women. Continously, she propells the notion that men are liguistically-challenged because they don't follow her prescribed patterns of femme-speak.Ultimately, the book bottoms-out by the second chapter. everything else seems a sad reguritation of her previous books. If anything readers have learned about Deborah Tannen is her benign feminism and inability to understand men.Dr. Tannen should resort to her given occupation rather than marketing herself as an author. Given her title of Doctor, she is already spreading herself way too thin."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Too often today vested interests present inane theses encouraging support of the subjects that provide their sustenance. The thesis of this book, that individuals should take advantage of metamessage concepts, results in deception. That there is an effect created by tone of voice, language style, speed of speech, etc. etc. cannot be denied. Those interested in communication, however, attempt to eliminate these effects, not take advantage of them. Tannen's information might be put to use to eliminate the dissimulation commonly encountered today, but the more obvious use is to encourage non-verbal misdirection. The most obvious example is our president. I have never seen such sincerity supporting a provable lie. Would that this area of expertise sink without a trace."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"More than one newlywed couple I've talked to describes the first year as a difficult and challenging time, and the insights that this book gives can make the difference between being able to work through the issues and just running in place.I read this book just after our honeymoon, and it was a revelation. Although both my wife and I had a wonderful relationship before we got married, we found ourselves having problems that neither of us understood after we wed. As I read this book I quickly saw that there were issues discussed that paralleled what we were going through. I loaned it to my wife, and now three years later we make it a point to add a copy to any wedding gift we give.Once you read this book, you may see the communication in your own relationships with a clearer eye. Of course, that assumes that you actually understand the text, instead of (as two reviewers here do) simply skim it for evidence of some preconceived political agenda. People who see Feminist conspiracies around every corner will completely miss the point of this book, which is too bad. I suspect such folks don't have much luck understanding the women in their lives either.A good example of the misreading that the Feminist-hunter did is in the claim that &quot;she propells the notion that men are liguistically-challenged because they don't follow her prescribed patterns of femme-speak.&quot; Yet the whole point of Dr. Tannen's book is this: While indirect communication (more common among women) is as valid as more direct styles (more common among men), it is the way someone who speaks in one style perceives the messages from a person who uses another that causes problems. What really made the book enlightening to me was the exploration of how context and meta-messages change that cross-style dynamic, and it helped me understand how my words could be misunderstood, how I might be misunderstanding the words of others, and why the exact same actions after the wedding could have totally different results than they did a week earlier.My only negative comment about the book is that Dr. Tannen not only doesn't give any advice on bridging the gaps in style, she even states at one point that such efforts are futile. People who use an indirect style, for example, will be offended by a direct discussion of communication styles, because they'll try to figure out &quot;what you're REALLY trying to say&quot;. In fact, once both my wife and I had read and discussed the book, we learned to clear up (if not always prevent) this kind of problem, and it made a huge difference in our marriage. A little less pessimism and a bit more guidance would have made the book even better."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"This book does indeed have a narrow focus, but the subject of that focus--interpersonal communication--has far reaching implications in any type of human relationship. As was correctly stated by a previous reviewer, relationships often suffer from a variety of different problems, ranging from differences in personal habits, to differences in values, to differences in religious views, but that is more or less a given in any relationship, especially one in which people share a domicile. However, it is how those relationship partners choose to &quot;deal&quot; with their inevitable differences &quot;communicatively&quot; that will determine the ultimate success or failure of their relationship. Do they choose to disagree or argue endlessly? Do they insult each other, or call each other names? Do they try to talk over each other,or become violent? Or do they approach each other in cooperative manner, open to each other's different ideas and viewpoints, with a willingness to learn from each other?What Tannen does in this book is show how some of the common communication differences between men and women in relationships have their basis in fundamental differences in the way men and women perceive each other, and relationships in general. And furthermore, that these fundamental differences, often hidden below the surface, can have profound, and often negative, effects on all kinds of relationships throughout a person's life, unless they are brought into the light of day. In effect, what Tannen is trying to do is to get people to be more aware of how they &quot;habitually&quot; communicate, the possible reasons why they communicate in those ways, and how the things they say and do may affect others. In effect, her goal is to empower people to begin--perhaps for the first time in their lives--to really &quot;choose&quot; how they communicate in relationships--rather than being a slave to destructive habits relied on since childhood. I strongly recommend this book for both men and women in ongoing close relationships. Once you have read it, you will never see communication in your relationships in quite the same way."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"This is my favorite of Tannen's books. It makes some simple but important points about why people have trouble communicating. They talk differently.My favorite comment was about people having different tolerances for pauses after the other person stops talking. For some people it is 10 seconds. For others it was nano-seconds. I wanted to encourage a quiet friend to talk. I found that by counting silently to ten after I finished talking before starting again, made him realize there was a gap to be filled there. An easy trick but I learned a lot from him and Tannen.This is the book to give to friends and relatives, rather than her others that beat the differences between men and women into the ground. Simple but with a sweet and useful message."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Deborah Tannen sure takes care of emphasizing her Ph.D degree in linguistics on the cover of every book she writes. And she has every reason to do that, since \\"That's Not What I Meant\\" is a book very influential and full of revelations about... talking.Through many (very many) examples of everyday talk, Tannen... oops, sorry, Dr. Tannen ;-) explains how something very small we said can turn a whole conversation upside down, bringing the opposite result of what we expected. Be it between friends, lovers, or even diplomatic ambassadors, she shows how the way we talk - anything from the tone we say a word to a single finger's gesture - can change completely the meaning of our talk, and gives advice and suggestions on how to talk better and have more successful communication with everyone around us.What I didn't particularly like about this book, is that Tannen is providing far more extensive examples of talk than she is providing explanations and solutions. She does explain things, and at the end, I did understand a lot of things I never really noticed about talking, but I certainly became a bit overwhelmed by the vast number of examples, and many times I couldn't focus on the main point.However, this still is a pleasant book, that is easily and casually read at any time of the day. Given its low price and the practicality of its conclusions, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"This book addresses a problem that is common in troubled relationships and offers some very good advice on how to deal with it. The only drawback that I really see is that the book addresses only that one problem in relative isolation, and troubled relationships often suffer from other problems as well. But, so long as you keep its somewhat narrow focus in perspective, and don't fall into the easy trap of believing that solving this one problem will make everything all right, it is a marvelous tool for improving communications in relationships."},{"Title":"That's Not What I Meant","review":"Deborah Tannen comes from the point of view of a linguist which is not common in psychology-oriented \\"self-help\\" books. I like her analytical yet practical style. Knowing the conversational style of different cultures as well as genders can't help but improve one's communication.

Live life to the fullest!"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Based on the cover illustration and the subtitle, you'd think that The Naked Ape is another book about human evolution. This is far from the truth. The Naked Ape is about man's current condition. It views people as just another animal.Desmond Morris is trying to strip us of our superiority complex. His first tactic is to give us a new name: Naked Apes.In a book that lacks loads of hard facts, it's easy to stray off and stretch the little data available. For example, Morris says that humans will inevitably be surpassed by another species. But he also gives evidence that goes against that. He claims that humans kill anything that competes with them. Morris stretches data very far when he talks about how the neighborhoods where houses are the same, are inhuman. He says that because we are territorial animals, we need to feel our territory is unique. He says that this leads to people in these neighborhoods doing things liking adding a room or planting a colorful flower in their front yard, to make up for the lack of uniqueness. The only thing is that if you ask someone who is adding a room to their house, they're going to say it's because they need space. We may be territorial but turning that into why we add things to our houses is quite a stretch.To be fair, most of Morris's arguments are legitimate. In the first chapter when he talks about human origin, the theorems presented are legitimate. This is due to the fact that none of the theorems presents are Morris's. He is just reprinting other people's theories. (And crediting them) The theorem about aquatic apes makes a lot of sense.This book is humbling. People seem to feel superior to everything, but Morris shows that humans answer to the basic laws of animal behavior. Even though city life is against our nature, we find a way to make it human. Being around hundreds of thousands of people is unusual, we still manage to talk to and be around the same twenty people.I feel people should read this book because it shows not just how we're similar to chimps and gorillas, but each other. Though we may make different decisions, deep down we're genetically all the same."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I really enjoyed this book when it first came out but now, of course, I'm older and have a larger point of reference. I still find it well written and entertaining but it all means something different to me now. For one thing, I find it peculiar that there is a lack of information on what a father does or doesn't contribute toward the outcome of an offspring. It appears this author believes that how a child will turn out is entirely dependent on the mother. If she does something too little, or does the same thing too much, she will irretrievably warp her poor child, and do it all by herself. I wonder if I actually believed that back then? Probably. But now, and several adult children later, I don't.This author apparently believes there isn't a single human (or animal) behavior that can't be explained in some logical way. All you have to do is look for the potential meaning in every benign activity (or lack of activity) and then you will recognize what it really means. In the end I was reminded of the Freudian quote - &#34;sometimes a cigar is just a cigar&#34;."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book is dated now but it was controversial when it was first published. Forty four years is a long time. There are better explanations and better theories today. But are they?Humans do some strange things do they not? Maybe there's a good reason for most of behaviour.Thousands of years, billions of humans. How much is instinct? How much learned? How much is plain old biology?Read Isaac Bashevis Singer for more on peculiar behaviour.Ten stars. Another brain scratcher..."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Very interesting book that I think everyone should have a read of. Our behaviours and physiological characteristics are looked at from a zoological perspective, we're analysed in much the same way as other species are.There are lots of eye opening sections, things to make you go \\"Wow, that makes a lot of sense\\". Unfortunately there is no direct proof attached to any of the claims (although I'm sure it is based off scientific research). It would just be nice to know these scientific facts as well although I guess that wouldn't make for such a free-flowing book.Some ideas, particularly those based on sex and sexuality are noticably out-dated, but that is to be expected I guess.The book has opened up another avenue for me - information on the \\"aquatic ape\\", I'm not sure I believe this theory but it definitely makes for interesting reading, I'm about to begin reading a book solely on this subject.Overall, definitely worth a read, very interesting, thought provoking and actually a bit humbling - trying to get us to realise that we're just like the other species we're related too at our core."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I think this book is well worth reading, because it provides many insights into why we behave the way we do. I recommend the book despite the following flaws:-sloppily written and organized-some things are likely incorrect-dated, and it shows-the author doesn't make it clear enough his theories aren't facts-bizarre ending"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"A stirring look at the primal factors driving man in the art of Love, the doldrums of Work and the visceral depths of War and chronicling our relative similarity to our closest cousins, the primates, Desmond Morris adds soil and soul to the grassroots movement sparked in the Sixties counterculture to reconnect with some bygone artifact of Man's blind past. There can be no doubt that the embattled Sixties and the embittered youthful revolts influenced Morris to direct his scientific acumen at the internal drive of Man.Overall, this is a good start for those questioning just how biological many of Man's drives are."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris, currently seventy-six, has accomplished many things throughout his life, but The Naked Ape has to be one of his best works. In The Naked Ape, Desmond Morris takes a look at Homo sapiens thru a zoologists view. He talks about how we started, what lead us to be the way we are, our tendencies, and how things really haven't changed that much. This book was very interesting for me, and gives us a different view on our fellow man.Though the book is filled with facts, it feels as if Morris is having a conversation with you. The book is quite easy to understand and does not drag on and on. Though he does refer to us as animals, he also describes us as marvelous.I truly enjoyed how this book changes its view on humans to the third person. It is like standing in front of a mirror and not looking at yourself they way you normally do, but as is another stood before you.There are eight sections in the book: Origins, Sex, Rearing, Exploration, Fighting, Feeding, Comfort, and Animals. I could not help but notice that Sex was the longest section; that is saying something about our peoples.In the first section, Morris talks about how we became bipedal, lost our fur, and are so social. When he talked of how we went thru a shift from being traveling primates to bipedal carnivores, I felt somewhat empowered. There where also a few explanations to how we lost our fur, including a parasite problem, overheating, and first going thru an aquatic stage before going bipedal. I found the aquatic theory to be quite convincing.The rest of the book following the first section discusses our tendencies. It is hard to notice that things we do everyday, from smiling to how we eat. How most mothers hold child with the child's head to the left of their chest. How we move in a heart beat motion when anxious, or the source of our aggression. Morris points out some of the reasons we do the things we do, and why it is part of our being. I also thought that how humans can be curious at older ages while most animals simply live with what they know after reaching adult hood. It amazes me how so much of what the book says is true.This book also shows how humans are very animal like. The male is looked at as the one to provide and control, and how woman is to be caring and motherly. It goes deeper than that; take a moment and notice the things you do and what others are doing and compare it to pre-historic man and nature today.The Naked Ape, simply put, is an amazing book. I will not soon forget what I have learned from this book and the ideas it presents. This book's interesting perspective will also give us something to think about."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Dr. Morris does a great job describing humans as we are. He clearly set aside all of our egocentric perspective and our &quot;special&quot; place in &quot;creation&quot;. He undoubtly explains we are just another ape, a singular one , but finally apes. I really like his writing style, he is very clear in everything he explains and has lots of scientific evidence to support his ideas and perspective. This is a book I highly recommend to anyone interested in humans as the animals we are, just to know the zoologist perspective. A last warning must be made, this is not a recent book, it is a classic one (at least I consider it a classic) so if anyone is really interested in this subject a good advice is to try reading recent books to be updated."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I found the book fascinating because it forces you to look at human beings for what they really are.

This book belongs in every library of the Homo Sapien kingdom....."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"If you missed it the first time: I beg all of you to question 'Naked Ape' inside and out. Specifically you who assumed right off the bat that his theory of the evolution of female topography makes sense. Morris hardly bothers to look at human evolution without slanting it toward the preferences of modern culture. As one example: he immediately assumes since that because men of 20nth century western society prefer curvaceous women, men of all societies share in their preference. NOT the case! Not only do women in isolated hunter-gatherer societies not emulate the aesthetic standards of modern western males, but the men of those primitive societies don't even care for hemisperical breasts or curvy figures. Secondly Morris obviously loves his vision of man as the hunter and stops at nothing to revolve all of anthropology around it. What that leaves us with is a whole lotta speculation stemming from a LARGELY unproven theory of human evolution as I must remind anybody before they pick this book up.It seems Morris doesn't question the Savannah Theory as much as he should. He outlines the social structure of baboons and compares it to that of humans. Doesn't he find it odd that he makes human hierarchies sound more similar to baboons than that of our closer chimpanzee kin? He explains that as both baboons and humans moved out onto savannah territory, they restructured society in such a way to keep it glued together out in the perilous open. Doesn't he find it odd that other species who evolve in savannah land don't follow these same trends.Thirdly, according to 'Naked Ape' men evolved to hunt, women evolved because men hunted. (But women never seemed to influence the evolution of men) He describes woman's evolutionary role as something of a pampered cavebunny who survived only by pleasing men sexually. The carefully veiled sexism doesn't bother me nearly as much as how far-fetched some of these ideas were. I hope anybody who has read this book or will read this book will keep in mind that some of this material can be outdated and one-sided."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I bought this book cheap second hand, and I'm surprised what a good purchase it was. This book is a basic beginners sort of guide into the world of anthropology/zoology but it is tailored to the average reader, and contains lots of interesting facts you may not already know about the animal kingdom, especially about the monkeys and apes. This book is bent towards the Darwinist theory of evolution, probably one of the most popular &quot;scientific&quot; theories people are taught today. Yet all this is still not much more than speculation, for there isn't ample concrete evidence to prove that this theory is true. Still, the question is : what if it is true? And if it is, then all these incredible things said in the book (I was very amused when reading the chapter about how and why human beings have nipples, lips, etc.) could be true! As I said - almost unbelievable, funny at times, and so fascinating! The book isn't overly lengthy at all, so its pretty short and sweet, but most of the general public will definitely learn at least one or two things after reading it."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I read this when it came out, I was 10 years-old.

He claims this is evidence of the mothering instinct. So, I took a doll to school and experimented on my friends. I experimented on about 35 kids, boys and girls. I found that Morris was wrong. Little girls did not differ from boys as to the way they first held the doll.So, if you read this book, watch out.

Set aside the serious philosophical and epistemological problems encountered when one presupposes to be only an \\"animal\\" and then proceeds to provide an objective analysis of said \\"animal,\\" the book is grossly outdated and with the advantage of hind-sight, wholly simplistic.Philosophically, the book suffers from assuming the correctness of its conclusion as its major premise -- it begs the question. If you're looking to find reinforcement for your already held belief, this book may make you feel snug and self-justified. That is the extent of its utility.In the words of renowned paleoanthropologist Joseph Weiner: \\"It is quite obvious that modern man could not have arisen from any ape, let alone monkey, at all similar to those of today...it is ridiculous to describe man as a 'naked' or any other kind of ape.\\" (Joseph S. Weiner, *The Natural History of Man*. New York: Universe Books), p. 33."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris explains what we have been taught to deny ourselves for centuries, that we are merely homo sapien sapiens. He does not deny that we have evolved beyond all our counterparts here on the earth; however he does reinforce that we are now more than products of the earth. We have become products not only of our biology, but also of our growing self awareness. I tend to think that Morris is stating that we are cognitively denying our roots simply because we cannot succumb to them. Our own arrogance is separating us from that which we are, leading to our betrayal of our humanness. Desmond Morris seems to understand that we must know where we are coming from in order to understand where we are going. Without this understanding we may be headed for eventual disaster."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"There are certain people who just get an enormous kick out of telling the truth; especially when it involves disclosing something that other people don't particularly wish to hear. Desmond Morris fits into this category. The idea that we are just a few, tiny DNA notches above our ape cousins, can't be particularly welcome to most people, especially to the \\"Brain Luddites\\" of religious fundamentalism, but nevertheless it is the truth, and, in this book, Morris seems to take great pleasure in letting us know this.He writes in a clear, lucid style that avoids unnecessary jargon and gives the attentive reader plenty of time to keep up with the flow of his ideas. One way he does this is to organize the book into 'organic' chapters, focusing on different aspects of human behavior, such as \\"Sex\\", \\"Fighting\\", \\"Feeding\\", etc. Another way is to constantly compare specific human behavior with that of other animals.Of course some questions remain about the exact evolution of our species, our degree of adaptability, and the complex way our primitive natures tug against our modern conditioning, but so much is revealed or clarified by this book that you won't have time to notice any omissions. Along with Fraser's Golden Bough this is one of the key texts on which to base a clear understanding of human nature and society."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This is a great book that should be read. Morris is a very intelligent guy, and a very good writer, and you'll be able to polish this book off with no trouble.One caveat is that the book is over forty-one years old, and so some of the conclusions/assertions/asseverations may be obsolete (and many more \\"politically incorrect\\")...but most, I'd imagine, still hold true. Evolution tends to take a while...one need look no further than the nearest mirror. Morris makes some dated predictions, and overreaches on a few, but nothing on a Paul Ehrlich-level of hyperbolic nonsense.Many clever insights are provided throughout the book, shining an etiological bulb on numerous aspects of naked ape culture and behavior. Morris's articulated reasoning for the invention and continuation of religion in an allegedly rationalistic age was novel to me (though intuitively obvious--after the fact!), and his explication of how some traits have developed out of conjunction with our evolutionary time-frame (while anachronistic others remain sticky long after they've ceased being useful) is truly food for thought.I recommend The Naked Ape highly, with the proviso, alluded to earlier, that certain folks holding certain orthodoxies probably won't find their cherished faiths reinforced, and thus will react with hostility."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"In this book, Desmond Morris gives a very unique view at our species. He examines the biology and behavior of humans in much the same way an entomologist might study a newly discovered insect or an ornitholigist might describe a previously unknown bird. He takes a step back from his own anthropocentric bias and attempts to explain humans in terms of evolutionary biology. When confronted with evolutionary explanations to issues generally taken for granted, one may find oneself questioning the answers given by such accepted institutions as psychology and religion. This may be why The Naked Ape has remained so thought provoking and controversial so many years after its original publication"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris is one of my scientific heroes and I have a huge brain crush on him. I think he's brilliant, a master of his field. My background is in wildlife biology and I've long been fascinated with human behavior from a more detached perspective than psychology or sociology. He was the first person I encountered that had the same fascination with humans from a zoological perspective. Anyone who feels superior to animals or chooses to deny the fact that we are animals should be made to read this book.My only quibble with the book is that it is somewhat dated, though truly it doesn't much affect most of the information given. However, his view of homosexuality is obviously a product of the times (1960's) and was the only point in the entire book with which I did not agree. There have been a wealth of studies into the phenomenon of homosexuality throughout the animal kingdom since this book was published, so I personally would love to see a more modern revision with information gleaned since the 60's.Other than that, this book was extremely fascinating and informative. I can't begin to cover all of the information, but if you think you might be interested, definitely get this book! Desmond Morris' works in general are very interesting, accessible to non-scientists, easy to read, and quite full of information."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book is great to read. Whether you believe what's been written or not, not-so-religious people can't deny evolution. It's as simple as 1+1=2 and that's how this book has been written.You believe what I just said? Grab a copy of the book now!Don't believe me? Good, as I don't buy into everything that has been said as well. But I do think it's important that the more views you have, the better your fundamentent for judgement is. This book certainly has some very strong points and may sound familiar to you.So, just with psychology and Dr. Phil, don't believe everything that's being said, but make up your own mind. Maybe this book will be 'a changing day in your life...'."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"The concept of looking at ourselves as an animal in the zoo is a fascinating one. While Desmond Morris takes a look at humans through a zoologist's goggles, coming to terms with this idea is half the fun while reading this book. The title and introduction of the book help create the detachment so the reader can play along. This 1960's classic reads more like a commentary of an intellectual with a fertile mind than the thesis of a scientist who has dedicated his life to studying the human species. Read it with that expectation and you will not go dissatisfied. However, if you are expecting anotherThe Origin of Speciesby Charles Darwin, The Naked Ape will not cut it.The book characterizes the naked ape's tedency to procreate, raise children, explore, fight, feed, live and communicate in evolutionary terms. My favorite part is where the act of sexual intercourse is put under the microscope and studied from a zoological perspective. It is like taking notes while watching a porn movie.As with any stimulating commentary, it has opinions that may force your mind to demand substantiation. For example, throughout the book Morris' is morbidly fixated upon the problem of population explosion and that it would become the single-most important cause of destruction of our species as well as the planet. It plays such an important role in his mind, that his last words in the book are a warning sign against this phenomenon. His fear and his suggested solutions are radical. In general, he calls for sophistication of \\"birth control\\" at least to the same extent as \\"death control\\".At the time of writing the book, the population was 3 billion growing at the rate of 150,000 per day (1.82%). If this growth continues, which Morris resigns is \\"highly unlikely\\", the book projects 400 billion naked apes in 260 years. Let's review this projection at the time of reviewing this book 40 years later. We are 6.6 billion growing at the rate of 211,000 per day (1.17%). At this rate, in another 220 years, we would be 80 billion which too, may I add, is \\"highly unlikely\\" and highly undesirable.A commentary of evoluational proportions spans millions of years, and the selection of information to be presented is a task of astronomical proportions. Being mindful of the complexity of this problem, Desmond Morris seems to have done a fine job of selection and generally speaking, the theories are very agreeable. This is certainly one for the shelves."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Rather than denigrate religion, it helps to define mankind's potential given his human condition, and should be mandatory in high school and college classrooms to form the basis for the human condition in his collective world.Profound as the title might seem, the philosophy is sound in that once all structures are removed from earth, what is left is essentially man, woman, and child to construct the best possible world for survival - what could be simpler to understand the nature of society that is as surely rooted in biology, as in philosophy and organization? Without a basic understanding of biology, human society cannot survive or make progress.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"There isn't much more to say other than this is an amazing book, but I'll try. It includes comparisons of human and non-human animals in the realms of sex, child-rearing, fighting, hunting, and day-to-day living. Not one of the 250 or so pages was uninteresting. It's a very quick read and you'll find yourself reading it again and again. This book is a must for any biology major or anyone interesting in learning about our origins. I would definitely suggest checking it out."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris has created an extremely provocative and challenging book that forces one to question \\"humanity's\\" everyday and all-time reactions and motivations. It challenges one to analyse and understand whether we are as intelligent as we think. This book is as valid today as it was when it was written 40 years ago. Our arrogance in seeing ourselves as being intelligent beings is exposed or at least called into question. The Naked Ape, used well, forces one to continually re-assess and measure society's and one's own behaviour."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I don't know if our imagination is a curse, or a gift, but I believe in many ways it clouds our vision, clouds us from the truth, and clouds us from reality. Desmond Morris brings us back to basics. He puts us at square one, and goes step by step through a journey explaining who we are, what we are, and how we got here. He lays down several theories, some plausible, some undeniable. The religious folk will not like what Desmond Morris has to say, and rightly so. He comes from a scientific standpoint, not the hopes and dreams that religious extremists have come to believe as &quot;the truth&quot;. Clear your misconceptions about who you are, and what you are. You're a naked ape."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I read this book over 30 years ago and it remains one of the most impressive works I've ever read. It was actually I book I got from the book club because I forgot to tell them not to send it to me. I thought that I might as well read it and I was thoroughly astounded by what it had to say. The author, Desmond Morris, takes a look at man as a part of the animal kingdom and gives us a portrait of a species only slightly above other genuses and species. His examples and explanations are thoroughly compelling and one comes away presuaded. The question is; persuaded of what?

Very thought prokoving and interesting. A must read."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book sure provides the reader with an appealing, refreshingly bright view of the human species, without fear to face man as an intelligent animal, yet still an animal. It is utmost logical, everything stems from always astute arguments or analogies which make the exposition a charming and clever view of humankind's evolution, but this is also and partly for this reason the perfect illustration of the non-scientific, somewhat dangerous book, especially for those readers who wouldn't appreciate the difference between acknowledged facts reported in the book and speculations asserted by the author.Ascertained facts are narrated in a most fascinating and enthralling speech. For instance, the physical and emotional changes accompanying the act of making love or getting ready for fight are terrific descriptions. Most insights, with more or less experimental evidence to support them, are amazing and will really make you love the book, for their convincing and sounding universal explanations of fundamentals wonders. One will find for instance possible reasons for why our females have orgasms--something quite unique to our species--why do we need love, what are the motivations for jealousy, friendship, courtship, mating in humankind, etc. But too often does Morris attempt to conceal his scientifically-free allegations along with accepted ones. Then come the clearly out-of-topic extrapolations, like how human beings will have to evolve in order to avoid war extermination (said to be more than liable). His description of him faking a dominated ape to avoid paying a speed-excess fine gives the book a taste of tricks cookbook to fool others, when we like to see it as a popularization essay of ethnology with extras.Thus, no question whether you should read or not this book, read it! But please be sure not to fall in the trap of blindly eating all is said, because that seems to explain (at most, that could perfectly explain, but that isn't the way science goes). Morris did such a good job of mixing science and speculation that non-specialists, me first, won't make the difference easily. Most important is to enjoy the book, and avoid fanatic response afterthat (doing the ape as Morris to take advantage upon other people seeming the more likely stupid reaction).

Otherwise, don't waste your time. Evolutionary science has advanced dramatically in the last 50 years and has discredited many of the views presented in The Naked Ape. Several are even laughable, such as the explanation of homosexuality in the chapter on sex.Further, while promoted as a zoological study, the presentation is psychological, focusing on behavioral issues and their explanations rather than biological evolution. It is filled with the \\"he-man hunter\\" psychobabel that was preached in 1960's university Psych courses.Simply, this book was a waste of my time and money. The reviews that stated the book was dated, but still relevant, were sadly mistaken."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Morris is an entertaining and engaging writer, and most things he writes about are plausible at first glance. However, when you really start to analyze it, he's really just another humanochauvinist working from the assumption that the human form is the pinnacle of perfection and that it represents some sort of &quot;advancement&quot; over the &quot;lower&quot; species.In fact, the human body is a real mess from a bioengineering point of view. The idea that bipedalism is somehow &quot;superior&quot; to other modes of locomotion just doesn't stand up, if you'll excuse the pun. It has caused us as a species untold health problems. Hypertension, headaches, bad backs, bad knees, indigestion, hemhorroids, the list of ailments attributable to our frankly bizarre posture goes on and on. The idea that an essentially quadripedal animal would one day just decide to get up and walk because someday he might want to use tools is just too pat for my taste. Evolution has no crystal ball. Lest you think I'm just hand-waving here, the savannah hypothesis Morris bases most of his assumptions upon has been largely demolished as of late in the face of new fossil and genetic findings. The foundation is rapidly washing out from under his argument.Enjoy the writing but take its conclusions with a grain of salt. Read Elaine Morgan's work for a theory which I think holds water.

You feel like this is an exclusive club you belong to, which of course the human race is."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"The Naked Ape was certainly an important book for its time, as it helped people think about themselves and their fellow humans in a different light. However, reading the book about 45 years after it was first published, its age begins to show, with some old-fashioned chauvinist ideas creeping in, an incredibly biased point of view towards the European/American model of society as the only one that matters; and a surprising amount of false and outdated psychological ideas ascribed to people (surprising given that the premise of the book is that we are far closer to our animal nature than we care to admit).I would still recommend reading The Naked Ape just because it is an important milestone in the history of cultural anthropology/evolution, but would take a lot of the conclusions with a healthy dose of skepticism.

It's hugely impacted my outlook on the human race, and I think it should be handed out free to students by the world's governments. Every chapter in this book gets 100% from me.

Every page is a fantastic reservoir of knowledge. The best Introduction I've ever seen!"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Read this years ago and consider it oneof the best books I have read. Planning to read it again."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris wrote &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; in the late 1960's, and it is a classic which established the field of evolutionary anthropology. His ideas were revolutionary at the time, and he clearly says so. If there is a fault in the book, it is that he covers too much ground too quickly. I think his purpose at the time, however, was simply to condition the reader to thinking of people as an animal that has been subject to the forces of biological evolution on the Savannah for 98 percent of our evolution. Our species only formed farming communities 10,000 years ago.Much of Morris's conjecture has been turned into solid research in more recent years. For example, studies have found that males are sexually attracted to females having a waist/hips ratio of 0.7. This is universal among contemporary societies including primitive societies. When shown diagrams of women having different waist/hips ratios, male members of the primitive societies chose the 0.7 ratio and specifically indicated child bearing ability being linked to it. Females universally are attracted to males having a waist/hip ratio of 0.85.The argument between nurturing versus evolution is likely to continue. This book started the argument. It is certainly a serious argument. Some readers may prefer not to think as humans as being animals. Some readers, particulary those interested in newer cultural trends such as feminism, may find certain of Morris's arguments objectionable. The material is oriented towards understanding how biological evolution of Homo Sapiens has affected their social behavior. It is not directly related to how to get along with your lover or spouse. However, the book was as thought provoking today as when it was written. It is an excellent introduction to the field of evolutionary anthropology."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"If human beings ever make contact with an intelligent species from beyond planet earth, then the observations those \\"people\\" might make about us would probably read quite a bit like the ones evolutionary zoologist Morris makes in this humorous but deadly serious study of the human animal. The very things we have come to see as mundane about ourselves are the very traits Morrison zeroes in on here. Very little escapes this careful study, although in some cases humanity might collectively wish it had. In this book the human species is anatomically, psychologically, sociologically and biologically cataloged and classified. We read a dispassionate critique of our mating habits, the ways in which we raise our young, our preferences for foods, for where we live, for how we interact with one another, and what bodily features are universally desired over others. In the end I was left both amazed and embarrassed to be among the membership in this great and crazed life form."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book can rightfully be called a classic. It represents an early account of the ways in which an evolutionary perspective can illuminate human behavior. It confronts a wide range of subjects, from the signaling value of postures to the role of infant crying. The use of a carnivore model to interpret the evolution of the human family is admirable, in its attempt to link such a phenomenon with knowledge of other animals, if misleading. All this said, however, The Naked Ape should be read cautiously by anyone seeking a current understanding of similar subject matter. For example, Morris' claim that human behavior should best be understood in complex nations such as Britain (p. 51:&quot;The only solution is to take average results from large samples of the most successful societies. The small, backward, and unsuccessful societies can largely be ignored.&quot;) represents an assumption since turned on its head by evolutionary psychologists. Read alone, this book will generate interest but too-often misinform; read in combination with more recent work (e.g. Pinker's How The Mind Works) this book can be seen as most valuable."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris is that rarity, a scientist who can speak plainly to the layman, without jargon, and impart an understanding of science clearly. Being human, he of course also makes assumptions that later discoveries cast into doubt. So it is with this book.Morris, in his career, has studied many species, including rabbits, birds, turtles, fish--and primates (he was curator of mammals at the London Zoo); particularly human beings, whom he sees as the greatest of the primates. Of course virtually all humans would agree with that.Much of this book would seem to reflect undeniable fact, for those of us who accept the apparent gradual changes of organisms over thousands of generations in their attempt to survive in a changing environment--a case usually termed &quot;evolution.&quot;For those who deny evolutionary &quot;theory&quot; in favor of creationism, this will be a boring book, and a waste of time.One particular facet of Morris's view of human evolution both disturbed me and led me to further investigation: his mention of the theory that pre-hominids had passed through a re-entry phase which brought about dramatic physical changes in our species that made us unique among other primates, our cousins, who shared our last common apelike ancestor.Specifically, the theory, the Aquatic Ape Theory (AAT) as it is known, he only briefly mentioned and seemed content with the view that our earliest ancestor, faced with a receding arboreal African environment which became insufficient to support all of the primates and thus forced them out, dropped from the trees and hit the African savannah running bipedally, and changed their diet to include meat, shedding their fur as they ran to cool off.Problem: The fastest animals on earth are quadrupeds, and are covered with fur. Also humans have a subcutaneous fat layer that provides warmth (and flotation.)Eventually, I found Elaine Morgan's books (The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis, and Scars of Evolution,) which I found much more persuasive than the Savannah Theory which he espoused.Nevertheless, Desmond Morris and Robert Ardrey (The Social Contract, and African Genesis,) have made huge contributions and should be read by anyone with an interest in this subject.Joseph H. Pierre"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I have fond memories of this book. It was first published in 1967 and I read it pretty young; I'd have to reckon it among the more powerful influences of my youth. Controversial or not, there's something profoundly liberating about stepping back and looking at humankind as one species among others.And actually, it's still a darned good book. As Stephen Gaskin remarks somewhere in _This Season's People_, human beings are so intelligent and conscious that it's a matter of controversy whether we're the lowest of the angels or the highest of the primates. Well, the controversy hasn't dissipated since this book was written, but it's still every bit as important for us to recognize and accept the reality of our animal nature.For we _do_ have such a nature, no matter what view of evolution and/or creation we buy into. Evolutionary anthropologist Desmond Morris tends to treat us as though we have _only_ such a nature, as though our being an advanced ape is automatically at odds with our also being a fallen angel. That may or may not be true; I have my opinions on the subject, and you probably have yours.But we don't need to settle that issue in order to find this book immensely valuable. The most solid evidence we have continues to confirm that we have a close genetic kinship with the other primates and that, biologically, we are best treated as primates ourselves. Whatever else may be true of us, this much is about as close as anything in science ever comes to fully established fact.We can disagree about the precise mechanisms of evolution as much as we like; we can disagree about how much of our nature is really accounted for by this or that theory of evolution; but the one fact we can't get around on _any_ account is that as a matter of biology, we _are_ naked apes. We may be more than animals, but we are not less.That's what makes Morris's account so valuable. There just isn't a lot of question that our evolutionary history has shaped us to a very great degree, and Morris is awfully good at explaining how and why this is so. There may be details in need of modification -- after all, evolutionary theory hasn't stood still for the past thirty-five years and some of Morris's own theories were far from universal even then -- but the overall structure is sound.It's no surprise, of course, that this book was so controversial when it was first published; I'm not sure it would be all that much less controversial if it were published for the first time today. But boy, if you want to get a clear sense of what it _means_ for human beings to be primates, this is a great place to acquire it.And contrary to what your initial intuition may be, it _especially_ belongs on the reading list of folks who think human beings have a spiritual side too. Nobody ever made much spiritual advance by denying the hard facts of his or her biological nature and pretending to be a disembodied spirit."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Possibly one of the greatest things to come from reading any book, is that your entire perception of something, a paradigm you may have, is completely and entirely set on end. Unfortunately, even for the most avid of readers, this is a very rare, however the day I completed Morris' unprecedented work I never viewed my world in the same way again. This is by no means an exaggeration. Morris breaks human beings down so effectively, so methodically that it is nearly impossible not to agree with him that indeed, stripped of our veneer of civilization, the inner workings of a naked ape are all one is left with. Not to say Morris doesn't get a few things wrong along the way. I am in full accord with modern day evolutionary psychologists (or sociobiologists, or whatever the hell they decide to call themselves) who fault Morris for his pair bond theory, amongst other things, which indeed does stand on very weak ground. I can't see how one gender would ever develop a trait that in the end would only be beneficial to the other gender, as would have had to have happen for this theory to work. Fortunately, though, I tend to see this as a mere chink in the elaborate chains of thought Morris constructs, unlike his detractors who claim it undermines his entire book. This is stupid. Morris was writing back in time when evolutionary psychology was in the zygote stage, completely unknown to anyone beside a handful of scientists. Morris sets forth in his book powerful and logical evidence and explanations that support the clearest model out there with which to view our species. His critics point out that his book failed to create a renaissance in academia, but so what? When has the academic world ever been quick to change its precious models, especially ones that focus on ourselves? Even today, years after not only Morris, but the even more persuasive work of Trivers, Williams, Wilson, Symons et al has been given, academia still has yet to truly embrace the sociobiology paradigm, despite the mountain of evidence and obvious intelligence of the theory. This is indeed a true sin, because it is a beautiful theory, one that not only helps us truly understand ourselves and our relations to each other, but to the world around us, placing us firmly within the grip of Nature, yet able to take our own course just the same."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book is phenomenally informative. It is organized into eight long chapters, so the good stuff keeps coming fast and furious, making the book hard to put down. The Naked Ape will teach you everything you've ever wanted to know about yourself, your fellow man, and society at large.Morris deals briefly with the concept of religion, describing it as a manifestation of our need to fulfill our inbred biological primate urges. But his main intent is to describe humans in zoological terms as just another species, albeit a tremendously successful one. He jokingly compares our journey to the top of the food chain as a rags-to-riches story, and like all nouveaux riche, we are very sensitive about our background.I wholeheartedly declare this book a must read, although it might be a bit unsettling to those who prefer not to think of humans as mere animals. Even still, it is definitely worth reading. It seems Morris, writing just a few years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, was not optimistic about humanity's long-term prospects, and wished to write a book for the time capsule. Reading it on the other side of the millennium which he doubted we'd see, I'd say he succeeded."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"The Naked Ape is Desmond Morris' controversial best-selling book that studies human beings not as exalted creationary exceptions, but rather as creatures very much beholden to our evolutionary primate origins.Morris, a brilliant zoologist with expertise in the field of primates (amongst other things), uses his profound academic and professional knowledge about primates to shed light on the human experience. Backed with an enormous quantity of scientific evidence, Morris explains the what, why and how of human behavior by stripping away man's \\"civilized veneer\\" and examining the animalistic and evolutionary origins of our behavior.Morris walks us through the evidence in a logical and interconnected fashion. His chapters are organized thematically and begin with the \\"basics\\" of human behavior (sex, child rearing) and then move through the more complex and higher order behaviors (fighting, communication). Throughout these chapters, Morris uses a wide breadth of biological, psychological, sociological and zoological evidence to demonstrate the connection between man and our animal cousins.Though an academic, Morris writes in a simple and direct manner that is accessible to all. The book is jargon-free and has no footnotes, though Morris does provide helpful lists of related readings at the end the book.This book was first published in 1967 and its no-nonsense view of humanity's animalistic origins caused quite a stir. Even though more than 30 years have passed since its publication, this book remains thought-provoking and enlightening throughout. Due to the book's age, several of Morris' theories have been updated and refined over the years. Therefore, this book should not be read as an infallible account of our current understanding of man. Rather, this is an invaluable introductory work on evolutionary sociology/anthropology. More recent works are likely to provide more accurate and up-to-date perspectives.People who are uncomfortable with the idea of evolution or with humanity's connection to other animals should probably not read this book (they probably don't want to anyway). Most will find this a worthwhile read that challenges conventional thought about the human species and provides important insights into our origins."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris wrote this book in 1967 and it is as relevant today as it was then. We are treated to a fascinating, revealing, serious study of human ecology interlaced with humor and insight that only a first rate, dedicated zoologist could provide. Chapters cover our human peculiarities of origin, sex, anatomy, child rearing, exploration/innovation, fighting, feeding, comfort; relations to all other animals and environment; population management or rather, our serious lack of it; and amazingly, even that special peculiarity of humans- language, religion, politics and economics along with insights into the serious lack of efficacy in our endeavors.This is a true, bare to the bones, scientifically detached observation of the human animal and makes no apologies for \\"exposing\\" us in our varied and peculiar habits. An excellent eye-opening read, truly educational and enlightening!For those who are interested in biology, sociobiology, ecology, etc., will no doubt enjoy what can be seen as a large expansion on Morris' theme in the book: \\"Mammal in the Mirror\\" by the daughter and father science team of David and Ilona Barrash. It is truly off-the-charts for a study of us quirky humans."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Having read this book in My early teens, some 26 years ago, I found it informative and detailed. Possibly it was too detailed. I would Highly recommend Morris' next outing that has recently been reissued after being out of print for many years,entitled &quot;Intimate Behaviour&quot;. It seems to be a condensed version of naked ape, saving you from trying to digest vast text relating to zoology and anthropology."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This book contains some very interesting views on human's possible aquatic past which inspired me to do some additional research on the subject."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"well.... if you still did not, you simply must.... believer or not, no matter..... you will understand a lot of yourself and the culture around you"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"A very aptly named book. It categorizes hommo sapiens an a previoiusly unheard of way. I do believe you will find a better understanding of why you react to certain other people the way you do without ever having realized why. Try his \\"moving the salt shaker etc.\\" bit on your friends and watch their reaction. It is almost comical to be able to predict the outcome which will most assuredly never fail."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Great service.The Amazon.com is the best library in the world ( even for French and German languages). The book is very controversial, but interesting. I believe not in Darwin neither in old semitic books histories, however, since the psychology has a long, long way before it becomes a science, studying the behavioral patterns of the animals is the only accessible way to understand a bit our own nature. Please be aware, that the author keeps a complete silence about the human mental world, which represents not a less tangible reality for our deeds than the real world where we struggle for physical survival. Indeed, only the human can (and often do) accept great sufferences and death for imagined reasons, the reasons whose roots are not in the rational and biological but in the irrational, imagined, inspired, sacredly revealed... Strange enough that a such an eminant classical scholar as Walter Burkert in his CREATION OF THE SACRED holds the same position, asserting that everything, even the sacred is explainable by the scientific approach. It reminds me a little a philosophy of shop-keepers : ... great and beautiful things are hard to acquire and very distant, then keep yourself close to the reality: a piece of bread, warm shelter and healthy spouse... In other words \\" The thruth is good but the happiness is better\\".Nevertheless, this work is strongly recommended for its cristal clear reasoning, lucide language and very rich observation material."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"it analyses the human species from a zoological point of view and provides hypotheses of how it has evolved.i enjoed it a lot."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"i can't comment on the validity of the statements made in the book (so i wont), but as for the book itself, it doesn't take much to get into it, i naturally started by reading the sex chapter first, then started at the beginning and read the whole thing, and i found it very fascinating, as would most readers. I wouldn't say that someone who doesn't like to read would enjoy the book, but anyone (who likes reading) with the least interest in humanity would enjoy it. At the very least its an amusing book."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"A rather humbling and fascinating representation of that most complex animal: man. A must-read for any person interested in any bio-related field!"},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"I love the way he strips off our thin venear of civilization and shows us our bigger family history. Our primal urges are what makes all that is good and evil about human beings. To understand this is so important to understanding ourselves, and on a higher level, moulding future civilisations. Fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"Desmond Morris is one of the most acute thinkers to come out the field of biology (more specifically zoology) in the last 50 years. THE NAKED APE is a text that forces the reader to confront his or her own animalistic origins. Beginning with, literally, origins, the reader is lead through the interconnectedness of humanity's mammalian heritage in relation to sex, (child) rearing, mental and physical exploration, fighting, feeding, and comfort. Morris makes it evident that humanity is the product of evolution and posts fluorescent signposts along the way in the form of irrefutable evidence by connecting theory with fact. Whether Dr. Morris is outlining how humans have replaced their innate tendency to groom with the familiar greeting smile or that the pair bond replaces the parental void after sexual maturation, the author breeches all areas of thought along the way: linguistics, psychoanalysis, as well as evolution and semiotics. This is a dense text that is free of cumbersome jargon that anyone with an interest in sociology, philosophy, biology, psychology, or linguistics will come away without regret."},{"Title":"Naked Ape, The","review":"This classic will definitely change the way the reader looks at the human species. Those who still find it uncomfortable to hear of man being reffered to as an animal should not read this book. Or perhaps they should. Morris has this rare -to-find ability to write for a non-acamemic readership and still be thorough in his exposition. Fascinating form page one, up the the last one."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"This book was incredible. I am getting it for gifts for family. I find it amazing that he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, it seems to be in line with a more modern understanding of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book, if they were not so threatened by opposing opinions which this book is, being how it is written from the opinion of @80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The overall impression I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"Through his book, Gibran suceeds in providing a truly unique and totally believable perspective of Jesus &quot;the man&quot;, through the eyes and emotions of those who knew, loved and betrayed him during his ministry on earth. Like the broadway play &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, this perspective is at times divergent from the more traditional Biblical personna of Jesus. But therein lies the charm and intrigue of this book.The story consists of a series of short chapters, each offering a vision of this man-God by individuals who would have observed him conducting various aspects of his public and private life. Each story is a gem in and of itself that leaves the reader pondering their own relationship with &quot;The Son of Man&quot; and the impact his short life on earth must have had for those who lived within the region of Jesus's ministry.This is a book that should be on the shelf of every introspective seeker of truth and inner peace, regardless of one's particular religion."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"Gibran has masterfully rendered, through vignettes, the impact Christ had on the many people he touched during his life on earth. This book captures Jesus' charisma for attracting followers, as well as the fear his &quot;new&quot; ideas instilled in those not receptive to his message of love. Although this is a work of fiction, the book seemed very authentic in tone and content. I felt as if I was in Jerusalem and Galilee 2,000 years ago! Very highly recommended to anyone wanting to know more about the life and times of the Christ."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"This book warms your soul, as you read about aspects of Jesus' life heretofore unknown as seen through the visionary and prophet, Khalil Gibran. Khalil Gibran takes us through a miraculous collection of stories of the life of Jesus as seen through the eyes of the various people who knew him, including his enemies. It's a noble perspective of an ancient time, and helps to put Jesus into our hearts and minds. It can be read in a day, but never forgotten."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"Khalil Gibran's writing style is mind-blowing.

We have Mary Magdalene commenting on her first meeting with Jesus, Caiaphas telling how Jesus needed to be killed, John the Baptist talking about their plot, Judas' mother telling us how much she loves her son, then asking us to go question Jesus' mother, etc.Of course, this is not an historical account of Jesus' life, and Gibran makes many errors in the book. Jesus wasn't born in Nazareth (it didn't even exist when he was born), Jesus was the disciple of John (rather than the other way around), etc. But put your scholar hat aside and just sit back and enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"jesus son of man is wonderful and this book-for me-worth dying for. i think gibran were understanding the bible perfectly(maybe, almost)before he wrote this amazing book. and his way seeing jesus is amazing too. see the chapter about a widow whose son following jesus ! this book absolutely amazing. five stars ain't enough to describe this book....."},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"Kahlil Gibran's \\"Jesus the Son of Man\\" is a magical book filled with facts about Jesus' life interwoven with complete fantasy. It would be best to only read this book if you have already read the New Testament. In this way you will know what Jesus actually said and what Kahlil Gibran made up in a poetic fashion. I did enjoy this book as it made Jesus even seem more beautiful to me. Kahlil Gibran really does capture the essence of Jesus' teachings. He also really had a gift for telling the reader what they wanted to hear. Most of the accounts in this book are positive but a few are negative. Some of the people discussed really lived and interacted with Jesus and others seem born of fantasy. Some of the details are a little incorrect like Jesus was actually born in Bethlehem not Nazareth. I think you will enjoy this book because it is very poetic and it leaves you comforted and in a state of peace and joy.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Jesus the Son of man: His words and his deeds as told and recorded by those who knew him","review":"This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing \\"Jesus, the Son of Man\\", he thought of \`Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;.

In this work, his words are sheer poety and reminiscent of his great work &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Only one other author of recent times has come close to revealing the essence that was Jesus, in such a masterful way. It coincidentally happens to be a close associate of Gibran's, Richard G. Patton. Patton's wonder-filled &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot; also echoes the footsteps of a VERY human being.

The story began in a fairly amusing and intriguing way, as is usual with Kate Charles, but about half way through, the characters and dialogue became very predictable and the ending was not a surprise, to say the least. The dialogue also seemed very dated and similar to the author's other stories. I hope the next one will be better."},{"Title":"Evil Angels Among Them","review":"In a small and insulated society, sometimes evil grows and festers. And then, if changes are introduced from outside that society, sometimes that evil begins to ferment. Evil Angels Among Them by Kate Charles takes place in the small English village of Walston. Everyone knows everyone else and everyone understands his or her place in the social and power structure of the village. Newcomers Gillian and Lou, a lesbian couple with Gillian's young daughter, and Stephen and Becca, the newly married rector and his wife, engender the change that activates the malignancy. There is gossip and rumor, then obscene telephone calls and finally murder. Stephen's friends, David Middleton-Brown and Lucy Kingsley, come to Walston to try to sort things out. This is a study of evil, a banal and petty evil, but evil nonetheless. The atmosphere of the book is fetid with fear and ambition and hatred. Only the church stands, peaceful, beautiful, above the infection in the village. This intricate and intellectual mystery pulled me into the story, taking me down by-ways and back lanes, until finally the solution was revealed, layer by layer. It also introduced me to some very complex and interesting people, three-dimensional people who change and grow because of what happens to them in this little village.The church and the rector are at the center of the story, but the storm swirls around them, hardly touching them with its frightfulness. This is hopeful because that means the good people who live in this village may rise above the gossip, the prudishness, the licentiousness of the few tainted people.

At the end, you wonder how so many people survived as long as they did under such conditions. The story is told from the point of view of a child (which the author was at the time.

The author appears to assume the reader is a (a) female, who (b) obsesses about her weight, (c) needs to lose a lot of weight, (d) has tried many different diets already, and (e) has experienced yo-yo gains and losses in weight.I'm a (a) man who (b) has never thought much about my weight, (c) is on the upper end of the &quot;healthy range&quot; and desires to lose only 12% of my current weight, (d) has never tried to lose weight before, and (e) has never yo-yo'd but steadily gained as I reached middle age.No, the author was definitely speaking to someone else. That being said, I thought the actual advice in the book is spot-on and makes much sense for ANYBODY to follow, not just for someone like me who had childhood experiences with hypoglycemia. The only thing to which I couldn't relate was the personal food journal, but I guess it makes sense. It takes discipline, however.The diet advice in this book, combined with the exercises and diet advice in Jorge Cruise's &quot;8 Minutes in the Morning&quot; are a great combination. Follow the diet and lifestyle changes in &quot;Your Last Diet&quot; and where it doesn't conflict, follow the advice in &quot;8 Minutes&quot; such as the flax oil and food cards, and do the exercises (which actually take more more like 17 minutes).

Basically, stay away from sugars and white foods (except for that potato).. It also seems to embody some of the glycemic index theories.. All in all, I wasn't impressed.. It's helped so many people though, it might be worth a shot for someone else.. GOOD LUCK!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I've always been a sugar addict but just didn't want to admit it. I know it causes my weight problem and when I saw these books I couldn't decide which to get, so I got all three. I'm still reading them but each one is very interesting. I didn't know there were any books about this problem. These are simple enough and very helpful with what to expect and why you feel the way you do and what you need to do. I can't believe it took me this long to find some help. This could really be my LAST diet!!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"Dr. DesMaison describes what I have been feeling and going through perfectly in her book. Not only does she know my symptoms she also provides an answer. The plan is well balanced and you make changes in steps, very gradually so your body does not suffer. No willpower is require, just a commitment to heal. A very healthy approach to healing the body. I highly recommend this book if you want to get off the diet merry-go-round."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I first read this book in October 2011 and it set me on a path to lose 75 LBS through 2012. Very well written. It was like Kathleen was speaking right to me and my concerns. I started by following the first few steps to add protein for breakfast, cut the big sugars (candy which was a huge problem for me) and log all my food. After a few months of getting my brain biochemistry straight as detailed in the book, I started on a good diet and exercise program with control and discipline. The weight steadily fell off and I can't believe my success. Thanks to Dr. Desmaisons for lighting the way for me!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I had read Desmaison's first book, Potatoes Not Prozac, and Your Last Diet, and they helped me lost nearly 100 lbs prior to the birth of my son a few years ago. I just started getting really into YLD and was at my lowest weight ever as an adult (193 lbs)when I used being pregnant as an excuse to eat whatever I wanted. I abandoned the books that had helped me so well for the next few years. I was almost 25 lbs heavier than that low mark. I felt pretty hopeless... like I just couldn't do it all over again. I picked up YLD again and it was like I'd never left. I'm dropping the weight thanks to Kathleen's warm, sound advice. I highly recommend you do the 7 steps, in order, not too fast... and don't skip one (especially journaling- eye roll, I know). It does work. I know you know there are no magical answers, and this one may not be magical... but it does sparkle and it can get you where you want to be emotionally, mentally, and physically. I recommend you buy this book and you join the online community for support. Kathleen is incredibly involved. On more than one occassion I have gotten a personal email from her checking on me. And I do not know her. I'm not a star group member or anything like that... far from it. She just truly cares and believes in her work. I've come to believe in it as well."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"When I read Potatoes Not Prozac, I thought, \\"at last, a book on diet that doesn't focus on losing weight!\\" After all, food acts in the body in a much more complex way than simply making you lose or gain weight. Apparently DesMaisons decided to pick up on the weight-loss market and rewrite PnP for losing weight. I felt her style of explaining how I feel now and how I'm going to feel after doing her plan, little more than the common weight-loss testamonials you see in every second-rate diet advertisement. By the way, I have eliminated sugar from my diet and it has not \\"changed my life\\" or solved all my problems. The 4 billion dollar diet industry, which DesMaisons has become a part of with this book, banks on those types of claims."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"The insights in the book are awesome! I wondered for years about why my mother and I didn't get along better - what I did to make her hate me so, why she was always so mad at me. Then I beat myself up with guilt for not trying to get closer to her and fix things before she died. I've struggled for years with my own self esteem issues, and I've tried more diet programs than I can count.Now I see that my mother was sugar sensitive, and it explains so much about her behavior while I was growing up. What wonderful freedom to have an explanation that makes sense! I've started to see some of her behavior patterns in myself. I understand now that I've inherited the same body chemistry from her, but I don't have to be a prisoner of it. There's hope for me, and for a better relationship with my daughter. I truly expect this to be my last diet, and I believe it's going to change my life for the better!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"Your Last Diet is a companion to The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program and is worth picking up if you are sugar sensitive."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"Initially, I found this book to be a good read. Eliminating sugar and increasing protein seemed to make sense. However, too much protein can cause a host of problems. I have had to start supplementing with HCI hydrochloric acid, because my body could not metabolize all the protein I was eating. I also developed Rosacea because of not having adequate HCI to handle overload of protein. I am now supplementing with amino acids, and only need a normal 55 grams of protein, a day. My mood,and weight are fine. I also get restful sleep like never before. A book that outlines amino acid supplementation is The Mood Cure, or The Diet Cure, by Julia Ross."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I had read DesMaisons first book \\"Potatoes Not Prozac\\". But, I didn't get anywhere. So I decided to buy her latest book and I figured out what went wrong. There are 7 steps that Kathleen outlines in all of her books. Me, being the impulsive and impatient sugar-sensitive person I am skipped these steps and immediately went for the detox. Big mistake!!!!!I am still working on the 7 steps, but the thing I love about this book, \\"Your Last Diet\\" is that it reminds you to follow these steps and it shows you that this is not a quick fix. This is a program that takes time. Patience is the key. You didn't gain the weight in a day, so it's going to take you a while to lose it. And the weight is not the issue. It's the biochemistry and any other emotional issues you have with food.The reason why this book stands out for me is it gives better reasons to take it easy. It gives better reasons to follow those 7 steps. This is probably because there's been more feedback and experiences with this program since the first book. Probably the biggest step I ignored was the third step - the journal. I thought I knew what I was eating, so when these wierd cravings came back, I was confused. Kathleen's reasons for this step explained everything to me. Without the journal, you are unclear about how your body feels about the food you eat, therefore when a crave comes up, you have no clue where it came from.This book can easily be your last diet. Diet is really not a good word for this program, but I understand that Kathleen had to have a title that was catchy. But, you have to be patience and go through the steps. And I already know from my own experiences that life changes that occur slowly or at a steady pace last a lot longer than those that happen overnight."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I've read *all* the books and tried so many &quot;diets,&quot; but never found one single program that was able to make a lasting difference in my life and weight. This book builds on the science explained in Dr. Des Maisons's first book, Potatoes Not Prozac, which helped me to understand that weight gain (and depression) WAS NOT MY FAULT, but rather a function of my sugar-sensitive biochemistry. That realization was key to 80 pounds of weightloss (and counting) and the kind of centeredness, confidence and happiness I haven't known since childhood."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I have read this awesome book and am working on step 1, adding protein to my breakfast. From day 1, I've been feeling much better and I actually see a light at the end of the tunnel of depression (and it ain't no train either LOL). I really recommend this book to anybody who wants to stop dieting and who wants to start living again!!!I believe that this somewhat negative review would shy away people who love to eat a variety of food. If I didn't know anything about YLD, I probably would look for another book with more positive editorial reviews. However, I read it and I love the concept. And from day 1 I really felt a difference on how I felt in the morning by eating a good, filling breakfast, which carried me well into lunch time. The program focuses on slow and easy steps towards weaning yourself off sugar, unlike the Atkins diet. Therefore it is so much easier to incorporate it into your life. You're doing baby-steps not giant leaps that mess you up and are unsustainable. Also, you are not being told what to eat, you learn how your body reacts as you do the steps.However, as I read the editorial for this book (after I had read my copy), I've noticed that the author of the editorial review said that you cannot eat white foods, which includes potatoes. Actually, if this person would have read the book, he/she would've learned that eating potatoes before going to bed plays a major role in stabilizing your chemistry over night. As a matter of fact, a whole section (step 4) is designated to stress the importance of the spud.Also,what was that remark about the book consisting of more marketing than science (not the exact words, but same meaning). In my opinion, it includes enough science to explain to people outside the scienctific-profession how the chemical levels in your body can make you react a certain way. To be honest, if Dr. DesMaisons would've added much more scientific facts, the book would've been overwhelming for many readers. I'm more interested in the way her program can help me live again. If you are a science-buff, I'm sure she wouldn't mind giving you more details via e-mail. As a matter of fact, you will see how involved she is with her groups on her website at radiantrecovery.com and you can read the forum or join other online support groups where you can communicate 24/7 with other people on the program at different levels. If someone has a question that's tough to answer or someone posts something that's not correct, she is always willing to answer questions or correct readers.Marketing? Marketing is good, if it makes people aware of what they need to know. In this book, Dr. DesMaisons merely points out sources and products that can help us in recovery. Also, she helps sugar-sensitive people to cope with their feelings and teach them how to get well. If this is considered marketing, it's great, isn't it? Again, just go to the website or the online groups and see what veterans or even newbies have to say.Great book and great support! I love it!!!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"Four years ago I put on extra weight because of health problems. That is when I started my diet roller coaster. I have a shelf filled with diet cookbooks and diet books. I did the Zone, I ate low-fat, no-fat, high carb, low carb and I swirled into a pit of depression and low self-esteem that I thought I would never get out of.I bought Your Last Diet, when it was still an E-book, and read it voraciously. Dr. DesMaison's style manages to convey information while still being informal enough to understand. She's real. Your Last Diet taught me I was a Sugar Addict, and with Your Last Diet I healed my sugar addiction, and I have begun healing my life. In the process I also lost 20 lbs that had been impossible to lose because of Hypothyroidism.I will never need another diet book. I haven't eaten sugar in 7 months, and if I slip, DesMaisons has provided the help me to recover from it. Her book is about progress, not perfection. Committment not will power.This book will change your life. You will learn to love yourself and your body, and you will find a group of friends who will help you on your way to a radiant you.In sort, this program works. If you know you're a sugar addict.

I have searched high and low for &quot;The Answer&quot; ... Weight Watchers, The Zone, Richard Simmons, low carb, low fat, low calorie, personal trainers, videos, machines, thermogenic pills and drinks ... my book shelves hold a selection of books that rival any book store and my cabinets are full of specialty bars, drinks and pills. To be honest, I DID loose some of the weight with these programs. However, even though I was lighter than before, I STILL was preoccupied with food, still battling chocolate urges, still on the merry-go-round of eating too much one day and starving the next. This is the only program that actually explains what is going on and WHY and actually outlines a way to heal this craziness from the inside out. If you are tired of searching and throwing away your money and your self esteem with each new diet plan tried and discarded, then I strongly urge you to read this book and get set for some fantastic REALITY!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"After following this program for 1 year 4 months, I found all the claims to be true. I fit the description of \\"sugar sensitive\\" and I feel better than ever. Finally able to lose about a pound a week which NOTHING else accomplished. Plus the biochemical improvements - no more gray sadness, uncontrollable binges, mood swings. Oh and blood pressure and lipid profiles are better.Just for comparison...Better than low-cal - the support and balance of WW without feeling starved and (...) from spending points on whites & sugars. Also the 24x7 support is moderated like an everpresent WW leader, so if misinformation shows up it's quickly corrected.Better than lowfat, high carb - all the great stuff from veggies, whole grains, and portion & fat control without the bloating, scary weight gain and dryness/skin problems from lowfat.Better than lowcarb - the clarity and focus of lowcarb without the energy bonking and the sudden crave/binge from nowhere. Because you're controlling not only insulin but also the brain chemicals seratonin (impulse control) and beta-endorphin (feel-good schwinnggg!)So what's the downside? You don't start losing the first week. You do maintenance first and then when you finally know what it feels like to eat right, you tweak for weight loss. Instead of starting on day 1 with a food plan, you have breakfast with protein. You take the time to construct your own program based on how YOU react to the steps.This is the last food plan for me because it's the best I've ever been on, and I'm constantly getting better at it too."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"Fantastic book.

After more than 30 years of riding the diet roller coaster, Dr. DesMaisons has shown me the way to end that insanity. By teaching us how to heal our special biochemistry first, really learning maintenance first, the gradual weight loss really is permanent. I have been following her program for about a year, have lost weight slowly and consistently, and feel better than ever. Knowing that there was a reason why I was unable to maintain the weight I was able to lose on any other diet program I followed so rigidly is very freeing. Now I am listening to my body and customizing this program just for me while following the outline provided in this book. The results are miraculous.

Having suffered from mild depression for over 20 years this book gave me hope to overcome the depression and also lose the weight I gained from overeating. I found PnP to be an excellent read because Dr D was able to clearly express the science involved in sugar sensitivity. I have followed the plan fairly closely for the past year, and while the depression is still there, it's not as bad and I've lost 30+ pounds. Initially I resisted purchasing YLD because I thought there wouldn't be anything new. I should have followed my instincts. The book is a definite disappointment - nothing much new, little or no &quot;science&quot; compared to PnP, and largely just 200+ pages of rambling. She spends far more time telling the reader how they will feel (too many testimonials that remind me of TV advertising) than what they need to do to get there. Too much time is spent on nonsensical topics like &quot;finding your personal style&quot;. It seems Dr D was intent on capitalizing on the success of PnP and squeeze a few more bucks out of her readers."},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I don't know what I would've done if I hadn't gotten this book. I almost didn't buy it. For the past year I couldn't figure out why I was so irritable and overwhelmed at times. Now I know - too much sugar!! This book is invaluable. If you have times when you have a really short temper and just explode, you need to buy this book. It's probably because you're sugar sensitive. I followed her advice and got the zinc, vitamin C, and B complex supplements and I feel like a whole different person. I'm not kidding. I did research on B vitamins and now that I know what I know, I wish I would've gotten them earlier. I was deficient in B vitamins. I have way more energy, am more focused, and have more self-esteem. B vitamins are touted for helping with depression. I didn't know I was in a mildly depressed state until I took the B vitamins. This is a very good book! Buy it!"},{"Title":"Your Last Diet!: The Sugar Addict's Weight-Loss Plan","review":"I tried Kathleen Des Maison's diet for months last year after reading her 3 books first. I did not lose any weight and it did not help with my insomnia at all.Moreover I was pretty frustrated with her website. They claim that you get support when you write to them, but whenever I sent them an e-mail with 5 questions, they answered one or two of my questions the most. I had to write back with my 3 unanswered questions and got maybe one more question answered and so on and so on :). Get it?Update: in the meantime we found a much much better diet which is giving the body enough nutrients AND make you lose a lot of weight without the usual hunger feelings/cravings. Check out Joe Cross' documentary \\"Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead\\". I know, the title does not sound very appealing, but the documentary is great (you can watch it for $4 on amazon Instant) and there is a free website (Reboot) where you find all the recipes. Joe Cross did this diet under the supervision of Dr. Joel Fuhrman and a nutritionist. So this is NOT some questionable, odd miracle diet.We did juice fast for 16 days in August/September, I finally got rid of my frequent headaches and we both got rid of our insomnia AND lost more weight with the Reboot juice fast than with any other diet before plus we were never hungry once we overcame the first two days.This is the one diet that actually works!One more fact that I found out about years ago when I learned how to do fasting the proper way: obese people have enough protein stored in their body to live with little protein for up to 90 days without causing any damage to their heart as long as they take in 400 mg of magnesium per day and drink at least 2 to 2 1/2 liters of water per day (for people with heart problems that's not possible as they should not drink too much). And I agree that 1/2 gram of protein per pound of body weight is way too much, especially for anybody who is overweight. Ask your primary care physician.Joe Cross was taking in about 30 grams of protein per day while he did his juice fast for 60 days. Then he continued to live mostly on fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds (eating, not fasting).I made much better experiences with writing to the Reboot website and getting clear answers to ALL my questions, not just one or two."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Zen: Beyond the Death of God","review":"This book was my first introduction to zen writing and still is a favorite.

I was looking for a more experienced based spirituality after getting burned out on authoritarean prophetic spiritualities. The essays in this book were gently thought provoking and thought transcending. The editors do not explain much and leave the reader to feel his or her own truth about what is said. There is a direct, playful, brain teasing, and pure way of directly experiencing life and the sacred at the heart of all the essays. For many years, I tasted a kind of sanity in the writings that lead me back to what I was actually experiencing. It inspired me to commit to daily meditation, something I have kept up for over 25 years.

I read part of this book, \\"the Zenerin\\", at a poetry reading long ago and everyone felt a potent silence afterwards and some understanding. Zen has always felt like a breath of fresh air and a touch of genuine sanity. It points to a devotional commitment to live in the now with all of life, joy and sorrow, being accepted fully. It rapidly pierces our tendancy to get caught in thinking and miss out on what life is about.

Bravo! Prometheus has brought UML fire to the forsaken and dank world of UML neophytes. UML Inherently lends itself as an acutely idiomatic abstraction on the science of software engineering, and could be a rather knotty topic to elucidate. Paul has created a dazzling masterpiece for those of us who have been frazzled and bedazzled by attempts to understand the language to any practicable extent. His prose is sufficiently balanced with literary invites and his techno jargon is tamed enough to foster a pleasant reading experience. Now that I have exposed the relevance of this book to me, I will offer a few words on how it might benefit you.With a desire for more than an a cursory excursion into the study of UML, you might ask yourself these questions: how can this enhance my career? or how can I employ this newfound knowledge? Well, it will prepare you to overshadow the initial daunting feeling you might experience on your first encounter with a UML CASE tool; this type of software engineering tool could enable you to become very productive in a respectable time span, but this feat is achieved only after you have had a profound understanding of the robust and industry-proven design methodology that is inherent in UML--this book will bolster your confidence for that mission.Again, Bravo!"},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"Let's face it... Reading a book on UML in far too many cases is akin to poking your eye with a sharp stick. You only feel good when you stop. Therefore, any book that can make the whole subject of UML more readable has my commendations. And UML DeMystified by Paul Kimmel falls into this category...Contents: A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Lines of Code; Start at the Beginning with Use Cases; Diagramming Features as Processes; Discovering Behaviors with Interaction Diagrams; What Are the Things That Describe My Problem?; Showing How Classes Are Related; Using State Chart Diagrams; Modeling Components; Fit and Finish; Visualizing Your Deployment Topology; Final Exam; Selected Bibliography; IndexKimmel takes a subject that can be overloaded with lofty terminology and concepts, and boils it down to applicable, tangible examples. You'll learn the most critical parts of UML, such as use case diagramming and process flow diagrams. I'm sure people who make a living doing analysis with UML might think that the material is over-simplified, but that's the benefit of it. Most developers are not going to live in the world of UML. It's a communication tool that is designed to help convey design, not the actual system itself. Kimmel's approach removes the jargon, strips out the esoteric items that are more academic in nature, and focuses on the parts that actually benefit a project 95% of the time. Using a conversational tone with plenty of illustrations and practical examples, he allows the reader to soak in the information without getting bogged down in minutiae. This would be a good starter text for developers being exposed to UML for the first time. They'll understand what is trying to be accomplished, and they can refer back to the material over time to reinforce the concepts."},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"I tried reading two other UML books before I found Paul's. After the first two I didn't even know what I had read. I almost gave up but work kind of made me keep trying. When I found Paul's book, everything started to make sense. Not only did I seem to be able to actually use the diagrams in useful ways but his book enhanced my understanding of object oriented programming, which was a bonus.I highly recommend this to anyone who has been baffled by UML in the past. It's the first time I have seen how really valuable the whole process is. Now I'm hooked. Also, his book keeps me awake and is well thumbed, the other books would make me nod off."},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"Paul really nailed this subject on the head with this book. His title was very apt as although I have 5+ years working with UML, I was largely mystified by this modelling language and even more often by the implementations of it. After completing the book this past week I felt my understanding of UML to be pleasantly refreshed and clear.Paul does an excellent job taking UML and describing it in a manner that is clear a concise - cutting through the technical details and giving you truly useful information and tips. Paul has a solid grasp of what is important, and even more key in my opinion, what is not important.As well as cutting through the details that people often get bogged down with when using UML, the book is surprisingly easy to read considering the oft-dry subject matter! Kimmel's writing style turns this subject into an enjoyable learning experience and left me with motivation and energy to implement UML successfully in the future for my clients.Newbies and \\"experts\\" alike will find this particular UML reference a valuable tool."},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"The authors easy going style makes this an easy read.

Also, in the quiz at the end of the first chapter, the first question says \\"What symbol represents a use case\\", and the answer they give is \\"A stick figure\\".

Buy it, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"I downloaded the Kindle edition.This book could make a good entry point and it has a lot of practical advice, but you should be aware that it only coversa subset of the diagram types.For example the following diagrams are not covered:Timing, Composite Structure, Package, Profile and perhaps others still.In fact it seems that it is pre-UML 2.Still, it gives lots of practical advice on how much detail to put into your diagrams, on how to communicate your diagrams and on style in general that it's worth having (and let's face it, it's cheap).There are a few spelling mistakes that should have shown up in a spell checker which makes me wonder if it was well edited."},{"Title":"UML Demystified","review":"I used this book to jump start some software development modeling at work.

There is no miracle in this book to get a ton of free stuff.This book and her &quot;new&quot; book are the same book just her old book she doesn't try to sell you all her other products.

What a disappointment when I received it in the mail and then read it. There is nothing new in here...the book has nothing in it of value for those who have read other authors in this area. I was really upset at certain parts where the author describes what are clearly gray moral areas. Her recommendation to sneak food out of buffets is [not a good idea]. I do not recommend this book at all. Here her advice about playing - play only video poker. Thanks but I knew that already."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This book is a very good introduction to the world of casino perks.

Some tips I had learned earlier but new ones worthwhile. Most important tip is \\"Do not be shy about asking about comps.\\""},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I think this was my first book with regards to gambling, and it was worth it. If you are planning a trip to Las Vegas, or any casino, and want to know the ins-and-outs of getting comps (freebies from the casino), this book is a good guide. Jean Scott (the author) is an expert on Video Poker so this does come up quite a bit, however she does delve into slot machines and table games too. It was written many years ago, however most all of the tricks she talks about are still valid today."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Horrible book regarding Casino comps. Very outdated and all she says is the comps she's getting without really any insight for the average person."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Most of the information in her book is available on cable TV for free. She gives very little specific information regarding anything about how to play. If you want info on how to join a slot club, available free at any casino, then this book is for you. Otherwise, forget it."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"It never would have occurred to me to employ the basic strategies to getting comps that are discussed in this book. Raises your level of awareness that many things in Las Vegas can be had for free (or cheap). Read the whole thing in four hours; couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Anyone who plays table games, slots or video poker for any amount of time, will more than pay for this book in comps if you don't take advantage of the system allready. As some readers will tell you, some of the information seems more like &quot;work&quot;. However there are many easy things that can save you Hundreds of dollars. I know it has saved me more than I ever knew possible. Nice job Jean."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Every time I turn on show about casinos or Las Vegas, the author of this book is being featured. I can understand why. She is a grandmotherly type, the antitype of the desperate casino gambler, and she seems so ordinary. Yet, she supposedly beats the casinos at their own game. That would be extraordinary. But when I read the book I got a very different opinion. Some of her &quot;methods&quot; are just not applicable to most casino gamblers. Some of them are &quot;cheesy.&quot; I think this book is more hype than content, although some of the information in parts is interesting. I am sure there are much better books and authors out there who actually explore how to play the various games and what strategies to use."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Parts of this book are interesting but what the author advocates is like going to work instead of having fun. Most of us plan our vacations for pleasure. This book is good if your job is trying to get comped at a casino. A disappointment for those of us who want good strategies."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I had been to Las Vegas and Reno a few times before I found out about this book and absorbed it. Now I understand that Comps are not just for 'High-Rollers' but for everyday people too. This book explained to me the purpose of the slot club cards and what the points can do for you. It also put me on the right track as to which games in a casino have a higher house advantage than other games and therefore to be avoided. This is a great book as a starting point to understanding how to take advantage of comped rooms, food, etc. I also found the recommended reading list at the end of the book helpful in going to the next step in understanding the comp system and advantage gaming.I highly recommend this book as a starting point for anyone who is interested in gambling and making their gambling money stretch as far as possible.It is an easy read and her sidebar stories are a hoot!"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Hey &quot;Gone with the Wind &quot; it ain't . But I really enjoyed this book. Sort of &quot;Comp City&quot; lite. Useful tips. Great Bibliography. Books like this make the wait between Las Vegas trips easier to bear. Go on one click it and read it!!! And then buy one of the Video poker books that are mentioned in it. Ok and a copy of Comp City. Ok and get &quot;Lifestyles of a High Roller&quot; Read them on the plane to Vegas."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"There is no denying that this book is very good for the low roller looking to get some comps. Jean Scott really does understand the comping system inside and out. It is not as much fun as Max Rubin's Comp City and it can't touch Frank Scoblete's Guerrilla Gambling which is really the best overall book ever written on gambling, comps and psychology in my opinion. However, readers who want to learn how to extract the most from video poker will truly relish many of Scott's ideas, althouh some are a little far fetched."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"pure and simple. DO go ahead and hang around crowded airports waiting to get bumped. Put your head deep into digusting garbage cans to retreave some coupons. Is this fun? The book is filled with nonsense."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I'm a gambling book junkie. I've purchased and read probably 30 books on the subject. Most books on gambling teeter between terrible and awful. They usually follow the following tedious formula: 1) describe a game in away no one could possibly figure out, 2) point out the extremely awful bets, 3) describe a gambling system or two, 4) relate a couple of great stories about how the author or his buddy used this technique to make a zillion bucks. This book certainly doesn't fit that formula at all (which is a good thing).I bought this book for my mother. My mother is now officially a senior and I don't get to see her often enough, typically twice a year for a day or so. Last year we went on a Vegas vacation together which seemed to give some very quality mother/son time. However, this was my mother's first visit to Vegas and she was a bit overwhelmed on how to deal with the extreme access to gambling (which means that she probably lost more than she felt comfortable with). Her previous experience has been with local Indian casinos - which means she's never really spent more that a couple of hours in a casino prior to our Vegas trip.This book has some advice on gambling, lots of advice on getting comps, but the parts I found interesting are the cheap diversions. It talks about free gambling blackjack tournaments, cheap slot tournaments, and looking for coupons. All of these are fun diversions from having the casino grind the money out of you. I know lots of folks like to shop, go to Hoover Dam, or do other non-gambling activities in Vegas. But let's face it; most of us go to Vegas to gamble. At least the diversions in the book are intended for serious gamblers. I've been to Hoover Dam, I've seen all the casinos on the stripe, I hate shopping, but some of Jean's suggestions sound fun.If you're expecting great literature or some profound revelation about gambling forget it. You won't find that in any gambling book (with the possible exception of \\"Theory of Blackjack\\", by Peter Griffin - which is my favorite gambling book by far but is only recommended to folks who really like math). The bottom line is that this is a good value for a gambling book, especially if you are looking for some low-cost diversions that are interesting to a gambler."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Jean Scott may not have been the originator of the wise advice: \\"A penny saved is a penny earned,\\" but it fits her philosophy perfectly. I am a professional gambler and writer (Casino Gambling for Fun and Profit:Second Edition)and note that much of the money to be squeezed out of the casinos comes from cash coupons, cashback, promotions, etc. Jean Scott is a master at getting the last penny in fringe benefits from the casinos.J. Edward Crowder, Ph.D."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This book gives a fairly good introduction on how to leverage comps if you are a neophyte to the casino world. Instead of insisting you play only her games of preference, she gives advice on how to have a good time while minimizing losses, and advice on how to move to &quot;the next level&quot; if you become more interested in optimizing your play.While giving expected payoffs for the better paying games (i.e., video poker), no strategies are presented, so if that's what you want look elsewhere. It does serve as a starting point for further research into game strategy, if you wish further information the appendix lists some good sources.Some of her suggestions are just bizarre, such as asking hotel maids for discarded coupon books, taking doggie bags for leftover food, etc. If you need to go to these extremes to save a buck or two on vacation you are probably better off staying home.Nothing here is particularly new or groundbreaking, but it will give the clueless a good place to start when they walk into a casino for the first time. Overall it's an enjoyable and easy read, with lots of anecdotal advice, some good, some just silly."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This book is disappointing for several reasons. The glaring one is the fact that most of the author's advice falls into the &quot;use your slot card and the casinos will give you presents&quot; category. There is very little strategy in the book, although it emphasizes playing video poker over any other game. I did not think the more &quot;esoteric&quot; advice for getting freebies such as garbage picking, airplane bumping, buffet bagging was worthwhile unless you are a fanatic for frugality as this author seems to be. This book pales in comparison to other Vegas books such as 24/7 and Guerrilla Gambling. If you are looking to go the comp route and you also want to learn how to play the games, I recommend Guerrilla Gambling. If you want to get inside the casino and see what not to do, I recommend 24/7. There are other worthwhile books on the market that are also much better than Frugal Gambler such as The Mensa Guide to Casino Games, and The Idiot's Guide to Gambling Like A Pro. But if you only want to read one book, I'd recommend Guerrilla Gambling. Frugal Gambling has one or two interesting moments but the book just doesn't hold up in light of the others that I've read."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This book tells you what games to play for the maximum payback and how to find the best deals and comps (freebies) in Las Vegas. The book focuses on video poker more than any other game. This is the book that first taught me what I needed to know to play video poker with the optimal strategy and how judge the paytables on the various machines. Not all information is provided for every type of video poker machine, but Jean points you in the right direction for just about everything you need. And even though I haven't yet been to Vegas, I'm much better prepared for when I do go. And if you're not getting any comps when you go to Vegas, you need this book. Jean will show you that you DON'T have to be a high roller to get them.S. Nelson"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I am not a particular frugal person, nor am I a bargain hunter. I am, however, very competative and want to win. That's why if a supermarket scanner makes a mistake I insist on getting the item free, not for the savings but for winning the game.Jean has terrific insights both for frugal people like her and for people like me who treat it as a game. I have a better understanding of how the comp system works and how to play it after reading the book than I did before. I also have a new respect for casino fun-books and the possibilities for turning negative expectation games into positive expectation ones by using a small value coupon.Thanks, Jean"},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"My personnal experience after reading the book was when I had a resent trip to Vegas in Febuary 2011. I did a lot of research before I went and part of that was this book.When I arrived in Vegas and started to put the steps into action I could not find the exact video poker machine that was mentioned in the book. I even went to other sites like vpfree to locate the different casinos and there location with no luck.It has been a while since I was there and the only real way to get around is by cab.Two casinos that I wanted to go Fiesta Rancho and the Santa Fe which I thought was downtown but they were a little further so to time restraints we did not go to them.We did make it to Four Queens which was downtown that we did have some luck playing VP and Slot. This was due to all my research and reading the book. We will be planning a trip back to Vegas next year and maybe will purchase her new book and learn more steps to take to put more of the odds in my favor. She needs to know that the exact machine she recommends I could not locate Full Pay Deuces wild .Hope this will get to her and she needs to respond back .Thanks,Luckyone."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Jean Scott has given some terrific advice in this book. Even people who think they are experts can learn a thing or two, but it is the novice that will truly gain from this book. To them, it will be worth many, many times the purchase price."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Since its publication in 1998, this book has dramatically changed the gambling experience for thousands of readers. This is a fantastic introductory book that gives many casino patrons their first glimpse at the possibility that they have a good deal of control over their gambling experience and outcome. Proof of this change can be found on gambling message boards where players frequently quote Jean's strategies and successes. I have bought many copies of this book for gifts. Whenever I hear that a novice friend is going to visit a casino, I give them a copy of the book."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"The book was just as the seller said it would be. very happy with the item. fast shipping."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I wish I had the time to clip coupons, run around from casino to casino, read all the local papers, and write a book! The fact is, regular players only care about winning with the best value, and not listening to someone brag about their ability to squeeze every last cent out of the casinos. The author says so much about herself that the reader begins to doubt if her &quot;new found career&quot; is part fact / part fiction. For the novice, I'm sure they go goo-goo over this book. But for anyone who has gambled or flown even once, we should have been told not to spend the money on the book. I feel Ms. Scott doesn't feel anyone other than her is capable of getting the best bang for the buck. I certainly didn't when I bought her book."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I agree with the reviewer below that Jean Scott's book is good but not great. The downside is that much of her advice is of the variety of getting bumped for free mileage on airline, using coupons and sneaking food out of buffets in doggie bags. The gambling aspect is essentially look for video poker machines that are full pay and play the right strategies on them. I also think that Frank Scoblete's &quot;Guerrilla Gambling&quot; and Max Rubin's &quot;Comp City&quot; are far superior. Scoblete's book deals with all the games and strategies to cut the edge. It also has much better advice on how to get comps. Rubin's book is a hoot. However, Scott's personal stories are interesting and enlightening and it is a worthwhile book to have in a gambling library. There is no doubt that if you put the time and effort into getting comped as Ms. Scott does that you will get maximum value for your gambling dollar, although you will be using up an awful lot of time do do so."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Jean Scott's book covers it all in a very easy to understand Format. For everybody who has heard about FREE buffets, rooms and flights, this book tells you how YOU, the low roller, can get them for yourself. She also explains what to look for and what to do before sitting at Video poker machines, Blackjack tables and other Games, to maximize your Profits and Minimize your Losses. The Chapters regarding Slot Clubs make The Frugal Gambler a Must Have book for the casual-to-serious gambler. Jean Scott makes it easy and fun to get Freebies and explains clearly how you can also do it easily. Loved the book. Read it twice in the first week and passed it along to a friend before his trip."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"While this book is an enjoyable read, and there is a lot of good advice given to casual players, I don't consider Jean Scott to be a \\"low roller.\\" As she says, you need a bankroll of $3,000 to make her system work on 25 cent video poker. To me, that's hardly a \\"low roller.\\" Also, there is no way when I'm on vacation that I'm going to spend 8 hours a day playing a machine. That seems more like work to me- I'd rather have a drink by the pool, or just wander the Strip. And taking food from the buffet in a doggie bag? Please!All that being said, I'd still recommend this book. It will give you enough tips that what whatever gambling you do, you'll benefit. It's an easy read, and it'e also entertaining. Just don't think that by reading it you'll be getting suites comped to you. A free room or buffet now and then is about it."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I believe that The Frugal Gambler, and the sequel, More Frugal Gambling, were highly relevant in the old days. By old days I mean when Casino Hosts had discretion in issuing comps. Today the system is so highly automated by Slot Club Cards that there is little room for negotiation for better comps. Today you need to simply SIGN UP for a card where ever you are playing. One thing I do find problematic about this series is that it does not address the need to stick to one club, whether it be Harrahs or Ceasars or whatever, in order to get the most bang for your buck. Spreading your gambling budget between multiple casinos merely dilutes your value to each of those casinos.If you are a table player, then definately check out Comp City, by Max Rubin. You can still buck the table rating system today. That is until MindPlay rating systems become universal."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"Having been a long time subscriber to the Las Vegas Advisor newsletter, I had heard many good things about Jean Scott, and her approach to getting the most out of a low-roller's gambling budget. I'm very glad I bought the book. Jean's strategies are range from ones that everyone can use to ones that require a little more nerve. She lays them out, and you decide which ones you want to use. I'm heading back out to Las Vegas in a couple of weeks, and I plan to read the book again before I go."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"If gamblers insist on playing negative games they should at least make the best percentage bet for the player and take full advantage of the comp system and other casino promo's to ease the loss.My game of choice is video poker and with it along with the comp system I am able to spend 100 nights a year free (I could actually stay free 365 days a year if my other life commitments would let me) and I eat all I want for freeI wish everyone would become an expert in thier positive game of choice and I wish I would have read the book &quot;The Frugal Gambler&quot; years ago. It would have saved me thou$and$."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"In the gambling field there are a lot of charlatans. Over the years I have received mailings from people who have promised me that I could beat the casinos if I followed their advice. I never thought that television would hype a person and a reputable company would bring out such a absurd book as Jean Scott's Frugal Gambler. This is a ridiculous book as some other reviewers have noted. It really doesn't help the average gambler unless the average gambler has larceny in his heart,or HER heart. Scott describes clearly immoral activities, again as some reviewers have noted, as a part of her arsenal of weapons to beat the casinos. Bringing doggie bags to fill up at the buffet, purposely booking overbooked flights to get bumped. The stuff in this book is a list that goes from the ridiculous to the shameful. This book is a waste of money and time. She doesn't even explain in a thorough fashion how to play video poker but recommends other books, obviously by her publisher, which will make you a winner...This book is truly awful. Look elsewhere for enlightenment on gambling."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"For players looking to learn about the games or to maximize comps, this is NOT the book to read. Essentially Scott's advice is to play and then ask for comps or get cashback from your machines, which is what everyone does. Her &quot;refinements&quot; are outlandish, especially hanging out in airports to get bumped and digging in garbage cans to get coupons. If you are looking for THE book on casino gambling and comps I recommend Frank Scoblete's &quot;Guerrilla Gambling. It is loaded with valuable information. Jerry Patterson's new edition of &quot;Casino Games&quot; is also a very worthwhile book."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This book is a great overview of how to get the most out of the comp system. Scott talks mostly about video poker, but much of her advice also applies to table games."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"If you have no background in the wold of video poker and casino comp policies, this book is a decent place to start. If however, you have played in casinos or even read other information about comp policies, you will find this book very elementary. I found this book to be short on useful information. I expected better personal stories about the authors casino experiences. The writing is long winded and repetitive."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"I have been to Vegas 3-4 times before, and when I heard about this book on the Travel Channel, I understood it to be for ALL levels of visitors. When I read throught the chapters that interested me, I was disappointed to find what I already knew. The book has very good information, but it would help a &quot;first-timer&quot; much more than it did myself. On the flip side, my Mother lives in Vegas and found the book very enjoyable. It pointed out things that she had not considered before. You won't know until you try it, if it's for you."},{"Title":"The Frugal Gambler","review":"This is a great book for anyone new to gambling.

At age 35, Scott got tired of the preaching and turned to gambling. She traded her Bible for Lenny Frome's book \\"Winning Strategies for Video Poker.\\" She never goes to the casino without it. Now a grandmother, Scott thanks her lucky stars that almost everything is free...all you have to do is know the angles.Scott and hubby Brad spend more than half the year sleeping in beds that are comped by the casino. They don't bother to pay for meals, the meals are free too. Scott says the key to successful gambling is to know where to play and what to play.Scott's book \\"The Frugal Gambler\\" lays it all on the line for novice gamblers. When a game is programmed to pay out more than 100 percent of the coins put in, the longer you play, the more money you win.Scott belongs to every players club on the planet. Her philosophy is, \\"Playing any machine in a casino without using a slot card is like going to your room after each gambling session and throwing fistfuls of dollars out the window.\\" That was in the year 1998 when Dan Rather profiled Jean and Brad on the CBS news show 48 Hours.Scott was singing a different tune in 2001. Mr. and Mrs. Scotts ten year winning streak turned to dust. They finally joined all the other slot players and went on a losing streak. Month after month they learned what it felt like to be a loser...they couldn't climb out of the black hole.Sadly, other slot players couldn't help them, they didn't have Scott's charisma. In fact, it is doubtful if other slot players would have helped Scott whose arrogant, superior, pompous, sassy attitude through the years makes it hard for them to digest what she writes."},{"Title":"Uniforms, Organization and History of the Waffen-Ss","review":"a very informative book for all collectors of uniforms, caps, helmets, and so on. with the history and insignia of all waffen-ss divisions. lots of pictures, tables and information"},{"Title":"Perfect Lies","review":"I saw the reader rating on this book and thought it deserved better.

When I got home, I read the review on Amazon and thought, oh no why waste my time? Since it was 11pm and I was desperate, I started to read it anyway and guess what? I liked it. My only complaint, (and here I agree with the reader from Arizona) is that the romance between Meg the protagonist and Abe, her lawyer/friend was a little late and not very inspiring or believable. All in all, I think Perfect Lies was perfectly okay."},{"Title":"Perfect Lies","review":"I found this book hard to get through because the story just wasn't there for me. The romance doesn't even begin until well over halfway through the book, and by then you don't even care. I found myself being bored and just wanting to read the last chapter to find out who did it, that way I could just put the book away and go on to a more satisfying read. This book should try to bring the reader into it, and instead drives the reader out of it. I think Liza Bennett is a talented writer, but she just needs to get a story we can sink our teeth into."},{"Title":"Perfect Lies","review":"Pretty much the title of this review says it all. Mediocre writing and a very stale plot made it a chore to read. Also, if I had to estimate, the book contains AT LEAST 25-30 typographical errors which annoyed me endlessly.

He did such a great job of creating his characters and making me love them that I felt very real shock and grief when both Dedalus and Ambrose died. I kept fearing that Donuil would be next! I had to keep reading to make sure the people I had grown to love through the books made it!I will say that as a woman, I was a bit bored by the seemingly endless battles and battle strategies, but I can see that they were necessary to the story. I did find the weaponry and descriptions of sword crafting very interesting, and it opened my eyes to things I've never wondered at before.Thank you, Jack Whyte, for your totally plausible, exceptionally well-written interpretation of a wonderful legend. Of the 6 months I spent savouring your words, I wouldn't say a moment of it was wasted time."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Although this is ostensibly a review of \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", it in actuality covers all six books of the series to date (\\"The Skystone\\", \\"The Singing Sword\\", \\"The Eagles' Brood\\", \\"The Saxon Shore\\", \\"The Fort at River's Bend\\", and \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\"), primarily focusing on the last two. This series, The Camulod Chronicles, outlines the story of King Arthur as it might have been in a historical perspective, beginning with the end of the Roman occupation of Britain. If there were such a person as Arthur, he would have lived during this time. Most likely, he was a composite character, based on some of the more influential warlords and petty kings of the day. As an aside, I am reminded of a vacation in southern England that my family took in 1995. My sons, who were 11 and 13 at the time, could not understand my excitement in viewing the ruins of Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, asking \\"How can this be the birthplace of someone who never was?\\" But, that's a different story. . .The first two books of the series, which outlined the founding of Camulod (or Camelot) and Avalon and the forging of the sword Excalibur, were told from the viewpoint of an old Roman soldier. The last two books, which detail the birth of Arthur and his early boyhood years, are told from the viewpoint of Merlin, or, \\"Merlyn\\" in the Chronicles. The last two books, which detail Arthur's adolescence and subsequent coronation as High King of Britain, are also told from Merlyn's point of view. As an avid reader of Arthurian legend and all its various retellings, let me tell you that the character of Merlin is probably one of the most varied of them all, probably due to the fact that he was actually a minor character in Mallory. Hence, the details are free to be filled in by the current chronicler. Merlin ranges from an evil wizard living backward in time to a benevolent sorcerer to merely a human being who is just a little smarter than most. The most esoteric version of Merlin can be found in Stephen Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle in which Merlin is the son of Charis, the last princess of Atlantis, and Taliesen, the greatest of the Celtic Bards. Except for the exotic birth, Jack Whyte's Merlyn has much in common with Lawhead's Merlin in that both were mortal men, though a little larger than life in that they were fierce warriors, outstanding field generals, and outstanding scholars. Also, neither possessed the true gift of magic, though they were believed to by the masses of humanity. In the sixth book, we are also given a glimpse into Merlyn's future as he begins to withdraw from the public eye, just as Arthur begins his ascendancy into it.The Camulod Chronicles begin earlier than Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\", in a time that historically did occur, hence the tales carry an air of realism. The descriptions of the Roman influence on Britain in the late Fourth and early Fifth centuries are fascinating. The story unfolds at a leisurely pace, but the pages just keep on turning. The story is easy to follow as well as fun. There are those critics who complain that some of the dates given are inaccurate, as well as some of the situations. As Don Henley sang, \\"Get over it.\\" This is historical fiction at it's finest, with the emphasis on fiction. Granted, there are differences between this series and others of its kind, but the abundant variety of viewpoints and details are what make Arthurian literature the great store that it is. For the most part, the common characters that the Camulod Chronicles share with other retellings are true to form, though the treatment of Vortigern is more sympathetic than any other I can recall.As I type this, I am awaiting the arrival of the seventh book of the series, \\"Uther\\". I will keep reading these books as long as Mr. Whyte keeps writing them. So far, I consider this to be among the best Arthurian series' I have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone who has an interest in the Arthurian legend, anyone who has an interest in historical fiction, or both. As a bonus, anyone who likes these books would most likely like Stephen Lawhaead's Pendragon Cycle and Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy. The order you read them in is not important, though somewhere in the mix you should read Mallory to see where it all began. I love Arthurian fiction and fact, and, after reading these books, I'm sure a lot of the rest of you will, too."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Jack Whyte's \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", sixth book, and 2nd in the series is excellent. Once again we follow Caius Meryln Brittanicus, in his quests, and watch an older Arthur becoming a leader, and in time the high king of all of Britain and wielder of Excaliber. In this novel we are brought back to Camulod, and now Meryln serves as a leader of colony alongside his brother Ambrose. Not to give away story, but tragedy will strike, and through this Meryln makes the change from leader of men, to Sorcerer- friend of few, feared by many, a powerful transformation. Evil always dwells, and this 2nd book in series has alot more action then previous. Once again the characters are descriped in great detail, and we get to know them through Merylns narrative. I in particular like the Pendragon descriptions, characters like Huw and Lyewelln are nice to follow. The only downside I can see at moment, is that there has not been a real follow up to this as yet, as the next book follows Arthurs father, hopefully in time Whyte will deliver more books for this series. Highly Recommend the \\"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis\\", an entertaining and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I have to say that this book is really amazing. Jack was able to create a clear picture about how such little evidence we have about authurian ledgends into 6 breathtaking novels.

That is something not many authors can do.Praise for Jack Whyte"},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Jack Whyte yet again maintains his level of excellence in this series! And yet again, I was kept up until the wee hours of the morning unable to put down the book. I have rarely seen characters this well written; Jack Whyte gives them such depth and complexity that they seem so authentic. You get this incredible sensation that these people did exist - period - and history unfolded exactly this way - period.One of the great things about this book and series, is that Jack Whyte explains the magic and sorcery that has surrounded this legend with down-to-earth explanations. The amazing thing is that in doing this, he creates an even better legend. The idea that man, without the aid of magic but by his intellect and will alone, is able to have a vision and bring it to life in a way that has endured as long as this legend has, is very inspiring.I have related to every one of these characters; I have laughed, cried, been enraged, and been constantly surprised by them.I tip my hat to Jack Whyte - he has quite a gift."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"First off, I love the way Mr. Whyte writes. It's been a while since I last found a series of modern works worth reading, and the Camulod series really satisfies the true reader. The words fly through the brain effortlessly and the thousands of pages are turned with amazing speed. A good read, and that is no lie. But! After all that, I am gravely disappointed that Arthur was not given more attention. This book, and this series, just ended - WHAM! Halfway through &quot;Sorcerer,&quot; I panicked. Arthur was still only 15. That was when I finally excepted that Jack had no intention of telling the actual Arthur story. He instead has told the events leading up to the Arthur legend - the story of the making of Camelot. He has left the actual Arthur story largely untold. I guess this is what he intended, and I will not blame him, yet I am left languishing for the actual tales of Arthur in his manhood. Maybe... just maybe... there will be another book after &quot;Uther&quot; ??? I can always hope... In any event, I am a Jack Whyte fan and promote his work shamelessly."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"This is (I think) the sixth volume in the series. Now after something like 3000 pages we have just gotten to the Sword in the Stone episode, Arthur now being about 18 years old. I shouldn't say this, but the author is not a young man -- he dedicates one of the books to his grandchildren. Here's long life to you, Jack!The series is compulsively readable, however. As a member of some King Arthur clubs on the Internet, I have been taken to task for liking these books. They say they are historically inaccurate, in, for example, the same sense that the movie Gladiator was criticized for showing the Romans using fire-shooting catapults on a campaign in the northern German forests. Also, there is no evidence that the British at this time used cavalry to great advantage because they had discovered stirrups. Well, la-di-da. Who cares? It READS convincingly as pseudo-history, and that's all that matters in this sort of story. The latest one is particularly good, after two or three dull ones.The author had a new slant on the Uther/Ygraine tradition that was really good, and there are other felicities. There's also a lot of boring dreck. On the whole, though, a good series."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"\\"A gigantic ball of flame roared from the pit with a concussive, deafening sound that sucked all the air in the room, it seemed, into its heart, then belched it out again in a terrifying rain of sparks and embers and great, whirling clouds of choking smoke.\\"The Sorcerer Metamorphosis is an ingenius fiction of the Arthurian legend by Jack Whyte and it is the fifth book in the Camulod Chronicles series. It is about how Merlyn and Arthur return to their stronghold of Camulod but instead of peace and prosperity, they find themselves in the middle of a desperate war with their longtime neighbor and ally, the now distrought, Cambria! While Merlyn loses everything he ever cared about and morphs into a powerful sorcerer, Arthur fights in the war to learn how to become a man, a soldier, and a leader.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the previous books in the series and anyone who likes books on the Arthurian legend or just books about medieval warfare."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I have read and enjoyed this series more than any I have read in recent years...and this installment bettered all previous.

I had a hard time forcing myself to read this one because it is so slow moving and just plain boring. It seems as if Whyte lost his train of thought here or was himself bored with the telling of the Camulod tale. Either way, his editor needs a kick in the rear for letting this one be published as is.For those who are reading the series and haven't yet gotten to this one I do suggest you read it just to keep following the story to the end but I finally resorted to skiming paragraphs/pages just to get through the really boring parts.Very disappointing this book is."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"Whyte continues a familiar story with quite a different approach.Merlyn Brittanicus continues his tireless journey to make a High King out of young Arthur but finds his carefully thought-out plans disrupted by his long time nemisis Peter Ironhair. Consumed by his deep hatred for Ironhair, Merlyn set out to destroy his enemy once and for all at all costs. If you have read the first books of the series, you will remember Publius Varrus' similar determination when he dealt with Seneca.This final chapter manages to provide a seemingly logical ending to the Camulod Chronicles series. However, you get the feeling that Whyte tried too hard to link too many of the past events from his earlier five books to this final book so that he gloss over certain events. That just leaves readers feeling that something is missing. Certainly, it does not give you the same feeling as when you finish reading Book One - The Skystone.For those readers who prefer a more wholesome ending to the Arthur / Merlin story, Mary Stewart and Bernard Cornwell's series are highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I may only be 14 but I've read all these books and I like them all.

The earlier ones were lustier and had more fighting."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"I am enjoying Jack Whyte's version of this archetypal saga very much. I have read quite a few different versions and interpretations of the Arthur epic. I think the scot version is as good as any others I have read, despite the nit-picky reviews this series has gotten on these pages. If you love the story then you should hear it from as many sources and opinions and historic angles as possible, yes? No one will ever know the actual facts, but everyone knows the archetype;(that is what archetypes are all about anyway), this one is a constant in our society, and mass consciousness.

Now in Sorcerer, he has recovered quite a bit, but still fails to hold a candle to his previous works.Finally, Whyte resolves dozens of our expectations and dangling questions. Certain characters have died, as we knew they must. Camulod is becoming less Roman, and more like the Arthurian Britain we all know. Merlin has now become the sorcerer, and Arthur has pulled the sword from the stone and become King of all Britain.Unfortunately, the manner in which he did all this... left me far from impressed. While Whyte had spent immense detail on every little meaningless event in previous books, he then chaotically rushed through these MAIN events we have been waiting for since The Skystone.It's a shame, but after six books- I am no longer interested in how this series will turn out."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"book is great and most impressed with ordering and delivery, actually received in under 3 weeks"},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"The book, The Sorcerer Metamorphosis, by Jack Whyte, is another adventure tale of King Arthur.

One more part is needed to make the circle full, Merlyn started at least one of his volumes referring to Arthur dying in his arms an the kingdom in ruins, but in a way the main story ends here: the king is given his singing sword. I felt sad when it ended. This volume is vintage Whyte, with action following logically from whatever has taken place earlier. Somehow, however, some of the changes seem forced, with Merlyn striking his head or getting sick just at a crucial junction to send the story on a new route. Besides, magical visions, such as the meeting with Ironhair do not belong in a story that is just a description of what happened. Too much supernatural coincidences make the rest less believeable, and a deus ex machina or a dream seem too easy ways out of a tight spot. However, Merlyn's revenge in the war in Cambria is a magnificent part of the plot and covers other problems. I still wondre about the leprosy, it never got anywhere further than Merlyn's own thoughts. If, and when, the final part of Merlyn's story reaches the end, I would also like a more detailed map to keep track on what happened where. At this stage, I envy those who have yet to discover this magnificent interpretation of what could have been....."},{"Title":"The Sorcerer: Metamorphosis (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 6)","review":"This is the last of the books in the Camulod Chronicles series, I'm sorry to say.

Two of the descendants, of course, were the mythical figures, King Arthur and the sorcerer, Merlyn (Merlin.)The story would have been fascinating no matter what the characters' names.

He is the author of the Camulod series of books and has just had published the first in a trilogy about probably the most famous Order of knights, ever to come through the pages of history, the Knights Templar.This is the sixth book in what has turned out to be a terrific series. Yes there are some reader's who do not like the approach of the author to the subject of Arthur and they have every right to voice their opinion. Personally I feel that the time frame he has placed Arthur in sits well in my own mind but if the truth be told none of us know whether Arthur actually existed never mind the period he lived in, so it is all pure conjecture. He certainly did not ride around in tournament armour, as Hollywood would have us believe. That type of armour was perfected several hundred years after the time that he may have lived.. He is much more likely to have lived at the time that Jack Whyte places him.In this, the sixth book, Merlin, Arthur's guardian and mentor has realized that the time is right for his dream to come to fruition. He has groomed young Arthur away from prying eyes, there is nothing more than can be done. It is time to present Arthur as the High King of Britain, a role that he was born for.

For starters, the \\"super-secret high tech\\" plane they're sent to retrieve, is just an AC130 Spectre Gunship (they call it an ARCLIGHT), a plane thats been in service since Vietnam. It's not high tech at all, and definetely not worth the effort they put into retreiving it. And the plan they devise to get the plane back is the biggest piece of nonsense they could possibly create. And why go after it all when you can just blow it up??It's not like it's a proto-type, why go through all the effort and expense?The antagonist in this book is also a massive joke. He was obviously created to be completely unbelievable and over the top. Instead of an opponent who was devious and clever, we get a clumsy, foolish, and very stereo-typed evil villian; who was created for the sole purpose of disgusting the reader.The ending also makes little or no sense at all.If you want a good military/action book, get HOGS #1: Going Deep.Its a great piece of fiction about A-10 Warthogs in the Gulf War.Bottom line, avoid this book like the plague!"},{"Title":"Going to Extremes: Mud, Sweat and Frozen Tears","review":"While the four individual sections (Coldest, Driest, Hottest, and Wettest) are enjoyable, I was disappointed that Nick Middleton makes no effort to connect the sections or even come to any overall conclusions about why people live in such extreme realms.In addition, the sections themselves seemed occasionally padded. The Driest section is the worst offender, with a lengthy section on living at extreme Andean altitudes, which, while fascinating, isn't related to the main topic (this is ironic to me since it's the main reason I bought the book, having visited -- for twenty minutes -- the airport at Arica, Chile, enroute to La Paz, and being curious about this desert beachfront place).The best section is the first (Coldest), being a rather vivid look at the peculiar adaptions the people in a Siberian town make to live with extreme cold, as well as some fascinating descriptions of the phenomena associated with a -50 degree climate.Perhaps the TV series it's based on is more enlightening, but since it's not out on DVD yet, I can't find out"},{"Title":"Going to Extremes: Mud, Sweat and Frozen Tears","review":"The book's topic and treatment of a travel log are very memorable and full of interesting observations from very unexpected places.

Although it was not what I expected, I find that it offers a very unique insight into Jewish thought, from a very specific time and place, and from a very distinguished human being.Heschel visited Israel right after the Six Day War in 1967, and what this book offers is his interpretation of \\"what Israel means\\" to the world, for both Jews and non-Jews. I expected something closer to a journal, detailing his thoughts and observations from his visit. What Heschel provides is more of an outline of Jewish philosophy, in the context for a 1967 audience. It is rare to find such an articulate encapsulation of the perceptions \\"the day after\\" such an historical event.This is not a history book. If anything, it is more like an emotional time capsule. The Israel of 1967 is very different from the Israel of the 21st Century, but the hopes and aspirations of what Israel can mean for our lives and to the future is still present throughout this book. Heschel's words are a snapshot of his own perceptions of Judaism, politics, philosophy, and the evolving State of Israel.There are two very poignant items that struck me in this book: his notion of paradox and his observations of regional politics.Early on in the book, Heschel addresses the idea of paradox as an inherent part of religion (for example, religions teach us to treat all people equally, but we are also commanded to hold special attention to our mother and father). I can only imagine the paradox that Heschel must have felt in 1967. The State of Israel only survived out of the violence inherent in war, but Heschel's own philosophy is so deeply rooted in the tenants of non-violence.In the context of discussing the regional conflicts, Heschel clearly states \\"We (Jews) abhorred and continue to abhor violence.\\" The strength of the Jewish connection to Israel is driven by Hope. Heschel's words clearly state that \\"Hope cannot stand alone. It must be morally substantiated, faithfully attended.\\"The words balancing \\"hope\\" and \\"morality\\" of Israel's actions had very specific meaning in 1976. The same words, however, raise different challenges today, when addressing the politics of the region in the 21st Century. Heschel also states \\"[peace] is our hope, our prayer, our goal. The six days of war must receive their ultimate meaning from the seventh day, which is peace.\\"Heschel admits that \\"We must not expect history of politics to read like the history of theology,\\" but he also does not shy away from the importance of the political realities that challenge Israel then and today. The book not only addresses the desire of Jews to connect with Israel, but also addresses the importance of Israel to Christians and Arabs as well.Balancing the needs of humanity is the ultimate challenge that Heschel attempts to address - \\"How to unite the human and the holy?\\" For Heschel, the Bible is still an unfinished drama, and all people --- Jews, Christians, and Arabs --- have an obligation to fulfill the promise of expectation in Israel.The bottom line is that this work does a wonderful job of summarizing Heschel's observations of Jewish thought in the 1960's. The context of his words may have changed since then, but the lessons he teaches are just as relevant today."},{"Title":"Israel: an echo of eternity","review":"Simply put, this work does not present Heschel at his best. He has no real insights as a secular historian, and his observations about Jewish history, the Jewish state and Zionism, are one sided and unfair. But Heschel being Heschel, the work does have much to offer. When he sticks to some of his topics which are well worn, like notions of Jewish time and space, the work shines with the special sanctity of his mind and his sparkling insights. But even this is not enough to save this work. It is both vague and pointedly polemical; its clumsily drawn conclusion don't have enough punch."},{"Title":"Simplicial objects in algebraic topology: [lecture notes","review":"The book was in the same conditions as described when I bought it and it came in time."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Gifts Handbook: The Complete Guide to Discovering and Using Your Spiritual Gift","review":"Many of us believe that spiritual gifts belong solely to Christian professionals - pastors, missionaries, and seminarians.

And if we believe that the Bible is the Word of God then we must also believe, as II Timothy 3:16 says - &quot;All scripture is given by the inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&quot; The key word there is ALL! Out of the 19 spiritual gifts listed in the Bible, Dr. Black proposes that the first 9, which include healings, miracles, tongues, etc., are no longer relevent. It is as if he skims the cream off of the top and tosses it out. By doing this he is saying that only a portion of God's Holy Word is given to present day believers.

Wild Geese Calling, by Stewart Edward White, is a story about a couple who are pioneers at heart. It is about adventure and homesteading in Oregon, Washington and Alaska in the early 1900's, and about the captivating beauty of that part of the country, but even more it is a study in personalities and relationships.I especially enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters, John and Sally Murdock. Although it's slightly too romanticized to be wholly realistic, they do have a few issues and conflicts they have to work through. What's really enjoyable about this book, though, is their observations of themselves and other people. They enjoy \\"people-watching\\" and the study of character, and some of their conversations about people and actions, as well as Sally's reflections on her own inner life and conjectures about what is going on in other people's minds, are thoroughly enjoyable.The narration is largely from Sally's point of view, although told in third person, and I think a good part of the reason I enjoyed it so much is that Sally is a likeable character, and a lot of her thoughts and responses reflect my own. She is bright, adventurous, and very much in love with her husband, and she has a streak of independence and fire that adds a lot of interest to the book. There are traces of an odd brand of naturalistic spiritualism in the book, but not to an extent that they are distracting or would make the book inappropriate for someone with a Christian worldview.Sally does at one point make some slightly poor decisions and get herself into a bit of trouble, but she responds well in the end and the situation is resolved in such a way that I think she learned her lesson.Although the book proceeds at a leisurely pace and isn't one of those books that's impossible to put down, the book kept me reading and interested all the way through. There were some points of suspense and several scenes that made me laugh aloud, and the last part of the book really picked up and was the most exciting.The language and writing style of the book is in many places truly beautiful, and I enjoyed the turn of language as much as the characters and storyline.Overall, I found this a delightful book. There are a lot of nuances and observations that would be fun to discuss with a group or another person reading the same book, and I think it would be a great book for a discussion group to read. I will be looking for other books by the same author."},{"Title":"WILD GEESE CALLING","review":"A married couple living in turn of the century Seatle decide to liquidate thier assets to buy a sailboat they live on as they travel up the coast to frontier Alaska.

This book is basically a stroll through the patterns the author owns and a few tidbits and factoids. Half the pattern numbers don't have dates given. Values are pulled from thin air. 90% of patterns covered in this book are between 1940 and 1960. So it is not really a century of anything, but about 20 years of one person's collection. Still, I find myself using it as a reference, so I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"A century of American sewing patterns, 1860-1959: Identification and price guide","review":"I read the other review for \\"A Century of American Sewing Patterns\\", but I went ahead and bought it because there are so few books published on the topic. I sell antique and vintage sewing patterns, so I'm always looking for new resources.Unfortunately, this book is much worse than I expected; in fact, I would say it is nearly useless. The patterns are separated into categories by company name (Advance, New York, Simplicity, etc) and then by pattern number within each category. For each pattern, the author gives the pattern number, a very brief description (\\"blouse\\"), the date published, the original price, and the current value. Unfortunately, this information really doesn't tell you much.Value guides are notoriously difficult to create; as the author points out, values vary regionally and depend greatly on condition, and what's more, they're generally out of date within a few years. Therefore, the valuations should be ignored completely.A large number of the patterns have no attempt at a date - not even a decade. There are few photos included, so you can't confirm the author's dating. If you're trying to date a pattern in your own collection, this book won't help much. The final straw for me was on page 96, where there are photos of Simplicity #1251 and #1268, which the author has dated as 1920's patterns. In reality, they date from ca. 1933, a fact that is plain by the envelope style, the illustration style, and the fashions themselves. Why such a glaring error? The styles of 1933 look nothing like the styles of the 1920s, and if you're in doubt, fashion is easy to check through period magazines and pattern catalogues. I have to wonder how many of the other patterns are misdated, and that is why I say this book is nearly useless and I won't be using it.Much better books on the topic are \\"Blueprints of Fashion\\" by Wade Laboissonniere. Unfortunately, his books cover only the 1940s and 1950s, but they are much more thorough and reliable and include a wealth of photos. If you want to date patterns outside of those decades, invest in the \\"Everyday Fashions\\" books that Dover publishes. Each book analyzes a decade year by year, and you can easily date your patterns with the help of those books."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"Nora Chadwick is probably cited by every book on the Celts published since 1970. A lot of work has been done since then in archaeology and linguistics. Chadwick's view of the Celts is therefore a bit dated. She doesn't even examine Celtic architecture and technology in very great detail. It is now generally accepted that the Celts had a profound impact upon Roman technology and culture. The Romans didn't simply evict the Celts, but rather absorbed entire populations in Italy, Spain, Gaul, and Britain. Each absorption brought something new to the mixture. Each absorption drained the rich world of Celtic development of further resources. And current research shows that Chadwick's treatment of the Romans in the British isles is quite inadequate.This book is best considered as an introduction to the profound reconsiderations of Celtic history and prehistory which the late 20th century produced. Modern scholarship often attempts to extend Chadwick's work, but sometimes invalidates it. Her book was profound and evocative in its day, but it is now little more than a testimonial to the state of Celtic research a generation ago."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"I've heard a lot of criticism on this work: that is is confusing, jumbled, and out dated. But I personally have found it helpful in my studies, and enjoyable to read. However, for someone very new to the subject of the Celts, I'd recommend &quot;Exploring the World of the Celts&quot; by Simon James, instead.The book is fairly comprehensive, commenting on the many sub-groups of the peoples contained in the word &quot;Celtic&quot;. But herein lies the biggest flaw, in my opinion. It is all very well to recognize the Gauls, Galatians, Welsh, and Picts as Celtic, but there are differences in these groups that may have been overlooked too casualy in Chadwick's work. I've learned all too well, in the process of my own studies, that we cannot correctly assess certain characteristics as generally Celtic, nor can we judge one sub-group of the Celts by another. To do so is simply incorrect. We may make educated assumptions about the social structure of the Britons based on, for example, recorded i nformation from from Gaul, but this will not neccisarily be true. We can't assume that all Celts fought in mortal combat at feasts because Posedonius tells us that is a practice of the Gauls. And I think that this type of assessment is too common in Chadwick's work. Nevertheless, because I'm capable of picking instances like these out, for the most part, I wasn't hampered by the work.Anothe criticism of this book is that it is fairly unorganized. One paragraph may be talking about the Dalriadic Scots and next about the Welsh under Roman rule. In this sense, I wasn't able to use the book much for quick references, and I found myself knee-deep in only somewhat relevent information when looking for specific information.My last criticism of The Celts is the near total lack of citations and explanitory footnotes. I'm not fond of taking information on the author's word alone. Although, I suppose this is a fualt rather in the dating of the book, typical of other works put out in the same age. That does not excuse the many times I came to be asking myself about the source of the information Chadwick had given.Despite my criticisms I did find the book enjoyable, easy to read, and helpful. It is more the type of book I'd pick up to read to brush up, rather than the type of book I'd pick up for reference or for details on a specific subject. The most thourough and well explained chapter in the book seems to be &quot;The Celts in Europe&quot;. The intro by Barry Cunliff was also a nice addition."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"This is an excellent single-volume book on the Celts. It provides a great overview from prehistory on. I have enjoyed it so much I'm on my third reading. This new addition should add even more readers to it's admirers."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"Nora Chadwick gives us in this book an essential vision of what the Celts were. A great civilization, extremely advanced in crafts and arts, with a fully developed mythology of gods who were the masters of these crafts and arts. She gives us all the details she can find on this civilization : their level of development and any kind of metal work and the rich social order that went along with it. Dynamic agriculture, rich arts, a lot of commerce, great crafts and a religion that was based on those social values. Just for this reason, this book is essential. She should have insisted on the Celts' great underdevelopment as for warfare when confronted to the Romans. They were all warriors but were not able to fight against a professional army. They were individuals fighting to defend their own communities not mercenaries fighting to conquer and to loot. Some more recent research has been done on the Gauls and has revealed how those warriors were preparing for war. They were trying to build some unity through rites that made them share their most intimate feelings and fluids. A lot of research has also been done on the position of women showing that they were the doctors of this civilization, and hence were not reduced to a secondary and minimized status. They were full members of their society. This civilization was not mizogynistic, or phallocratic and certainly not homophobic. Their religion was also a set of rites that made all members of the society equal. Unluckily, the Romans, and even the Mediterraneans (Phenicians, Greeks and Romans) conquered them first through some commerce and then through military force. They destroyed this civilization and reduced it to slavery. And that was only the beginning. Christianisation was performed ruthlessly and all the culture, the arts, the mythology were destroyed by being forced into Christian rules. It is emblematic to see how the first christianisation of these people was destroyed later on to stick to the new Roman augustinian ideas, which meant a second deprivation of their culture by purifying the first Christian faith they had adopted of all the remnants or recollections of previous Celtic heritage. Some will say history cannot be repaired. Sure. But we must note that our Western civilization lost a tremendous amount of inspiration and human depth by this brutal colonialization. The Celts were dedicated to human and visionary values that we have lost. The Celts were dedicated to a real cult of nature and total respect for it. We are presently reinventing this respect for the natural environment. But we have to do this because the Mediterraneans destroyed it some twenty centirues ago. What a waste of time ! What a waste of energy ! Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"There are a lot of good things about this book. It also has some flaws. For example the presentation and organization of the book could have been better. All of the same I consider it a good introduction.

She wrote many books and articles on the topic and also delivered numerous lectures on the subject at renowned univesities throughout Great Britain.For a work of non-fiction, this is a very fluid read. The subject is compelling and, here, Chadwick has given us a full account of pretty much all that is known of this fascinating culture of people. The Celts essentially displaced and or assimilated into the indigenous culture(s) of Ireland. They originated in Europe and their eventual migration(s) to the Emerald Isle is still, to a large degree, a subject of endless study.Chadwick yields this essential history in terms and text that we can all follow. She punctuates her account with numerous bits of Celt trivia, such as: \\"...human sacrifice among the Celts, although of great ritual significance, may have been practised [Eng. sp.] more commonly at times of communal danger or stress, rather than as part of regular ritual observance.\\"Other interesting tidbits are more generally about Ireland and the today's Irish people who ultimately emanated from their ancient ancestors: \\"Irish ballads, unlike those of the rest of Europe, are hardly ever related in the third person... (the influence of \\"speech poems\\").My 1997 college thesis, for which the university awarded me a second-place spot for \\"Thesis of the Year,\\" focused upon the Celts. I relied heavily upon Chadwick as one of about 40 sources for that monograph and her coherence and credibility helped me greatly to see that voluminous project though to its successful conclusion.Anyone can read this book and come away with both an enhanced knowledge of a little-understood culture and a general gratification for having read a brilliantly competent work of non-fiction."},{"Title":"The Celts (Pelican books)","review":"The pictures are fine. But, this is a dated, poorly cited book. The chapters are choppy and incoherent in spots. There is no flow or chronological synthesis to this volume. Footnotes and a larger bibliography may have helped her case. The Celts were never a civilization. The word itself comes from the word for city.Even archaeology magazine stated these tribes did not have cities.The positive rev's of this book are grasping at wet straws.Stephen Oppenheimer, Bryan Sykes, Malcolm Chapman, Simon James, and John Collis have all written far more well researched books that detail the Celts as an 18th century creation of the Romantic movement.Neither this or even the far better Celtic books written by Barry Cunliffe have disproved the 5 authors I mentioned.In recent decades the Celts have been the most overomanticized, overated, and written about people of the ancient world.

The highlight of this novel is Philo and what makes her tick. She's one of those characters who will warm a person's heart, leaving an impression upon the reader and making her very unlikely to forget.Her circumstances in life are not great. She has just run away from her husband and children to seek comfort at a convent, pretending to be a single woman without children. She tries to talk her way into the convent by claiming she has always wanted to be a nun. The tattoos on her body as well as her large size and gruff attitude make them a little nervous at first, but the nuns take her in, at least temporarily.Appearances are often deceiving, and it is so with Philo. Her outward appearance may be that of a tough, crude woman, but in reality she has a heart of gold. Despite her personal problems, Philo finds ways to make others happy. She's a wonderful nurturer, and although not all of the nuns at the convent warm up to her right away, she eventually finds her way into everyone's heart --- at the convent and anywhere she goes.Philo has many vices. She's a chain smoker, and living at the convent means that no smoking is allowed. She sneaks the cigarettes with the help of Sister Rosaleen, a nun who takes Philo under her wing, despite the disapproval of some of the other nuns. Philo and Sister Rosaleen bond and become good friends and co-conspirators at the convent, making for some very funny scenes throughout the novel.Philo's other vice is food. Her mother has taught her that eating will always make her feel better. So if she's unhappy, she eats --- and she eats a lot. As Philo's weight approaches three hundred pounds, it is safe to say that food is always on her mind. Sneaking in bacon and eggs in the middle of the night while the rest of the world sleeps, or eating a handful of candy bars to pass the time, is a daily occurrence. She eats all she can during the wee hours of the morning, and then sleeps the food off in the morning. It is her way of coping with the many worries of her world.Her main source of concern is her husband Tommo. He constantly berates her in front of the children, and has given her a black eye or two. Yet, when Philo runs away from him and the family, he always comes back to her, begging her to return, telling her that he's lonely and needs her. When Philo runs away this time, she refuses to return, despite the fact that Tommo has gotten rid of the children and placed them in an orphanage. Philo knows that the children are better off without their parents, yet she misses them so much. However, she thinks it's best that she stay in the convent to keep her children and herself safe from Tommo.In the meantime, Philo's life is now centered on the convent. During the day she helps out at a senior citizens center, where she and the nuns help prepare food. With love and inspiration, Philo performs miracles at the center, creating new life and energy among the elderly, giving them newfound happiness. She gets them involved in Bingo, with the help of Sister Rosaleen, as well as a crazy game called Blind Date. From here, a subplot emerges --- that of the love story of two elderly persons at the center, Cap Coyle and Dina Sugrue, who have known each other for decades but have been sworn enemies due to a history that involves Cap's best friend Gerry, who later became Dina's husband.Philo's life takes on new meaning as she helps out at the Senior Center, visits her children when she can, and plays matchmaker with Cap and Dina. But once again, Tommo reappears in her life, and it's not good.One cannot say enough about EVERY INCH OF HER. It is beautifully written, told with a touch of humor. Sheridan does a good job at describing life in the North Wall, which can be hard, but there are plenty of friends and family to help one get through the day. It is a tale of one person's desire to survive, to find happiness, and to overcome insecurities and demons from the past.

Peter Sheridan creates a lovable character in Philo, who despite all her problems, makes sure that everyone around her is happy and being taken care of.In the first chapter, Philo arrives at a local convent, seeking a place to stay. She has left her husband and children, but does not tell this to the nuns. She lets them believe she's a single woman wanting to become one of them. The nuns, however, find it hard to believe, especially by looking at Philo's huge body covered with tattoos, and hearing that between every few sentences are uttered a foul word. Philo keeps forgetting that nuns do not swear.She also forgets that nuns do not smoke, and Philo is a chain smoker. She is also a compulsive eater, and at close to 250 pounds, she still cannot seem to stop. She eats to help forget her own problems, that of her abusive husband, the children she has left behind, and her past, which she wishes no one to find out about.Philo is not one to give up, however. She always makes the best of a situation, and now that she lives at the convent, she does her best to fit in by helping out. Her crowning achievement is helping out at the senior citizen's center, and between herself and her new best friend Sister Rosaleen, they get the seniors blood stirring with a few rowdy games of bingo and a game of BLIND DATE.All good things do come to an end and Tommo, Philo's husband, tracks her down at the convent.

An unpopular man is dead and there are a host of people with motives - but none with an obvious opportunity.

When Ms. Christie finally picks someone as the murderer, she rounds off all the rest as impossible suspects. But really, the same can be done for any of them, then round off all the rest.

Hope I can write like her someday"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"As a teen, I made my way through nearly all of Agatha Christie's novels, starting first with those featuring Miss Marple and later moving on to Hercule Poirot. I never realized that they had a particular order; rather, I began with \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\", as it was immediately at hand, and worked my way through based on what was available at the local library. At this point, as I go back to re-read the favorites from many years ago, I'm attempting to do them in order, if only to satisfy my curiosity as to how audiences originally received these books. Therefore, I'm starting with \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\", the first Miss Marple mystery and, in many ways, different from how this unlikely heroine would become.The story is told completely from the viewpoint of Reverand Clements, a rector at the parish in the hamlet of Saint Mary Mead. When a hated member of the community is found shot in his study, the Clements is sure that there is more to the mystery than meets the eye. Two separate individuals have confessed to the crime, and, though the deceased was not liked by anyone, he is sure that neither suspect is actually guilty. In his attempt to get to the bottom of the problem, he ends up with help from his neighbor, Miss Jane Marple, an elderly spinster with an uncanny knack for seeing through people and observing things most miss.While \\"The Murder at the Vicarage\\" is definitely bumpy in spots, it's obvious that, even early on, Christie was able to build in the element of surprise. Unlike her contemporary Dorothy L. Sayers, she created a mystery at once puzzling and with characters that, though later fleshed-out more, grab your attention right from the start.

Miss Marple seems to see everything and pop up just when the inspector is ready to work. The ending is not obvious and the entire story is easy to read. Thank goodness for Agatha Christie and Miss Marple!"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I am an Agatha Fan from 'way back, and was i ever surprised to find this book in THIS format!I am buying up all of the other illustrated books available, in my price range....They are a lot of fun!However, one should try to read the ORIGINAL books FIRST....this should be the &#34;dessert!!&#34;"},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"I've always enjoyed mysteries on television (I grew up watching Murder, She Wrote with my mom), and the last few years I've delved into Agatha Christie's books a bit. By far, I'm most fond of Miss Marple, among her characters, and this is the spinster's introductory novel.It's set in first-person narrative format, from the perspective of the Vicar - this was slightly odd to me at first, but I think it ends up being just fine, as, in addition to his thoughts on Miss Marple herself, we get some of the Vicar's not-always-christian thoughts on other characters.While it's not a terribly long book (I read it in two nights), there was sufficient intrigue that I was left guessing as to most of the mystery until the grand reveal. Overall, an quite enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The plot is ingenious and the story, of course, is very well written and it certainly gives the reader clear insights into the &#34;social&#34; of those days."},{"Title":"The Murder at the Vicarage","review":"The very first Miss Marple.
