If you've never read the original (or haven't since junior high), do yourself a favor and pick it up. You'll be amazed how relevant some of the social criticism from over 150 years ago seems, not to mention how funny Dickens' wry wit can be.There's a reason this story has stuck around for a century and a half, and it's not the admirable efforts of the like of Alistair Sim, George C.

A Christmas Carol should ideally be read. After you have read the book you should buy this audio rendition. Geoffrey Palmer is not only an excellent actor but has a terrific voice for narration. Dicken's has a way with words that makes it easy to the reader/listener to imagine the setting. Palmer builds on this with his rendition of the story, where you can truly experience the old fashioned dickensian christmas era. Unlike other narrators that summarize this classic, Palmer reads straight from the novel so if you have the book you can follow line by line. The story is told across two audio tapes. I noticed that amazon.co.uk has just released this rendition on CD, so hopefully the CD will be available in the US soon."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dover Thrift Editions of Charles Dickens Christmas Classic, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is short and to the point. My kind of book. The world over knows the premise of Dickens classic but (especially) at this time of year is a story most people will enjoy reading again. The slim 68 pages makes it possible to share this story with a love one in less than an hour. Puts even the most hateful love one in the holiday spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This slim volume is an example of Victorian literature at its finest. Dickens' literary voice croons with the tempo of the story, dark and foreboding as the ghosts escort Scrooge on his journey and upbeat and merry as he reforms his ways. It is a story of hope in the human spirit, urging you not to give up on people, not to count them out because they may surprise you. Although I doubt that many a moral eyesore can be transformed so easily and heartily as Scrooge, Dickens artfully exploited the marshmallowy feeling many experience during the Christmas season, which makes this a believable and much loved story.Dickens immersed Victorian themes in many ways and with great skill. The worship of children as innocent creatures was apparent in the way that Tiny Tim was glorified. His pitiful image and heart of gold appeal to our senses as well as it did to the Victorians.A thirst for the supernatural was quenched through the use of the three spirits. They are not exactly Christian in nature, yet they seek to do good. This secular flirtation could indicate that Victorians' faith was being shaken and in its place a value system based on choosing favorable Christian principles and disregarding the rest. As is human tendency, we do not usually care about anything until it is almost gone (such as endangered species), and when Christian faith was questioned, interest began to percolate in the Victorians. I believe we still like basic Christian ideals, but going to church is asking for a lot. We continue to have more of an interest in phantoms than angels.Also integrated was the belief that the middle class is more virtuous because they work for their money. Bob Cratchit did not need moral instruction; Scrooge, an old miser, did. It teaches that sacrifices made for money will be costly. Scrooge lost a woman who loved him by being greedy. She dismissed him regretfully; \\"You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond its sordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you\\" (Dickens 37). This theme is timeless as a recent movie, Family Man, heavily drew upon it as a successful businessman who had discarded the fancies of a wife and children, woke up one morning to having both and realized he had been in error. The Victorians and many contemporary Americans ache to believe that the pursuit of wealth is not as fulfilling as two hands with wedding bands clasped and changing dirty diapers. Whether or not this is accurate I cannot say because I have neither.Dickens was a Victorian mastermind and he knew what Christmas was all about. It is about looking for the best in people and the world. It is one time that it is okay to be cheesy, okay to be touched by stories of hope and love. So next Christmas, when the snow falls like sugar and the sentimental tears fall like rain, pick up A Christmas Carol and watch the Victorians come out of the woodwork. They look a lot like us and this is why Dickens' novel has survived."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book was really good.

The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. (...) I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...)The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.MAybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself.

Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears. The movie showed little events than what the book showed. The said part is that many people are just like the Scrooge here today in the United States. On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to. To Charles Dickens you should get an award for this piece of work. I think all ages will enjoy this book and maybe someday we will all change and not be so mean to others.

I really hope the boy I bought it for is enjoying it because I hated to give it away!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the stories I really wanted to share with my children this season was A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. The children I particularly wanted to read this with were my 7-year-old daughter, and 8 and 11-year-old sons. While I wanted them to know the story of Ebeneezer Scrooge and his change of heart, I knew that the unabridged original version would probably be a bit much for my daughter to take in, and require a lot of explanations regarding the archaic language for my sons. So for us, The Great Illustration version of A Christmas Carol was perfect.This version has illustrations on just about every page, which was particularly important for my very visual younger children. This version stayed true to the original as I remembered it and kept the personality of Scrooge, from bitter old man to renewed and invigorated redeemed soul intact!I also felt that the use of modern English was not a disservice to the original. While reading about the death of Tiny Tim, I felt the same amount of emotion and pain as reading the original. In fact as my voice cracked and the tears started to well my little son, who is just beginning to truly appreciate the subtle nuances that make for a good reading said, \\"Great expression, mom!\\"I have read some of the reviews of other books in this series as being too watered down, and that may be. But for this particular age group, I think this book in particular fills a special need.

Such as Scrooge's emotions being quickened by the past heartache in his childhood; seeing how his bad choices caused the hardening of his heart and how deeply it cost him in the end; seeing what could have been his to enjoy and then thinking it could still be his with the Spirit of Christmas Present only to find out the future does not hold any love or joy for him by the Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come and instead his actions leave him robbed at death and no one left to grieve for him.

Will Scrooge learn this lesson in time to save himself?This is a story with which most of us are familiar. There are countless adaptations in the form of children's books, movies, and abridged texts, so I am quite familiar with the story. However, I have never actually read the complete original text. Imagine my surprise when I found such elegance and beauty in Dickens' original words. This coming from me, someone who does not always have the greatest appreciation of Dickens.I have always loved this story, and found the message so deeply touching. I have so much empathy for Scrooge as a character, have suffered a lonely childhood and gone without real happiness his whole adult life.

These are infrequent and do not detract from the story - in fact, it adds charm and authenticity. Better than having some editor arbitrarily determining what you should read and what should be cut out. I believe the Amazon price for this book was $12.00 - an amazing bargain.

I haven't played it yet, but I have had some of them before, and to be honest, I don't think I would have bothered within this edition of A Christmas Carol if I'd known, as the quality of recording and reading of these leave a lot to be desired.Having said that, if your not bothered about the audiobook, don't forget the illustrations as they ARE included and have been taken from the original book, which I think was published in 1843, but whether this particular book and it's illustrations are from that edition, I cannot tell.

These are the letters, words, sentences, paragraphs that made Christmas the celebration that it is today - the family parties, the feasts, the excitement, giving to the poor. Virtually every way we celebrate this magnificent Holiday (except the mall part!) comes from this book written by Charles Dickens.First off, this is the unabridged version. Nothing added - nothing taken away. That's as it should be. (Unfortunately, as great as they may be, the movie versions truly do not do the book justice - although I must say the George C. Scott and Alistair Sim versions do come fairly close).One thing that surprises me about this book is how few people I know that have have actually read it, but they've seen one version or another of the movie countless times! They don't seem to realize that when books are put to film, so much is taken out for length or for other reasons. A Christmas Carol is no different. In fact, if you watch all of the different movie versions available, you STILL would not get the complete book, even though each movie adds one thing or another from the original story that the others may not.There are countless copies of this story available in various book form, but this particular version is probably one of the best that I have seen. The illustrations attempt in some part to keep in the same spirit as in Dickens' original. But the best, most interesting part of this version (besides the story itself) is all of the little facts, explanations, and trivia put into the margins throughout this book. They give the modern 21st century reader more of an understanding of what 19th century English life was like. A couple of examples: when Dickens writes of the Cratchit family taking their goose to the bakers to be cooked, I wondered why would any one take their food OUT to be cooked and then picked up later. This book explains that few poor people in this time period had ovens large enough to roast a good family sized bird. They were big enough to cook a small bit of meat and that was about it. In order to have one of those rare Holiday meals, they had to take it to the large baker's oven at an appointed time for cooking.Another fact I did not know was that in the story, Scrooge's sister, Fan, was based on Dickens' actual sister in law, Mary Hogarth.There are also a multitude of paintings, drawings, and sketches from Dickens' time showing his time. Now you can see, as accurately as one can considering there were no cameras, life of the rich, middle class, and poor as it actually was. There's a picture of Queen Victoria and her family celebrating Christmas. There is also a beautiful painting of a poor labourer's family Christmas celebration. There are sketches from the first edition of 'A Christmas Carol.'If you plan on owning a copy of this most wonderful of all Christmas novels, this is the version to get."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I'll not insult you all by describing the action of this classic novella, nor belabor the lesson taught. I'm sure even Mowgli the Jungle Boy must have heard this story once a year growing up in the jungle. But with all the TV and movie and cartoon and Muppet iterations (the best of which remains the 1951 Alastair Sim movie version), when's the last time you went back and actually read the original book?Dickens is, of course, a wonderful author and earlier generations read everything that he wrote. Today, however, you read an obligatory novel or two in High School, breath a sigh of relief that's over and then blithely ignore him along with the rest of the ancients. But, as a reacquaintance with A Christmas Carol will remind you, he remains pretty accessible and his novels are often quite fun. What's more, there's even a Reading Version (available online) of the story that Dickens condensed himself for his numerous public readings of the tale. It's perfect for reading aloud to the family.Here's just a sample of the prose to entice you:On Scrooge before: Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge. a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.and Scrooge after: Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him.He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!We, all of us, have a tendency to let the classics become so encrusted that we take them for granted and forget how good they really are; if this has happened for you with A Christmas Carol, do yourself a favor and dig out a copy and reread it this Holiday Season. I bet it becomes an annual tradition.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life. Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'.If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings. I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have always loved this story and read it every year.

Easy to read -- only drawback of course is the free version contains no images/drawings. But if all you want are the words as a reminder or something to check a quote, then this version is perfect.

For some reason I've put off reading it for years, and now that I've read it, I wonder why. It was a delightful tale of the joy that Christmas can bring to our lives.

A must for any library!!!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's still the greatest. I've been rereading this since I was a child, and it never grows stale. We're in the middle of a heat wave and I decided to reread it just to cool off, and was as charmed by this classic tale as ever. What I noticed more in this reading, though, was the gentle humor. In the past, I focused more on the negativity of Scrooge and his redemption. This time, I focused on the humor, from almost slapstick to sarcastic, that Dickens infused throughout. For such a short story, it's really packed, and the language is a wonderful refreshment after today's crisp writing style. I know that Dickens was paid by the word, but he didn't waste a single one. If you have a child who can read at 6th grade level, who is stuck on low-level series, try them out on this.

I did enjoy the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, it is a very famous and well known story, so i didn't really have to focus on what was happening and instead I focused on the beauty of the writing. I see why Dickens was so famous and I will be reading some more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"After many years of watching the different versions of a Christmas Carol, I came across this version. It was free, and I thought it would be a novel idea to READ the book this past year and not just watch a movie. What a thrill it was! It is often said, \\"the book is better than the movie.\\", and likewise this is so true! This book captures the essences so much more than any version I have ever seen. Though, in my opinon, the Christmas Carol starring George C Scott is the closest to this orginal writing. The book was so enjoyable, it has me downloading other classics that we tend to default to movie versions. Little Women, here I come!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens's classic novel, A Christmas Carol, is his most famous and beloved story. Millions around the globe have read this touching book, about brotherly love and charity, since it was first published. Countless people have seen Ebenezer Scrooge, the selfish and unkind man, transform in to a kind and generous person by the visits of four mysterious ghosts.The story begins in the afternoon of a frigid Christmas Eve, as a mean-spirited man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his office. Scrooge is a cold-hearted and selfish miser, who isn't in the spirit of Christmas. Every so often, he shouts, \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" He doesn't even buy coal for the fireplace, so he and his clerk freeze away. No one likes him, and no one stands up to him. Dickens describes him thus: \\"No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\\" However, this is exactly what Scrooge wants - to be in his own world.Dickens starts out the story by stating that Scrooge's former partner, Jacob Marley, is dead. Then, he reverts back to what Scrooge is up to. As it is Christmas Eve, Scrooge isn't happy. He scares all the carolers away, and refuses to donate money to the poor. When the day is finally over, he goes back to his house, and tries to go to sleep. As he locks the door, he sees an apparition. There is Jacob Marley's ghost - looking right at him! Scrooge is shocked at first, and still is shocked when Marley's phantom tells him some surprising news. The ghost explains that there will be three other ghosts yet to come: the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Then, he leaves.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. The ghost of the past shows Scrooge how he used to be. Scrooge discovers that his life was somewhat pleasant, but still lonely. The ghost of the present reveals to Scrooge his more recent attitude toward Christmas. It shows Scrooge the consequences of his actions, most of which are to Scrooge's dislike. The ghost also informs Scrooge how other people are celebrating. Dancing, playing blind man's buff, and caroling aren't part of Scrooge's world for certain. The ghost of the future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him; actually everyone is happy that he is gone. Meanwhile, all of these visions have Scrooge sobbing in tears and he is finally ready to make changes in his life. After the final ghost leaves, Scrooge runs about his little town donating money, greeting people, and visiting his nephew and clerk's family. It turns out to be a very happy Christmas after all.I liked A Christmas Carol very much. Charles Dickens's style is very descriptive. I especially liked the vivid verbs and adjectives Dickens used when he described Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, gasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!\\" As for Scrooge, I liked him a lot. The book was funny when he said something completely nonsensical like \\"Bah!\\" or \\"Humbug!\\" On a scale of one through ten, I would give A Christmas Carol a ten. It was enjoyable and interesting to read, especially over winter break, as it heartens the spirit of Christmas itself."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is the book to read if you ever need to get in the Christmas spirit. Everybody goes through the holidays and becomes a &quot;scrooge&quot; at least once during the season. Though we aren't as bad as Ebenezer, we still need the realization of the Christmas spirit to set us right again. Reading the classic story of Ebenezer's adventures with the three Christmas spirits will bring warmth and happiness back into our hearts. It will be easier to give and be gracious, we will be grateful for everything we have, and we will remember what Christmas is all about. Thanks to Dickens for writing a masterpiece especially for this time of year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a truly remarkable story. Though this is a Christmasstory, there is no religious thing and it reminds us what trulyimportant is. You can find out your own heart warmingChristmas memory with Scrooge.

I won't go into the plot, because I'm sure everybody knows the concept of this book. I've seen so many television and movie versions of A Christmas Carol, that I decided to sit down and read the original, and I'm sure glad I did. Not only does this book have a great lesson to it, but it is also beautifully written. I think everyone should read this book - and not just at Christmas time. Sure, the story takes place at Christmas, but it's a great book to read any time. I highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is Charles Dickens' best christmas story. Only David Copperfield tops this story. Mr. Dickens teaches the reader that no matter how much money or position we have, no matter how important we feel, no matter how much cynicism we have, life will come right out in front of us with a big wham!! Tiny Tim is compassion, Mr. Cratchit is hope, Fizziwigg is happiness. And all these things are life at its best. A Christmas Carol is the true feeling and hope and love. Make this short story your hope."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is about an old bitter man named Scrooge, who in decades has not showed any compassion to any living creature for uncountable years. Ebenezer Scrooge owns a firm called Scrooge and Marley - Jacob Marley being his business partner and sole confidant who passed away years ago. On the night of Christmas Eve, while preparing to retire from his busy workday, he hears boisterous noises and frustrated and frightened answers simply by Bah! Humbug's! Marley's ghost, tied to heavy chains, appears in front of the stupefied Scrooge and alerts him that three ghosts will be visiting him that night and he must follow and obey them in order for him not to suffer the same consequence as his partner Marly. That night all of the three visit and show him his past, present, and future. Scrooge, alarmed from his future outcome changes to become the caring, charitable, and socially conscious man he was years before. Christmas morning he shocks everyone around with his Christmas spirit. Later that morning he gives Bob Cratchit - worker of Scrooge - the honor of being his equal partner in the firm and gives Cratchit's children the best Christmas they'd ever been the witness to.I enjoyed A Christmas Carol very much, I give this piece of Charles Dickens work five stars because it is a heart warming, extremely well written novel that anyone and everyone should read in their lifetime."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The story A Christmas Carol written by Charles Dickens was a great story to read. My favorite part was at the end when the ghost of Christmas yet to come scared Scrooge. That ghost was also my favorite character. It took place in England. In the beginning of the story, Scrooge was being mean to all the people at his job. He went home and was having a bowl of soup when he heard chains rattling. He looked at the door and it flung open and Marly's ghost came through the door. The ghost explained he was going to be visited by three spirits. In the middle of the night the first ghost came the ghost of Christmas past. He showed him all the things he did wrong to other people. All of a sudden he awoke in bed and thought it was all a dream until the second ghost came. It was the ghost of Christmas present he showed Scrooge how poor all the other families were because of him and all of a sudden he woke up in bed again. The clock struck and another ghost appeared. He was the ghost that Scrooge was scared of the most. He showed Scrooge all the horrible things that happen and he shows Scrooge's employee. He goes to Cratchit's house and has a party. To conclude the story A Christmas Carol was an exciting story to read and you should read this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"You will be haunted by Three Spirits.&quot; So forewarns Jacob Marley's ghost to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser of stingy, unfavorable traits. And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed.

Very much. It preserves the poignancy of lost time and redemption that is at the heart of Scrooge's story - even more than a religious message. Dickens addresses the reader directly, and there is more humor than most adaptations show.This edition has an interesting account of the first time Dickens read the story to a general audience - the beginning of Dickens' career in performing his work which proved almost as lucrative as the mere writing of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I was impressed with the quality of the book for the money. Looks great on the end table during Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I give this five stars as much for its compact form as its literary value. To write a compelling story in 300 pages is difficult, but certainly possible; to weave a complex tale in under 100 requires much greater skill. Dickens does just that, drawing you in with a sparseness of prose that is wonderful. Over-explanation has been excised, and we the reader benefit.Having seen at least five variations on this story, I was surprised at just how simple the source material was. Clean, clear, subtle, and leaving far more to imagination than description, this was a wonderful Christmas read. What else is there to say? It's Dickens in under 100 pages; this is not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This story has become an icon for Christmas. The story is well known, but I realized sitting in the new movie with Jim Carrie, I had never read the story itself. How could I judge a movie or play without knowing the written original? There is no way a true critique of a movie or play could be done without having a passing knowledge of the original, especially, since the orginal was presented as a written story.The new movie does follow the written word closely. The plays do not, but they try and do a good job of getting the jist of the story.As for the story, I find it a bit to goody, goody. Scrooge would not turn his life around so thoroughly from such a night of dreams. He is who he is and has been for a very long time. 'Old habits die hard' is not just an old saying. Scrooge has been thinking his frugal thoughts for most of his life and I just do not think he would be able to change so radically so fast. Another problem is Tiny Tim. He may be lovable, but what would move Scrooge to feel so sorry for him? He sees him for only a moment, would it be enough in reality?These questions are irrelevant, but I had them, so I thought I would voice them."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, in my opinion, is one of the most perfect stories of all time.

It provides an excellent refresher on the life and times of Charles Dickens, without hitting the reader over the head with an outrageous data-dump of factoids that contribute nothing to your enjoyment of the author and his story.This book would be a well-appreciated gift for any fan of Dickens. Even if you own another version of A Christmas Carol, this affordable and portable history belongs in your collection."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"We have long loved this book. I was charged by my family to find a good copy, beautiful and legendary, to replace the hardback collection we picked up used somewhere many years ago.

His Scrooge is mean, troubled and seemingly irredeemable but as Mr. Winters makes his way through the story he shows us a quite complex and interesting portrait of the infamous miser. Just so you know there is a female actress to do the female parts and there is music and sound effects throughout the story to make it well paced and impossible to take your ears off of it. Although I don't want to give too much away Mr. Winters gives a Ghost Of Christmas Present with a Scottish accent! This is a wonderful way to help celebrate Christmas!I never thought I'd find something to rival Patrick Stewart's one man show, but this is a thoroughly entertaining production especially considering the \\"reader\\" is American!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A holiday staple in my home, I re-read it every year.

The ability to rapidly look up some of the older Victorian English words and phrases with the built-in Kindle dictionary made reading it even more enjoyable. Plus, who can argue with the price (free)!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" represents not only Charles Dickens' most memorable work. but perhaps the most perfectly plotted story in the history of literature. What other tale has been retold so often, in movies, cartoons, etc.? The heart warming ending never loses its charm, and even for a jaded public that now largely shuns morality plays, the timeless message always finds a receptive audience.Because of the brevity of this story, which is not one of Dickens' colossal novels, the deep complexity of the characters is slightly lacking, as is the terrific humor found in his longer works. Still, the master managed to create a man that everyone can understand, and give him a believable history in comparably few pages. He also bestowed an unforgettable name upon him, that melded seamlessly with his personality.This story can still inspire, and lift the spirits of any reader. What more could we possibly ask of any writer?"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Its amazing to get many classic stories for free and getting them through amazon and reading them on your kindle is not only easy, its easy to read and the way things are going to go. The story was classic and I highly suggest downloading as many of the free classics as possible."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"First of all I have to observe that Charles Dickens was born almost two hundred years ago, minus one year. That is just amazing! The man was taken out of school before he was eleven and yet managed to begin publishing his work at twenty-one, and finally being able to turn around the course of his family's debt at the age of thirty when he published this book. There's something to be learned from his life as well as from this book.For those of you not familiar with the book, it is a story about a man named Ebenezer Scrooge, who is a miserly individual who, one Christmas-Eve Night is visited by the ghost of his long dead partner Jacob Marley. His partner is there to tell him that he will be visited by three ghosts, (the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Christmases Yet to Come) in order to show him the error of his stingy and cold ways.The images Mr. Dickens produces with his words are astounding. I could see the night sky swimming with forlorn spirits bemoaning the good they never did in life! My heart ached for the girl realizing the man she loved was no longer the man before her. I laughed at the Christmas antics of Fred's guests, and felt the pain of a parent loosing their child when the ghost showed it to Scrooge. It moved me as only a truly talented author can move a reader, despite the century and decades separating our lives. Though it is writen in the third person, the author engages the reader personally, speaking to you and giving his own personal opinion on a subject. It was the first time I've observed that kind of writing to be honest. For example when discribing Scrooge's nephew at Christmas the author writes that if you should know someone more blessed in a laugh than Fred, to introduce them and the narrator would cultivate the friendship.I have to say that all the Christmas Specials on T.V. can not compare to reading the original work. The adaptations do well, but so much has to be left out or changed!Admittedly, his way of spinning a sentence is much different from today. There are times I had to re-read a sentence or two to understand it better, not because it was written badly, but because the speech of the day has changed. I found it a pleasant challenge though, and not too daunting in the long run cause he makes his world so vivid with life and action, you can see it all and even if the words said aren't exactly clear, the overall idea of what is going on is clear.Not surprising, I would give this a five-star review! It is well written, has vivid images, believable characters, and flows well. I would highly recommend it, but maybe caution the reader to have a dictionary on hand for any words that might be unclear. Without one, I'm afraid the reader might find it more of a challenge than they thought. I look forward to reading it again when Christmas time rolls around again, and maybe even before if I have the time!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Each Christmas I enjoy seeing again the several versions of this Dickens short novel. I read the work along with all of Dickens' other fiction, in a 10 volume gift set received 40 years ago, but long since lost in house movings. When I noticed A Christmas Carol in among the Kindle free book offerings, it was time to revisit this lovely classic. God bless them, every one of the faithful who convert these works to digital format! Get it and read it in installments to your grandkids. Who knows? You may revive the art of reading aloud among friends and family!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I try to read Dickens' Christmas Carol every year during the week of Christmas. It's always worth it.I read it this year while waiting at an airport in the middle of the night during a snowstorm the day after Christmas.The story always seems fresh to me. And haunting. And inspirational.It's a cool way to end the year with reflection on how we lived up to that point and also to begin the new year as we ponder how we want to live going forward.Get this book. It's free. And it's good, moving, Christmas literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"For many years, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, has been considered a classic Christmas novel. In America, people are becoming increasingly busy and more concerned with themselves around Christmas time. The spirit of Christmas is making its way out of the American culture and becoming a distant memory. A central theme in \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the renewal of this spirit as depicted in the life of the main character Ebeneezer Scrooge.The setting for A Christmas Carol is in London, England during the 19th century. At the time, England was undergoing an industrial revolution. Money was to be made! I feel such is the case today as technology is revolutionizing the way business is run in today's society. The main character, Ebeneezer Scrooge, is a money dealer who, along with his business partner Jacob Marley, gave loans to various people and institutions needing financial assistance. Over the years and after the death of his business partner, the love of money hardened the heart of this once cheerful man. I was reminded, while reading, how money hardens people's heart is found in the world today. Scams are becoming an increasingly popular topic in the news. Truly, money is the root of all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Throughout the course of this book, Scrooge experiences a change of heart while he reviews Christmas memories and once again discovers what it is like to feel and live the Christmas spirit. As I read this book, I felt that desire--the desire to rediscover what it feels like to live the Christmas spirit. While reading this book, I felt the emptiness that comes when one is focused solely inward during the Christmas season and the joy comes when the spirit of Christmas motivates one to lift and serve others.I am a lover of good literature. Recently, I have noticed myself becoming busier during the Christmas season than in past years. While reading of Scrooges' Christmas memories, I couldn't help but put myself in his shoes. By so doing, the spirit of Christmas returned to my life. What a difference that made in my enjoyment of the Christmas season! I recognized what was truly important--remembering Christ by serving others. This book is a great read for anyone; especially those who feel they have lost the Christmas spirit and have the desire to rekindle it again."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Reading Dickens was hard at first, but he is a wonderful story teller.

Doesn't have the right \\"feel\\" (e.g., not calling the \\"Staves\\" \\"Staves'!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Aside from the Bible, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol is probably the most familiar and well-known book ever published. Scores of film adaptations have been made over the years, taking Dickens' story of one man's redemption to all the corners of the globe. The name Ebenezer Scrooge immediately brings to mind the miserly curmudgeon whose life and very nature were radically changed after the visitation of four ghosts one early Christmas morning. Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former partner, returns in spirit form to warn Scrooge of the ponderous chain he is forging in life by his penny-pinching, selfish, Christmas-hating ways. Then, of course, the ghosts of Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas future come to call for an increasingly troubled soul who comes to see the worthlessness of his purely materialistic life. A Christmas Carol offers a truly amazing character study. Scrooge, this seemingly incorrigible fellow, quickly becomes a sympathetic character as we view the circumstances of his life. From a lonely boy rejected by his father (who blames him for the death of his wife in childbirth), we see a sensitive soul, one quite capable of feeling and expressing both happiness and love, grow greedy and cold, shutting even the woman he loves out of his life. Completely broken down by the scenes revealed by the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge's transformation is remarkably real and powerful.Little need be said about this timeless classic, as it is a story virtually everyone knows in some detail. The message is clear to all of us, as well. Dickens, the social conscience of the 19th century, illustrates the humanity and worth of even the lowliest of society's members and casts the harsh light of truth on those with the means but not the desire to help their fellow man, giving new life to the clich&eacute; &quot;you can't take it with you.&quot; Dickens briefly alludes to the religious aspects of the holiday, but he vividly evokes the true and rightful spirit of Christmas in humanistic terms. This is a timeless story that will forever be a part of each Christmas season. Not only does it impart lessons of the highest order, it never fails to charm and delight you no matter how many times you have previously read the story (and watched the movie adaptations) over the years."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The vocabulary was exelent.

It didn't turn out to be the case. Admittedly I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens' books and consider David Copperfield one of my favorite books, I felt A Christmas Carol a drastic departure from author's usual style. What I noticed the most in the book is the usage of the many five dollar words (This might be the reason, I realize now, that there are alternate versions of the story and especially in abridged form). Not only those words made the book difficult to read, they helped to provide detachment for me from enjoying the story and being immersed in the tale. What is worse, I simply didn't like the story all that much because I felt my motivation to be lacking when Ebenezer Scrooge was hand-picked for the journey. Thinking of the kind of a person he is, why can't a worthier person be selected? That's why I prefer the tale of It's a Wonderful Life over A Christmas Carol, and it did happen to a better person than Scrooge. One worst part about A Christmas Carol is the force to love Christmas to death. I am not too keen about this approach because it feels too religious in the wrong way. Then again, the entire book was too religious for my taste with a lot of overtones in a spiritual sense. Charles Dickens also gives poverty a role in A Christmas Carol, but I didn't like the part where a character is judged by how he views money as he sees fit. All in all, I found A Christmas Carol a disappointing read, and all of the characters were unmemorable for me."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Before reading A Christmas Carol, I automatically gave the book the highest regard probably because I was influenced by the Disney's movie version, at least that's what I thought the book will be like.

When Scrooge is revisited by a ghost friend he is warned about the three ghosts that will come. The ghosts come and take him many places and show him all the wrong he has done to others.

It's light, fun, sad, and presents an important message about Christmas. During this time of rampant commercialism and long lists to Santa, it's easy to forget that the greatest joys of Christmas come from the giving. This book illustrates the euphoria that Scrooge feels when he finally is able to give gifts, either of time, money, food, or whatever, to other people. Christmas is not about what you can get...it's about what you can give. If you want a story that will remind you of the real meaning of Christmas, this is it! In terms of story-telling, this book has classic Dickensian characters and ample humor and drama, making it a classic in its own right. If I had any criticism, it would be that the story seems to wander a bit and move even a little too fast. But it really doesn't take too much away from the experience."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for myself so that I could enjoy this timeless Christmas tale over the holidays.

A classic story and a must read. 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Every Christmas I say I will reread A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, and this past Christmas I actually did it.Nobody needs reminding of the story of A Christmas Carol. We all know the tale of Scrooge and his visits by the Ghost of Christmas Present, the Ghost of Christmas Past and the Ghost of Christmas Future. Even for those who have never read the book, the story has been retold in many different forms and at least three versions make their appearance on our television screens each Christmas.So why has this little tale proved to be so popular? I think it's because Scrooge is such a memorable character and we all know someone we like to think of as a Scrooge. And, let's be honest, we would like them to change. A Christmas Carol touches the desires of all of us to show people what they are really like and have them change for the better. And Scrooge is also one of those characters that seem to be likeable even when they're easy to dislike.I think this book is still worth reading, even though we know the story. It is a very small book. I read it in its entirety on Christmas Eve. It is also very easy to read. Some classics, I feel, are difficult for the modern reader because our tastes and expectations are different from those of the past. But because A Christmas Carol was written quickly by Dickens, and kept short, it will pose no problems to readers of today.Besides being a great tale, A Christmas Carol also gives us an insight into the way Christmas was celebrated in Victorian society.

Most of the class had never heard of The Christmas Carol, so I was excited to share it with them. I used study materials along with the novelette, and then showed the Jim Carrey version to help them visualize the events, etc..

Read it even if you have seen the movies that came from it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dickens, it's said, created the British image of Christmas.It would be a ridiculous but interesting challenge to name the world's most successful or influential work of fiction, but if it were attempted, this novella would be a strong contender. Crafted with all the brilliant wit and imagery of which Dickens was capable, it chronicles the redemption of an aging skinflint, rendered bitter and cruel by his passion for money, to whom life has become a trudge towards the grave.Joy and love Ebenezer Scrooge has barred from his life, and for this, as his dead partner's ghost warns him, he is doomed to wander the Earth after death, chained by his hoarded loot. Yet he is to be rescued by the spirit - spirits actually: three of them - that burn hot and bright with forgiveness and hope amid the snow and of this darkest, final month.Dickens wrote this tale as a protest in 1843, against the even then growing obsession with material wealth, and neglect of life's freely given riches. Tnd today its message is as strong and apt as ever. To me, Christmas has not arrived until I've seen it told yet again in one of its many film adaptations, be it the black & white 1951 version starring Alastair Sim, or one of the later versions in which George C. Scott, Albert Finney, Patrick Stewart and many others have portrayed the old miser. This rich and unashamed snatch at our heartstrings never fails to pluck mine."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I am not going to review the Charles Dickens novel 'A Christmas Carol' in this review. I did that already (see my other reviews to read that), and, of course, I gave it 5 stars.What I'd like to comment on is the extra's this version brings. For instance, the original art work from the first edition by artist John Leech are here, placed where they were originally. There are also the actual 1843 and 1844 critics reviews in this book so one can see what was originally thought about this classic at the time of its release.Author Richard Kelly gives his perspective on the reasoning behind Dickens writing this ghostly Christmas story - the why's and wherefore's of the characters and scenes, which, for me, gave a little more of an understanding of what may have been going through Mr. Dickens mind at the time.Mr. Kelly also writes a bit on child labor, education, and the workhouse, which, again, opens the mind a bit more in reading this story.There is also a chapter that has many writings by Dickens contemporaries, such as Washington Irving, and their own descriptions of Christmas in their time.Believe it or not, there is quite a bit more in this book than what I've told you, including, of course, &quot;Carol&quot; itself. It makes a very interesting read and can help one to understand the purpose behind Dickens original classic, as well as of the times in which he wrote.A lot to read at a very good price.

I also thought this would be an accessible way for them to get oriented to English literature and prepare them for further reading.The requirements of the Christmas Carol book to be purchased were that a) it be new as opposed to a ragged used copy, b) it be unabridged, c) it have good drawings; and d) if possible it be inexpensive. I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible. The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods. The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing. Thirteen bucks. I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read. I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on. I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand. Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started. It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days. On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it. But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.Dan of Arlington"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This e published version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is beautifully illustrated and an absolute joy to read. This is the first time I read this book. I expected a revision of Hollywood's version of this story. Obviously, no movie can do justice to any book or novel; this book is no exception. What is excellent about this version is that it gives a brief history of the historical background that Dickens' wrote his work in and the history of this timeless classic. There may be a minor ( and I mean minor issue) on two of the illustrations: Bob Cratchit carrying Tiny Tim on his shoulders and Scrooge raising his salary. The Kindle Fire version of all the illustrations are recreated perfectly. They are partially duplicated on the top third portion and look like the top third of the illustration is above the the whole of the image in the Kindle 3G Keyboard version. I think that the publisher should look into this. This is no reason to avoid purchasing this version. Again, this version is excellent!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"There is not exta narration through out which I LOVE! It gives you extras in the front of the book with a lil history, but they left the story untouched which is great. There is just enough illustration to give you a start, but otherwise it leaves the rest to your imagination"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I shopped around quite a bit for the \\"perfect\\" edition of Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\". I settled on this edition, and I couldn't be more pleased and satisfied. Quite simply, Candlewick produced a beautiful edition of this COMPLETE work. I stress complete, because as I was searching for a good edition, I discovered several others which were abridged. As best as I can tell, this edition has preserved the original work. The rest of my review will focus on the cosmetic aspects of this edition, and why it's perfect for me.The dust jacket is thick and gorgeous with detailed artwork. The title \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is raised and glossed (tho the rest of the cover is matte). Under the dust jacket I was surprised to see that the publisher made the hardcover appear like scrooges door with the marley knocker. The back cover is also made to look like the back of a door. You cannot turn a page of text in this book without seeing color artwork, of which the vast majority are highly detailed. There are also several pages dedicated only to artwork which is fun to admire.The page stock is very thick, and the typography fits very well by giving you an old world feel. The size of the words and spacing is typical of what you'd see in a young adult or early teen book. That's not to say there aren't plenty of reasons for an adult to love this edition. I have no regrets in regards to my purchase of this edition, and I trust that you will cherish it too."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A few years ago, I was in a production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL at my community's playhouse. One Sunday evening after the matinee and before the evening performance, I stopped in a Barnes&Noble; and decided to pick this book up. It looked like a beautiful adaptation of a classic holiday story that had made my Christmases special for years.I was not disappointed.Just take a second now to look at the cover of this book. Whether you have it in your hand, or you look at it on Amazon, just glance at it for a few seconds. Do you see the intricate detail artist Dean Morrissey puts in his illustration? The bricks on the wall, and shadow on Scrooge's face. The snow on the pavement on the ground. This intricate attention to detail is present throughout all of the illustrations. They are gorgeous, and they bring vibrant life to Dickens' classic.Now, for the treatment of Dickens' writing. This book is abridged, but is marvelously done. Many of the lines are Dickens' own, and all of the cuts come from lengthy descriptions that aren't essential to the story. Dickens' overall tone and beautiful use of language are present in this book, and they make the tale of Scrooge and his redemption as inspiring as it's ever been.This is a nice introduction if you've never read the Dickens original (though I can't imagine anyone hasn't). However, if you have read it, this is a must-own if you value Scrooge and his ghosts as an essential part of the holiday season, as I do."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Just as Clement Moore gave us the definitive Santa Claus in &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;), Charles Dickens gave us the definitive Christmas spirit in his simple but charming novella &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. First published in 1843, this supernatural story of an elderly man's redemption from his mean-spirited, miserly ways takes place in Victorian London, but its universal theme of charity towards our fellow man has endeared this classic to many a generation around the globe. In addition to its priceless role as a morality tale, the book colorfully describes the Yuletide customs practiced in England during the early nineteenth century. This Washington Square Press edition of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is unabridged, yet you can understand why so short a book is yet published in abridged versions, especially for schoolchildren. Not infrequently, Dickens veers from the main story line and goes into tangents of a philosophical or descriptive nature, much like the converser who abruptly changes the subject only to return to it with the familiar &quot;Anyway, ... &quot;. I assume children (and some adults) may find these tangents cumbersome and distracting, but they are still useful in that they reflect Dickens' thoughts while writing the book. It may still be difficult for some of us to think that cold-hearted Christmas-bashers like Ebenezer Scrooge exist, but look at human nature around you, and it will be difficult no more. At a time when &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; is being supplanted by a more vague &quot;Happy Holidays&quot;, and the season gives way to coarse behavior and unchecked materialism, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is the perfect guidebook to put things into perspective."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Has any story been copied more times than A Christmas Carol?

One can really feel Dickens' love of humanity and joie de vivre throughout. At the end, Scrooge overcomes his addiction to money, misanthropy and greed to partake of the joys of participating in mankind.It is revolutionary because it is the transition of a miserly man to one, who at the conclusion, shares what he has with his fellow beings. In a sense, it is an apt theme for the \\"Occupy Movement\\" with its focus on the 1% who control most of the wealth of the world.There are an astounding number of moral lessons to be taken from this simple, but animated tale, by one of the world's greatest story-tellers.Favourite quotes: from Marley's ghost playing on the word \\"business\\" - \\"Mankind was my business.

Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.9. The commandments, \\"Do not commit adultery,\\" \\"Do not murder,\\" \\"Do not steal,\\" \\"Do not covet,\\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \\"Love your neighbor as yourself.\\"10. Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.11. And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.12. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.Scrooge envisions his past, his present, and his future, and is given the choice between damnation and salvation. He reveals his choice by saying,\\"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future.

In any case, one of Dickens' classics, and deservedly so."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"(In my blog review of this (visible at basicallyamazingashley.com) I have some really awesome pictures from a stage performance.)We all know that there are myriads of great (and not so great) books that have been turned into movies, plays, animated cartoons, TV shows and etc. etc. etc. I always roll my eyes at people who respond to the question- How did you like that book? With some variation of, \\"Oh ya, I loved it! The movie was so great!\\" Gag. Really?! You just said that?! You just smeared the name of literature by telling me a book was great because you liked the movie?! (Ahem...) Well, the other day I shamefacedly realized that I was guilty of this myself. (Insert horrified gasp here) One of my fondest memories of Christmas, most beloved childhood memories and in my top 3 favorite Christmas stories was missing something...A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is one of the most recognized, well known, and cherished Christmas stories in existence. There are numerous versions and adaptations for both children and adults, in animation, live action or produced live on stage. You can find it serious or slightly comical or even as a musical. Some follow the original script closely while others use only a loose interpretation of the story. Whatever versions you've seen, most people are very familiar with the plight of the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim, the cold, miserly heart of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the eerie spirits who visit him during the night of Christmas Eve.However familiar we are with the story, how many of us have actually read the book? I imagine not very many. It's included on BBC's The Big Read and I wonder how many people include it because of the story rather than the book itself. So, to avoid this horrible reader faux pas, I decided to pick up this favored story and read it for myself. It's a short book, more of a novella than a novel, and I already knew that I loved the story.I did really enjoy reading this book and I'm glad I can now say that I've actually read it. However, I must admit that I am a tiny bit more in love with the idea of this book than its reality. It's a wonderful story, with a wonderful message and wonderful characters, but I didn't have the same emotional connection to the written story that I do to the various productions I've seen. I know that this is more due to past experiences and the relationship it has to my childhood than anything negative about the book. I loved the book and will definitely reread it in the future, but it's just not the same as watching Scrooge, the Musical or The Muppets.The book places more emphasis on the characters and the realizations they make than just the story of Scrooge. Most movie or live productions emphasize Scrooge's discovery of the Christmas Spirit, and becoming a more generous person. I love that, and it is a very important part of the story. However, I love that reading the book offers more insight into why Scrooge became the way he did and the relationships he had with those around him.It is a great story to invite the Christmas spirit and remember the true meaning of Christmas, but it is also a cautionary tale. Be careful the emphasis you place on money and things. It is usually more important to focus on the people in your lives than the things in your life and this story, no matter how you experience it is a great reminder of that."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"An apt reminder of what makes a timeless classic! Not having read this book in many years, it was refreshing to see how effectively Charles Dickens captured a social class system that lives on to this day."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"As much as I like to read, I always sell myself short on reading \\"true literature\\" . . . especially books that were written pre-20th century. Listening to the audio version was a wonderful re-introduction to Dickens! It was incredibly easy to follow along, and the story came alive. It was magical.The narrator impressed me with all of the voices that he did. In scenes when multiple characters were conversing, it was easy to follow along due to the unique voices that he gave each character. His British accent made me feel as though Dickens himself could be narrating the story.Listening to this book together would be a wonderful family tradition! Both young and old will love this story! Don't miss out on this moving story!I received a free copy of this audio book from christianaudio in exchange for my fair and honest review."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The illustrations in this book are so pretty, which also makes the book (with old english words) easier to read. I think this book is worth every penny, and I will keep it in my bookshelf forever."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I grew up watching the Muppet and Disney versions of the story and even remember watching the Albert Finney version with my mom as well. I thought I knew the story pretty well. I mean, I knew that the ghost of Christmas present struggled pronouncing pistachio, I knew that there was a funny rat. I had no doubt that I knew all that there was to know about the Christmas Carol, but I decided to read it anyway.Boy was I in for a surprise (insert sarcasm here). I'm not gonna lie, this was a hard read. It wasn't because of the content or writing ability of Dickens, but it was the language barrier. Sometimes I swear it was like I was reading a different language. It took a while for me to read some parts and I had to use the wonderful dictionary feature of the Kindle many, many times.I did enjoy the story and it is incredible how Dickens can describe even the most mundane details and make them interesting. I could see the ghost of Christmas past's flame, I could hear Marley's chains and see the shock on Scrooge's face when he sees his own grave. Dickens is incredible at painting pictures with words.After reading this book I saw the newer animated Christmas Carol with Jim Carrey as Scrooge and I was very impressed at how well they brought the actual story to life. There were some differences, but overall they did a magnificent job.Definitely a good read during the Christmas season or any time really, whenever you need to remember that we should value other people and treat them as we want to be treated.If you like my review and want to read more of them I have a blog chronicaling my first year with my Kindle.

It shows you that you don't have to be rich and powerful to be a great person, and if you are not a grat person for a while, you can change.

We should all take a look at ourselves like Mr. Scroog was forced to!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the best, I must say. Charles Dickens just blesses my heart. When I read a Christmas Carol, I was truly touched; anyone reading this story should grasp the concept that we all need to love one another: That includes sharing, helping, and just being kind. The best way of getting it over to the reader that as a person one should live so that a happy afterlife is ensured is the ghost voice of Marley, Scrooge's partner. Marley had lived as a tight grasping old man, just like Scrooge. He died, and Scrooge is the heir. Scrooge takes over, but he is NO BETTER than Marley. He is such a greedy, stingy person that even the dogs hate him! He has not friends--PERIOD. And then...one day...On Christmas Eve, Scrooge's nephew drops in to invite him over for a Christmas dinner. In his usual manner, Scrooge dismisses the young man with his usual 'humbug' word.That night, he is visited by Marley's ghost. Scrooge is not a scary man. He talks to Marley as if it is nothing, but inwardly he is a bit shaken. What really scares him is when he is told by Marley that he will be visited by the ghosts.Marley is right.First, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past. Then the Ghost of Christmast Present. And last...and scariest...of all, is the Ghost of Christmas Future. In a short while, he shows Scrooge what will happen to him if he does not change his way. And he shows Scrooge his own grave! Imagine being shown your own grave! In the end, Scrooge has a complete transformation. He is no longer stingy or greedy. I like to think that he devoted the rest of his life to helping others. Now, I don't believe in ghosts, but I sure do think that this little ghost-like story is one of the best!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Works on first try on my Cruz tablet.

And my book club selection was A Christmas Story: The Book That Inspired the Hilarious Classic Film by Jean Shepard. The first created our modern Christmas. The second, well, the second was the basis for a gag-filled, funny movie. Both are touchstones of modern, American ChristmasesI'm not a Dickens fan but in reading these two short works almost simultaneously, I was surprised by one thing: even though I'm separated from Dickens by the Atlantic and one-hundred and seventy years and unfamiliarity with the Victorian world and a familiarity with the the settings -- if not the times --- of Shepherd's stories, I so much more preferred Dickens to Shepherd.I've given some thought to this. It's not like I'm was surprised by the narrative. They're pretty much what I've seen on the TV for decades. It's not that I knew that after Jean Shepherd divorced his second wife, he completely ignored his under seven son and daughter he'd had with her for the rest of his life. Dickens' wasn't a great husband or father either. (Then again, he at least didn't publicly deny their existence and did support his children.)I finally realized why I liked Scrooge's story over Ralphie's. It's that Dickens is Charles freakin' Dickens and Shepherd is, well, Jean Shepherd.Dickens can be \\"a vein of saccharine sentimentalism\\", true. But it is called A Christmas Carol. People are wanting saccharine sentimentalism. Ayway, it is leavened with rather dark passages that offer great balance. In fact, there's one scene that Dicken's writes that I've never seen touched on the the many films. It's part of the tour that the Second Ghost gives Scrooge.\\"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remember those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.\\"I found that wonderful and joyous. It's Christmas.Compare that to the moment after the Bumpesses hounds ruined the Christmas turkey. In the short story, it's actually an Easter ham.\\"Finally, he [the old man] spoke, in a low, rasping voice: \\"All right! OK! Get your coats. We're going to the Chinese joint. We're going to have chop suey.\\"Ordinarily, this would have been a gala of the highest order, going to the chop-suey joint. Today, it had all the gaiety of a funeral procession. The meal was eaten completely in silence.\\"Not quite a chorus of Chinese Fa-La-La-La-La's of the film, is it? Not very....Christmas-y, really?In other not-so-obvious ways, you can feel the sharp edge of post-modernism -- or is it nihilism? Well, whatever -ism it is that tells you not to have joy in this world -- creeping it's way into stories.The final thing that turned me off a bit to Shepherd was, again, the Bumpuses. The family -- not just the dogs -- is detailed in the story. I found it offensive. While Dickens almost beatifies the poor. Shepherd depiction is so full of cultural smears and stereotypes that would be considered very bad taste if applied to another group of people. And Shepherd just keeps going on and on with pilling cliche after cliche on them including a mention of father-daughter incest. It just got tiring.With A Christmas Story, stick to the movie. With A Christmas Carol, read the book...and watch the 113 movies made of it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I would have given this book a good rating before I even bought it, having read the story and had it read to me decades ago and a re-reading simply confirmed it - five stars.

It is a short story that most of us are familiar with but may have not taken the time to actually read. I have seen versions of it on TV, movies, and this year even seen a good performance of it done in a play. This year I decided to pick up the book and devote a little bit of time to reading the story. It of course is a classic written by one of the greatest writers ever, Charles Dickens. The story has a lot of meaning and reminds us that we should be aware of how we treat others not only at Christmas time but in all we do. Ebenezer Scrooge may be in us all at one time or another but like him there is time for redemption if we allow ourselves to reflect and appreciate what we have and are willing to be giving of ourselves to others."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The quality of the color printing of the illustrations is poor.

Though he could meet the expense of the most expensive clothes available, he chose to dress in the fashion of a lower-class civilian. He worked in a counting house with only his clerk Bob Cratchit for business. Scrooge was a grumpy old man whom believed that Christmas is for rich people. He also thinks that Christmas is also just a reason to miss work and get gifts to one another and also to exchange the gifts. Every time the Christmas holiday would come Scrooge would get the same feelings as the years before which are not very Christmas spirity. Most people respected his dislike for Christmas holidays, and continued to dislike him, despise him, even hate him. He doesn't believe in all of the good cheer, happiness and charity that the season promotes, and he makes sure everyone knows how he feels about the Christmas spirit. His money was what he lived by. One night Scrooge was visited by his friend, which was Marley, who was also grumpy and cold as Scrooge was. When Marley visited Scrooge, Marley told Scrooge that if he continues to be stingy and so selfishly he would continue with greed as his assemble. He also tells Scrooge that three spirits will haunt him. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge received three visits from three specific ghosts. The ghost names where the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Those ghost showed him the true meaning of Christmas and the true meaning of his life. They showed him his error in valuing money over people. Scrooge saw his long forgotten past, realizing all the good quality he had deserted, and all he had done to guide him where he was now. He saw his childhood, his grief and pleasure. He saw his relatives and acquaintances. He also saw himself turn from all these through his greed as his age progressed."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I choose this rating because it was a pretty boring book but it was finda interesting itself.

We developed a tradition of reading it aloud each year in the days before Christmas and using Roberto Innocenti's gorgeously illustrated version of Dickens' classic tale of redemption, or rather, \\"reclamation,\\" as one Ghost puts it, made this tradition even more delightful. Dickens' wordsmithing sets a standard few authors reach and reveals a desire not only to make humanity better but make more faithful the practice of the religion (Christianity) which constantly underscores the words and actions of the characters. Innocenti's illustrations reveal many hours of research into the clothing and look of 1830s London, as well as many hours spent illustrating the author's words down to some of the briefest references. Each time one looks at an illustration one notices some new charming detail: the drops of blood from a goose's neck on the snow, the Marley-haunted tiles around Scrooge's fireplace, piles of bones in old Joe's shop. The copy I received--my second copy--was in even better condition than I anticipated; while not brand new, it obviously had never been opened.

It's so great to be able to read it anywhere in a convenient format, even in the dark which makes the story spookier."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Realizing I had never read anything by Charles Dickens, I decided to take a crack at this novella after I found it being offered for free on Amazon. If you've seen any of the dozens of adaptations of this classic, you know the story: A cruel miser is visited by ghosts of past, present and future on Christmas Eve and given a glimpse of the misery he has and will continue to cause if he doesn't change his ways.As far as the Dickensian style goes, I can see the reasons why it is both loved and hated. At times the tone is conversational, like Dickens is standing in front of you telling the story, which is something you're either going to love or hate. At times I got a little lost in the text, but I just see that as a byproduct of reading a book that was written in a very different time and place.That said, the themes are very familiar, especially in today's political climate. Scrooge's dialogue in the opening scene could easily be adapted for one of the talking heads of Fox News. I'm not trying to get political here. Scrooge is a worst case scenario cartoon rendering of a heartless rich guy, but then again, I feel like he sees the error of his ways just a little too easily.At the end of the day, what you have in A Christmas Carol is a modern fable, and unlike many cultural myths, the original text is here for your enjoyment and analysis. This book is responsible in large part for how we experience and imagine Christmas today, so the cultural themes are vital. It's also a short read, so you won't lose a lot of time seeing if you like it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Because this is a classic, I focused on the quality of the kindle edition.

Over the years there have been so many film adaptations of this story and it was nice to see it in its original form."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"165 years ago this week, Charles Dickens published what would become one of his most noteworthy and best-loved gifts to the world, \\"A Christmas Carol\\".The illustrations Arthur Rackham made for this classic in 1915, with mostly lithe figures and spare coloring do great justice to the tale of an elderly miser, who, on the anniversary of his business partner's death on Christmas Eve, is forced to review his life, and is offered a final chance for redemption.The tale of Ebenezer Scrooge could be viewed as an early novel of spiritual psychoanalysis.After readers learn of Scrooge's character flaws--his stinginess, his cold-hearted attitude towards people, including a nephew and his wife, who are his only family--he is confronted by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley, who, despite Scrooge's reluctance, shows him his long chain, explains its significance, and warns him to amend his ways.Scrooge is visited by three spirits--the first being the child-like, white-haired Ghost of Christmas Past, who makes Scrooge retrace his steps in life, causing him to review a harsh and lonely childhood, which is tempered by consolation from his loving but ill-fated sister, Fan, his happier years as an apprentice to a man named Fezziwig, and finally, he recognizes how his singular pursuit of wealth at all costs resulted in the loss of his fiancee, Belle.The Ghost of Christmas Present is the most joyous and festive of the apparitions.Sitting in a well-lit room at a table with a glorious bounty when he first encounters Scrooge, he escorts his elderly charge through London, where he sees the spirit of the season among the people, and visits the houses of his employee, Bob Cratchit, and that of his nephew, Fred. He learns of the plight of Cratchit's son, Tiny Tim, discovers how he is viewed in both households, is shown the impact of poverty among those whom he has the potential to help, and lastly warned about the consequences of Want and Ignorance.The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come, is the darkest, most foreboding of the phantoms. It is hooded, faceless, and silent as it shows the old man the possible future, pointing to significant details with a clammy hand as Scrooge realizes that he has reaped what he has sown.Back in his bed at the end of a chilling night's journey, Scrooge sees the potential to be a better man than before. He has come to terms with his past, learns to rejoice in the present, and to create a better future for those around him.Ebenezer...In Hebrew, the name means \\"Stone of Help\\", which may well be why Dickens chose it for one of his most famous characters.In the end, a formerly miserly old man does a fine job of becoming just that!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Jim Dale is a very fine oral interpreter, it is a skill to read some of the most beloved books and make people love them more and discover something new.This is a 3 disc set of A Christmas Carol, audio version and Jim Dale gives each character its own unique voice and he is pleasant to listen to and he adds charm, warmth and humor to this very well known story.Treat your self, treat your family.

Thank you. I give you a five star rating.Earl Woodham"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Although it may be cliche to say, the book is so much better than the movie. And the edition of the book that I borrowed from Austin Public Library was terrific. It's called The Whole Story edition and gives illustrations from the original volume with an annotated history of London at the time that Dickens was writing the story. This hardcover also explains the settings and characters that were similar to Dickens' own life.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It's refreshing in this day and age to see a moralistic tale written without reference to religious symbolism. To me, the message under the story is so much more universally delivered this way because people with all different belief systems still get the transformation that Scrooge undergoes.I also love the concept embedded in the story about how rapidly a person can change. Unlike in Dickens' time, today we have the science to prove that if you want to change your life, all you have to do is change your mind. That's what Scrooge did and he underwent an instant and dramatic transition to a happier and more fulfilling life.If you're feeling humbug about the holidays, I suggest you read \\"A Christmas Carol\\"."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I absolutely loved this audiobook. Charles Dickens was such a brilliant writer and this is surely one of his most loved stories. Considering its an old story that has been told many times before, it still comes across as very relevant in today's economic situation.Simon Vance's narration is perfect and adds so much to the story. I particularly liked the way he interprets Scrooge all the way through his transformation, from the grumpy old miser to a jolly old man at the end. He did very well with the different characters voices and he held my attention throughout. I definitely was transported back to Victorian London whilst listening.I would recommend this audio to everyone, but especially to those who feel jaded by the commercialisation of Christmas.

Readers will compare themselves to Scrooge and try to change their ways, just as he does. It is an interesting perspective and a great way to spread the word about holiday spirit.After all, who doesn't have at least one Scrooge in the family?Anyone looking for an inspiring Christmas read; this book is for you. The writing may be old, but the spirit is still new and fresh!As an enjoyable little read, I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to take a chance with it.

Only then will you find the true meaning of Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol remains a Christmas classic for good reason. As it asks us all to live with the spirit of Christmas everyday, it shows Scrooge learning how to be kind and generous and enjoy his family and the people around him. More than a Christmas story, it offers a moral vision of a kinder, more generous world.Charles Dickens' writing style remains accessible and often humerus. The spirit visitors are drawn so vividly, they are quite enjoyable to read about as well. It is worth reading the original, even though there are movie and abridged versions everywhere.While to its benefit, the Kindle edition is unabridged and free, it lacks illustrations. Most printed editions include enjoyable illustrations. This is probably its only defect.Enjoy! Trev from Trevsliteraryreview"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, by Charles DickensTruth is a scourge. And like a scourge, it can leave one broken and bloody, stripped of all his or her defenses. No one knows this better than Mr. Scrooge, but I won't insult my readers by offering a summary of this well-known Christmas story (though I will chime in with my opinion that the old Disney version with Mickey Mouse and Scrooge McDuck is the best!).I know of no one who dislikes this story. That being said, the book is waaay better; by leaps and bounds! All of the movies tell the core of the story, but they leave out all of the nuance--if a picture is worth a thousand words and they have an hour and a half to tell this story (which was only 124 pages of somewhat large text), they should be adding nuance, not removing it!The only problem with it is that it's a book meant to appeal to everyone, including children. Therein lies the difficulty: it's somewhat like asking Beethoven to compose a jingle for an advertisement; sure, he could do it, and it would be good, but he could do so much better! And I know this is true, both because there are monstrous hints within the story (primarily when the narrator speaks), and because I've read some of his other works. But even if this is the worst that Dickens has to offer, then I would still rather read it than almost any other book written in the past 100 years.Memorable Quote:What would I not have given to be one of them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again. And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips, to have questioned her, that she might have opened them, to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush, to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price; in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.For more reviews like this, visit my profile."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I first read Charles Dickens' version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" in my 7th grade English class.

Dickens makes it easy to hate Scrooge while invoking some compassion on this horrible soul. The mixture of both hatred and pity shows the genius of the author. With the visit of the long deceased partner of Scrooge, Scrooge sees the tormented ghost and faces what he may become if he does not change his ways. With the horror of the moment, Scrooge is informed of three ghosts who will visit Scrooge, in order that Scrooge may not suffer the same fait of his former business partner. The three ghosts visit showing Scrooge the joy of Christmas had been, the happiness and good some enjoy in the current Christmas despite their humble and afflicted estate and the terror of his future. Each ghost offers their own terror but all the while offering hope that a changed Scrooge could change an even scarier future. The story will grip you if you can overlook some of the tangents by Dickens and some of the old customs included in the book. If you have a tendency towards emotional reactions to a good book, you may want to prepare yourself before reading this book. Every reader should read this book at least once and then you will understand what is meant by a Dickens Christmas."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.This particular edition is graced with Robert Innocenti's artwork, and it is gorgeous: detailed, atmospheric pictures that are alternately full of bright shining colors and dark dreary black-and-white images (such as the third spirit wafting Scrooge over a bleak, lifeless church and graveyard). Really wonderful accompaniment to the text.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all. God bless us, every one!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWCharles Dickens' 1843 classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" tells quite possibly the most oft-told holiday story in the English-speaking world. Though there have been many movies made, plays performed, and even other books written about this little gem, the best way to experience \\"A Christmas Carol\\" remains reading Dickens' original text.Many people know it as the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a hardened, greedy man who undergoes a great emotional change one Christmas Eve through the assistance(and occasional hard prodding)of three ghosts. Each ghost represents some form of loss. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Past represents the lost innocence and kindness Scrooge endures in a difficult childhood and young manhood. The Ghost of Christmas Present represents the love and fellowship Scrooge is losing in his current life, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come represents the finality of death and the lasting sting of a hateful life. Ironically, though the book is very powerfully about Ebenezer Scrooge, Dickens chooses to begin it with a discussion of his deceased business partner Jacob Marley.Ironic contrasts power the narrative, as the exceedingly wealthy Scrooge is miserable, while his poor employee Bob Cratchit is a contented man with a virtuous disposition and family. In a pared-down novel, by Dickens' amazing standards of length, Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit are two of the richest character contrasts in world literature.\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is a richly satisfying read.

Wonderful to listen to as you do your Christmas decorating or baking. I bought copies to give as gifts for several people this year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The only thing wrong with this edition is they replaced the nifty picture of Jim Dale dressed as Scrooge with a silly illustration, but you don't have to look at the cover while you're listening. Jim Dale did a fantastic job reading Harry Potter, and he does just as well with Dickens. (I hope he'll do more books soon.) With the many voices, he really takes you to Victorian England where you feel the cold, sense the ghosts and smell the food. Everyone knows the story, so I won't review that. It was a bit of a tradition in our house to read the Carol outloud at Christmas. We will probably still do it because it's fun to try to do the voices yourself, but if I'm away from home on the holidays I know where I'll turn for a substitute. And what better way to pass the time as you drive to Gramma's?!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The best of Charles Dickens' work.

With a Christmas-atmosphere title and its author, Charles Dickens-- the most talented one, this book is very attractive. It grows a wonder why does the title sound like a Chirstmas song.Then, I read it and found that this book is great! It told about 'the grasping, covetous old man', Mr. Scrooge, who hated the Chirstmas feasta (and so do the other festivals, I think.) Then he was visited by the 3 ghosts of Chirstmas who recalled his complete-forgotten joyful of this feasta in his younghood and revived his Chirstmas spirit that had changed him to become the great-hearted one!My fevorite charactors are 'Tiny Tim' and Mr. Fezziwig who has a grateful mind. There are many life lessons still waiting for you to found them. Just try!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is one of the most meaningful of all time and one I think should be read more often than just watched on television during the Christmas season. It is a tale of a small, cruel, and heartless man changing into a kind and generous soul. He is helped by a long dead friend, Jacob Marley, who wishes to save Scrooge of a eternal fate of walking the Earth forever with the weight of his sins upon him. Jacob changes Scrooge by having him haunted by three ghosts who show him all the people he has hurt and all the people he will hurt if he does not change.After the spirts visit Scrooge he rewards the Cratchit family with an anonomously sent Goose and immediately finds a charity, to which he generously donates. He also makes amends with his nephew Fred that has been trying to change Scrooge for years. Finally he helps Bob Cratchit by raising his salary so that Tiny Tim may survive.I think this book is great for the family and though it is a little difficult I think it is suited for anyone over 12 years old."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've had this edition since I was little and wanted to get the same one for my daughter, now interested in being a Dickens scholar.

But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

Vance is known for his regal feel as a narrator, and replicates his performance for A Christmas Carol brilliantly, providing a slow, British accent to properly place the work of art. His narration gives the feeling of upper class.I have watched different interpretations of this classic period on the big screen. From ancient versions to the most recent production featuring Jim Carrey. This audiobook, by far, is superior to these eye-candy interpretations. Thus far, this is the best work I've heard from Simon Vance.Read more of the review and FTC disclosures at scriptedgenius(dot)com."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"There's really nothing to be said about this book that hasn't been said a million times over. Either you're in the mood for a heartwarming classic Christmas tale by a master of English literature or you aren't. The story may be familiar, but Christmas is a great time for familiar tales. Dickens brings a wit and quality of observation to the book that many of the abridged versions and movie adaptations lack.Regarding the Kindle version: several reviews are faulting the free version for lacking an interactive table of contents, less than perfect formatting (lack of white space or chapter headings), or illustrations.

May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.\\"~Charles Dickens, 1843.And so A CHRISTMAS CAROL has since its publication; it has never been out of print or truly out of fashion. It is the quintessential Christmas story and the easiest of Dickens books to read. The narrator introduces us to Mr. Scrooge, a man whose heart has turned to stone from ambition, care, avarice, and greed. We see him at his desk in Scrooge and Marley Money House dark and chilled since he is too tight fisted to permit decent coal fires and candles. He scorns everyone that visits his office Christmas Eve, especially his nephew, Fred. But when he finally gets home, the massive door knocker transforms into Marley's face and strangely lights the foggy dark night.But Marley specter follows Scrooge to his bed chamber with chains, locks, and money boxes wrapped about his transparent body. He means to save his friend the fate that he has endured since he died seven years ago on this very night. Three Ghosts will haunt Scrooge: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come - whom looks much like Death. Through the lessons these specters will reveal, Scrooge has a chance to become a different man and employer and lead a different life.Scrooge's transformation is genuine as it is remarkable. Through Dickens's simple narration, we not only witness Scrooge change but we also feel his emotions. We cry at the possible demise of Tiny Tim and the true affection Fred has for his uncle. Scrooge on Christmas morning has rediscovered faith, hope, and charity and his heart is full of love for the season as well as his neighbors. This novella is one I read every Christmas and I love it more each year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I listen to this rendition of A Christmas Carol faithfully every year while I'm wrapping gifts, baking, or decorating.

I love reading this at Christmas time :)"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This review first appeared on my blog, Jacob's Caf&eacute; ([...]).I haven't read any of Charles Dickens' original writings since probably middle school. At that point, I know I never really appreciated the beauty of his work and words. I recently listened to christianaudio's version of A Christmas Carol, which is one of their best audiobooks yet. Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor. While God was never explicitly mentioned, the Gospel is written all over this classic.While it is a short book that can be easily found for free, christian audio is also offering it for free for this month!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher.

I've seen multiple movie versions, but I haven't actually read the book until this year. Reading it opened my eyes to a few things that I haven't noticed before and/or don't remember from the movies.While I don't think any spirits will come and visit me in the middle of the night, Dickens' spirits spoke to me in a sense in that it made me stop and think about my attitude this time of year, and what I'm doing to help others. I knew what to expect as the story unfolded, but it was still a joy to follow Scrooge on his familiar path and to see his literal overnight change!Merry Christmas, and as Tiny Tim would say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Although I have seen several movie versions of, \\"A Christmas Carol\\", I have never read the book, until I ordered this one December 2010. This version is, I think, a great representation of what this book should be. The illustrations by Robert Ingpen are outstanding and plentiful. If my children were still young, I would be reading this book to them each Christmas season. As it is, I will be ordering them this book next Christmas to read to thier children during Christmas seasons to come."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A must read for the 'learned' reader. This is an advanced book. Although it is family friendly, it's not something I would suggest reading to a child because I don't think they would be able to keep up for the most part. You would constantly have to explain the meaning of many words. A good book for high school age and up.Although the words portrayed in A Christmas Carol give you a sense of cheer and you can easily see the grump that Scrooge is, there is a 'hidden' message that you will find in the second half of this book. Christmas is not just about good cheer or being neighborly. It's about overcoming your personal 'demons' and being stronger than your issues. Choosing to be joyful as opposed to being sorry for yourself.I'm rambling. Excellent literature and I recommend it if you have not read it!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Like most people, I've seen version after version of Dickens' A CHRISTMAS CAROL.

Unfortunately, I did not read it until I was well into my adulthood. My review will focus on aspects of the story from that angle.The initial part of the story provides the reader with a portrait of Ebenezeer Scrooge that is a little overdone and a bit comical. I can only say that it came across as being a bit 'corny.'The best part of the story lies in its middle chapters, where Mr. Scrooge receives upon himself several visitors during the night. As a reader you feel drawn into the lives of the families that are visited and you find yourself caring for them rather quickly.The payoff ends up being somewhat weak. It seems rushed and concluded rather a little too hastily. A slightly lengthier expansion of the final pages would have increased enjoyment of the story immensely.Still, even with such criticisms, I realize that the story will appeal to people of all ages, and have given the book a 5 star rating. I encourage parents to let their children enjoy this classic as soon as they think it is age appropriate and not view the book with a little bit of a cynical eye, as I myself might have had."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I will admit that, until now, I have never read \\"A Christmas Carol\\", but instead - like most Americans - have watched countless film and cartoon versions, from the wonderfully classic 1951 film version with Alstaire Sim and the Mister Magoo cartoon version to the most recent film incarnation starring Jim Carrey. Having just purchased a Kindle, I decided to take advantage of the free copy offered in the classics section of the Kindle site so I could finally read the actual Dickens tale. I was certainly not disappointed.I won't bother with a rehash of the story - who doesn't know this tale? - but will only say that I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I recommend to everyone that they put it on their \\"to read\\" list (it's a rather short story, I was surprised to discover). As an actor and filmmaker, I was particularly interested in comparing the story to the many film and cartoon versions I referenced above, and this has given me a new appreciation for those versions that were truer to the original, capturing the \\"right mood\\" and maintaining a sense of anticipation, fear, wonder, melancholy, and - ultimately - pure joy.You don't have to relegate your reading of this tale to Christmas time, so I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so. For those who have read it, it's worth a return visit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I read Dickens' A Christmas Carol over the holiday. It was free to download on Kindle. Sadly, I don't believe I've ever read it before. I remember Great Expectations from high school (also free on Kindle), but honestly don't ever remember reading A Christmas Carol. It's another one of those classics I blame my teachers for cheating me on back when I should have been reading it, but a small town high school curriculum spent too much time on Shakespeare instead.All of us know the story. It's Christmas tradition, right? If you tried, you could probably tell a decent version of it out loud to the children at your Christmas party and do a pretty good job at it. First published in 1843, it's been a part of our American lives for a long time. Like I said before, it's tradition. Most of us know it from the big screen. If not the 1951 black and white version (also available colorized), you definitely saw the 1984 version with George C. Scott. The Muppets did it. Even Bill Murray spoofed it in 1988, a good spoof which is a classic in itself from the 80s.Community theatre groups have also embraced it and made it tradition on the stage. I was almost in a musical version myself back in high school, but it got canceled for some reason. I was cast in dual roles, one that I don't remember, but I was also going to be the Ghost of Christmas Future and I remember the director obsessing over how I should point. When I lived in Memphis, I went to see the annual production of it at Theatre Memphis. My point is, and I do have one, is how many of us can honestly say we first learned the timeless tale from the book itself. I know I didn't.It's like a really good memory that we embellish year after year for whatever reason, until sooner or later we forget how it actually happened. We're so numb to it. We've received more pleasure telling it our way, so why rediscover how it actually began, how it actually went, or what the truth is.That's exactly why I wanted to read it. It's there. Scrooge. Marley. Tiny Tim. The ghosts. All there. As I read, my brain played it out just like seeing it on the big screen, even some of the dialogue (including \\"God bless us, everyone!\\") was right there on the page. So, what does this tell us? Throughout history, we haven't changed it much. We've at least stayed true to it, not counting the Bill Murray version of course. I tried - very hard - not to picture versions of the characters I knew from the movies.Honestly, it's not very good writing in most places. Dickens loves to list things in order to describe them, like opening the thesaurus searching for a better word and deciding to just use them all. Case in point, when the Ghost of Christmas Present arrives he is sitting on a throne made from food. Dickens names almost every food there is. I'm paraphrasing here but it was a throne of ham, sausage, turkey, chicken, grapes, apples, bananas, oranges, pies, custards, puddings, bread, muffins, cakes, Reeses Peanut Butter Cups, M&Ms;, Yoplait Yogurt, Froot Loops, Candy Bars.... and this isn't the only place he does it. The children were happy, glad, gleeful, joyful, cheerful... bleggh! Some of the lists take up half a page or more!It was kind of like reading Shakespeare for the first time, be it Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet or whatever you read in high school, and your getting it. You are comprehending it okay, enough to know what it's about. But your really having to dig through the muck to find the parts that make sense. But overall, in the end, it does make sense. You found yourself scheming through it or focusing your attention elsewhere during parts, at least until you got to something you could understand. I didn't scheme through any of Christmas Carol - I read every damn word of it - but believe me, there were parts where I found myself slowly drifting off and thinking about something else.In the end, I felt no different than when I did before I read it. A sense of accomplishment? Perhaps. Now I can at least say I've read it. I know the truth, although everything I knew before wasn't much different. I want to question what makes this a classic, but I already know the answer.Time.So...I don't have much more to say about it. God bless us everyone!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a fantastic edition of Charles Dickens' classic holiday story of Ebenezer Scrooge's transition from Miser to Man of the People. It is unabridged (original text that includes wonderful lines such as \\"solitary as an oyster\\") and bound well for a smaller paperback. An excellent edition for an unbeatable price! For a gift idea, tie these books with ribbon and gave them as gifts to coworkers, neighbors, and even as stocking stuffers; I did, and they were a terrific hit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Yes, modern - and not so modern - media have bombarded us with version after version of this classic tale. Some have been good, some have been ridiculously horrible (e.g. Kelsey Grammer in a \\"musical version\\"....aaarrrrgghhh!!!). However, none of these forms have ever accurately conveyed the imagery so wonderfully as the original written text by Dickens. Though written some 150 years ago the mastery of the English language portrayed in the book can never be duplicated by video. Take for example Dicken's description of Scrooge as a \\"squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\\" Tremendous ! Or Scrooge's nephew Fred's description of the season as \\"a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely\\" The literary version also contains numerous snippets of marvelous text such as Dickens desciption of Scrooge waiting for the first spirit when he notes that Scrooge could \\" no more go to sleep than go to Heaven \\". Or when waiting for the second spirit that he was: \\"ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much\\". I know of no media version other than the written text which delivers these literary gems.In the book, Dickens notes that he is \\"standing in the spirit at your elbow\\". Do yourself a favor. Read the book ! Give Dickens a chance to spend some time in the spirit at your elbow and you thoroughly enjoy what he notes in the preface is a \\"Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.

I have lost count of how many times I've read it. And each time I read it, I fall in love with it all over again. I am not that familiar with Charles Dickens (something I need to work on!), but his prose is simply captivating. Each detail is described with simple clarity, from the horror of Marley returning from the grave to the humor of Scrooge's encounter with Bob Cratchit at the end of the story. Further, Dickens makes the characters as real people, and as the reader you can't help but get swept up in their lives and learn to love them, beginning with Scrooge's loving nephew Fred, and the innocent Tiny Tim, to the original \\"Grinch\\" himself, Mr. Scrooge. Emotions range from joy to fear to sadness and back again, and it all concludes with that heart-warming and unforgettable quote, \\"God bless us, everyone!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a very high quality kindle edition of a classic story.

I already loved his work, but even if you're not familiar with him, his reading of this classic is wonderful.I admit I had a hard time for a few moments, not picturing him in a French maid's costume, or a concierge uniform, but that's my problem, not yours.This is a fantastic reading; Curry inflects every character perfectly. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and plan to listen to it every Christmas.

The book is all the more special because it was signed by Dickens' g-g-granddaughter and g-g-g-grandaughter, who were special guests that weekend.The illustrations are excellent and really bring the story - and, especially, the characters - to life.And the story! Oh, what a story! I think my favorite aspect is the descriptions of the characters and settings. As a morality tale, it is so interesting that there is very little sermonizing. The three ghosts do not jibber jabber...they let Scrooge come to his own realization by placing him in situations where he can see and contemplate his own actions. The most biting part is when his own cruel words are turned on him. But other characters, too, act without charity, and if we don;t see ourselves in Scrooge and his outlandish meanness, perhaps we can see ourselves in the minor characters and their snide remarks, and improve ourselves on that account. While Tiny Tim seems to be the iconic character of The book, I actually like several others more, including the nephew, Fred; Fezziwig and his family; and the folks who stole the very curtains and clothes from Scrooge on his deathbed - their behavior was atrocious but their characterization was superb!This book capped off a year when I read two other Dickens works - Bleak House and Great Expectations for the first time.

Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth. Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes. The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment. They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge. He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment. He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate. Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesn&#65533;t trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly. It is the only pleasure he allows himself. He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different. Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off. Despite this, Bob is a happy man. He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home. The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, &#65533;but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.&#65533;The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit. His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man. He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man. Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience. His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family. He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed. A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers. His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I love this book and all its movie versions.

Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.Far from it!Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family.

It's just not Christmas if I don't read about Scrooge or see a movie about him."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I doubt if there's been a Christmas season in the last thirty years that I haven't read, watched or listened to A Christmas Carol, in some form or another. Like King Lear, every actor reaches a point in his career where he wants to stamp his mark on this classic, so you have to be really quite special to compete with the crowd. Fortunately, this reading by Tom Baker IS really quite special!I approached this with some trepidation because, much though I like Baker, for me the definitive version is Patrick Stewart's and I doubted Baker could match him. I was wrong - Baker brings drama, fear, sorrow and ultimately joy to the story just as much as Stewart does. As with all of the best of the Dickens' narrators/performers, (Callow and Margolyes, as well as Stewart, spring to mind), Baker has a huge personality and a powerful voice - necessary to fill the shoes of Dickens' larger-than-life creations. Although this is a straight reading, Baker uses his fine acting skills to give each character an individual identity. I enjoyed the occasional background music and other sound effects at the more dramatic points and felt that they added to the overall performance.I intended to listen in instalments but by the time the first disc ended, I was so hooked I ended up listening to the whole thing in one session. Not better than Stewart (not possible!) but as good, and of course this is the unabridged version. Three hours of pure listening pleasure - this set will now join my select collection of Christmas Carols, to be brought out and savoured time and again over many Christmases to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Though it is clearly stated in the product description, I didn't notice that the beautiful Rackham illustrations have been rendered into black and white until I got the book.

It is a wonderful edition and one that will be an heirloom, remembered by little ones when they are grown up and reading it to their little ones.I looked far and wide for an edition that was unabridged and lovely enough to come out every Christmas and this is absolutely the one and I'm so happy to have it!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is one of my all time favorite books and I read it every Christmas. This year I thought it was time that I upgraded from the old paperbacks I had and got a really nice version of the story. I bought this one based off the reviews on here and I must say it exceeded all my expectations.Everyone knows the story so I'll just talk a little about the book itself. The first thing you'll notice is the size and weight of the book. This thing is heavy. Always the sign of a quality book, the pages are thick and of the highest quality and the covers are thick and sturdy. Its a rare thing in this day and age to come across such a well made book. Its the sort of book that looks great on a book shelf or coffee table but will also hold up to many years of reading.The second thing I need to mention is the illustrations. Sprinkled throughout the book are many illustrations by Robert Ingpen recreating key moments and they are, quite simply, beautiful. Robert Ingpen has captured Charles Dickens' Victorian England and the characters and mood of a Christmas Carol perfectly.I cant recommend this book highly enough (and I'm picky when it comes to these things), its the sort of book that could become a treasured family heirloom and be read for many years to come. If you've come across this review looking for a high quality version of this beloved story, you can stop looking. I highly doubt that theres a better version available.

But nothing beats the original and it's a great one to read aloud at Christmas, and you can select parts of it as each chapter is self-contained. That's how Dickens was used to writing and publishing, so his books are almost better read serial style.I purchased this particular copy for someone who was in jail and the redemption theme of the story is perfect for this purpose, I think, without being preachy. Scrooge himself was in a self-imposed prison."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Jonathan Winters reads from Dicken's own version written for public readings, so it moves along nicely, never dragging or labored.You'll want to pick up several copies of this CD for friends as a welcomed Christmas surprise."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Many versions of Dickens' classic \\"A Christmas Carol\\" are actually abridgements (done more or less smoothly) but this version is complete and unabridged. Even if you think you are familiar with the book you may find upon reading this one that you previously had read a shortened version! The completeness of this volume would be reason enough to add it to your library, but the quality of the pages, typeface, and above all the lovely illustrations scattered throughout further commend it. I have bought copies for all 3 of my grown children--because every family deserves to own a complete version of this classic story and this one is the best I have ever seen."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol Audiobookread by Jim DaleI once heard it said that to appreciate Dickens best, one should read his stories aloud. I have never had the time to try to do this, but having just listened to a new unabridged reading of A Christmas Carol from Random House, I can see the validity of the statement. Playing the CD's I felt as if the narrator was, in the words of Dickens himself, &quot;standing in the spirit at your elbow.&quot;And what a narrator! The multi-talented Jim Dale reads the story...no, that is not correct...Jim Dale PERFORMS the story. I counted 42 voices in the three-hour recording. Jim Dale is well known for his over 200 voices (and counting) bringing to life all of the characters in the Harry Potter books, which he also records for Random House's Listening Library.I first saw Jim Dale in the 1977 Disney movie Pete's Dragon where he played the bumbling villain. The next year he played three hilarious characters in another Disney film, Hot Lead and Cold Feet. I was lucky to see him in two musicals on Broadway, in Barnum, and Me and My Girl. Both very memorable performances. I plan to see him next month as he sings and dances Scrooge in Madison Square Garden's Christmas Carol - The Musical. I figure if he is great in the audiobook, he will be even better on stage. An actor has only two tools...his voice and his body. In the audiobooks, of course, only the voice can be used.And Dale's voice talents are well showcased here. I often found myself laughing out loud, thanks to the combined genius of Dickens and Dale. In a couple of cases, the genius is pure Dale. At one point he adds a bit of a dog's panting that really cracked me up.I have seen and/or heard other wonderful actors do one-man renditions of A Christmas Carol. A number of years ago a friend played a tape for me of John Gielgud doing an abridged version. I saw Patrick Stewart do his acclaimed one man show on Broadway; from the first row! And I have seen the author's great-great grandson, Gerald Dickens do his skilled and energetic version several times. They are all memorable and it would be impossible to say which was the best. But I can heartily recommend that Jim Dale's version be added to the family library. It is complete, it is accurate and it is a virtuoso performance.Although I certainly know the story well, I found by listening to the audiobook I was paying closer attention to the lesser known parts...the parts that, to be honest, I usually would skim over when rereading the book. In fact, there were several sections where I felt as if I were hearing them for the first time. Marvelous sections. I couldn't believe I had missed them in the past. Maybe Jim Dale's voice just made them more vibrant than my own inner voice.I suppose that asking me to review Jim Dale reading A Christmas Carol really isn't fair. One of my favorite performers reading my favorite story by my favorite author! But surely I am not alone. Dickens is universally known as England's greatest novelist. I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Dale was gaining a reputation as one of the world's greatest readers of audiobooks. They are both master storytellers. And to quote the Dickens himself, &quot;If that's not high praise, tell me higher, and I'll use it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I hope all readers take time to read A CHRISTMAS CAROL in the original language Dickens used in the 1840's. Dickens' language remains humorous, descriptive and insightful and not inaccessible to most modern readers especially with the use of a good glossary. This is a great read aloud for families at Christmas time and also a great introduction to Dickens and other Victorian writers. Don't settle for an abridged version. Read this masterpiece the way it was intended"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume.

The book is finely illustrated but the narrative is so full of gaping wounds that the entire charm of the story is lost. I should have searched a little harder for a COMPLETE version."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"As to this kindle edition: it's reasonably well-formatted on the k2, but still has a few typos; the spacing is generally clear. There wasn't a clickable table of contents -- like a lot of other free Kindle books, this is pure text only -- but since this is really more a single short story than it is a book (1065 kindle \\"locations\\"), that's not a major fault, and the price makes up for it.As to the story itself: I doubt there's an english-speaking child who doesn't have at least some familiarity with some version of it; I think every saturday morning cartoon series ever did some version, and every other sitcom. This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work, and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommendDavid Copperfield; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've been shopping on Amazon for years and this is the first review I've ever left for a purchase I made; that's how impressed I was with this book.

A majority of the pages have beautiful illustrations that wrap into the text or take the entire page, the binding and cover is understated yet perfect for this book. This is the unabridged version, the original text of the author.

I was thrilled to find out that Mr. Dale had recorded \\"A Christmas Carol\\" because I've listened to many many hours (and more voices than hours!) of Mr. Dale.One of the great strengths of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is that it can be presented in many different ways and appeal to a variety of people at many ages. I've seen and listened to, live or recorded, Owens, Sims, Barrymore, Stewart and even Mr. Magoo perform this story but I knew Mr. Dale could bring something new to it.I'd forgotten that Crachit had no topcoat and Scrooge's niece had kissable lips. I'd lost the memory of Scrooge trying to put out the light of the Ghost of Christmas Past and was glad to be reminded of all of the descriptions of food that Dickens layers throughout the book. I love listening to the English phrases and words that had slipped from our common usage. When I was young I thought the Ghost of Christmas Future was not much of a threat, but now, deep into middle age and a cancer survivor, I see that hooded figure quite differently.It's a wonderful story, told with a fresh view from a beloved voice. What a great Christmas present!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Some songs, customs, and stories are so beloved, so familiar that they have become an integral part of our holiday celebrations. It wouldn't be the 4th of July without a parade; it wouldn't be Valentine's Day without a heart shaped box; and it wouldn't be Christmas without hearing \\"Silent Night\\" and a reading of \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"Every once in a while another version or recording comes along that makes the familiar seem new, we hear it as though for the first time. That is certainly the case with this performance of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by the irrepressible Jonathan Winters. He inhabits every character from Scrooge to his housekeeper to Tiny Tim, offering in his own incomparable manner the way he thinks each character would sound.Never has a Scrooge been meaner, a ghost more menacing or Tiny Tim more winning. Mr. Winters has been called \\"a one-man theatrical troupe\\" - indeed, he is as he not only presents amazingly different voices but sound effects as well.

The language is very descriptive. No wonder it became a classic."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A few days back, I read in an article on Leo Tolstoy's \\"What is art?\\" that he quoted, as examples of the highest works of art, Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" along with other works such as Friedrich Schiller's \\"The Robbers\\" , Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" and Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". Since I've read these three - and since all of them are my favorites, I decided to hunt out all the books recommended by Tolstoy, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" being the first of those recommended, which I hadn't read before.Believe me this short novel didn't let me down. I wouldn't call it as great as \\"Les Miserables\\" or \\"The Robbers\\", but it perfectly fits into Tolstoy's main criteria of a great work of art - that which :1.Flows from man's love for God and for man.2.Unites people in the common, universal feelings of mankind and in such a manner as to lead to the betterment of human society.Tolstoy stressed on the moral content of a work of art - and on the emotional impact it makes on the reader - on its relevance and effectiveness in leading to a better world.Considering these points, \\"A Christmas carol\\" is certainly an excellent novel.The theme of this novel, I'd put as: \\"A man's discovery of the joy in giving.\\"Dickens', it seems, meant the novel to have a \\"social conscience\\" - exhorting the rich and amply endowed to look after the poor and wretched - to fight ignorance and want.But he achieves much more than this -1. This is a novel about the regeneration and rebirth of a man's soul - a man's return to innocence.2. This novel clearly shows that man is never beyond redemption -that it is never too late to make atonements for one's past misdeeds. As long as there is a will and a future - man can always strive for the achievement of higher values.3. Above all, this is (almost)the ONLY novel which radiates a sense of joy, benevolence and goodwill towards mankind which would endear it to any reader.The way Dickens has poked fun at the wrong and the erroneous, blending this critical attitude with a cheerful, benign humor is an exceptional achievement in itself, for it avoids bitterness & unhealthy sarcasm - and, while the seriousness of the subject is maintained, makes the reader smile all the way from the begining to the end of the story.The way in which he has captured the SPIRIT of Christmas is wonderful - I never knew that Dickens could write like this. Moreover, Dickens is not concerned with religious dogma or the scriptures or Christmas day as such - but has gone straight to the essence of the Christian philosophy and has attempted to show its beneficent consequences on men's lives. He has used this day as a medium for understanding and appreciating all that it stands for ; the wider moral and social principles are his concern - as should be, for any writer of stature.I'd conclude this review by saying that it is my heartiest and most earnest wish and request to not just the readers of this review but to every person in this world - be a child, be full of benevolence, mutual respect and compassion that you may be joyful and radiate joy and laughter too, to all of you out there - make EVERY day of yours a merry Christmas - and may your life be full of the bliss and goodwill this day brings to men - as has been so beautifully brought out by this delightful novel.MERRY CHRISTMAS!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Although I have never heard of the reader on this cd, he's great!

If not you must read this classic. Charles Dickens timeless classic, A Christmas Carol , will be read by many generations yet to come. One reason this book is read by millions, is its universal plot. The first reason that the plot is so good because of the wonderful setting. This book is in London during Christmas time during the Victorian Erie. It's about an old grumpy , cranky, great business, man named Ebenezer Scrooge; who hates all and is hated by all. When he is later visited by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who tells Scrooge he will be visited by three different spirits. This novel is great to read to kids and for kids to read. This book will teach good values such as the importance of being generous. This book has many good examples of kindness like when Scrooges nephew, Fred, says Christmas is a \\"' kind forgiving charitable pleasant time'\\". It will also be a very enjoyable book to read during the holiday time of year. This book has a great English setting during Christmas in the 1800's, which will really boost your holiday spirit. This book often reminds us of our often forgotten past, which shocks the reader and keeps them hooked. This book explains many aspects of the Victorian Erie . For example when the author tells the reader of the greediness of some; Like when Scrooge says,\\"' If they rather die' said Scrooge,'then they better do it and decrease the surplus population.'\\" (11) referring to the poor. You can link many aspects of the book to the time period in which Charles Dickens lived and wrote. Like in 1838 the poor tried to get the write to vote but failed because of objection by the middle class . So you can see some of Dickens inspiration for the book. A Christmas Carol is a classic that has been read and enjoyed by many, and millions yet to come. This book has a great history and plot, combined it is great for kids as well as adults. So if you have not read this classic to your family you had better check your! pulse and start reading."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"There's nothing like reading an unabridged classic. Scrooge is uglier than any T.V. rendering but that makes his salvation even more remarkable. The introduction explains how the original story was published and why it has &#34;staves&#34; instead of chapters. Even in the Kindle form, the illustrations are beautifully rendered."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I had planned to listen to this audiobook during the holidays, which I had borrowed from the library. When I received a free gift from Audible to download this latest version narrated by Tim Curry, I chose to listen to this edition instead.Ebenezer Scrooge is a miserable old skinflint who runs Scrooge & Marley, a counting-house firm in London, England. His business partner, Jacob Marley, passed away seven years before, and Scrooge runs the firm with an iron-first. His employee, Bob Cratchit, is given a hard time when he asks to have Christmas Day off to spend in celebration with his family. Cratchit maintains that it is only once a year, and Scrooge's retort is that it is \\"a poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\\" Although Scrooge reluctantly agrees, he demands that Bob come in the following day extra early to make up for it!When Scrooge returns home on Christmas Eve, he is startled to see that the brass knocker on his door has turned into a likeness of Jacob Marley. Later that evening, he is visited by Marley's ghost. At first, he refused to believe that Marley was real. Marley's ghost is covered in chains attached to cash-boxes, padlocks, and ledgers. Marley warns Scrooge that he is destined to the same fate if he does not change his ways, telling him: \\"I wear the chain I forged in life...I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and my own free will I wore it.\\" Marley foretells of the three ghosts that will visit Scrooge.I read A Christmas Carol way back in high school, so this is a re-read for me. This classic still hasn't lost its charm. It is a heart-warming story of second chances and redemption, which makes it a perfect holiday read! One of my favourite parts of the story is during Stave Three, when Scrooge sees Tiny Tim's crutch and asks the Ghost of Christmas Present whether the boy will die. It is already apparent that the events of the evening have begun to thaw Scrooge's hardened heart.When I saw that Tim Curry narrated this version, I was immediately intrigued because Curry has such a big personality with a booming voice to match. He didn't let me down! Tim Curry's narration was fantastic! He does an amazing job of bringing Scrooge's personality across in his narration, and I highly recommend this rendition!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"As a kindle owner, I've learned to be a bit wary of free editions of classic works as well as various &#34;illustrated&#34; editions.

Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level. Rather than an abbreviated, two-hour video, I got to enjoy the entire thing and spend as much time as I wanted savoring morsels the video would have glossed over."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A christmas carol is a great classic.

Let me tell you, if anything, this is a better read if you've already seen the movie. The sense of bitter cold in London in 1840, and in Scrooge's heart, are all the more real in this slim text. Scrooge's isolation is shown to be something we have all felt at some time in our lives. His joyous redemption will evoke emotions you didn't know you had. Finally, for those of you who may have been tortured with Dicken's in highschool, this is an easy, single evening read."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"It's hard to think of a literary work that has been filmed and staged in more imaginative variations than Charles Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;--there's the excellent George C. Scott version, the delightful Muppet version, the charming Mr. Magoo version, etc., etc. But ultimately true &quot;Carol&quot; lovers should go back to Dickens' original text, which remains a great read.&quot;Carol&quot; tells the story of cold-hearted miser Ebenezer Scrooge, who despises the Christmas holiday and scorns all who celebrate it. But a visit from a series of supernatural beings forces him to reevaluate his attitude--and his life.With this simple plot Dickens has created one of the enduring triumphs of world literature. It's a robust mix of humor, horror, and (most of all) hope, all leavened with a healthy dash of progressive social criticism. One thing I love about this book is that while it has a focus on a Christian holiday, Dickens puts forth a message that is truly universal; I can imagine this story resonating with people of any religious background, and also with more secular-oriented people.This is a tale of greed, selfishness, regret, redemption, family, and community, and is enlivened by some of the most memorable characters ever created for English literature. Even if Dickens had never written another word, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; would still have, I believe, secured his place as one of the great figures of world literature."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Dicken's A Christmas Carol is a classic that we often see retold every Christmas. Everyone loves it, but few people have actually read it for themselves. I always prefer reading then viewing the story because then I have to use my own imagination. I would recommend to anyone that at least once they should read the story. Dickens is a wonderful writer although a bit longwinded (He was paid by word when he wrote!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"In Charles Dickens' classic masterpiece, the miserable Scrooge is given a chance to repent of his selfish lifestyle when he is visited by four spirits -- first, his tormented former business partner, sentenced to wander the netherworld until he has atoned for his sins -- and then three \\"Spirits of Christmas,\\" who show him the past origins of his lifestyle, the present effects of his selfishness on people in his life, and the future toward which his life is tending. He wakes from the final vision a changed man, renounces his selfish ways, and lives a generous, loving life from that time forward.This hope-filled moral tale contains themes of redemption, hope, and generosity that resonate with Christianity, but it isn't really a Christian story. In fact, it is a good example of how a Christian holiday has come to be observed in a way that diffuses its religious meaning.For Christians, Christmas is a day to celebrate God's gift of his Son to humanity. The familiar phrase \\"Peace on earth, goodwill to men\\" was first spoken by angels announcing Jesus' birth (Luke 2:13-14). This peace primarily refers to the relationship between God and humanity (Romans 5:1-2). God miraculously extended Himself to us in the body of Jesus, ending the hostility that had separated us from Him since Adam's rebellion (Romans 5:15-17). As Christians rejoice in the miracle of Christ's reconciliation, God's love naturally pours out into joyful generosity toward other people.This significance of the holiday has been largely forgotten in our post-Christian society, but you can still feel the shadow of that joy in a general sentiment of humanitarian goodwill recognized as \\"Christmas spirit.\\" In Dickens' story, the Spirit of Christmas is personified in the three figures of past, present and future Christmases, and it is to Christmas Spirit, not to God, that Scrooge turns in his repentance. In his own words:\\"Spirit!\\" he cried, tight clutching at its robe. \\"Hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse..... I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.\\"For Christians, who believe the only way to change your life is to trust in Jesus, Scrooge's repentance will be somewhat unconvincing -- but that doesn't mean thoughtful Christians can't appreciate the author's brilliant portrayal of human sin, selfishness, and suffering. This is a moral tale, excellent for demonstrating the consequences of sin and the benefits of goodness. Unlike many moral tales, this one is infused with joyful hope, executed with a literary excellence that has endeared it to readers for over 150 years.Dickensian language can be difficult for children to follow, and the content of this story may be troubling to an elementary audience, but for parents who think their kids will enjoy this story, an illustrated version can go a long way toward bridging the language gap. My favorite edition is illustrated by P.J. Lynch, whose exemplary gift for depicting human emotion makes his characters very real. They almost seem to breathe on the page, and the reader is effortlessly drawn into their thoughts and interests."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Having just read 'Great Expectations,' I am a big Dickens fan, and I found A Christmas Carol almost as good as his other. It is well-written, powerful, and as always, insightful into human nature. The story gallops along as well, wasting little time, which is rather amazing consider it is like 170 years old. So many books of that era are deadly slow, probably because they didn't have to compete with movies and TV.I loved the transformation that Scrooge made, and the framework Dickens created for fomenting that change had me convinced. Dickens really handled it beautifully.My one criticism, and to me it's a big one: Although Scrooge was clearly a Class A Jerk in the beginning of the book, I liked that at the beginning he wasn't just liberally squishy as regards \\"Surplus Population\\" (that is, overpopulation). Kudos to Dickens for even touching the subject. Granted, Scrooge was a creep to suggest that the world would be better off, and the solution most easily found, if poor kids should just die or go to the workhouse. I was disappointed when Scrooge just turned liberal and squishy at the end when he just gave money to the downtrodden. Heaven forbid Dickens give Scrooge real critical thinking along with his newfound compassion! Heaven forbid Dickens had compassion for the living, but really instead spoke out against people like his weak employee Cratchet just mindlessly having kids he couldn't support. The answer is not handouts; that doesn't solve overpopulation. People need to wake up and quit having so many kids, and whoever leads this world should put that message front and center."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"For fans of Patrick Stewart, this is an awesome rendition of an old favorite.

Scott my favourite)but really, because there's been so many, none of them dominated my mind while reading. The plot moves along very quickly and little is in the book plotwise which is not in the films.

The origional version Dickens told was nice but had a large vocabulary. This made the book chalenging to read.

When Christmas time comes, which is Scrooge does not like at all, he gets visited by ghosts. These ghosts are special ghosts who come to him at night and try to change his ways. These ghosts are the ghosts of Christmas past, preasant, and future. When Mr. Scrooge sees what he lived, lives, and is about to live, he realizes something about himself and his life that he doesn't like. He realizes that even he doesn't really like himself.

It was very inspirational. I would recommend the book to any adult or child. The book is basically an overview of how you can ruin your life, and even create death, by being mean. A Christmas Carol was a well- written example of how your attitude in everyday life, and even the way you celebrate holidays effect you and those around you. I enjoyed reading the book, because it inspired me to enlighten those around me that are like Ebenezer Scrooge or similar to consider changing. There were many interesting parts of the story. For example, in the story, the mean grouch, Ebenezer Scrooge had three ghost to haunt him. One of his past, present, and a ghost of Christmas yet to come. When each of these ghost haunted Scrooge, his attitude to each scene changed. He loved his past, hated his present, and pleaded for a better future. My favorite part of the story was the end. I enjoyed the end of the story, because Scrooge decided to change, his life improved, and he became a better person before it was too late."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is one of those stories that tempts a reviewer to succumb to grade inflation; it is so much better than other books that I've rated five stars, that I'm tempted to give it a higher than maximum rating.Granted, there are people out there who claim that this book is too cloyingly sweet for words; it's very stylish to be cynical. So call me a sucker for a happy ending if you must, but this is unquestionably the best thing that Dickens ever wrote; not only does it have his usual marvellous characterizations, but the plot moves better than most of those in his longer works, and, being a very short piece, it doesn't have the tendency to ramble that some of his longer works fall prey to.But beyond that, the story is an absolute classic, one that eveyone should have the pleasure of reading on a regular basis. What I find particularly pleasing about it is the frequently-overlooked fact that when Scrooge becomes pleasant and generous not only is it the right thing to do, and not only does it make the lives of those around him infinitely more pleasant, but it actually makes Scrooge himself much happier; it isn't WORK to be pleasant, it's FUN!The movie versions generally do a fairly good job of portraying the story, but nothing can compare to the original written story itself; even better, it's available from the &quot;Dover Thrift Editions&quot; for only a dollar!If you cherish your cynicism, you may want to avoid this story; but if you enjoy a good bit of delightfully playful writing that winds up with a classically upbeat ending, DO NOT miss this book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think it is for children and is very easy to read and very childish to me and I don't really like it"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I love to read classics and Ive seen A Christmas Carol movies so many times I felt compelled to read the book.

They focus on the value of the then new edition of the LDS scriptures and the value of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible for Latter-day Saints. There first paper is by Elder Bruce R. McConkie on \\"The Doctrinal Restoration\\". He discusses the need for a restoration, what it is that needs to be restored, how it is being restored, and what we need to do to participate in the restoration.The various papers discuss aspects of the Joseph Smith Translation in the Old and New Testaments and are all quite interesting. However, I particularly liked Robert Cloward's paper on the Sermon on the Mount. He compares the differences in the Sermon in the JST and the Book of Mormon with the standard King James Bible and demonstrates what is clarified and why these are significant.Once you read these papers, it will become even more clear why the JST is important and you will find yourself reading the footnoted passages and those longer passages in the back even more closely and with more understanding. At least that is what I have experienced."},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"For a person beginning any path of spiritually and for people that are more advanced, following any path, David Spero's book guides one deeply into the Divine within oneself. Written with exquisiteness from His Divine Love, Intelligence, and Knowledge, its simplicity and genuineness makes it easy to follow; and the sweetness of His Transmission can be felt long after the book is finished."},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"If you are inwardly drawn to this book, I suggest you get a copy. Read it as an exploration into your Self. While you are reading it, be sensitive to your surroundings. See what happens within yourself as you absorb David's words. It was after I met David, sitting in several of his spiritual gatherings, that I discovered his book. I had experienced his spiritual transmission at several public programs. At that time, I had been searching for Something. I was aware of spiritual organizations and teachers, but I was turned off by their doctrines. \\"Joining\\" anything was repugnent to me. To me, restrictions were totally unbearable. As I was reading David's book, I had a very amazing experience. I read what I, in my being, already knew to be True, the Something I had been searching for was awakened. I also read with interest about David's life.The reading opened up issues that I needed to explore in more depth, in the depth of my Being, by meditating alone and being more in David's presence. Sometimes fear would overcome me (as I read), for what David was sharing (in his book) took me to places that were hidden for a long time. As my spiritual awareness has grown (over the years), so has my ability to understand David's words. From sitting in his company and reading his book an incredible spiritual realtiy has dawned. For some, this book will be an account of one man's spiritual journey. For others, it will convey the Truth they've been searching endlesslly for. Either way, everyone who reads it will receive a special Gift, one meant to be enjoyed at the deepest level of Being."},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"This book was wonderful! Filled with insight, wisdom and the fullness of David Spero's spiritual transmission, I have yet to find a better book on the topic of Enlightenment. Written in an easy-to-follow question/answer format, this book puts the reader directly into the topic being discussed and answers the core questions we all have as spiritual seekers. Whether you are just starting out on your spiritual path or are a seasoned veteran, you will want to make Spero's book part of your journey. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"I have read some really profound books and had the privilege to sit with some amazing teachers. I remember writing what I am sure was the very first review of The Power of Now on Amazon.com, before anyone had heard of it. One could feel the energy behind the words in that book, and soon the world \\"discovered\\" Eckhart Tolle. Such is the power of the Profound.On the surface, David Spero's book will seem more personal and autobiographical, and tends to use terminology adapted from the Hindu tradition as a means of explaining various spiritual phenomenon. Some readers will resonate with this approach, others will not. What I found, personally, was a book which became an invitation to a most extraordinary experience of spontaneous meditation which seems to palpably emanate from the pages of the book quite independent from the words themselves. This \\"teaching\\" is VERY powerful.And the book is only one way to begin to sample this energy. One can also tune into David's free weekly webcast (www.davidspro.org) every Tuesday @ 7PM, during which many people report spontaneous experiences of deep meditation. Or one can check his schedule on his website and attend his weekly meetings.The book is a great introduction to his work, however.David is a challenging teacher, in that he makes no attempt to downplay his human-ness. Instead, he uses it to expand people's conceptual limits of what it means to be \\"free\\" or \\"enlightened.\\" This can be a difficult pill to swallow for whose concepts of spirituality are limited by concepts such as \\"ego\\" and \\"non-judgementalism\\" and most of the other various and sundry values which we have largely unquestioningly adopted from the \\"new age\\" movement without proper reflection or understanding of what exactly those values were pointing towards in the first place. I personally find his approach incredibly liberating.For those avid seekers who have made every effort, read every book, practiced every technique, sat with innumerable sages and the urge to scratch the itch turns to impatience followed by frustration, this book may be the introduction to a very direct route to your own Self. If so, you can congratulate yourself on having found something very, very special."},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"This in not a review of David's book as one might expect rather a true account of what happened as I was reading it. \\"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion\\" is sublime poetry for those looking for Truth. You can read many reviews as testament to this but when I was reading it during the morning bus commute to work I was inundated with a blissful spiritual current that was so powerful that I felt I was being lit up like a 100,000 watt bulb. My mind stopped in it's tracks, no thought, and stayed like that for many minutes as the bus made it's way down Market St. and finally let me off, drunk on bliss, to go to my day job.How's that for starting one's day!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Place of Laughter and Tears in the Land of Devotion","review":"Why was Rumi so intoxicated by Shams of Tabriz?

The characters are real, and reminded me of the different emotions I felt growing up.

The three Field sisters growing up in 1960s suburban Toronto live in a gloomy, comfortless world. Their father is demanding, difficult, and has dalliances on the side, and their mother, who dropped her baby son over the Niagara Falls many years ago, seeks solace in alcohol. The girls are the ones who take care of her and the house, going for groceries, cooking and cleaning, and trying to stop her from heading for the roof. But one day, one early morning, she does, and they cannot stop her.Barbara Gowdy seems to like the weird, the eccentric, the crazies. Falling Angelsis a tale of a dysfunctional family, with weird and unexpected events that lurk around every corner.

The book does not get bogged down in minute details or facts that are not very important. Instead it gives tips on how to make selection easier. The tips not only hold true for SAS but hold true for US units such as Force Recon and Navy SEALs. For anyone interested in special forces this is a great book and an easy read."},{"Title":"Joining the Sas: How to Get in and What It's Like","review":"Those of us on the other side of the pond who aren't looking to join the SAS will find this book interesting as well. The first half of the book deals with preparing to pass selection. It provides a 12-week train-up program, gives you a list of equipment you'll need, and provides a day-by-day schedule of what will happen during selection. Jungle, continuation, and survival training phases are also discussed (it even gives advice on how to deal with dogs). The last half of the book talks about the different environments (jungle, desert, arctic), jobs, and equipment you'll become familiar with in the regiment.

We look forward to trying many of the recepies that appear easy to make."},{"Title":"After the Hanging: and Other Stories","review":"OV Vijayan is one of the world's greatest writers of short fiction. Unfortunately he has not received the publicity he deserves. This collection is superb; ranging from horrifying allegories of power and corruption to biting sarcasm and satire to stunning stories of transcendental mysticism. Vijayan has translated the stories himself from Malayalam, and his language is fabulous -- in fact, I have read the stories in both the original and in translation and I am hard pressed to tell which is better. The almost-Victorian language he uses for his tales of terror adds deliciously to the gothic horror. In his transcendental stories, his language is much more naturalistic. There are several masterpieces in this collection: the title story, about a simple peasant going to the jail to receive the body of his executed son; the brilliant 'Wart' about absolute power; 'Airport' and 'Little Ones' about the magic that underlies Vijayan's mysterious Malabar Coast, India's stunningly and lushly beautiful Emerald Coast in the state of Kerala. This collection has been reissued in a new Penguin India Collected Edition -- along with novels &quot;Khasak&quot;, &quot;Infinity of Grace&quot; and the &quot;Saga of Dharmapuri&quot;. Definitely recommended. I am amazed Amazon does not carry this Collected Edition as it only came out in 1998. On another note, &quot;The Wart&quot; is being made into a film by filmmaker Murali Nair who won the Cannes 1999 &quot;Camera d'Or&quot; for best debut film. Presumably this will be a good film. Also, Vijayan is busy at this time translating his latest novel, &quot;Generations&quot;, another masterpiece, a semi-autobiographical family saga a bit like Faulkner's or Marquez's or Gunter Grass' work."},{"Title":"Bolos II: The Unconquerable (Bk. 2)","review":"Bolos are awsome.

Cheap fireworks for understimulated teenagers; a complete waste of time. But long before this pulp a master of the Golden Age wrote the best-ever stories of this genre', the Bolo stories. Keith Laumer's Bolo wasn't just big guns incidentally slaved to a good computer. It felt pain; passion; dismay; hope; joy; and above all else desire. It spoke with cold logic, never wasted a word. But its nanosecond thoughts were lavish with emotion. As with tales of soft-spoken heroes of the martial arts or the Old West, they think much and speak little -- and only then carry a big stick. Honor and desire, not mere power, are the Bolo's allegories. The authors of &quot;Unconquerable&quot; have insipidly shifted the focus from guts to guns. Laumer's passion and vision extinguished in these stories, they might as well carry the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; brand name -- it would be just as relevant, and more apropos."},{"Title":"Bolos II: The Unconquerable (Bk. 2)","review":"Bolo tanks are almost unbeatable- long range, extreemly high powered, working with humans gives them the edge when fighting bad guys"},{"Title":"Bolos II: The Unconquerable (Bk. 2)","review":"Received on time and as promised.

The Unity faith helps one find ways to receive the Spirit of God and develop the power of God within you. It tries to give you tools to take responsibility for your life, to grow and develop spiritually. It dares us to really connect with God and work on ourselves, rather than just sitting and waiting for something good to happen out of the blue. Myrtle's book here presents her religious philosophy very well. This little book is a goldmine of inspiration and teachings.I don't think that one even necessarily needs to be of the Unity faith to get a lot out of this book. From reading through it, I think anyone whose faith centers around believing in Jesus and God learn a lot from this book on topics like prayer, healing, etc. I wish I would have bought this years ago.

The book does not suffer from a desire to assign \\"war guilt\\" to any particular country and is at pains to demonstrate that all of Europe behaved in an irresponsible fashion in the years leading up to the First World War. I cannot see how his argument, that Austria-Hungary's efforts to operate as a multi-national empire in the midst of nation states was a perpetual and ultimately fatal weakness, can be disputed. I have read this book at least fifteen times after being required to read it for a college history course and I am still not tired of it. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"Lafore's work is not only the most readable account of the Great War's origins, it puts the emphasis where in should be: not on the naval rivalry between Germany and England, or on the ruling classes fear of revolution, but on the corrosive consequences of nationalism for domestic (and consequently) international stability.

Lafore clearly states his objectives in the introduction and then goes on in a thorough, organised manner throughout the rest of the essay, proving his thesis in a convincing and relatively unbiased way. History, according to Lafore in his opening remarks, is relative in that each generation sees the past from a new perspective due to the events of the present. However, despite this relativism, Lafore states that by further study, and &quot;with each new monograph or essay&quot; historians will come closer to what is actually the truth concerning the past (pp.14,15). It is for this reason that Lafore writes his essay. He feels as though it is a &quot;duty&quot; to reappraise history (p. 14) and that he, being removed from the events by a distance in time of over 50 years, can look at the events of World War I in an unbiased manner (p. 22). Lafore has two objectives in The Long Fuse. The first is to prove that the main cause of World War I was a &quot;single international event&quot;(p. 17); that is, an Austro-Hungarian conflict with Serbia, which was in turn a result of Serb nationalism and the structure of Austria/Hungary as a nation state. All other conflicts/events leading up to this were contributory in the forming of alliances, which in turn caused the war to be a &quot;world&quot; war, but they did not, in fact, start the war. The second is to show that while some of the major European powers preceding 1914 believed war to be inevitable, even going so far as to view it as a good thing, they were nave to the true nature of the war which was about to occur. They, according to Lafore, &quot;did not envisage four years of horror; they did not envisage social revolutions and the collapse of Europe.&quot; (pp.22,23). They could not possibly understand the major changes that would transpire as a result of their actions because they had never been involved in war on such a grand scale before. The author is, for the most part, very successful in proving his thesis. He elaborates greatly on the troubled composition of Austria/Hungary, as well as on Serb nationalism and the conflicting interests between the two parties. Lafore also outlines the other problems that led to the distrust and alliances within Europe and then gives reasons why these things were not in themselves events which caused the war. For example, Lafore discusses the colonial struggles of the Great Powers preceding the war in some detail in his chapter entitled, &quot;The Europe of the Armed Camps.&quot; It is quite evident from his account that these colonial struggles caused tension between the powers, but it is also made clear by Lafore at the conclusion his narrative on these events, that these conflicts could not possibly have been the cause of World War I. He states: &quot;Imperialism left barely more than traces on the European situation. It might even be argued that imperialism had served, rather than threatened, the cause of peace. As long as public attention was concentrated on &quot;little wars,&quot; which usually were avoided by concessions, the danger of a head-on meeting, where the really essential interests of Great Powers were involved, was lessened.&quot;(p110) Lafore does, however, at times seem somewhat conjectural on certain points. When discussing Russia's renewed interests in the Balkans from 1905 onward, he states: &quot;It may be argued that the Russians were especially in need of some political successes in Europe following their defeat in Asia; but it seems likely that, if they had defeated the Japanese, they might have adopted from strength the policy that they now adopted from weakness.&quot; (p.146) The reader is given no reasons why this policy of Russia's &quot;seems likely,&quot; it is only told to them. How is Lafore to know that this is what Russia would have done? Without further evidence, this statement seems too speculative. Yet, despite this fact, the essay is still convincing and the thesis is proven thoroughly by methods previously stated. Stylistically, The Long Fuse is quite well written and &quot;reader-friendly.&quot; While reading the essay, one does not feel as though he/she is reading a straight compilation of facts, as would be found in a textbook. Rather, World War I and its causes are woven together in a &quot;story-like&quot; form to keep the reader wondering what will occur next. On the whole this style is very successful, however there are some occasions when the reader is too aware of these stylistic attempts, to the point that they become somewhat intrusive. Such is the case on page 154, where Lafore, in attempting to be humorous says: &quot;the reader will be relieved to learn&quot; that he will be not going into a detailed account of the Turkish domestic situation in 1908. The reader is, in fact, relieved to learn this, but it did not need to be stated by Lafore. Also, Lafore tends to use the literary devices of simile and metaphor too much in this essay. Images of science being like the sun (p.26), Italy as a whore (p.127), and Russia a &quot;dog in the manger&quot; (p.228) become tiresome and almost sickening. Still, the essay is organised and explained thoroughly and skilfully. Lafore includes all necessary background details in order to facilitate the reader's understanding of pre-1914 Europe as well as the war itself, without going into too much detail about less important or irrelevant side topics. Also, as a result from the very nature of Lafore's objectives, the essay is relatively unbiased. His thesis is not to place blame on any one country or person in particular, but rather is more inclined to the belief that the Great Powers did not understand the repercussions of their actions. He does not try to accuse any person or nation as being &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bloodthirsty.&quot; Instead, Lafore goes so far as to say that &quot;the responsibility was the monopoly of no man and no nation; rather it inhered in the offices and institutions, in the system of European states and its shortcomings.&quot; (p.23). Laurence Lafore's The Long Fuse is an interesting, convincing essay on the cause of World War I. It is well organised, easily read and virtually biased free, as its' aim is not to place blame on any one country or individual."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"At first glance, The Long Fuse, by Laurence Lafore, may seem dated. Originally written in 1971 with a second edition printed in 1997, it retains enough of the first edition to make the reader wonder if modern scholarship may have passed it by. True there is no indication of what has been updated in the newer edition, and the author in the early chapters does little to challenge long standing conclusions on World War One's origins. But Lafore ultimately shows why his original work warranted a second edition.This book does not examine economic, social, or military causes of the war in any great detail. In part this is what makes the book appealing. Lafore instead follows traditional diplomatic arguments upon which his conclusions are based. He does seem to favor conservative viewpoints by stating the fringe areas of Europe (the Balkans, Ireland, and frontier provincial areas such as Alsace-Lorraine) did much to thwart the ambitions of the great powers. He also reluctantly includes Austria-Hungary with the great powers though it was comprised of the very fringe areas he is critical of.Lafore does avoid one traditional Anglo-French opinion, that Germany bore sole responsibility for the war. This he flatly denies. Instead, he shows how each great power was in part responsible for its own actions, and how their actions subsequently crossed the frontiers and affected their neighbor's or allies'.The title is somewhat a misnomer as he seems to brush on the period of 1871-1913 though in insufficient detail to connect it to the outbreak of war in 1914. In fact the first half of the book is a bit meandering. However, the real merit of the study covers the period 1913/4 and this is where Lafore exhibits his understanding of the wars' origins. But this does not mean the reader should merely skim the early chapters. There are ample euphemisms, witticisms, arcane words, and indeed humor (&quot;No one quite agreed on where Macedonia was-but wherever it was, it was a problem.&quot;) to keep ones interest.But it remains the last chapters, and especially the final pages that demonstrates the books' value, and for this reason it should be considered by anyone with an interest in the Great Wars' origins."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"The causes and course of the First World War are taught to every high school student in the country. And in every textbook and supplement available to the teachers the three threats of nationalism, militarism, and colonialism are named as the trinity of death and destruction on the road to war. Historian and author Laurence Lafore takes issue with this commonly held belief in his book The Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origin of World War I. It is Lafore's contention that colonialism left only traces of its conflicts in Europe, and militarism might have hurried the war, but it was the idea of nationalism, and specifically nationalism in Serbia and its incompatibility with Austria, that is the root and reason of the war.In The Long Fuse, Lafore looks at virtually every event, person, and idea that might be considered a cause of the war. The rise of German power, nationalism, militarism, the end of the Bismarkian system, and the rise of the alliances are all addressed. And while Lafore accurately places the items in their proper time and place the conclusions he draws from them are markedly different than the standard textbook.Germany plays a central roll in Lafore's book. Indeed, it is the emergence of Germany as a new power in Europe that was a catalyst for the other great powers to begin to reevaluate their positions. According to Lafore, while Germany's power was undeniable the threat they posed to the other nations was not insurmountable. Lafore does examine Germany's fateful attachment of nationalism to its military power and their seemingly belligerent actions in the uncertain moments after the Archdukes Assassination but he explains them in a context that prevents them from being causes of the war. They become only fuel and not the match. The fuel furthermore might have been rendered inert if time and diplomacy were aloud to continue.The author's argument against colonialism as a factor in the war is very convincing. Despite Fashoda, Morocco and other \\"near misses\\" the conflicts in the third world were kept as separate issues as far as the Great Powers were concerned. At the most they served as expressions of nationalism and pride for their mother countries and in the end seemed to barley leave a trace on Europe. Lafore is so definite in this statement that one feels obliged to take him at his word. But the evidence that he presents is proof enough that the textbooks and students of the Great War need to rethink the colonial connection.After 268 pages of dense reading Lafore of explaining what was not a cause of the war he eventually explains what was. According to Lafore, the fact that Austria-Hungary was a supranational state in a system of national states made it fatally venerable to small nationalistic movements such as those in Serbia. Not only did they have to treat forcefully with these elements they could not easily retreat or negotiate. On the other hand the death of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of the Balkan states as well as the social awareness of the time made Serbian nationalism a potent and unstoppable force. This was the incompatibility that could not be negotiated, counseled, mitigated or ignored. All other \\"causes\\" could have, and most likely would have, been overcome, but not the Serbian Question.What all the other causes did was provide a long fuse that brought the conflict from the Balkans to the rest of Europe. The alliances and prejudices created by decades of geo-political activity made the outbreak of a general war possible. To paraphrase Lafore; what was important to Europe was what the German military did, what the German Military did was what Austria needed, and what Austria needed was to deal harshly with Serbia. The chain of events that followed is well documented and is not Lafore's reason for listing them. Instead, at several places in these rapid and tragic events Lafore shows the readers different attempts to stop the insanity and the genuine efforts by some to prevent war. Such actions lend weight to his contentions that negotiation and d&eacute;tente was what could be expected in Europe on virtually ever other matter but the one that presented itself in August 1814.Lafore's book is an exhaustive yet efficient treatment of the prewar years. Being both heavy with information and relatively short means that the book feels dense and requires the reader's utmost concentration. His concise and logical presentations make his arguments convincing but, Lafore's lack of adequate maps hampers the reader's ability to absorb the contents more readily. With judicious notes, supplemental maps, and a Zen state of reading concentration The Long Fuse is a terrific source of information on the Great War and a welcome contribution to the constant reevaluation of history."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"Laurence Lafore concentrates on the events which caused the First World War. Germany's fault is well founded but they did not cause the war by themselves. Lafore shows how other nations played a part in the events which caused the Great World War. Lafore does not blame any one nation, he simply points out the domino effect which brought about WWI and actually delayed the war until 1914.In the spirit of A. J. P. Taylor, Lafore acknowledges the German actions but also points out they were not alone."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"This is absolutely the clearest, most concise, and yet complete book you can find on the origins of WW1.

Mr. Lafore takes us to Eastern Europe and the Balkans, the dangerous issues that metastasized between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, and the fatality of Russian decisions. It also carries important lessons for today.Germany's two-front war plan and the generally provocative mobilization requirements of the period are often discussed elsewhere. There has been maybe less study of what in the post 9-11 world looks like an elephant in the living room. Serbia's blatant support and encouragement of anti-Hapsburg terrorism and Russia's military support of Serbia's hostile policy are extremely interesting in comparison to the current world situation.Lafore seems to show that the general nature of what became World War I was not inevitable. Russia did not have to guarantee Serbia's intolerable antagonism of Austria. Before German armies rolled into Belgium, setting the world on fire, Russia signaled its decision to militarily protect Serbia's terrorist campaign to bring down the Austria-Hungarian government."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"The First World War (1914 - 1918) was the most devastating catastrophe to envelope European civilization since the 14th century Black Death had killed 25% - 30% of the population from Central Asia to the British Isles. The Second World War (1939 - 1945) was larger in scope, involved more nations and geographic territory, and caused more casualties, but it was manifestly an extension of the unresolved problems and the unsatisfactory treaty that concluded the Great War.Before 1914 an atmosphere of optimism prevailed. Science had unveiled technological miracles that vastly enhanced industrial capability and improved living conditions at every turn. In the prior century, the steam engine, railroads, the telegraph and telephone, the harnessing of electricity, and the invention of the incandescent light bulb had amazed everyone. The previous 20 years alone had produced the motion picture, the automobile and the airplane. Peace and disarmament conferences, while achieving little, at least demonstrated recognition among powerful nations that the time might come when war would cease to be an acceptable mode of political expression. Absolute tyrannies were gradually giving way to parliamentary democracies, human rights were becoming institutionalized, persistent social and economic injustices were being acknowledged and discussed. The sobering implications of Nietzsche's and Freud's insights on human willfulness had yet to be absorbed.On June 28, 1914, in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, a 19 year-old Serbian terrorist shot dead the heir to the Habsburg throne, putting a match to the fuse that would detonate European equanimity, demolishing four empires in the process and shredding the hopeful illusion that human beings were on the threshold of Utopia.What had happened? So many books have been written on the origins of the First World War that a scholar could spend a lifetime gaining familiarity with the crucial period 1871- 1914 that had made the terrible clash of nations all but inevitable. Who was responsible?In \\"The Long Fuse\\" (1965) Laurence Lafore argues that definitive finger pointing is neither possible nor profitable. Lafore was a Professor of History at Swarthmore College who had worked for the State Department during World War II. Though there is abundant blame to distribute, Lafore identifies a major culprit. \\"In tracing almost any of the circumstances that were most critical in 1914, one is led back to the national conflicts of Central and Southeastern Europe.\\"The Habsburg Monarchy, dynastic rulers since the 13th century of the polyglot collection of mutually hostile ethnic groups and expansive terrain known as Austria-Hungary, had failed either to unify the diverse interests and loyalties of their subjects or to facilitate their clamor, where it existed, for independence.Germans, Magyars, Czechs, Slovenes, Ruthenes, Poles, Rumanians, and Serbo-Croats rubbed shoulders within the empire in various concentrations, each with distinct language, history, traditions, and aspirations. To complicate matters, religious affiliations were distributed among Catholic, Orthodox Christian, Moslem, and Jewish worshippers whose theological tolerance for each other was at best nominal.The Serbs had already broken from their former masters, the corrupt and disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and felt they had earned their right to form a Pan-Slavic state in the Balkans including elements of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In this ambition they were actively encouraged by the Russian Empire, Slavic themselves and long antagonistic toward the Ottoman Turks because Russia thirsted for a warm water port and control of Constantinople, situated on the narrow strait between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, a tantalizing goal always eluding their grasp.The Russian Empire, neighbor to Austria-Hungary, had exhibited an appetite for westward expansion. In the late 19th century Russia had cemented an alliance with France, forever smarting over their defeat by Germany in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 and the subsequent annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by the German Empire. The Germans had always been nervous about their lengthy border with Russia and felt themselves menacingly encircled by the Russian alliance with France. As a counter-balance, Germany had reluctantly allied its military fortunes with Austria-Hungary.England had observed these Continental alliances with ambivalence until they learned from bitter experience in the Boer War (1899 - 1902) that Britain's diplomatic policy of \\"splendid isolation\\" might not work to their advantage in the protection of their far-flung colonial holdings and the safe guarantee of their maritime trade. As a consequence, they found it expedient to cultivate a military \\"entente cordiale\\" with France in response to strident German saber rattling in the press and naval buildup on the high seas.Generals, they say, are always fighting the last war. The last European war had ended in 1871. Things had changed. The same science that wrought exhilarating inventions for life's betterment had also \\"in the peculiar equilibrium of military technology\\" improved armaments for life's destruction. Germany's capacity for arms manufacture was prodigious. France longed for \\"revanche\\" over lost Alsace-Lorraine and had devoted two generations to preparations for war. Great Britain had introduced the dreadnaught to dominate naval action. Russia could mobilize millions of men for swarming attacks on any land opponent. The peace Europe had enjoyed for over 40 years had ossified military strategies.The Habsburg Monarchy that felt its prestige was crucial to the governance of its unwieldy empire could scarcely afford to let the assassination of its heir by Serbian anarchists go unpunished. Although its ruling class, diplomatic corps, high ranking bureaucrats, and military establishment were all keenly aware that war with Serbia would certainly provoke Russian mobilization, which in turn would trigger French and German war plans, they approached the crisis with cavalier disregard of its likely consequences. All sides contemplating armed conflict counted on a short war, limited in its aims and extent. No one envisioned the prolonged carnage that followed.Four years of pointless slaughter left ten million dead. Another ten million were afflicted with injury: missing limbs, gas poisoning, shell shock. Economies were in ruins. The Russian dynasty was toppled from within and transformed into a Soviet Union that would be locked down for 74 years The German Empire crumpled and, saddled with punitive war reparations that strangled the Weimar Republic in its crib, gave platform and purpose to Hitler. At the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Ottoman Empire was parceled out among the victors. The careless mapmakers carved the Austro-Hungarian Empire into national states along arbitrary lines that served their own designs but did little to quell anxieties or fulfill hopes among the congeries of determined peoples that the Habsburgs had failed to hold together by sheer dynastic will.This was the excruciating fact: the war had occurred among the very people who thought of themselves as the pinnacle of civilization, who had made an idol of Progress and an inexorability of human advancement. By the close of 1918, the very idea of Progress lay prostrate, punctured by exploding shells like the hundreds of thousands of corpses that lay rotting for no reason in No Man's Land.\\"The Long Fuse\\" is an excellent summary of the complexities leading to the Great War. Professor Lafore's impeccable prose is precise and uncluttered, marshaling the profusion of facts admirably, presenting characters and events in a manner that sustains dramatic suspense even though we are all familiar with the story and are left to inhabit the tense, unsettled world of its consequences."},{"Title":"Long Fuse : An Interpretation of the Origins of World War I","review":"I have read numerous books on the origin of WWI, but none treat the subject to such a clear and thorough yet concise treatment. The Long Fuse reviews all of the historic forces that culminated in the worse disaster in Western Civilization - a war that not only changed the world but every human being who lived at that time. The other great virtue of this book is that it is very well written - treating the most arcane and dry subjects with wit and verve. If you are interested in the subject - this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"I bought this book, looking for a history of Drexel and Milken, and what they did, and what junk bonds were.I found a defense of Drexel and Milken, and a rebuttal of the charges against them.Most of the book is a description of their trials, and how they defended, and how the charges were 'put up' by attorney Guilani.But, I think the book went too far in the last 100 pages. Having run out of things to say about Drexel and Milken, the author diverted his attention to the Savings &amp; Loan scandal, and has the gall to defend Charles Keating, and then go on to defend other S&amp;L 'criminals'. What this has to do with Milken or Drexel is beyond me, and thus only the first 2/3rds of the book lives up to its title.Also, he never concretes the evidence that there is a conspiracy, only that a top guy in government (who is jealous of Drexel), and Ralph Guilani, (not to mention the government's policies) are against Drexel."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"Mr. Fischel does an excellent job explaining what exactly happened with high-yield financing by Drexel Burham Lambert (Milken) in the 1980's. The book also goes into great detail about how Milkens financing of raiders helped evict the &quot;entrenched&quot; risk averse management of many US companies. These managers filled with anger and evny, join with their former college buddies (such as Nick Brady) to form an unholy alliance and stop Milken, Pickens, Icahn and their ilk. Mr. Fischel also describes in great detail of how a zealous prosectuor named Guiliani stopped at nothing to get Milken, et. al so he could boost his chances at the 1989 mayoral race in NYC. Fischel also speaks of some anti-semitism that might have been behind this. The book doesn't make apologies for most of what transpired on Wall St. in this era. Fischel declares Boesky and Levine to be &quot;crooks&quot; and shows no quarter when it comes to any of the other thieves who profited from insider trading. However, he justifies what Milken did to improve the US economy both then and now. The book also talks about Keating and the S&amp;L problem. A great book, I couldn't put it down!!!"},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"Payback - the conspiracy to destroy Michael Milken and his financial revolution is an outstanding book that changes your way of thinking about the american dream, the junk bond decade and I recommend it unconditionally to anyone who is willing to have a lot of conventional wisdom and preconceived ideas turned around.The author starts with a strange question - is there something like too much wealth ? Is it embarassing to earn too much money in a short period of time. Is there something like if you are born like this you must utmost become that ?This book is a story about a man who I believe was on the way to become the most important financial thinker in our 20th century, a man whou should be seen as a scholar more than as a businessman, in particular because he prooved what scholars before him erected as a hypothesis.His crime: working unnormally long hours, thinking the impossible paths of financing, not considering the estalished rights of normal banks (which would after him cease to exist) and not bending over to the politicians who turned an industry, that should have been killed in the early 80s into a nightmare of dimensions never heard of before. Milken just helped to open ways to a new wave of shareholder- value-oriented management, and he helped to get the best result out of the S&amp;L legislation, in principle just the way the politicians wanted it - only that they wanted to reverse everything after they had seen what had gone completely wrong,much too late at a much too high cost.I admit I have always liked Mr Michael Milken, already in the late 80s, when he was convicted, beacause the accusations seemed not plausible. This book shows, that he was sentenced to 3 years in prison (not 10 as one so often reads) for a crime that n-o-b-o-d-y can commit, because it is not a crime. It was just an accusation and a judge who lost control over the PR-work of a selfish State attorney Ralph Guliani. I admit that since reading the book I also admire Mr Milken for his proof, what a man, his wife and chidren can endure.Read this book just to show reverence to a great man of history who will never surrender, be it to unjustified accusations or to death in form of cancer, and to whom scholars in the next century will look as a magnificent thinker of the last century.Dr. Rudolf C. King"},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"This book describes eloquently how Michael Milken and the junkbond market that he pioneered in the US created wealth despiteall the populist reports to the contrary. Fischel shows howhigh yield bonds led to a huge increase in share holder wealthand to productivity gains in American companies - gains thateventually made these companies world beaters in the 90's.This market, however, was destroyed by over zealous regulatorswho frequently disregarded the civil liberties of junk bondpractitioners and in particular Michael Milken. Indeed, Fischelcompares the prosecution of Milken and his cohorts to theMcCarthy era excesses of the fifties; and he makes a convincingcase.Many of the so called &quot;crimes&quot; to which Milken pled guiltywere technical violations and they may not have evenbeen that. The author shows how Milken compromised in the faceof continual and unscrupulous government and press harrasment.Despite his compromise, and the nebulous nature of his &quot;crimes&quot;he was sent to prison. In short, Milken was ruthlessly madea scapegoat for &quot;the decade of greed&quot;; his real crimebeing that he had made a fortune.Milken was certainly not the only victim, however.Those who worked in this market often came from outside theblue blood financial establishment and were resented for it.Lisa Jones, for example, was a teenage runaway who had madesomething of her life against all odds. She served a prisonsentence for allegedly perjuring herself in a descriptionof events that the courts eventually found were not a crime.In short, the assualt on the Junk bond market was a victoryfor establishment insiders over energetic and innovativeoutsiders.While it is upsetting that a well-functioning and efficientmarket was severley disrupted and nearly closed down. This isnot the most disturbing aspect of the book. The most disturbingaspect is the illustration of how individual liberties weregiven such short shrift in the pursuit of populist goals.The American constitution was designed to protect theunpopular, but Fischel shows how it failed to protectMilken and others.This book provides an excellent description of some partsof the US finacial markets and so it is on reading lists ineconomics and business departments in universities as far afield as SouthAfrica. However, it should also be put on reading lists bylaw, sociology and politics departments as an example ofhow the government can get you, if it wants you.If there is a criticism of the book, it is that some of theexplanations are a bit long winded. But these can be skipped,and so there is no doubt that anyone interested in financialmarkets or civil liberties should buy this book."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"Finally a book written by someone who understands capital markets as opposed to journalists-turned-financial experts (e.g., &quot;Predators Ball&quot;), catering to popular sentiment (it's book sales, stupid!) and demonstrating astonishing financial naivity. Professor Fischel's account of Milken's financial innovation may never score big with general public, but it is a must-read for all finance practitioners and, hopefully, government officials, including NYC mayor."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"I found this book to be very informative on the rise and fall of Michael Milken as well as on the general regulatory responses to the various financial \\"crises\\" of the 1980's.First of all, the author is a professor of law and business at the University of Chicago who is very sympathetic to laissez-faire economics. Although the writing can be a little repetitive and overly detailed at times, I, as a graduate student of engineering, still found the style of writing very enjoyable. If you know a little bit about free market economics and a little bit about investing then you should find this book very accessible.Second of all, this book offers a compelling defense of Michael Milken. If only Daniel Fischel was his defense attorney! Fischel persuasively argue that the charges against Michael Milken were incredibly vague and the laws used were highly subjective. Furthermore, the author also argues how there was a lot of national sentiment to vilify a Wall Street tycoon, such as Michael Milken, in response to the recent market downturn. Unfortunately, instead of viewing sudden declines in market prices as a consequence of overvalued securities, many individuals find it much more emotionally satisfying to blame a successful stock speculator for their losses, regardless of if the stock trader actually did anything wrong.Further still, Fischel reveals how truly productive Michael Milken was. Milken greatly expanded the use of high-yield (viciously called \\"junk\\") bonds in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions, which in turn revolutionized corporate restructuring.Book is of great relevance today. From reading this book, you will learn of the emotionally-driven demands for the Federal government to respond to dips in the financial market. In response to the Savings and Loans crisis, Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), which essentially created a government-backed oligopoly of bond credit agencies (i.e., S&P;, Moody's and Fitch.) Note that these are the very same ratings agencies who are currently being blamed for the subprime housing crisis today.This book is also of great relevance for the 2008 presidential primaries. First, Senator Barack Obama is calling for \\"21st century regulations\\" of stock speculators. Reading the regulatory responses in this book offers a very recent parallel to today's debate. Second, you will read about Senator John McCain's membership in the \\"Keating Five\\", a group of five legislators accused of improperly aiding Charles Keating, the colorful chairman of a failed Savings and Loan.The most chilling chapter is the one that focuses on Rudy Giuliani as the relentless prosecutor of Michael Milken. Rudy Giuliani is portrayed as a ruthless attorney who will stop at nothing to incriminate speculators accused of insider trading. Specifically, you will learn about how Giuliani was the first to use the RICO Act, a federal law originally used to prosecute organized crime, for Wall Street traders. If the portrayal of Giuliani in this book is accurate, it is a stark contrast to the Rudy Giuliani of 2008, who campaigned for the Republican nomination while touting the virtues of the free market, especially in health care.If you are interested in financial economics, the recent history of investing, free market economics or just what really happened with Michael Milken, then I cannot recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"Michael Milken, so says David Kelley, has done more to help humanity than Mother Teresa ever did (it'd be interesting to hear what Christopher Hitchens has to say about it). He could be right; Milken's ideas about an overlooked &quot;niche&quot; in corporate paper - the region known as &quot;junk&quot; - turned the staid banking industry on its head, and in the process cleaned house in a number of other industries. MCI and McCaw cellular were created with Milken's help, and put an end to the AT&amp;T monopoly; indeed, many people today are disconnecting their wireline phones as they talk on a cell and surf on a cable modem. T. Boone Pickens was able to bring the oil industry to a more rational level after it overbuilt for the 70's oil crisis. Ted Turner took a little TV concern in Atlanta to a nationwide audience, then went on to start CNN, and today the cable industry is far more interesting than the Big 3 networks.In the process, Milken made many powerful enemies, who eventually turned to the federal government, and an ambitious prosecutor by the name of Rudolf Giuliani (who wanted to become Mayor of NY, NY) to pay Milken back. Milken's marketable and profitable bonds were known as junk because Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's services often overlook talent and entrepreneurial vigor in favor of longevity. It was only government interference in the market in the late 80's that brought down the market (by such atrocities as FIRREA); this fact did not stop critics of Savings and Loans from blaming Milken for that fiasco. Fischel explains the major S&amp;L trials, as well as the Milken trial, and finds the government guilty of propping up an industry that was insolvent by 1980, made no sense after Congress bailed it out, and ultimately cost taxpayers more than if Congress had merely let it die in 1980.Still, the conspiratorial tone is a little much, and Fischel accepts a fool's errand in trying to defend people whose names have become euphemisms for greed. People actually think that the Michael Douglass character in Wall Street, Gordon Gekko, was a real person. It would be worth reading Burton Folsom's _Myth of the Robber Barons_ and understand his differentiation between business entrepreneurs and political entrepreneurs before reading _Payback_."},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"At the time this book was published in 1995, Daniel Fischel was a professor of law and business at the University of Chicago Law School.

It really cuts through the BS and takes an honest look at the world of high finance. In the beginning it dissects insider trading and applicable laws in great detail so we have a good basis for what the prosecution was about. It's been said that statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics. In a similar vein, when the economy gets tough, our Gov't (and their minions) get dirty. Daniel Fischel documents this fact in spellbinding detail in this book.I bought my copy in 2005 in order to prepare and educate myself for the coming subprime mortgage meltdown. Wow! There's nothing like a good honest look at history to see what the future has in store. And now I am here in 2012, and the parade of Gov't idiots and populist nonsense is only just beginning. At this moment I am looking at page 212 where Fischel is bearing down on \\"government's scapegoating\\" (S&L; crisis), and presciently predicted, \\"Elected officials who see an opportunity to extract political contributions and other favors often are eager to help. Elected officials and regulators know that there is a good chance the problem will get worse, but they don't care. By the time the industry's problems become too visible to be ignored, they will be long gone and a new generation of elected officials and regulators in place. And for this new generation, the 'crisis' presents additional opportunities to search for scapegoats and 'rescue' the industry. These efforts are then used to convince taxpayers, who are left to foot the bill, that the government is on their side and something is being done to bring the guilty to justice.\\"Holy cats! How true with this current crisis again today? Remember Rohmbo's infamous phrase, \\"Let no good crisis go to waste\\"? They propped up the ailing banks with bailouts (again), and once these banks are making profits they extort cash settlements 'cause somebody used a rubber stamp to sign foreclosure documents. Never mind the fact that the people who borrowed the money hadn't paid the mortgage payments in about 3 or 4 years. To politicians on the hunt, the intent of the law isn't important! It's the failure to dot the i's and cross the t's that counts. The important thing for politicians is to wack someone with high profile, extort cash, and to create the illusion for the public that heavy handed political bullies are necessary to keep those naughty bankers and hot shot financiers from getting out of line. Notice that the plaintiffs seldom go to jail. That'd be like killing the golden goose from a gov't official's point of view, and oh how they love those deep pockets. Meanwhile the root causes are never really addressed - Fannie and Freddie are allowed to exist as zombies on a steady intravenous drip of taxpayers dollars, banks are logjammed with technicalities while foreclosures are allowed to rot on the vine, upside down mortgagees are encouraged to quit making payments, and the only one really getting wacked in the long run is the taxpayer.But back to the book: There was a reviewer who complained about the later part of the book going into detail with the savings and load fiasco. I couldn't disagree more. To me this was the main impetus for buying this book and an integral key to the main subject of this story.I could go on and on, but I thank God for Fischel's insightful review of this fascinating epoch in the history of finance and the economy. This book is a lodestone for those few who are not satisfied with the placebo dope (smoke and mirrors) our Gov't is so anxious to shovel down our throats. I thank God too for the spirit of freedom of the press and people like Daniel Fischel who are bold enough to tell it!"},{"Title":"Payback: Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken and His Financial Revolution, The","review":"Great book.

She puts a personal ad in the newspaper and encourages her friends to set her up on blind dates, with disasterous results. If you've ever been on a bad date, this book will make you laugh. My only criticism of this book is that the ending was rather open, leaving me hanging. Still, a fun read, excellent for the beach or pool."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"As the other reviewers have stated, this is funnier than Bridget Jones. Tiffany more sophisticated and independent. Looking forward to my 2nd read."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Originally I had to be hasseled by my friend to read it, having been more a fan of the classics myself, I mean how good can a book with a hot pink cover be? Well I abandoned those thoughts after the first few pages! And I skipped school to finish it the next day. Its a fabulous book, and I cant wait to read more like it!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I really enjoyed this book - very funny and witty.

This was a real treat to read, and quite cheery."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"It took me three weeks or at least it seemed like it to wade through Bridget Jones' Diary, while I speed through Tiffany in two days!! The book tells the tale of Tiffany Trott, a British 30 something in search of the perfect man to marry. A must read"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT by Isabel WolffI hadn't read a really good CHICK LIT book in a while, but here's one I highly recommend: THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT by Isabel Wolff. It reminded me somewhat of the heroine of BRIDGET JONES DIARY, since both books portrayed a woman that was far from perfect, and had a problem meeting Mr. Right. The tone of both books I found similar as well, and I think it helped me get into TIFFANY TROTT that much faster. But, while there have been a lot of imitations out there since DIARY came out, I think this one stands alone as one of the few that I feel is not an imitation, but the real thing.Poor Tiffany Trott doesn't seem to have any luck with men. One boyfriend was obsessed with golf (and other women) and another was obsessed with women's clothing. After much frustration, Tiffany decides to put an ad in the newspaper to see if she could find a decent man worth keeping. Her adventures in dating had me laughing-out-loud. When she makes a new best friend, Kate, who is also single and having men troubles, the two of them decide to team up and try the singles' \\"meet \`n greet\\" parties and raves. These lead to more funny adventures in dating that had me smiling.Among all the men she meets, the one she cannot forget is from the newspaper ad and who called himself \\"Seriously Successful\\". After a wonderful first date, she knows she's met Mr. Right, but he is honest enough to let her know he's married, and is trying to find someone on the side. (He's unhappily married, and refuses to divorce his wife so as to not devastate his teenage daughter). She backs off and turns him down, but he is the one that she dreams of at night, wishing he were free. No matter whom she meets, she always finds herself thinking of him.Besides the adventures in dating, THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT is filled with a lot of fun characters that populate Tiffany's world. I felt it was the characters that made this book a fun read, not the actual plot. Some of these characters were larger than life and were exaggerations of real-life people that we may meet on the street, but I think this fact helped to make the book entertaining and enjoyable. I'm giving this book four stars, and if there is a sequel to THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT, I'll be the first in line to read it. It is probably going to be one of the funnier books I will read this year."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Poor Tiffany Trott is having one heck of a time trying to find the right guy and her friends and family aren't making things any easier with their snide and hurtful comments about the men in her life. Meanwhile, Tiffany can feel her biological and romantic clock ticking away and is beginning to feel a bit panicky about her chances of ever finding someone to marry.And then, as luck would have it, the right guy comes along...except...he happens to be married. Turns out he's game for an affair but Tiffany (who is Truly Tempted) isn't ready to forego marriage just yet. So she goes back to the dating game, even trying the personals and dating agencies. Meanwhile, she can't stop thinking of the married guy, who she has nicknamed &quot;Seriously Successful&quot;.I found myself rooting for Tiffany, mainly because she was not only likeable but not the type of fairy tale princess found in many romance novels. Instead she is a resilient woman (if a bit downhearted from time to time) who is all too aware of the pitfalls of relationships. She's had her share of failed romances and rejections but is willing to jump into the fray once again.Tiffany's &quot;trials&quot; are chronicled with a dose of humor that had me laughing out loud in more than a few spots. Also, the book doesn't just center on Tiffany but provides a sharp view of the London social scene as well. Mostly, this was just a fun read, light but not too fluffy. I look forward to more books about Tiffany."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"What a wonderful book - clever, fast, funny and well-written. Tiffany is a wonderful character - someone we can all relate to. I couldn't stop turning the pages. How wrong you are Jennifer. I highly recommend this book. A must read."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Absolutely brilliant - I chuckled all the way through and kept turning the pages more rapidly as I neared the end. The witty dialogue has enriched my own vocabulary - can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Finally, a book that doesn't strive (unsuccessfully) to be the next Bridget Jones- Tiffany is as adorable and charming as Bridget herself. I couldn't put this book down!To be fair, the ending was a bit unrealistic- I struggled to believe and understand the characters' motivations and feelings that led up to that point.However, the incredible humor and wit compensated for a less-than-rational ending. Tiffany's &quot;trials&quot; were priceless!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I came to this book in a roundabout way. Searching for advice about creative writing (I'm a mature student) I found myself in Isabel Wolf's website, and I rather liked the sound of Tiffany Trott (I got divorced last year) so I went to the bookstore and bought the book. I don't regret it! It was a riot of laughter and funny situations from from the moment when Tiffany answers her first personal and it kept me gripped for four hours straight. *The Trials of Tiffany Trott* is a nice, engrossing read, because all along you keep wondering who - out of all these guys - many of them quite horrible - she's gonna end up with. I loved BJD but I thought this was wonderful also - a very refreshing, and at times hysterically funny take on being a single city woman, whilst not being vulgar or lewd. Tiffany is clearly cultivated (hence references to Solzehnitsin and Schopenhauer) and at times she can be a snob(she reminded me, slightly, of a toned down female version of Frasier in some ways) - and this book will therefore appeal more to the intelligent reader. The humor is smart, and in some places quite black - like when she worries that one of her dates might have hereditary alzheimer's, so quizzes him, over dinner, to test his memory! Having said all of the foregoing - there are definitely faults (hence four stars, not five) - the book is a bit long, overly episodic, and some of the characters are too sketchy, but this didin't spoil it overall because I just found it so funny and there aren't many books I can say that about."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I made the mistake of picking this up because it was recommended to those who love the Shopaholic series. Let me be clear, Tiffany Trott is in no way on par with the loveable and hilarious Shopaholic. All British gals are not created equal. Tiffany's narrative was extremely tedious and in no way entertaining. She's whiny and obsessed with finding a long-term boyfriend. The flirting in the book was lame, overdone, and none of the characters managed to endear themselves to me. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I expected this to be yet another Brit-lit romp following on the coattails of Bridget Jones but I was pleasantly surprised. The writing is fresh, the characters are appealing (especially the lesbian couple Tiffany meets at the birthing classes~) and the style of the book overall is very intelligent. Best of all, the jokes are great. Tiffany has some truly terrible dates, but I liked her self=restraint as she makes caustically accurate observations in her head about them, but is too self=restrained to let rip and say what's *really* on her mind. I'd heard a lot about this book, and I've had a fun time breezing thro it over these past couple of days."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Well, what do I say? The book started out, and I genuinely laughed out loud a few times. Tiffany and her motley assortment of friends had some funny observations on life, and I enjoyed bits of the snarky humor. I did find Tiffany a bit self absorbed and hard to like, but figured she would redeem herself part way through the book. I mean, everyone has to grow up, right? But the truth is, by half way through, I not only found that I didn't like or empathize with her, but that she was a bit of an idiot. I couldn't see why her friends liked her, since everything seemed to be about her. She never did grow up. So, for over 400 pages, I was reading about someone who had the emotional maturity of a 4 year old, AND SHE NEVER CHANGED. Then, the ending came. And it wasn't an ending. So, for over 400 pages, I went along thinking at least the ending will give some closure, but it didn't. I am really disappointed. This book started out with such promise."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read this ten years ago when it first came into paperback, gave away my copy and have regretted it every since. This book is just so funny. Anyone who says they've never been in the dating game is either a liar, a nun, in the closet or unhappily married and carrying on affairs. The dating game isn't funny, but Ms. Wolff's send-up of it is.However, I think the funniest parts are where Tiffany recounts everyday problems such as her exasperation with her name, which in full is Tiffany Nichola Trott. The uproar she describes when her trunk arrived at her girls' school as a child, emblazoned with her initials, TNT, made me put my head down and laugh until no sound was left. My-guy-friend-who-doesn't-read said to me in disbelief, \\"ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?\\"Then there's the sarcastic vicar of her church who refers to some members of his congregation as \\"his Christmas roses.\\" We have Easter lilies at my Episcopal church, so I know what he means. It's nice to read about a character who goes to church where the churchgoing is part of the story, not a sermon within the book.It's a fun book, and even funnier if you've done dating services, because you recognize the situations she mentions---because you've been there. She says what you wish you'd said."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I've been seduced by the &quot;chick lit&quot; genre, but this book is hardly worth reading. While there are a few funny moments, I found myself skimming over the many boring parts. And while the ending isn't predictable, I still found it rather corny."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I am not someone who often gives up on a book. I plodded through this book for about 200 pages or so before finally giving up on it. It wasn't funny, like the cover promised, but worse I felt after 200 pages like I still didn't know anything about the main character. The author barely gets into her emotions and none of the other characters are fleshed out well at all. A big disappointment for someone who wouldn't have minded a Bridget Jones knockoff."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Comparisons between between Tiffany and Bridget, two British, 30-something neurotic career women in search of romance and marriage, are inevitable. While both are entertaining, and will resonate with just about any woman with a comparable demographic profile of the two protagonists, TIFFANY comes up short in much the same way BRIDGET did. TIFFANY is an enjoyable and easy (if not a tad too long) read, but doesn't live up to the promised jacket cover premise: that over the course of the novel, she sees the downside of marriage and family in her friends' lives, and comes to appreciate her own life and the value of singledom."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I loved following Tiffany in her search. Very funny and enjoyable. A nice way to escape for an afternoon! Also check out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin for a good cry!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was clever, interesting, and a down right good time. I don't know if I loved it more than than the lovely MS. JONES (as others have stated) but, I do really suggest picking it up. I've passed it on to lots of friends and it's become our latest bookclub book. If there really is a sequel due...I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book. It was very lighthearted, and enjoyable, however, I was quite dissapointed with the end."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"To begin, I should confess that I LOVED Bridget Jones's Diary. In fact, I thought it was one of the funniest books I have read -- ever. I thought that I would love Tiffany Trott too but unfortunately, I kept waiting for her to get some courage or buck up. Something. She was likable. She did make me laugh. But, she annoyed me too. By about page 5, I was very sick of &quot;I didn't really say that...I actually said . . .&quot; phrase. Sometimes it was on a page 3 times. But, if you can over look that, you will probably really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"As a huge fan of chik books, I read the description and several reviews of this book. THinking it sounded incredible I purchased it. Biggest mistake. The character of Tiffany was not only annoying, but also repetitious. After reading the first 15 pages and noting Tiffany's actions and statements, you have read the entire book. She does not change or grow at all throughout the novel. I have never been so bored reading a book- I kept thinking it has to get better! Nope, it sure didn't. I couldn't wait to put it down. It was not funny. . .just annoying."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"In this day and age, very appropriate, but it was a good story that still has me scared a few years later."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I am amazed that this book received so many high ratings. I found this book depressing and extremely whiny. It's main character and her best friends seem to do nothing, but sit around and whine about how there are no good men anymore. Even children in this book, seem to find matrimony or lack thereof the only worthy subject. They seem to completely discount their success, careers, interests, ambitions, and everything else that doesn't involve getting some guy to propose. Granted I am not a 37 year old single woman, but I hope if I ever find myself in that situation, I will enjoy my life a whole lot more than those women do."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I don't get the good reviews on this one. I forgot it almost immediately after I finished it. True, there are some funny parts, and it was a decent way to pass the time sitting in airports, but most of the humor was the typical British stuff and the main character failed to gain my sympathy even til the end. Recommended only if a) you're hooked on this stuff so even the not-so-good is okay or b) you've read all the current chick-lits including both Shopaholics and there's nothing else for you to cover?"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is celebrating her birthday and possibly an engagement, or so she thinks, until her boyfriend dumps her.From here on in, Tiffany is on a mission - to find Mr Right before she becomes wrinkly and decrepid. There are blind dates, personal ads, old school friends, singles dinners, agencies and holidays to be tried and tested to sniff out the right bloke.Although this story does have some quite funny scenes, it was not terribly interesting for me. Every time I picked the book back up, I had to try and figure which man she was talking about. Unfortunately it was a case of too many men with forgettable inadequacies.I also tired of the naive nature of the main character, Tiffany. I had had enough of the &quot;Actually I didn't say that, I really said...&quot; scenario. I did finish the book, but I don't feel compelled to try more from this author."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read this book very soon after reading Bridget Jones' Diary, and I thought the wit was a lot better in BJD. This book had its moments, but it really felt like a lesser version of BJD. And who knows, maybe Tiffany came before Bridget. In any case, either or both of these books are good reads for women who are in the dating scene -- they make you realize that all those losers are just a part of the game (and Smug Marrieds are EVERYWHERE)! Also, the Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing (I think that's the exact title) is a good companion to either of these."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I expected more out of this book. Perhaps it is just that I am not 39 and husband-hunting, or maybe it is that I don't spend more than half my day thinking about designer clothes -- my designer clothes, the designer clothes of my friends and the designer clothes of the various people I meet -- or maybe it's just that I don't resonate with the refrains of the book hahahhahah, go to work on an egg, hahahaha, but try as I might, I could not relate to the characters in this book. I really tried to relate. I wanted to like the book, I wanted to like the characters, to empathize with their situations, etc., but in the end, I was disappointed. Other than the characters, I found the story quite entertaining in its pace and setup."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Of all the single brit-gal books i've read, this is the worst. Why? Well this Tiffany girl obviously doesn't have it together... but that doesn't mean that the quality of the book has to be just as messy. The whole book could have been maybe 200 pages- if that. But instead, Wolff just goes over and over in circles with people and conversations that just don't belong in the novel. I haven't read any other book by Isabel Wolff, so the unnecessary foolishness in this novel may not be attributed to her writing style as an author. I've read most of the books on some members' twenty-something &quot;girly&quot; books and if I were you, I'd read any of those novels over this one. Some may like it... not me."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"i love bridget jones's diary. that pretty much tells everything about me. so, like many other bridgetlites, after finishing bjd 1 and 2 (plus her guide to life and the movie, of course) i decided to try other books in the field. i read anna maxted, louise rennison, and finally stumbled across &quot;the trials of tiffany trott&quot;. the cover looked interesting and the flip wasn't too bad so i bought it. maybe i'd love it, i thought. and now, 404 pages later, i hate it. this book is so predictable and underwritten that a 7-year old could have done a better job. this book could have been a pamplet with it's horrible storyline that a quarter-way through i was already yawning and waiting for the end, when finally the foolish &quot;heroine&quot; would shag SS and the whole sorry affair would end. if you haven't already bought the book or read it, i urge you to pass it unless you like being bored to tears."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Here's what you should do. Get yourself a stack of books by authors like Katie Fforde, Christina Jones, Linda Taylor, Louise Bagshawe, Laura Zigman, Maeve Haran, Fiona Walker, Melissa Nathan, Jenny Colgan, and Victoria Corby. Heck, throw in the two \\"Bridget Jones\\" books (if you're one of the two people on the planet who haven't read them.) Then, start reading them one by one. In-between each of them, read a chapter of Tiffany Trott. It's a good palette cleanser. But it's not really a cogent novel, the plot is non-existent. You can tell it's derived from a weekly column, because it reads like one - definitely a modern day \\"Perils of Pauline\\". And that's OK - it's very witty, and at times I found it laugh out loud hysterical. But I didn't find it satisfying as a novel. If you want witty writing AND a coherent plot, look to the writers I list above. Especially Jenny Colgan and Victoria Corby, for their books are just so funny - and quick and light reads. (For those of you in the US, many of these authors are hard to find but are worth the search.) Don't write off Tiffany Trott - just don't expect a lot from it."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott really left something to be desired. The characters were one dimensional and boring. Half way through the story I could have cared less if I even continued. The premise of the story is that Tiffany Trott is a single girl, who mind you gets dumped on her birthday and is trying to find love. She places an ad in the paper and gets a number of responses. One is from Seriously Successful, whom she falls for. But, the catch is he is married. She works hard to meet someone else ... and as you can tell ends up happily ever after (or there about). I really wish that the story could have been more interesting. Create some characters who a 30 something woman can feel for. Instead I read this wondering how she could write so many pages of dribble."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"No, I am not Isabel Wolff. Nor am I a personal friend or business associate. However, I did happend to read TTT several years ago when it was serialized in The Telegraph. I loved her character so much that whenever I am in London I find myself on a quest for \\"Tiffany\\"...In contrast, I could not force myself to read Bridget Jones... Her character was simply too neurotic to admire."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I have to say, that after reading all of the reviews of this book, I was really looking forward to this one. And I was highly disappointed. Tiffany Trott has to be one of the most annoying female characters I have ever read. Bridget Jones, she is not. I took this book with me on vacation and was expecting to finish it in a day or so. It took me 5 days to dredge through all the horrific dates in this book. I kept on through it all, hoping that the ending would redeem the rest of the novel. No such luck. (Upon finishing this book, I threw it against the wall of my hotel room in disgust)! Tiffany Trott as a book and a character has little, if any, redeeming qualities. My advice: stick to Bridget and leave this wannabe alone!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I guess the title should have been my first clue. This book cannot be compared to &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; in the least! The dialogue is among the worst and most stilted I have ever read. Tiffany's men are introduced 3 to a chapter, and I found myself absolutely sympathizing with them, poor as they are portrayed to be. I could not stand that woman either! No wonder she is 37 and single. Stay away from this novel; if you pick it up expecting a hilarious frank narrative by the likes of Helen Fielding, you will be as disgusted as I was."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I recently, just finished reading this book. At first it seemed like a good book to read. But in the end, I was very disappointed. I thought it was going to better."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This novel is just childish and silly. If you enjoy books such as Bridget Jones Diary and 4 Blondes, you will enjoy this silly book also."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I am on a real British humour kick at the moment and lots of these books make me smile but this one had me laughing from cover to cover. It was a riot! From the moment Tiffany is dumped at the start to the twists and turns of her indefatigable journey through the London 'love jungle' right through to the last page I was really rooting for her, and laughing with her, and quite often AT her. She is a real emotional klutz at times but very endearing and witty. I liked the way she never gives up. From small ads, to dating agencies to lesbian mothers-to-be and a coconut-throwing competition at Club Med this is contemporary comedy at its best."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is funny and entertaining, but is no comparison to Bridget Jones. While Bridget is funnier and more entertaining, Tiffany is a tad desperate and annoying. However, if you enjoy this genre of dating problem / funny novels, you will enjoy this one too. The ending,though, was extremely disappointing. It made me wonder why I read the book. Take it to the beach, breeze through it, then read Bridget Jones's sequel- On the Edge of Reason."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book is not a stand out and I now wish that I could have back the time that I used reading it. I ended up reading the entire thing, not because it was brilliant, but because I tend to commit to a book unless it just stinks horribly. While this book did not reek, per se, I did have to struggle with the desire to just let it go. It wasn't engaging and it wasn't thrilling. Frankly, I was pretty bored by it. It had a good heart, but that's about all I can say.As a specific critique, I would say that none of the characters were at all well-fleshed out--I mean, at the beginning of the book, the way the author just listed the friends and the stereotypes to which their behavior would adhere was my first tip-off, but I thought surely the good reviews here meant that something better was coming. To my dismay, it was not. None of the characters ever came to life as separate individuals--they all sounded like the author. Not even Tiffany, the main character (!). I have no idea why the Club Med scenes tend to stand out for anyone, either. The resolution to each characters' problems were rather boring and forced. Happy endings are great, but what has the author got against a few pinches of reality every now and then?The last paragraph of the book was good--perhaps the only dose of reality in the entire book. But that one small bit of actual character development was not enough to redeem it. If you're a single girl looking for a good book to read, I'd suggest you continue your search."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read the customer reviews about this and was really excited to read it, expecting to laugh out loud as I followed Tiffany's dating disasters. I didn't. I barely even laughed at all. It was a slow read for me, considering that it is a &quot;chick lit&quot; book, which I love."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I am in my upper 20's and truly enjoyed the book &quot;Getting Over It&quot;. I looked for recomendations based on that book and &quot;The Trials of Tiffany Trott&quot; was suggested to me. I did not enjoy the book. If you are looking for a story about a sad woman who cannot ever find a man, then you might enjoy this. The whole book is date after unsucsessful date. And the ending was very disappointing to me. If you enjoyed &quot;Getting Over It&quot; like I did, I would steer clear of this book, it is not the same humor."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"The characters in this book are absolutely pathetic! Tiffany is a desperate woman looking for a husband through personal adds, dating agencies, etc. Not only was the leading lady pathetic, she was absolutely boring too. Not a single joke was remotely funny. If you want a really great British romance/comedy read Marian Keyes."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I recently read a review that claimed that The Trials of Tiffany Trott was excellent, &quot;better than Bridget Jones.&quot; I am an avid reader and just could not bear to even pick up the book. I could not even finish the last ten pages. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fun, lighthearted comedies, because this book is not one of them."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"After a string of failed relationships (including one with the philandering Philip and Laura-Ashley-wearing Alex), all Tiffany Trott wants to find is an \\"ok-looking-bordering-on-the-almost-acceptable\\" man who isn't afraid of commitment and doesn't play golf. Is that too much to ask? Well, yes, as Tiffany finds to her dismay. Despite the assitance of personal ads, singles events, Club Med vacations and introduction agencies, Tiffany can't seem to find men who aren't heartless, lecherous, stuck in adolescence or...worst of all...married! Thank God she has her friends' marital disasters and pregnancies to pull her attention away from her dismally single state and to help her avoid an entanglement with the one highly unsuitable man who has captured her fancy.Disappointed is the nicest word I can use to describe my feelings about this book. Isabel Wolff is a talented writer, as she's proven in her most recent works (A Vintage Affair and The Very Picture of You.) Those works showcase her clever humor and witty dialogue. Unfortunately, although this book, her first published, has rough glimpses of those traits, they are overshadowed by the meandering plot and suboptimal characters. These faults are slightly redeemed by Tiffany's hilarious internal commentary (especially the things she would say but doesn't) and her oblivion to her faults (including her obsession with a most undesirable suitor). Too, Ms. Wolff ably captures the life of a single girl on the hunt, full of an equal mix of optimism and despondency. Though I was quickly wearied by the story, I read on doggedly to the end, sure that it would make up for the majority of the book. When I got to the last page, however, I was so upset by the non-ending and completely regretted the time I spent on it. So, unless you just want a laugh, I'd recommend skipping this book and reading Ms. Wolff's much more delightful and absorbing A Vintage Affair!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This was an enjoyable book, but not &quot;unputdownable&quot; and definitely not memorable. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more in the summer on the beach. But it's fun, light reading, and I even laughed out loud a few times. It actually reads more like a series of short anecdotes, which makes sense since it is based on the character of the author's newspaper column. I think I would have enjoyed it more as a weekly column, rather than an entire book. Even the way the book ends makes it seem like you'll be waiting to read about the character's next adventure in next week's column."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I don't know if it was the fact that I read this after reading The Making of Minty Malone, but I just didn't find it anywhere near as fresh or as funny. I wonder would I think otherwise if I had read this first. Nevertheless I will still gibe this 3 stars and Minty 5!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"... I decided to give Tiffany a try. Well, she's no Bridget Jones. The characters are cliches. The plot (such as there is) offers few surprises. And as an American, I just didn't get some of the humor. But most of the book is so unamusing, I'm sure many Brits don't get it either. In short, save your money and re-read Bridget Jones instead."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Isabel Wolff is a very good writer - this book is extremely funny, extremely clever and great, great fun to read. I found it uplifting, inspiring but so realistic and easy to relate to -her descriptions of London and the 38 bus made me feel very involved as she goes to all the places I do! Tiffany is a very sympathetic, likeable character and she is surrounded by lots of lovely people - except for her ghastly dates! I LOVED the way she kept saying &quot;actually I didn't say that... what I did say was....&quot; - this is SO true to life! Which of us haven't done that! Unlike other reviewers I didn't find this irritating at all but just painfully funny. I think this would make a wonderful film or television series as the scenes are all so beautifully sketched and really conjure up a picture. ... Tiffany is a lovely book and I can't wait to read Minty Malone - Isabel Wolff's second book."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I bought this at the airport on my way to London and boy was I glad I did - it kept me laughing all the way to England. A slow start, but by page 10 or so I was hooked as Wolff opened my eyes to the weird and hilarious world of the personals and singles bars. I liked the way Tiffany never lets up in her hunt for her ok-looking-bordering-on-the-almost-acceptable (to quote) 'bloke'. And she finds him in the form of Seriously Successful - a real catch - with a catch. I won't spoil, except to say I loved the way this book has so many twists and turns - and so many jokes my neighbour kept complaining that I was stopping him sleeping. Tiffany is a riot with her great put-downs and eternal optimism as she has one disastrous date after another. Makes my love life seem soooooo great by comparison. I don't go on as many dates as Tiffany does but I could really relate to what happens to her. I liked Tiffany's sharp wit and sense of humour. The book is also very well written - sure it's light fiction, and it's not going to win the Pulitzer, but Wolff has a great writing style. On my way back to New York I bought her latest at Heathrow - OUT OF THE BLUE - about a not so happily-married married woman who works as a TV weather girl. Also very witty, though slightly more serious. But I will look out for anything by this author now - her books are funny, very smart, and stand out from the crowd."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Seriously. You try and pack 5 people in a mini-van between Tennessee and Texas and see if you don't want to kill someone along the way. But wait! There was something to provide relief! The Trials of Tiffany Trott kept me laughing long enough to ignore every irritating moment of the long, long car ride. This book is funny and reminds me of Marian Keyes' work. I appreciated the fact that the ending was not the typical &quot;formula&quot; that is so often used (or should I say over used?). I've been joking lately that with everyone jumping on the Bridget Jones type bandwagon it's like a lot of modern day Jane Austens. You always know what the outcome will be before you read the first line. Not so with this book. Thank you, Isabel Wolff."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I have read some pretty funny novels, but this one tops them all! Having read and enjoyed Making Minty Malone, Isabel Wolff's second novel, I couldn't wait to read this one. I can't believe I hadn't read this book until now! I have no excuses -- people were constantly telling me to read it. I am so glad I did. The story is about serial dater Tiffany Trott and her tenacious search for Mr. Right. She answered personal ads and attended parties for singles. The man of her life was out there, she just had to find him.I couldn't stop laughing at the funny situations that Tiffany had encountered. I lost count of all the men she met in the story, but it was funny that it seemed as though she only attracted dysfunctional men. Or was she the dysfunctional one? There were some incredibly memorable moments in this novel. I loved it when she said, &quot;Actually, I didn't say that at all...&quot; I mean, let's face it. We don't always say what's really on our minds. She was very witty and clever and real and I could definitely identify with her character. Also, I loved the backdrop of London's public transportation. It really made me feel as though I was there with her. Are you looking for an intelligent and hilarious read? Look no further. The Trials of Tiffany Trott is an unpredictable, hilarious and Seriously Successful novel that will keep you turning the pages. A definite must read!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I couldn't put this book down ~~ it was so hilarious and Tiffany's trials with the personals in finding Mr. Right hits the spot. I totally sympathize with her in her quest. The guys she meet are so-so, or delicious but they dump her for the ravishing girl next on the list and so forth. She falls in love with Seriously Successful ~~ can't spoil the ending for you.I have never read any of Isabel Wolff's books and this one fits the modern, dating woman to a tee. Most women I know have dated guys only to groan that they will never find Mr. Right. I can relate to Tiffany as she sees her friends pair off ~~ after which she has helped interfere in some way to bring those people together. Tiffany is an outrageous but lovable character.If you are blue or married but thinking the relationship is so staid, pick up this book. I guarantee that you will be thanking your lucky stars that you're not on a hunt for Mr. Right. However, if you are single, you can totally relate to Tiffany and how she has to go through all the Mr. Wrongs before she found love. Realistically, not all of us have dates every week nor have a job where our hours aren't set, but it's a fun book to read.I highly recommend The Trials of Tiffany Trott."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"A friend lent me this last weekend and I read it in a day - couldn't be parted from it, kept having to sneak back to it to find out how Tiffany's latest date had gone. I was really taken aback by how funny this book is - the writing and jokes are very clever, and I laughed out loud a lot - especially when she went o the Bahamas Club Med. As the book went on it got deeper, especially with the way Tiffany becomes her friend's birth partner - the baby classes were just a hoot and the birth of the baby made me blub! I really liked the way Tiffany is so polite and self-controlled whilst thinking quite vicious things which she keeps to herself. I thought that was very true to life. The characters and situations were so vivid and dramatic that it was like watching a movie - the dialog was so smart and lively. In short, a gripping, intelligent comedy of manners with a lot of feeling too."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read this because it was advertised on the Bridget Jones page and I'm so glad that I did as it kept me wildy entertained for the day and half it took to read. This is not a book to read on the subway though because, like me, you'll be laughing out loud and that could cause problems! I liked Tiffany instantly, her sense of humour is just fantastic and never flags, despite some weird encounters with some very strange guys. The story was totally unpredictable and there were so many nice comic touches - not least the birthing classes Tiffany attends with her friend. This book is a real gem."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott had me in stitches - I laughed more than I have in months. She had SO much bad luck with men, but kept on truckin'. I've been married three years so I don't get to go on dates any more, but I still remember the *trials* of being single, and this made me sympathise with Tiffany's seemingly endless quest. I hope the author didn't really have to meet all those horrible guys but the encounters felt so realistic I guess she probably did! I liked the way Tiffany Trott remained good-natured when faced with men whose wives had died only three weeks before, or who were already married, or who had added a foot to their height, or who were clearly gay. At first I wondered how the author would pull it all into a strong plot as the dates were separate, like pearls on a string. But in the figure of Seriously Successful (great name for a hero!) and the pregnant lesbians she did. Isabel Wolf is a very witty writer, and her distinctive and original humor shines through this funny, gripping and good-natured account of the singleton's search for a good man, or, as the cover says, at least a man who's not wearing womens' underwear...! Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott is a wonderfully funny book! It was a quick read... partly due to the fact that I just didn't want to put it down. Who did she meet for a date next? What incredible thing was going to happen to her on that date?While I don't know anyone who goes out on as many dates as Tiffany did, Isabel Wolff's description was an accurate description of women dating today. For those of us still searching for, &quot;Mr. Right&quot; it will seem only too real! For those of you that have already found your &quot;Mr. Right&quot; you will be thanking your lucky stars as you read of Tiffany's adventures. Either way, it's a delightful read!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Isabel Wolff is a marvelous writer. In THE TRIALS OF TIFFANY TROTT, she has created a lovable heroine who brings us into her life as she shares her travails as a single woman in contemporary London. Tiffany's friends are every bit as interesting as Tiffany herself. As a group, they pretty well explore the modern female condition. The ending of the novel is unexpected and it's a wonderful change of pace from the typical romance. Wolff is an author to watch."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Funnier than Bridget Jones, this is a terrific example of the emerging genre of thirty-something single women seeking Mr. Right. While not an intellectual read, the writing style is fast-paced and extremely witty. I could not put this book down, and found myself laughing out loud at the beach. Even better if you're in advertising!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read mostly literary fiction, so I was nearly put off this book by the horrible, garish cover. But I'm so glad I picked it up as once I had, I just couldn't put the thing down. I'd already read about a third of it in the bookshop - instantly hooked by the wit and humor of the author as her heroine embarks on her search for her perfect man. This book is full of clever irony, hysterically funny moments, surprising plot twists and great set pieces - especially the scenes at Club Med. It's also beautifully written and extremely touching at times. Read it and you, like me, will find yourself laughing out loud on nearly every page."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This was recommended to me so long ago, and I can't believe I waited so long to read it - it's just hilarious!! I breezed thro' it in less than 24 hours and fell totally in love with this witty, sympathetic but flawed heroine and with Wolff's witty writing style. A perfect blend of great humor and pathos, which you'll love if you're a fan of BJD, Marian Keyes or Lisa Jewell. This struck me as being Brit fic at its very best and I now can't wait to read Minty Malone."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Ah, I liked this book. It was a fun and entertaining read and not totally predictable."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"If you can laugh at yourself, that is. If you're not comfortable about being single maybe you won't like it as it comes close to the knuckle a few times. But this is above all smart, VERY funny and well written with bags of warmth and wit - I like that the hero is called Seriously Successful. I did think that the advertising slogans, which are clearly British, should have been 'translated' into US ones, but that criticism aside I thought this was a wonderful read and I'll be reading Making Minty Malone, and anything else by Woolf I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I loved this book - partly because it so aptly describes the singles scene in London, though any one with a sense of humour would recognise their own culture in it. It could probably catch a few on the raw as they recognise their own hang ups in it, so - if you find yourself uncomfortable or angry with what you read, maybe you'd better look at your own motives and get the necessary help - dating agencies certainly seemed to help Tiffany and, as she shows, those who try them aren't all sad, lonely singles! Have a good read, a good laugh, and maybe try some of Tiffany's own medecine for a different outlook on your life!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I picked up Tiffany Trott because I was looking for something to tide me over while I waited for another &quot;Bridget&quot; adventure. I was pleasantly sruprised! I found it to be quite interesting and entertaining, but very predictable. Several times I found myself laughing outloud at Tiffany's catchy one-liners, even though I knew that she was just thinking them to herself. Overall, Tiffany Trott was a pleasant read, and I have no problem reccomending it to my friends!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book is along the same format as a lot of books lately seem to be. I all it Bridget-Jonesesque. Not to say that it's a clone of Bridget Jones, but it's the single woman in London looking for a man and success in life, etc.Having said that, I did truly enjoy it. Tiffany finds herself in some very bizaare situations (which is something that I always enjoy in a novel!) and the cast of characters includes some of her friends, who find themselves in equally bizaare situations. (All I'm going to say about that is that the male-bonding retreat chapter is hilarious!)"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"As an unpartnered lady, I think this book was EXCELLENT -- funny, sad and true-to-life. And I just LOVED the &quot;thoughts&quot; -- the &quot;I-didn't-actually-say-that&quot; lines! I thought they were GREAT! No, this ISN'T Bridget Jones, it's different (I liked BJ too, but I don't really get all the parallels. They're two different characters, two different books, by two different authors).As a romantic with a Valentine where her heart ought to be, I didn't care too much for the ending, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, but on the whole, this is a wonderful read for unpartnered ladies -- and just about anyone else!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott's a crazy lovable character. She romps through disaster after disaster but always comes up hoping. The picture of London life is a slight exaggeration, but you could bump into Tiffany all over town - not only in the Ritz ! We enjoyed every page and followed up by reading Isabel Wolff's second novel, &quot;The Making of Minty Malone&quot;, with equal pleasure. We're looking out or the next offering from this entertaining writer."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be full of fun, witty British humor about a single gal. Well, I got the part about single gal right. The book dragged in several places. If you are expecting something on the level of Bridget Jones, Four Weddings and a Funeral, or Sliding Doors, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, the book was only mildly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I am currently on a huge English Humor kick that started when I read Bridget Jones... This was Ok to read but not exactly a thrill. If I wasn't on vacation without other books I probably wouldn't have finished it. I didn't really care what happened to Tiffany, didn't really care who she dated, found her a little boring. The only part I really liked was her pregnant friend."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"for me, i found this book to drag on and on......it finally made me 'laugh out loud' on page 280 with the description of childbirth which, for some reason, struck me to be hilarious, having gone through it three times myself. the rest of the book was fun, but too bad it took 280 pages to get there.the author described too much in detail, leaving not much to the imagination. when she said things she retorted with &quot;i didn't really say that&quot;, this got annoying after the eleventh time. she also went on and on with giving examples, endlessly.anyway, all-in-all, i am glad the trial is finally over. the end was predictable, even though she left us with quite an uncertainty......on to a more funny novel.....i hope."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is a boring, repetitive novel with a weak main character.Actually I didn't say that at all...wait, yes I did! This novel had potential, but it spent more time describing to us Tiffany's odd dates then it did developing the main characters. Tiffany spends so much time pondering love and marriage, and Seriously Successful, that we never hear about her friends, who sounded promising. Tiffany herself also seemed interesting, but you soon lose interest and find yourself not caring if this woman ever finds love or not.There were a few amusing moments, but none that would make this book stand out among the better ones out there.A weak imitation of the better written, and much more appealing, &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;. Another one to try is &quot;Asking For Trouble&quot; if you want to genuinely want to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is not a likeable character. She whines too much about the most trivial things and the funny moments throughout the book are sparse. It's repetitive, with no storyline and you loose interest in her ordeals a quarter into the book.. I can see why she's single...she's utterly annoying. I wouldn't want to date her. TT spends the entire book pining for &quot;super successful&quot;, who is never fleshed out, really, and when he finally is available, she doesn't want to be get married--her main objective of the entire book. She will probably be wondering, ten years from now why she didn't marry him, like she did with Kit--then the sequel will follow: &quot;The dilemma of Tiffany Trott: still single at 47!&quot;Reading all the glowing reviews claiming TT is better than Bridget Jones Diary, I wondered how they could have read the same book I did. The Trials of Tiffany Trott is a &quot;skip it&quot;."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I found the trials of Tiffany to be not so funny . It was a bit long and I found myself skipping paragraphs. Overall, it was cute but not something I would put on a my A list."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is a single girl who gets dumped on her birthday. Rather than wait for Mr. Right to arrive on her doorstop, she goes looking for him, attending class reunions, placing an ad in the personals, and traveling to Club Med.But every man she meets isn't right for her -- one is still living in high school, one is pompous, one is annoying, one is an egocentric TV personality, etc. The only man she clicked with is already married. He wants her to be his companion, she walks away. Or does she?The book started off on a high note -- we meet Tiffany, we meet her friends, we see her get dumped by the guy who likes to wear her underwear. On with the search, which goes on and on and on.The book would've been better if it ended sooner. I know this was supposed to follow a year in her life, from one birthday to the next, but how many bad dates can a person have in 365 days? Is London filled with annoying men? Plus, the author can't decide if she wants the book to be about Tiffany, or her friend Lizzie, or her friend Sally who SUDDENLY becomes pregnant and decides to have the baby on her own. This was thrown in for a twist -- it didn't work.I liked Making Minty Malone (the second book by this author) a lot more -- Minty was a character who had more on her mind than Tiffany. That book also is long, and follows a year in Minty's life, but her life is interesting."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Didn't think it was a terribly good book. Bit boring and not terribly funny. The ending was good but what a pity that it was really only the last page."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I read Wolff's other book (the making of minty malone) before this one, and was very disappointed when I read this one. I felt attached to the title character, but felt she was in a lose lose situation that did not resolve by the end of the book. My suggestion...read Minty Malone...you find out what happened to Tiffany anyway."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This novel is just childish and silly. If you enjoy books such as Bridget Jones Diary and 4 Blondes, you will enjoy this silly book also."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I'd heard a lot about this book, but only recently got round to reading it - wish I hadn't waited so long as it cheered me up after a bad break-up - my problems seemed to pale in comparison to Tiffany's. In short this book is a fabulously funny rollercoaster ride through the dating scene in London, with too many laughs to count and a lot of poignancy too - the birth scene in the hospital was wonderful. Despite the garish cover, this is not a girlie read, but a very intelligent one. A thinplot is more than compensated for by the quality of the characterization, the crisp, witty dialogue and the excellent humor. There are some great British chick fic books out there right now - Marion Keyes, Lisa Jewell - and this is one of the very best."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I picked up this book as it was recommended by Amazon, and I'm glad I did get to read it. It seems that I have been stuck on 30-something Singleton books, even though I'm only 16. Maybe because they give me a ray of hope to my dreary single life. Anyway, this book was quite funny as it plots the mis-adventures of Tiffany Trott as she tries to date the whole Single pool of London, and failing to as she is totally obsessed with this Seriously Successful whom she met from an ad, who is married, and just wants a casual affair. Through all her trials, you feel for Tiffany, and you get at sense of triumph at the end...just as she does. Read, and see what happens!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"A very funny book that most women can relate to. Tiffany is funny, witty, tempermental, and is definitely afraid of commitment! I couldn't put the book down until I read it all. Nice ending!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I will say that this novel can be funny. However, a book length riff on a 37 year old career woman's endless dates wears thin after awhile. Dismayed that all of her friends are marrying, TT dates just about every nightmare guy you can imagine, some courtesy of dating bureaus and personals' ads. These encounters can be really hilarious. The best guy of the bunch is married and looking for an affair, claiming he can't get a divorce. One annoying thing that TT does throughout is give stinging, witty comebacks to other characters and then tell you, in the next breath, she didn't have the nerve to say that after all. She only wished she could say it. If this was meant to be a comic device, it didn't work for me. Romance readers may not be happy with the ending, which is ambiguous instead of definitive with Mr. Right. An ambiguous ending was ok with me because I was never convinced TT really knew what she wanted in a man or a marriage. She seemed suited to being single."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany Trott is a feast of truly witty jokes, well-drawn characters and superbly visualized plot lines. Reading it is almost like watching a film. Indeed, I think it would make a wonderful film - a much better one than other London-based comedy-romances, such as Sliding Doors. Isabel Wolff's book had me laughing out loud and, although I read a great deal, I don't often guffaw on the Tube during the London rush hour. I received some funny looks, I can tell you! The book is well-written, yet the language is easily accessible so that reading is no effort at all. I was particularly moved by the birth scene at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, and I found the mobile phone on the bus scene absolutely side-splitting. I'm afraid that I can't possibly agree with 'Pathetic' of Boston, one thing this book isn't is 'Pathetic'."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I found this book a bit slow at first, but by about page 20 I was totally hooked and couldn't put it down. From Tiffany's first date onwards the story just grabbed me by the neck and took me along with it at an exhiliarating pace. I loved all Tiffany's dates - even the terrible ones - because they were all redeemed by Wolff's great sense of humour. I haven't laughed as much at this as a book for ages. The humour is unusual - not at all 'girlie' - but sophisticated and full of intelligent ironies. Sometimes Wolff slips in the jokes so subtly that you almost miss them - it's so clever and sly. I adored the section at Club Med with the coconut-throwing competition - and the way all the staff there said everything in about 20 different languages. I also liked the fact that all the jokes seemed to be on Tiffany herself - it's not a cruel or judgemental book. This book is a must for anyone who's ever been looking for love - and, like Tiffany, can laugh at themselves."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Upon learning that this book was similar to Bridget Jones Diary, I knew I had to read it. I am so glad I did! As a single woman looking for Mr. Right, I could certainly relate to Tiffany's trials. The book is funny and inspiring, and although I must admit that I feared for the ending, it was pulled off just beautifully. I cannot wait to read more from Isabel Wolff!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book had me in stitches. Successful, independent, lovable, thirty-eight year old Tiffany has it all except for a man in her life. Oh, there've been boyfriends but they have been a hopeless cast of oddballs. The harder Tiffany tries to land herself a man, the worse off she seems to be. But she perseveres in her search and is thoroughly entertaining to the reader all the way. And even when we see her to the end of her journey, she still manages to throw in a little twist for a somewhat surprise ending. This is a thoroughly entertaining book and I won't hesitate to read more by Isabel Wolff."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I loved this book! This book had me laughing out loud, it was a fabulous and funny read!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book is perfect for anyone who has been out on more bad dates then good ones. Tiffany is a very likeable character and the object of her affection is just delightful."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book was really funny. Wolff created a character in Tiffany that most single thirty something women can relate to. The situations in the novel were realistic, if a bit tediously episodic at times. Wolff has a good ear for dialogue, too. Some of the conversations between Tiffany and her friends about relationships really rung true (although there weren't any major insights, either). Each of the characters are distinct, although a few are underdeveloped - mostly because there were actually a few too many. It was nice to see a female character not totally lose track of her friends because she's completely consumed in her quest to land Mr. Right. Overall, the book is genuinely engaging and humourous.On the downside, the book was a little on the slow side at times, and it was too long. I didn't see why Tiffany couldn't forget about Seriously Successful, either. The ending bothered me. I still found it better than Bridget Jones' Diary - unlike Bridget, I could definitely see myself reading this again.

I can go back & read it again & again! I think that Tiffany is so easy to relate to, she is so funny and yet also so real!!! It is a quick,easy, fun read which also hits home in many ways especially in self-perception. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I'm a huge fan of Brit-Chick-Lit and this certainly fits into the catagory. I found Tiffany's trials to be funny, but they didn't hold my interest as much as other novels I've read recently. Tiffany is a champion for any woman who has had dating dilemnas. She cannot seem to find the right man for her, and grows weary searching while all of her friends find what they want. The men she goes out with are quite interesting and provide their fair share of laughs. I just felt myself wishing it was over when i was halfway through. It was good, but not up to speed with some of the other books out there. For truly witty humor, check out anything by Jane Green, Marian Keyes, or Lisa Jewell."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"'Tiffany Trott' tries hard to be as good as Bridget Jones but she doesn't quite make it.

I'm hooked!!!!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I thought this book was definitely a witty read. One of those books you can devour quickly.

It is on the top of my loaner list!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"By the end of this book, I was thoroughly exhausted with Tiffany Trott. It looked like a fun read, but it took too much effort for it to actually be called \\"fun.\\" It was more like work reading about the extreme minutae of Tiffany's dating life and quest for Mr. Right, or Mr. All Right. I'm not even sure she was such a great catch herself - she wasn't funny, or very sweet, or endearing in any way. If I were Tiffany, I'd be exhausted with myself. It was just too many darn pages to sift through to find out that Tiffany is happier being single."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany is in her late 30's and looking for a husband. Read all about the chaps she meets, and the blokes she dates.This books will keep you laughing."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I thought this book was so funny, I was laughing a lot and a lot. In Germany where it has just been published we are all finding this book very very funny. The Lesbians at the birthing classes are very amusing, lovely characters. The scenes at Club Med are also brilliant and so well written that I felt I was there. And I so liked Tiffany Trott herself, she is very engageing and nice and also real. I felt I knew her, and I laughed such a lot. This is an unusual book also loved the character of her friend Kit. In short, there are so many great scenes and wonderful jokes. I would love to read anything else by Isabel Wolff as I think she is a very, very funny author."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"A great hilarious look at the trials and tribulations of dating. I really enjoyed Bridget Jones, but I agree with the other readers here that Tiffany Trott is clever, wittier and ultimately more likeable. A great read. Can't wait for a sequel. I would still recommend Bridget Jones as well as another funny book about dating called Fried Calamari."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I could NOT put this book down! I had a big grin on my face the whole way through, and I laughed out loud, over and over (no mean feat with a book, yea many books make you smile, but few can actually make you laugh out loud. I totally loved Tiffany and her pals, she is brilliant! And the way she describes the whole relationship &quot;jungle&quot; is just superb! I am really jealous of all the people who have not yet read it! My only criticism is the way the author kept saying a witty retort, then saying &quot;Well actually I didn't say that, but...&quot; This sentence was used at least several hundred times (well it SEEMED like it) throughout the book, I found it most tiresome.Please, please - there HAS to be a sequel?! There just HAS to be!! I for one cannot wait, and will be checking out the bookstores 'til it arrives!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"&quot;Trials of Tiffany Trott&quot; is one of a seemingly endless number of British romantic comedy novels to come out in the past few years. Smarter than some, but not as funny as others, &quot;Tiffany Trott&quot; is a pleasant and enjoyable read. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys this genre; be forewarned, though, that this novel runs a little longer than your average romantic comedy.The story follows 37-year-old Tiffany Trott through her travails of trying to find her male soulmate in England. She's smart, attractive, and actively looking, but nevertheless the available, straight men seem to be in short supply. She places personal ads, joins a dating service, and attends singles parties, with sometimes uproarious results. Perhaps one of the funniest elements of the novel is contrasting Tiffany's life with those of her small, close group of friends, who are all embarking on journeys of their own through marriage, single motherhood, and balancing career with the desire to have a relationship and children. The scenes with her friends sufficiently ground the novel between Tiffany's forays into the singles scene.The one jarring note is the conclusion. It seems to be a foregone conclusion that Tiffany will find someone at the end of the novel, and the question becomes who. I had it pegged as one character, who got married 3/4 of the way through the novel to another character, which pleasantly surprised me. But just who Tiffany ends up with struck me as a bit of a false note, a too-easy ending...I'll let you see for yourself.A funny, sometimes touching exploration of searching for Mr. Right in your late 30s."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"How many disastrous dates can one girl survive and still live to tell the tale? That's the premise of this book...well not really. Tiffany is just doing the best she can and wants to find a \\"bloke\\" to share her life with. Along the way she meets one oddity after another in wanna-be partners.Tiffany, being true to her British faade of stoicism in any given situation, no matter how torturous, initially responds with what she is really thinking (usually quite witty and on the mark, just what we would want to say), followed by Tiffany telling us that she didn't actually say that. Her response of course was always one that falls at the top of the list of proprieties expectations. This technique is used frequently by the author and really gives the reader a release from the many unbearable situations that Tiffany calls dates.Along with our heroine's trials and tribulations on the dating scene, we are introduced to her set of quirky friends that just add to the humor along the way. This is a lighthearted humorous read that is similar to The Bridget Jones series. Kelsana 4/18/01"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I saw the other reviews for this book and am appalled at how many people didn't like it! I thought this was a wonderfully funny book. Though, I must say, Seriously Successful was a bit on the strange side....otherwise I think if you like contemporary romance then this is my pick for you!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"Tiffany is a riot! She is just as funny if not more so than Bridget Jones. But even better- she is smarter and witier and far less shallow. The author's writing is bitingly entertaining and Tiffany's trials are identifiable, hilarious and almost always embarrassingly familiar. If nothing else you will have spent a few fun hours on a book.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"If I read one more reviewer compare a Britsh author's book about a single girl to the ever popular &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;, I just might tear my own head off and eat it. GET OVER IT, PEOPLE!! Tiffany Trott is a 37-year old ad exec who dreams of marriage and babies- theoretically, anyway. What bad luck she has- being dumped by her current boyfriend on her birthday, being &quot;a day late and a dollar short&quot; when she could have married her great friend Kit years ago, and being thrown into the singles pool when most women her age are banging their heads about how to get their 4 year old to potty train. Tiffany decides to leave nothing to chance and takes out a personals ad and attends a Rave and several singles &quot;Eat-N-Greet&quot;s to find Mr. Right. Unfortunately, their are more Wrong's than Right's- Mungo Brown (the name says it all, doesn't it?)is a leacherous &quot;reporter&quot; who never has cash on him, Eric the artist is into art that she just cannot &quot;get&quot;, and Seriously Successful IS Mr. Right- for his wife, anyway. As Tiffany hurtles from one date failure to another, Seriously Successful is Seriously Tenacious about pursuing her, claiming time and again that his was a marriage of convience and he is unhappy- yet he can't leave because his father-in-law is his boss. Ugh. Tiffany's friends all have their own crazy circumstances, so they are of no help. Reading about Tiffany going to Introduction Agencies and singles dinners is a hoot. The ending is interesting, because there is no confirmation on what Tiffany decides to do, thereby leaving the reader to assume there will be a sequel. However, &quot;Making Minty Malone&quot; is totally about another person- interestingly, though, Tiffany Trott calls in to Minty's radio show to share her experience of how she hooked up with her man, and we discover the outcome to her situation there. I thought it was a clever twist on Wolff's part. Overall- I liked &quot;Minty Malone&quot; better, but &quot;Tiffany&quot; was a fun ride on the singles waterslide. A good beach or lazy day read."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I hardly ever give Chick Lit 5 stars, but I couldn't help myself with this one! I don't know why it's taken me forever to get to this book, but I am so happy I finally read it. I was very surprised at how wonderful it would turn out to be, especially after reading so many formulaic single-girl-in-the-city books. Two thumbs up for this one!The Trials of Tiffany Trott tells the story of our lovely heroine, Tiffany, and her struggle to find happiness. After being dumped by Phil, her boyfriend of three years, and Alex, the one who likes to wear women's underpants, Tiffany is at a loss. Being 37-years-old doesn't help much either, especially when her biological clock can be heard ticking from miles away. If it wasn't for her group of mostly single friends, Tiffany would probably go insane. But Tiffany is determined not to be knocked down, to get back on that horse and ride, to put herself through tortuous blind dates, numerous singles events, and the dreaded personal ad, in order to find to Mr. Right.Sounds like your typical chick lit story, but there is just something different about this one. Maybe it is because the main character is older and not ditzy, that she likes her job, or maybe because it is tons funnier than other reads in this genre. Whatever the reason, I believe all fans of chick lit will find something a little bit better in this book. I highly recommend it for its laughs and incredible storyline. And now I've got two more of her books to look forward to!"},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read. It's not great literature, but we can't read Tolstoy all the time, can we? I think any woman over thirty, regardless of her relationship status, will see shades of herself in Tiffany, if only the tendency to overpack or to be gullible to any overpriced skin treatment. I must admit, I found Tiffany a bit annoying for the first 50 pages or so, but she grew on me. Isabel Wolff has crafted an thoroughly engaging story. This one will keep you reading. I found myself slipping away for any brief moment to see how Tiffany's next date went. Some may complain that the foreshadowing is a bit obvious (it is, but who cares, this book is really funny). Others may complain that the characters are a bit one dimensional (they are, but see previous parenthetical). I would recommend this book to anyone with a sense of humor. Just keep it on your bookshelf for the next time you need a good laugh, are going on a long trip, or come down with a cold and need to put down War and Peace for a while. You won't regret it. A note to Bridget Jones fans (of which I am one) - this book is similar to Bridget Jones, there is no denying it, but Bridget and Tiffany are different people ultimately and these are different books."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I loved this book. It made me laugh so much. Just goes to show how much we wonder if todays single thirtysomethings really do want committment after all.

I hope I don't end up in that situation."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book was bought on a lark and turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Although I could see how some readers would find the heroine annoying after a while, this was a light, enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book is a wonderful look at the singles scene. Though the British language may be a little hard to follow for some, the story itself eliminates any difficulties. Every single woman should read this book."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"As I read Tiffany Trott all I could think about was Bridget Jones. There were definitely similarities. Both main characters are endearing but Tiffany had high morals and she always took the high road. I would like to have her for a friend. Bridget, on the other hand, was fun but out of control. The book was quite long (404 pages) for all that it had to say. Wolff gives many examples in certain situations that tend to make one lose interest in the scene. Tiffany wants someone to love and someone to love her. She is a charming person and the book definitely picked up in the last hundred pages but it still left me wondering &quot;what was the point?&quot; I haven't read any other Isabel Wolff books and I would hestitate to buy another if this one is any indication of her long windedness."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This is without question someone's life. There is the boyfriend who wears woman's underware, Alex. Phil, who's mother tells Tiffany to be glad she know's where he is when he is \\"Golfing\\". And then there is her dislike for some mens names... Terry, Kevin or Duane. So she is looking for Mister \\"ok-looking-bordering-on-almost-acceptable\\".

It's obvious that the book is based on a character that Wolff created for a newspaper column -- it's plastered together in month by month chapters, but there's really very little continuity to it. I couldn't really get a good handle on Tiffany -- is she ditzy? intellectual? funny? dull? hopeless? self-sufficient? The novel is humorous, though, and a very fast read. I must say, though, that if you're looking to read a selection from the exponentially multiplying &quot;neurotic London gal desperately searching for a husband/job/weight loss&quot; genre, there are some better choices out there. Making Minty Malone, by the same author, was a fun read, as was Watermelon by Marian Keyes."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I love this book, it's one of the first chick lits I've read years ago and I would read it again. Tiffany is someone who's clever, witty and definitely a person I would want to be friends with.

Well, hopefully not as badly as poor Tiff has."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"I picked up this book because of the apparent similarities to Bridget Jones' Diary. It was an okay book in that I wanted to finish it and find out what happened. However, it just so happened that the copy of the book I had was missing the last pages (the pages 344-377 just kept repeating to the end), so I had to go through the trouble of going back to the bookstore to get a new copy to find out if Tiffany finally found the man she was so desparately looking for."},{"Title":"The Trials of Tiffany Trott","review":"This book should really be called the TRIALS OF TIFFANY TRITE.

Fool that I am, I stuck with it, hoping that it would get funny somewhere in those pages. I should have known better as this &quot;light read&quot; took me about 2 weeks to finish.

Maybe it's because I'm not British but I didn't think it was hilarious. Every now and then I chuckled but still she was kind of annoying. Then there was this whole &quot;Actually I didn't say that, what I said...&quot; was extremely annoying. She wrote it like 25 times throughtout the book and it would've been ok if she didn't say it exactly the same way every time. A little variety would have been helpful. By the middle of the book I could predict when she was going to put &quot;actually I didn't say that...&quot; before I read it, then I realized I was right and rolled my eyes.

They are more thoughtful and original, sophisticated yet truth-bearing -- and overall more enlightening on the state of the singlehood.I think if you don't come away with a satisfied feeling from your ten dollars, it just isn't that good and could easily be borrowed at the library.

Next we find the great Towers of Assyria, Babylon and Sumeria before concluding with the great Temples of the Aztecs, Mayas and Toltecs.This is a fascinating book which is able to give the layman an expert's insight into the greatest archaeological finds of history.NM"},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"In Dylans Choice, one of Christina Reeses best friend, Dylan Becker has second thoughts about horses.

I love the other books, but really what are the odds that you will have like 10 of those \\"one in a million horses\\" like Wonder, Pride, Princess, Glory, Shining, Honor, Star, Image. I could go on and on. It was really a story that you can relate to, I have had like a million friends that you think they like the sames things you do or whatever, but then bam they turn on you like a turn on the forehand! They also did it at just the right age I mean this happens mostly in teenages its not like an eight year old would do that. But its cool how Dylan comes back in the end. Its also true that its really hard to concentrate on more than one sport at a time. I used to horseback ride and do gymnastics (horseback riding more of course) but you really have to choose one sport in the long run. So this is really a good book and targets something that basicly everybody will have to go through at one time or another. Its great they got Dylan back though, because he was a really good character (realistic too, considering at Camp Saddlebrook he totally didn't know how bad Rachel was flirting with him, and all guys do that so it just makes it better.) This is definatly one of the best Thoroughbred books yet! Also, I love the books on eventing! What do all you people have against it? Why can't Christina and Melanie just stay on eventing instead of going to racing? We would all be much happier if Cindy never came back!

I loved the feel and emotions of the old books, these new books might be good if the new writers didn't write them so darn fast. Take a little more time and put a little more effort into the story line and you come up with a good book but I haven't seen it happen yet. Most of the newer readers of TB haven't read the older books so they don't know what to expect. I have read them and still do, but I will not buy another one of the new ones until I hear a good review. And I haven't heard enough to make me want to risk spending my money on the other books I don't own. I miss Asheleigh and Sammantha. I didn't really like Cindy. In the beginning she was fine and then they started getting away from Asheleigh and then Samantha and then it was on to Christina. I don't think you should just drop good characters for new. The older characters have history and a good personality. But people keep popping up and I'm losing count.

Sterling always has some kind of problem whether it is wanting to run like in a race or doesn't listen or is scared of the water jump. It's getting old and you'd think she would learn by now. Plus jumping is getting on my nerves. Where did all the racing go! Also this book said Sammy wrote a letter from Ireland but it never says what it says or why Sammy moved to Ireland. Where did everybody go! &lt;(Including characters and Joanna Campbell)"},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I use to love this series because it was about horse racing.Now all it talks about is jumping.I'm sorry but I don't care about jumping all that much.I use to be able to read these books as soon as I got them and finish them within a couple of hours because they made me want to find out what happened.But now all the books are about the same thing.Some problem Sterling's having.All in all I just don't like these books anymore now that my favorite people are out of the picture.And besides these books don't even tell you what happened to Cindy or Max or Tor or really even Samantha.All it says is that she moved to Ireland but it doesn't say why. I hoping that they will come out with some super editions or something telling the readers what happened.And I really hope Joanna Campbell comes back really soon.Even though I don't really like this series anymore I'll probably still collect these books since I already have every one. Please come back soon Joanna Campbell."},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"In this book, Dylan must chose between soccer and Dakota. Chad Walker and all the other guys are pressuring Dylan, telling him riding is a sport fo girls. Which will Dylan chose? Riding (and Christinia) or Soccer? I think this book was VERY bad. One thing that bugs me is that I am the exact same age as all the characters and I don't have a boyfriend, I'm not dating, though I have had crushes. I think these kids are to young to date and have serious relationships. Thats what really bugs me about this book. One good thing in these books are that the characters don't always win. Thats the only thing thats realistic."},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I don't like Christina's character she is a brat. The books are all about Sterling's three-day event problems. The series used to be about racing. Also, Whitebrook used to be all nice people but lately even the character of Ashleigh is a jerk. The only good part of THOROUGHBRED books lately is the prankster Melanie, hopefully she stays at Whitebrook for awhile."},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"OK, Joanna Campbell NEEDS to come back. I just re-read all the books Joanna wrote, and they are soooo good...I hate how the new authors are making it a jumping series! And Christina is a little brat, I would hate to be around her.

I mean, right from the beginning, there was no description whatsoever. What time of year was it when Ashleigh came to Townsend Acres? If you don't know when most Thoroughbreds are born, than you would have no idea! Sure, Campbell is a great author . . . compared to the others! I hated the series from the beginning, but I kept on buying just to see what all the fuss was about. I'm still wondering. Let's see, whatta we got here? A girl who becomes a famous jockey and gets the ultimate husband on her first try, then a girl whose temper doesn't bring any consequences (she also finds her soulmate without any problems), then an orphan who, at first, expects nothing, than suddenly expects everything to go right for her! An example of how these people write: &quot;Cindy see horse. Cindy see horse run. Cindy want horse to win big races.&quot; (And she gets her wi! sh, huh?) Personally, I think you all should try other books, but I agree--there are none! You want racing? You're stuckP.S.--My all-time most-hated? &quot;Glory's Rival,&quot; of course! Cindy is the most snobbish, self-absorbed person I've ever had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of hearing about!

I LOVE TO JUMP, but Christina is obsessed. It's all she thinks about. She doesn't remember how to have fun on a horse. She also thinks everybody else has to be as serious about riding as she is. What if Dylan was as serious about soccar as she is about riding?? Would she even care????? My advice to the authers: Bring Sammy back and drop Christina and only do books about Melanie and racing!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I was disapointed with this book.

All they're about is Christina falling off Sterling and still winning every Event they go to.She's such a brat,I think that the books should go back to racing because they were really good like that.

In every book since 25, the only &quot;problem&quot; is getting sterling over a water jump and stopping her from thinking that she is in a race. I like jumping, BUT NOT IN A RACING SERIES! This new author has made every character snobbish. Even Ashleigh! Who cares if Dylan likes soccer better. I sure don't. I care about RACING! I am SOOOO happy that the Ashleigh sereies is coming out (#1 Lightning's last hope) but why the heck so they have to make a new series for racing? Can't this new autor start a new series of her own?

I guess that's when racing starts again. I'll read that. But if it's like all the others I'm dropping the series. I am NOT going to read about wonderful super horses. If I have to read through clones of Glory's Rival then that's it. This book is the absolute worst the series can get. At least I think so. This series is total crap. I don't think I'll ever go back.

I mean what has happened to the racing and the thrill of who wins and makes it and stuff like that.

I personally like show jumping but I agree it does not make for as exciting of books as racing does.P. S. Anyone who reads this and knows what happend to the Joanna Campbell I would appreciate knowing.

It might just help. :-("},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I have read the Thoroughbred series since it has been published, and I think that the writers and authors are doing a great job.

I think that the new writers are doing a great job, and I hope that they keep on doing a good job. I think that Christina and Melanie are NOT brats. They are teenage girls faced with real problems that some of us face today. I hope that the series continues on, because I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!"},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I don't know what is going on here, but one thing is for sure. These books s***. The series began with actual problems. Yah, sure, this book has a problem in it. But come on. It's a little insignificant problem. It's hardly even that. I don't care if Dylan suddenly doesn't like riding. I don't care about Christina. And I really don't care about her BELOVED Sterling. They could all just vanish and I wouldn't notice. And this Dylan character. If he thinks riding is for little girls, fine! I really couldn't care less about what Dylan thinks about riding horses. It isn't the end of the world when he decides that soccer is better. And another thing. I really think that it's a bad idea to alternate the series between jumping and racing. For some wierded out reason the publishers and the authors think that this will make everyone happy. Those who want racing get racing and those who want jumping have jumping. I think that is a little uneven. It's not balanced. One month we are reading about one story and another month it's back to a completely different story. Why don't they just split the series? Like the Thoroughbred Christina Series and the Thoroughbred Melanie Series. Because I will not read the Christina books if they are this pointless. Jumping is boring to read about. Racing has more kick to it. If they think that they are making everyone happy then they should think again. The jumping crap is for the author's benifit. The author is the only one that is really happy with the jumping stuff. The public has plenty of jumping series out there. They don't need another. Especially a really strange series that can't keep the same story line."},{"Title":"Dylan's Choice (Thoroughbred Series #30)","review":"I Love thoroughbred I love Sammy and Ashliegh!

I mean, any horse is a good horse. As long as we stay on the topic of thoroughbreds, people! I thought this book had good points to it.

I had written to her a while ago nad she explained that she was sorry bout what happened to the series. Yes I agree that A LOT of the old charters should come back- and for all you &quot;Cindy Haters&quot; out there please understand that though she beacme a VERY spolid brat- we, well most of us still want to know what happened to her. There are so many horses out there that thay forgotten about. This series has taken a turn for the worst here- but Joanna's books were much better, so keep reading them. I agree that I would rather read the saddle club for jumping, and hopefully something good will happen. As for this book I think it had some sort of meaning to it- that you have to take care of your horse. Horses arn't made to show off with. NEVER take your anger out on your horse. Though the thing bout doing other sports and riding not being possiable- well I find it totally WRONG. I ride, play basketball, do Jazz, and still have time. Christina is a little messed- she was being such a baby- Oh Dylan, will you please ride with me, no you cant do anything but ride- ok so she didn't really say that but still, she doesn't own Dylan. I am happy how they made Ashleigh better in this one- more nice. I think they should switch to Kevin- ha likes the race horses, may be able to tell us something on Cindy and Samamtha, and they haven't had a boook from a boys point of view.

They might want to figure out where they sent Wonder's Legacy and focus in on the farm that bought him and start a new line of horses and books.

I didn't like Chad to much because he thought he a hot shot being in the all-star-team. He made Dylan forgot Dakota when he was injuried &amp; rode a dirt bike instead.

One eye of each illustration is cut out, making a continuous hole all the way through the book. This book makes learning to count as easy as 1, 2, 3.

The characters are entertaining and could as easily be from Oxbridge in the 90s as from the 40s and 50s. I was quite in love with Fielding Gray and appalled when he was disfigured. Shame that the publishers made such a hash of re-issuing the series. I waited 11 months between the first and second volumes, and as far as I know the third volume has yet to be published. The novels are not in chronological order - is this the order in which they were written?"},{"Title":"Fielding Gray: A novel","review":"The opening page of my hard cover copy of 'Fielding Gray' indicates it was the fourth book written in the Alms for Oblivion sequence, however, cronologically, it is the first. It is actually the last book I read in this sequence - I searched high and low for it for almost ten years, until I found two copies within weeks of each other, one in a charity shop in my old home town, where I hadn't lived for 20 years!Fielding Gray, priviliged, handsome, charming, talented, manipulative, debauched, corrupt and a corrupter, emerged as the central and pivotal of the ten main characters in the sequence, even though he didn't appear at all in the first written book 'The Rich Pay Late' (cronologically fourth). He made a memorable but minor appearance in the second written, 'Friends in Low Places' (cronologically fifth), but became the undeniable star of the sequence in the third written, 'Sabre Squadron' (cronologically third).'Fielding Gray' takes us back to where it all began - the summer term in 1945 at his public (in the UK, that means private) school begins with a thanksgiving service after the war in Europe. The acknowledged Golden Boy, destined for a glittering academic career, Fielding Gray gradually loses his innocence (via increasingly seedy sexual encounters) and is ultimately responsible for a devestating sexual tragedy, as his originally projected future slips away. However, some of his schoolday liaisons and friendships stay with him all his life.The ten independent novels of the Alms for Oblivion sequence take a ironically cynical poke at the English upper-middle-class, involving academia, politics, journalism, the aristocracy, the army, etc. Disguised as bawdy tales of strange, often indecent passions, populated by a curiously likable contingent of debauched and corrupt characters, their associates and their victims, Simon Raven writes the most deliciously enjoyable, stylish, funny and clever social satire you will find (excepting, perhaps, Robertson Davis). Many of these characters crop up in his non-sequence novels, 'The Roses of Picardie', 'September Castle', etc., and they raise the second generation in a further sequence 'The First-born of Eqypt' (only seven novels this time!)While many of Simon Raven's most memorable characters are people you would probably avoid having in your life, their tales provide vicarious enjoyment, an addiction that once started must continue until the very last word.Even though I rarely re-read books, while researching this review I've come to realise I must read them all again, starting tonight!"},{"Title":"Fielding Gray: A novel","review":"Similar I suppose in style to Powell's Dance to the Music of Time, Raven's Alms series is a lighter and more devious, and is devilishly funny. Highly recommended - all volumes have now been re-released, and are worth picking up. I would say worth reading in the order they were written, rather than in chronological order, as this method was surely Raven's intention? Buy NOW!"},{"Title":"Fielding Gray: A novel","review":"Delighted to find other Simon Raven fans do actually exist!He's been a seriously neglected novelist because most of his novelshave been out of print for over twenty years. A revival is long overdue, particularly before the old boy drops off the twig...Fantastically well-written novels and sublimely well-chosen language. END"},{"Title":"Fielding Gray: A novel","review":"I discovered Simon Raven in an essay in the quarterly Slightly Foxed,a British publication. Each issue contains about eighteen essays, usually about a writer, and all well done. The piece about Raven, called \\"He Stayed the Course\\", appeared in the Winter 2005 issue [these are available from S.F. on-line] and was by an admirer of Raven's, Andreas Campomara, a publisher.According to Campomara, Raven, already a successful novelist, wrote \\"Fielding Gray\\" before any of the other novels in the series, but was told by his publisher to keep it back until more novels in the series had built up interest in the character. That may have been true at the time -- perhaps there were too many novels set in public schools -- but it would be too bad to leave \\"Fielding Gray\\" until third or fourth, as it is clearly seminal. Its theme of corruption and betrayal, very well developed, is carried out, in varying degrees, in the whole series.For anyone reading this who wants to know the order of the novels in terms of the time in which each is set, here it is, with the setting in time in parentheses: Fielding Gray (1945); Sound the Retreat (1945-6); The Sabre Squadron (1952); The Rich Pay Late (1955-6); Friends in Low Places (1959); The Judas Boy (1962); Places Where They Sing (1967); Come Like Shadows (1970); Bring Forth the Body (1972) and The Survivors (1973).Vintage Press has fairly recently reissued the entire series in three big paperbacks, but the novels are presented in the order, not of setting, but of copyright date. These can be ordered from England, if not at Amazon, then at ABE.I rated \\"Fielding Gray\\" with only four stars because although, as I said, it is well developed, its overall view is a bit unbalanced, too skewed toward the negative -- as is the entire series. I have read seven of the novels so far and have liked almost all of them, but the cynicism, while sort of fascinating, is over the top. Luckily there are a few likable characters -- one of whom is Fielding Gray."},{"Title":"Bangers","review":"If you like your cops dirty and your crime dirtier, this book is for you. One of Phillips darker books - more in the vein of the Jook than his others - Bangers is a real page turner. The characters leap of the page. You can tell Gary knows LA and the book is littered with real locations. I can't say enough about this book. I have read most everything Gary has done, and this is the book I give to people as an introduction to his work. Check it out. As Gary himself said below he has a chapter you can read at his web site http://gdphillips.com/bangers.htmDon't bother with the other review on this page.

Yes, might be too dark for a beach or subway/commute, but wonderful for a rainy afternoon, in the lounge chair!Who was it would put Gary Phillips' stuff under a Gary Hardwick book? Wow.

Were I an African American (my wife is, however, and she backs me up), I'd roll my eyes at that one!!!"},{"Title":"Bangers","review":"First off the bat - I only found out about Garry Phillips following the hype surrounding his latest re-release by Switchblade \`The Jook', which by all accounts looks totally kick-ass. So naturally being the curious cat I am, I went on a hunt to check out his other novels and came across \`Bangers'.I like books where the protagonist is tainted, not one of those squeaky-clean run of the min types you find in police procedurals by the more popular authors of our time (Patterson, Cornwell etc.) which is why \`Bangers' by Garry Phillips did it for me - in more ways than one; oh let me count the ways:BANG - Book is about a bunch of not so moral cops who are part of an elite street-sweeping group 'TRASH' going about their business by any means possible (utilising the services of LA's streetwalkers - and not just for snitching, beating down crooks for cash and information, and dapping into a little extra-curricular activity by way of drugs and guns).BANG BANG - the setting is typically dark though some of the most memorable scenes are portrayed in daylight (run down \`hoods from LA to Mexico and back again). Phillips knows how to set the mood.BANG BANG BANG - Gangs, cops and dames all hold equal footing in the overall scheme of the story allowing the reader a view through a multi demesnial window into a world most of us wouldn't know is out there.Sure, there's violence (beat-downs, murder), sex (enough to satisfy the more perverse reader), back-stabbing (from every conceivable angle) and engaging characters (check the relationships between the TRASH team and their significant others/siblings) but the thing that impressed me most, was the fast paced, action packed scenes and noticeable lack of filler content.If you're looking for a gritty urban book with a touch of noir and hard-boiled then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bangers","review":"When I read the synopsis of this book, I was expecting something similar to Gary Hardwick's books. But, what I got were a lot of characters, a muddled-at-best plot, and a totally boring read.

It was more about performance art and I detect overtones of lesbian activism. Which is OK. It was more academic than racy. Which is not what I was looking for. Let's just say the artificial, cabberet-type setting of it all was... anti-climactic. And of course there are also those recurring themes about stretching the limits of the gender continuum, breaking the gender binary, coming up with new catagories to put these people in ect., etc..., But this book is not without its gems.The photographs rank so-so in shock value but score high on \\"camp-itude\\". I think they've got an edge over their drag queen sisters who are limited to portraying 50's movie stars and \\"divas\\", very traditional, idealized caricatures of women. Drag kings can be fat, ugly, working-class, Joe Blows... One can quickly see that by just looking at the cover. Two of the models have quickly achieved pin-up status in my mind. Check out Jackie and Stafford on pp. 34-37! Aren't they darling? In one photograph, they are dressed in business suits. In the next two, they are topless and wearing matching (albeit different colored) pairs of Levi's...I don't quite take to that Halberstam fellow. That scholarly pompitude and high-brow style she writes in is boring at times. Read \\"Female Masculinity\\" to really put you to sleep. She has reduced my fetish for butch women to a dry science. Sometimes she gets more technical than a medical journal. Fortunately, she's considerably dumbed down her writing in this book. And you get to read less from her because it's packed with more interviews with the drag performers themselves.

This wonderful book, using an informal, conversational writing style(and at a super cheap price!) describes this immensely important area of study, without bogging down the reader in too much complicated math.Mr.Tricomi takes a very interesting and useful approach, by focusing on infinite series methods for solving these equations. Infinite Series is a very powerful and immensely interesting topic, and so using infinite series methods not only introduces the reader to some good techniques but also gets the reader very interested as to what will follow. Furthermore, Tricomi's opening the book by introducing a practical problem is a good way to get the reader interested(see my other reviews for other good practical math textbooks.) Furthermore, I liked how Tricomi described integral equations as being like infinite systems of equations.A few minor problems. The book does assume a tad of knowelege about linear algebra, and an overview of the theorems of linear algebra used in the book would have been nice.

Hardy's novels are generally brilliant, beautiful, and throughly depressing. Then you come to come to Hardy's first published novel &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot;. Definitely &quot;Hardy-Lite&quot; this novel is a sensational, melodramatic story which is very different from the bulk of Hardy's more recognized prose.the story centers around young Cytherea Graye, who becomes a servant to Miss Auclyffe, a woman with a troubled past. There, she encounters Aeneas Manston, the incredibly handsome and charming steward of Miss Auclyffe, and also a man with a dark secret. He falls hopelessly in love with the beautiful girl and sets out to win her. But alas, Cytherea is already in love with the kind Edward Springrove. Who will ultimately win her? What is the mysterious connection between the steward Manston and Miss Auclyffe? When will people learn not to set fires next to their thatched houses??I really enjoyed this novel, though at times the melodrama was so thick it was humorous. It reminded me of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; in many ways, though I felt it was more entertaining than that supposedly great english novel. A lot of twists and turns, very well-written, and an ending very different from your usual Hardy downers. Classic literature? Maybe not, but a fun read and a glimpse of England's greatest novelist before he had mastered his craft."},{"Title":"Desperate Remedies (Penguin Classics)","review":"Hardy is a wonder.

The plot is flawed and probably influenced by his early need to \\"go commercial\\", with a quick unveiling of scandal at the end.The characters are not as well defined, and the writing not as pithy as in his later prose and poetry, and his literary allusions fall somewhat out of context.Yet it is a good effort for a young architect in his early thirties who has many great novels to come!"},{"Title":"Desperate Remedies (Penguin Classics)","review":"Desperate Remedies, Thomas Hardy's first published novel, is far from his best but surprisingly quite good and, indeed, somewhat underrated. Despite some limitations - I hesitate to call them \\"faults\\" - that Hardy later overcame, it is an engaging, suspenseful read that holds up rather well after almost a century and a half. It is a novel by a young beginning writer full of promise; though it infamously got several very bad reviews, at least a few critics rightly saw that its author could someday produce greatness. Fans and scholars will delight in these budding elements and much else related to Hardy in embryo, while the significant differences from his other novels may even attract those who do not normally like him.Hardy later improved on all the book's strengths, but there are, to its benefit, several similarities to his great later works. Not least is a strong sense of place, perhaps Hardy's most important and characteristic novelistic asset. He is rightly known for vivid, often detailed, and sometimes strikingly lyrical descriptions of settings and for moving them beyond mere background to become an integral part of the story. This last is not reached here, but the descriptions are well above the norm, and we can see Hardy's progress toward works where setting is so important that it almost becomes a character. The official launching of Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that Hardy made world famous - did not occur until his fourth published novel, but he was clearly already working toward it. This is not a proto-Wessex novel in the sense that his next two books are, but the setting is a rural England based on Hardy's own area and quite memorably sketched.The portrait of the heroine, Cytherea, is also striking - the first of Hardy's many great heroines. She is skillfully and realistically drawn, quickly gaining sympathy and interest; we feel for and with her vividly lifelike character. Like Hardy's more famous heroines, she is to a large degree idealized - incredibly beautiful, intelligent, and educated yet innocent and nave. She is notably strong and independent for a female literary character of the era, clearly showing that Hardy had a far higher view of women than most people of his time, especially men. However, also like his more famous heroines, she is not perfect but must fight a tendency to be overly trusting and a dependent streak. The many feminists interested in Hardy's work will find much to fascinate them in this early depiction.The author's preface admits that, even after Hardy became acclaimed, the book was praised almost exclusively for this character. He as usual sells himself short, but it is certainly true that characterization is not the book's strength. Hardy later improved his characterization to the point of mastery, creating some of the era's most memorable characters, but here Cytherea stands well above the rest of the book's cast. Her lover Edward Springrove, whom Hardy says he based closely on someone he knew, is believable and memorable, but other characters are stock cutouts to various extents. Her brother is the most well-drawn among them, with an appealing intelligence reminiscent of later Hardy characters, but his overbearing paternalism smacks of stock Victorian male types, however lifelike. Cytherea's employer, Miss Aldclyffe, is even more conventional - the grim and dominating but mysterious rich lady with a hidden heart quite familiar in Victorian fiction. Worst of all, though, is her son Aeneas, whose villainy is pushed to such extremes that it is not only highly implausible but sometimes even bordering on unintentionally comic. These deficiencies are interesting in that they make Cytherea stand out even more but keep the book significantly below Hardy's later great work.The real weak spot, though, is the plot. That said, it is weak only by the highest literary standards and in comparison to Hardy's later masterpieces. Leading Victorian critic George Meredith read Hardy's first written novel, The Poor Man and the Lady, and suggested he write a book with more plot. Hardy took his advice, putting much of the book into Desperate Remedies and eventually destroying the rest. However, by his own admission, he took the advice rather too far. Hardy became known for complex plots, but ambition outran him here; the plot is not only needlessly convoluted but also overly melodramatic. He also became identified with heavy use of highly wrought coincidence; many have criticized him for it at the time and even now, and it is a large part of the reason some do not like his fiction. Yet many fail to realize that he did it deliberately and carefully as a way of advancing his deterministic views. There is much of it here, but unlike in later works, melodrama and generally overcomplicated implausibility push it over the proverbial top. Anyone expecting a realist novel will be sorely disappointed, and the book is also not well-done enough to be classed in the naturalist genre that Hardy helped make famous.Even so, taken on its own terms, the plot is quite engaging; highly suspenseful and very entertaining, it grabs interest quickly and does not let go. It is almost the mid-Victorian equivalent of today's cinematic thriller. Indeed, there are several interesting things going on at once. One thread is a love story of the sort Hardy later specialized in; it has strong verisimilitude and great emotion, making it well worth reading for fans and those who appreciate such stories. Uniquely in Hardy's long career, another thread is a dark murder mystery of the sort Victorian fiction made immortal. Indeed, though it has almost never gotten credit for it, Desperate Remedies is an important early entry in what became known as detective fiction; we must remember that Sherlock Holmes was almost two decades in the future. I do not mean to put the novel on the level of that brilliant work in terms of detective fiction, but the mystery is lively and engaging. Anyone who really knows such works is well aware that they can fail like nothing else when handled poorly, but Hardy works this aspect quite dexterously; the tight execution he became revered for is already here to a large degree. Fans and critics used to more typical Hardy plots may well be pleasantly surprised by how deftly he could handle something so seemingly alien to his art, especially at such an early juncture - and may be entertained against their will. More notably, its great difference from later Hardy may even mean that those who dislike his more representative work may find themselves liking his fiction for the first time.The reason for this strange dichotomy is that Desperate Remedies is essentially an entry in the sensation novel genre. It was then wildly popular but now nearly forgotten and rarely read - with good reason. Desperate Remedies aside, the novels of Wilkie Collins, the genre's master, are basically the only ones still read. Hardy knew the genre was not ideal for him, but the rejection of his first novel and his poems made him desperately and begrudgingly decide that adopting a popular form was the only way he could be published, as the title perhaps slyly and cynically acknowledges. It was an awkward fit; Hardy's talent was too great and idiosyncratic to fit any template, much less such an inappropriate one. The novel is thus a curious mix of conventions and individual brilliance bursting through, perhaps even against Hardy's will. The conventions are well-done, but genre purists thought them less than perfectly handled. This is the result of Hardy's own brand creeping in, which is to the book's great benefit. Desperate Remedies would perhaps be fully forgotten if it were a pure genre entry, but the elements of Hardy's later greatness are in embryo, raising it above a mere sensation novel. Hardy thankfully never restricted himself this way again, which improved his art greatly, but this book's unique status in his canon is not its least appealing aspect.Fans and scholars will indeed see and appreciate much that is familiar from later works. One of the most obvious is Hardy's unusual prose style. This is clearly an early effort, as he greatly improved his prose, but his characteristic writing is already in evidence. More notable are the strong presences of themes he would return to again and again, primarily sex and class. The former is of course done via Cytherea, but the latter suffuses the whole book. Like many later Hardy characters, Cytherea, her brother, and (especially) Springrove are lower-class people who managed to educate themselves well beyond what was normal. The resulting class complications are memorably dramatized here. The class system's unfairness was a perennial Hardy topic, but this is noteworthy for pushing the issue unusually far; one might almost call it protest literature. It comes across most forcefully in the confrontation between Springrove and Miss Aldclyffe, where even the ostensibly neutral narrator gets in on it. This scene is indeed so heavy-handed that it is arguably authorially intrusive; we get the strong sense that Hardy is pushing a personal issue at the expense of story. It was indeed a sensitive issue because of his humble birth and the setbacks it caused him, not least his future father-in-law's reluctance to let him marry his daughter. One cannot blame Hardy for feeling thus, but it does get in the way of his art here a bit, even if his points are valid and well-made. He realized this himself, toning down some of the harsher passages in later editions when his own position as a famous and rich author became established and age perhaps mellowed him. Hardy made meticulous changes to all his novels when they were reissued, but this perhaps has the most interesting and revealing alterations. Students of his art will certainly want to seek out an edition with footnotes detailing the changes.This debut novel is also revealing in other ways for those familiar with Hardy's life and thought. For instance, a negative reference to conservatism throws into question his insistence of lifelong indifference to party politics. Perhaps more importantly, there are many elements related to his life, not least many references to architecture, his pre-writing career.All told, Desperate Remedies is an essential read for fans and critics, while even those who normally dislike Hardy's fiction should check it out. I recommend it especially to fans of sensation novels, detective fiction, gothic literature, and anyone who likes the darker and/or more melodramatic side of Victorian fiction. The novel is so overshadowed by later Hardy that hardly anyone has read it for some time, and it is now quite difficult to procure. This is a shame, as it is very readable and has several hints of greatness. Unless one is willing to chart Hardy's progress chronologically, this should be one of the last Hardy novels anyone should read, but it should be read."},{"Title":"Desperate Remedies (Penguin Classics)","review":"I was glad to find this here.

It's a literary biography, to be sure, but it's a great portrait of the time-- very colorful, very illustrative, very smart.For a romantic decoration of Disraeli's life and time, read Andre Maurois; for a long and thorough detailed analysis of Disraeli's political career, read Robert Blake instead."},{"Title":"Disraeli,: A picture of the Victorian age","review":"I liked this book.

It is a good book if someone wants a sense of the Victorian Age and all of its seemingly genteel ways."},{"Title":"Disraeli,: A picture of the Victorian age","review":"Andre Mourois' biography of \\"Disraeli\\" is certainly political biography in a literary class unto itself. However, the more recent \\"Game Change,\\" by John Heilemann and Mark Halperin although about contemporary politics, is a book in its own right, not to be slighted as a literary work of some distinction. For even on the exalted plane where Mouris lives, \\"Game Change\\" can confidently hold it's own. Both are about the political personalities and political dynamics that framed pivotal times. Mourois' is about a single dominating personality, the only Jewish Prime Minister of Britain, Benjamin Disraeli, during mid-Seventeen Century Britain, when arguably the British Empire was at the very peak of its glory. However, due to the \\"potato and corn famine,\\" and general mismanagement of agricultural policies, Britain began a precipitous decline that arguably did not end until the post-Colonial period in the aftermath of the Second World War.Heilemann and Halperin's book is about the key political personalities during the pivotal U.S. Presidential election of 2008, which ended with the election of the first Black U.S. President. It too, arguably was about a season when, in the aftermath of eight years of Republican mismanagement of the economy began a decisive and precipitous decline in the U.S. standard of living and in U.S. international prestige that may not end until the U.S. has become a second rate power if not a supersized Third World country. Everyone is anticipating that it's just a matter of time before China will call in all its economic chips and replaced the U.S. as the last reigning superpower.The similarities of the times and the fact that the leaders of the respective parties in power were of a different ethnicity than the racial majority, is a comparison that often is too uncanny to go unnoticed. The upshot is that it begs for a comparative analysis of the two leaders. With Mouris' book and what we know so far about Obama, a tentative comparison can now be made.Disraeli versus ObamaBeyond being called upon in equally troubled times, Benjamin Disraeli and Barack Obama have some uncommon similarities but also important and rather stark differences. For instance, their contemporaries considered them both intellectual heavyweights. Obama's tenure as editor of the Harvard Law Review, a stent as a Law Professor at the University of Chicago, and the author of two well-written runaway best selling autobiographies, distinguished him as an intellect and as a writer. Disraeli had published two modestly well-received novels before the age of twenty-five. Both men, early on, were touted as \\"The\\" rising stars of their respective parties. Both had mastered the art of oratory and held the public and members of their respective parties spellbound with their speechmaking abilities and oratorical skills. Both were from humble backgrounds and made their way up the political ladder based primarily on their intellectual prowess. Both had \\"outsized egos\\" and were considered Machiavellian manipulators. And if the truth were told, both considered themselves an intellectual cut above their colleagues. Both were also plucked from the tree before they had fully ripen.But there the similarities must end and the differences must come into play.Disraeli used his speeches to roast the opposition and as a bludgeon to force action and the hands of his opponents. They feared him as much as an Opossum fears an axe handle. Obama, so far, seems content to have his minions out on the front line taking the political heat and fire of his opponents. No one on the opposition sides fears Obama. Many think he is a joke and is \\"in over his head.\\" The Republicans are now tickled pink that Obama does not seem to know how to fight his way out of a bipartisan paper bag. Disraeli loved nothing more than a good battle, the tougher the opponent and the more blood that flowed on the Parliament floor, the better. Obama engages in preemptive capitulation, conciliatory behavior as a \\"going in strategy\\" and tries to avoid conflict and confrontations at every turn and at all cost, even at the cost of jettisoning his political base. On the few occasions when he has sallied forth into a fight, he inevitably has returned to the safety of the Oval Office with his tailed always tucked. Take the \\"Beer Summit\\" for instance. Only the howls of his base seems to bring him out of his Oval Office foxhole, but only to make an explanatory speech, which denies the reality of his weakened positions and his obvious cowardliness.Disraeli took great abuse because of his ethnicity and lack of strong Christian beliefs, but nevertheless did not compromise his strong position on any of the major issues. He bided his time while he bled emotionally until the respect he was due, and his positions deserved, came around. Obama on the other hand has yet to reveal that he has anything at all up his sleeve? No one yet knows what he stands for, or will stand up for? So far, his favorite position is to lay prone in his \\"hope-a-dope\\" position taking blows until his political base has to throw in the towel and say \\"no mas.\\" His only excuse for this cowardly behavior can be found in the Obama mantra of \\"more bipartisanism\\" even when there is none to be found in the Washington D.C. cupboard. This has left his backers (including this one) wondering if the first Black President is really up to the challenges he has signed up for, or if he is just another empty Orator?On the issue of ethnicity, although it caused him great pain and angst, Disraeli did not shrink away from or dodge the issue of his Jewishness. He maintained a healthy and balanced attitude towards it and took his lumps as they came, and at times they rained down on him very heavily. Despite constant bombardment, Dizzy, as he was affectionately called, always stood his ground and inevitably made successful comebacks. Obama, on the other hand, except when backed into a corner, seems allergic to his own blackness. He does not want to make it an issue even when his opponents do. Announcing early on (in the most obvious kind of political pandering) that Blacks should not expect any special attention from him, and rather incongruously admonishing, of all groups, his own, black men; and doing so in the same coded racist rhetoric most often used by the most active of American racists: His message to all black men is to shape up and live up to your responsibilities. (Only Black women and the Ku Klux Klan applauded.)Both men were Christians. However Disraeli was weak on religion generally and although he never flirted with atheism, he did not go to any great pains to hide his lukewarm attitude towards religion. Obama on the other hand, when it became politically convenient for him, jettisoned his minister of twenty years, claiming lack of knowledge of his firebrand anti- U.S. rhetoric, despite the fact that almost all of it was true.Disraeli was a congenital political animal, principled, and disciplined, and who knew how to play the game and played it well. He fought for the causes he championed and was a graceful loser. And he lost often. Obama and his handlers are proving to be worse than neophytes: first \\"triangulating\\" here, then \\"tacking\\" to the right there, ever in search of the elusive and non-existent center, always angling to the right, thinking they can pick up another Republican vote or two. Obama is as scared of his \\"left flank\\" (his base) as a Possum is of an axe handle. And so far, has proved to be a chameleon who is always feinting, ducking, slipping punches and then coming back, instead of with a right jab with a conciliatory speech. Disraeli kept raising the level of his game with each defeat. Obama's response to each setback is the same: more empty speeches and radio messages, and emails for more campaign funds.Mouris began his portrait of Disraeli as a flamboyant almost clownish egotist. But Disraeli lived a full political life and ended deservingly as one of Britain's most revered, respected and most distinguished Statesmen. One wonders what will be Obama's legacy. So far as seen from this ex-Obama supporter, he is not doing so well. Can he make a comeback? I don't think so. His handlers apparently did not recognize that a coward's political capital is perishable. And as far as I can see, Mr. Obama's has gone completely rank.[Is Hillary still in the house? (Please forgive me?) ]Maybe Obama should stick to writing books? Ten Stars."},{"Title":"Spinoza and Buddha: Visions of a Dead God.","review":"Melamed's book is a rebuttal to the \\"many commentators, critics, and historians [who] have cried that Spinoza's excommunication was not justified since his doctrine was traceable to Jewish sources\\" (136). He argues that there is a \\"line extending from the Upanisads to Buddha, St. Paul, St. Augustine, and Spinoza\\" (5, 299-363), and that mysticism was no part of traditional Judaism. For all his otherwise impressive erudition, however, Melamed never mentions the Zohar. He does mention Hassidism, but after acknowledging that it arose independently of Spinoza, he circumvents this counter-example to his thesis by means of a non-sequitur: \\"Chasidism - although it is not a consequence of, is a parallel to, Spinozism... [There is a] deep-rooted pantheistic tendency in Chassidism. In view of these facts, the assertion is justified that Spinoza's influence on the cultural process of his own race in modern times was almost as powerful as was his influence upon the general cultural process in the West\\" (146-7). Melamed's antipathy to Spinoza is continually in evidence (even apart from the book's subtitle): Spinoza was not only \\"the patron saint of Lenin's state\\" (30) and \\"the official philosopher of Red Russia\\" (31), \\"Spinoza was actually responsible for the cultural anti-Semitism of modern Europe\\" (147)."},{"Title":"Sew the Essential Wardrobe for 18-Inch Dolls","review":"I am a novice seamstress and found some of these patterns a little challenging, yet I was able to complete others with no problem.

In fact, most of the people I know are not necessarily watering at the mouth for apologetics text books, and the few that are would prefer Scott Hahn or Pat Madrid to Sungenis. Why? Hahn and Madrid speak more down-to-earth, presupposing no knowledge on the part of the reader. Sungenis writes more for the scholar, presupposing some knowledge of the Greek language (i.e., he spells Greek words using the Greek alphabet, without providing English transliterations, as Hahn or Madrid might do).If you're still with me, if you're still interested, if you still want to roll up your sleeves and deepen your faith, then hear me telling you to get this book. In fact, get the whole trilogy (Not by Bread Alone, Not by Scripture Alone, and Not By Faith Alone). This book goes through the Old Testament, then the New Testament, then to history itself. Sungenis examines Eucharistic passages with a microscope, highlighting cross references, original language, interpretations offered by the opposition, and refutations of the opposition for each passage. He ends by looking to the Early Church to see how they interpreted the doctrine of the Eucharist.If you're a Catholic, you need this book to strengthen your own faith, make you appreciate the mass more, and give you some good defense for your beliefs. If you're not Catholic, then you should at least consider what Sungenis offers (if you're open-minded that is - if you're just out to refute anything a Catholic has to say, there are several other books you can attack that are much cheaper than this one), and see if what he says is true.It's a technical, scholarly work, but if you're serious about worshiping God with your heart AND your mind, then you need to get this book and start getting dirty."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"I got this book because I saw the 'eucharist' in some protestant churches, reduced to mere symbolism.

For a an uneducated guy like me, my copy is dog-eared.

He has also analyzed those church fathers (Tertullian, Eusebius, Augustine, etc.) who use figurative language when discussing the Eucharist. Sungenis believes that these fathers were thereby simply employing spiritual applications of the Eucharist, and were in no way questioning the Real Presence. Of course, one needs a technical theological and historical background to assess the validity or otherwise of Sungenis' arguments.Sungenis defends the view that the latter half of John 6, wherein the Lord tells His disciples to eat His Body and drink His Blood, is a reference to Holy Communion, and not simply a continuation of His Bread of Life discourse of the first part of this chapter (where He uses the eating of bread figuratively to represent believe in Him). Sungenis cites Bultmann's contention that the latter part of John 6 was a later addition by the early church for the purpose of supporting the Real Presence in the Eucharist. But the fact is that Bultmann believed that virtually ALL of the Gospels were simply bits and pieces of early church teachings stuck together. Liberal theologians like Bultmann would furthermore have us believe that almost none of the Lord's teachings and actions are found in the Gospels. According to Bultmann, the Lord never had a Last Supper and never instituted the Eucharist. The church invented these myths long after Jesus and attributed it to Him. For these reasons, Sungenis' citation of Bultmann with regards to the latter part of John 6, and as a defense of Transubstantiation and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, is inappropriate and somewhat disingenuous. If Bultmann is correct, the Last Supper and the Eucharist are inauthentic."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"This book goes to the &quot;heart&quot; of the matter. It is both scholarly and practical. The explanations are in an easy to read style and even the bible quotes are for Protestants who use the NIV. It is evident that Sungenis wrote this to get to the &quot;heart&quot; by way of the intellect. I believe that his work is truly ecumenical because unity cannot be achieved without knowing the truth. The Mass is heaven on earth."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"Sterile? I don't think so. Scholarly? You bet. Exhaustive? That's putting it lightly.For those reading this who have not read Robert Sungenis, he is meticulous and tedious to a fault. If you want to explore the exhaustive depths of an issue he has covered, you will want it. If you want an hour read by which you can glean snippets to stump others, don't bother. Why? I'll tell you.He goes for it. When you think Sungenis has totally and utterly exausted and annilated the particular idea or verse or word study, he brings more. I think he's brillant. I'm also kinda geeky and weird. I do fix computers for a living so I have an excuse to be so. I don't know if there are a handful like me who will admit all that to an unknown, online audience.Fact of the matter is, if you want to exhaust the subject Sungenis sets his mind upon, you gotta get it. Then later you can go back to it as often as you like and learn something new you missed the first million times. If you do not want to do too indepth a study, skip and go on to someone else. But Sungenis MISSES NOTHING!"},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"this book was meant to be an apologetic defense of the sacrifice of the Mass and the Catholic teaching on the Eucharist. Sungenis does an excellent job laying out the Catholic position and giving answers to the common objections against it. This is a complete and thorough work on the topic, a must have for any serious Catholic. This book should be on every apologists book shelf."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"Not only is this the best, most thorough work of its kind, but if all Catholic priests had to master it and use it to teach about both the Real Presence and the necessaity of propitiation, then we would not see so many contemporary Catholics who think more like Zwinglians and Calvinists than like Catholics. As with Not By Faith Alone, this book is also a must for apologetics."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"Whewww, awesome!Let's go, seek and prostate ourselves to the Eucharistic Lord!Excellent job, Robert!"},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"All of the books written (or edited) by Robert Sungenis are all basically in the same vein. Slowly cover every inch of ground Biblically, linguistically and historically; then, systematically destroy the opponents arguments.It worked in Not By Faith Alone and Not By Scripture Alone and it works well here too.Mr. Sungenis explains the nature of God's covenant and the atonement in the Old and New Testaments and applies it to the theology of the Mass and the Real Presence. Finally, he develops the theology of the Eucharist historically through the writings of the church fathers. Through the course of the book, he shows how the Protestant (and Liberal Catholic) positions are simply unworkable Biblically or historically.If you are really interested in theology then dig in. It is written at an advanced laymans level. Its exhaustive, encyclopedic scope might intimidate some readers, but I encourage anyone to read it. The theology of the Lord's Supper is central to the Christian life, so study it carefully and I guarantee you will profit greatly from it."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"I am always very interested in apologetics, and this book is clearly the best defense of the traditional understanding of the eucharist. I agree with all of the positive reviews, and I wanted to bring to your attention some books that will further your study of the meaning of the eucharist and fellowship. These books will really help you draw out the ecclesiological implications of the eucharist and the liturgy.

Sungenis provides solid background behind the belief in covenant between God and man, and how this theme sets up our entire relationship with God. He goes through the Old Testament and explains the importance of propitiation, and how Christ atoned for man's sin.The book also provides a good defense of the Real Presence. He answers major Protestant objections, and the footnotes provide much more technical detail. The beginner may simply skip the footnotes and focus on the substance of his arguments in the actual text."},{"Title":"Not by Bread Alone: The Biblical and Historical Evidence for the Eucharistic Sacrifice of the Catholic Mass","review":"Let me say quickly:Apparently that last reviewer doesn't know what a fundamentalist is. That's the only way I can account for such a stupid comment.As for the book! This book gives the most concise explination for the Real Presence of any book I have read (and I've read quite a few). From the Biblical perspective, from the covenantal perspective, and from the historical perspective. Mr. Sungenis even takes on the professional antiCatholics head on and destroys their arguements.Great book!

Shades of Hiawatha though, was more like reading a mixture of what many others had said before. I wish the author would have spent more time developing own opinion, own words, own viewpoint and message to share with the reader.I enjoyed reading about the photographers and their views of Native Americans, what if anything they wanted to accomplish, but I hated that this was only a small portion of the book. Most of the books seemed to be in quotes."},{"Title":"Shades of Hiawatha: Staging Indians, Making Americans, 1880-1930","review":"Do you know how clever Alan Trachtenberg is?

This myth was mentioned as fact in W D Alexander's &quot;A Brief History of the Hawaiian People&quot; published over 100 years ago. It was perpetuated by a Spaniard living in Hawaii, Francisco de PauloMarin (&quot;manini&quot;).The argument in favor of the Spanish discovery rests in somepart on the Spanish charts which were seized by Anson when hecaptured a treasure ship in the Phillipines. Certainly thischart was known to Cook, and it does show islands at approximately the same latitude as Hawaii, but well to the eastof Hawaii's actual location.Dahlgren carefully sorts through the facts and demonstrates thatthis Spanish chart was not based on any known observattions,furthermore he shows that the Spaniard who supposedly made the discovery was in fact not even a competent navigator.It is a serious historical work, carefully written, and 100%convincing."},{"Title":"Were the Hawaiian Islands Visited by the Spaniards Before Their Discovery by Captain Cook in 1778?","review":"Dahlgren's thesis, that the islands depicted on dozens of pre-Cook globes and maps dating from the 1500s, were actually part of the Marianas Islands has no credibility. The Marianas are depicted on all these globes and maps where they are - nearly 4,000 miles west of Hawaii. Further, his conclusion is refuted by numerous authorities including La Perouse, Herb Kane, the staff of the Madrid Naval Museum, the late journalist Bob Krause, Wendell Carlsmith, Capt. Richard Rogers and author James Jarvis. In his \\"Legends and Myths of Hawaii\\", King Kalakaua noted that during the pre-Cook reign of Kamaluohua a ship was wrecked off Hawaii with five survivors. Oral Hawaiian histories noted pre-Cook foreigners landing there. That is but a handful of evidence disputing Dahlgren and supporting the conclusion that the Spanish arrived in Hawaii first."},{"Title":"Christmas Rhyme Time (My Turn Books)","review":"My daughter received this book when she was just about to turn 1.

I highly recommend this book because it isn't battery-powered or full of bells and whistles - just basic reading fun!"},{"Title":"Italian hours","review":"The films 'Room With a View' and 'Wings of the Dove' make one wonder about the Italy reflected in classical paintings executed before the destruction of WWII. My curiousity was heightened in an art history class when the instructor showed a photo slide of the Ponte Vecchio and told the amazing story of the Nazi pilot who disobeyed orders to destroy the last bridge the allies could cross on their advance north.This beautiful book brings to mind the saying, &quot;The Past is a Foreign Country.&quot; Italy of the 19th Century is a place none of us can know except through records left by one who witnessed it. The book consists of essays James wrote on his travels to various places in Italy including Venice, Rome, and Florence. He visited some places several times and the text reflects the changes he observed on revisits.He records an Italy whose poverty for a time prevented the intrusion of developers, who later made many changes perhaps for the worse. James was not a worshipper of old buildings, he appreciated them, but he was also aware of the suffering of the Italians, many of whom existed in dire poverty. His reflections on various cathedrals, churches and other objects of artistic interest are humanized by his comments about the individuals he encounters. He muses on the morality of travel, &quot;whether it has been worthwhile to leave his home [and] encounter new forms of human suffering.&quot; His awareness of the Italians themselves makes his writing a bit like that of Paul Theroux, a travler and writer in our times. James differs from Theroux however. My sense is that James is a little less likely to criticize and a little more willing to overlook unpleasantness. Perhaps that makes him less of a realist, or perhaps Italy was a more pleasant place in the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Click: A Book About Cameras and Taking Pictures","review":"I thought this book was great!

Part of Ian Allan's impressive 'Luftwaffe Colours' series, it offers a comprehensive, well-illustrated look at some pilots, aircraft and units that are seldom mentioned in standard Luftwaffe histories.If little known, the history of Luftwaffe anti-shipping efforts from 1939 to 1943 is nevertheless an interesting one. Units flew a smorgasbord of aircraft ranging from biplanes such as Heinkel 59s and Arado 96s to He 115 floatplanes and more modern warbirds such as the He 111, Junkers 88 and Focke Wulf 200. Imagine going to war in a lumbering He 59!The early war years were marked by an ongoing territorial battle between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine regarding the maritime attack mission, infighting resolved in favor of the Luftwaffe. Subsequently Luftwaffe aircrews were active laying mines and attacking enemy warships/shipping at sea and in harbors.Despite game attempts by men like Helmut Lorenz, Robert Kowaleski, Martin Harlinghausen, Bernhard Jope, Heinrich Schlosser and Herwig Ritter von Heider, the initial record of the Luftwaffe's maritime arm was mixed at best. Many claims were made but actual sinkings were few due in part to poorly performing torpedoes and lack of training received by crews in torpedo attacks.Goss does a good job of covering this early war period, summarizing missions flown, successes scored and lessons learned. Along with fleshing out the narrative with first-hand accounts from the aircrews, he includes mini-bio's of several successful pilots and commanders. The text is nicely served with over 150 color and black & white photos along with eighteen pages of color sideviews by Tom Tullis and Tim Brown.All in all, another winner from Ian Allan!****For more on this subject, check out Harold Thiele's LUFTWAFFE AERIAL TORPEDO AIRCRAFT AND OPERATIONS."},{"Title":"Sea Eagles: Luftwaffe Anti-Shipping Units 1939-1941 (Luftwaffe Colours)","review":"I buy the luftwaffe colours books on the models I like to make because they have great pictures and colour images of the aircraft.

Once in a while you see a picture of a float plane, even more rarely are pictures of the 4 engined FW 200.Hitler and his generals were land oriented. Almost all of their efforts were devoted to a bomber force, defended by fighters, that would assist the conquering army. Only a small force was set up to attack ships. At the beginning they were flying machines that seem more at home in books about World War I, biplanes with open cockpits, a long, long way from the ME 109 or a Spit. They were using torpedoes that didn't work and rudimentary bomb sights.Over time, and after winning an internal battle with the German Navy (everything that flew belonged to Goring.), the planes and the men began to improve. This is their story from 1939 to 1941. Here are more pictures of the FW 200 Condor that I ever imagined existed. Here are stories of attacks made, battles fought, the story of small brave units that fought a hard fight.This book has been needed for a long time."},{"Title":"ACME Catalog: Quality is Our #1 Dream","review":"Author Charles Carney has delivered a top-notch, giggle-producing tribute to some of the most glorious cartoon characters ever created.

Demonising learning by rote and excoriating the traditional British neglect of science, Howard Staunton, noted primarily as the only British chess master who could lay claim to being world champion of his day, claims that learning can only take place successfully if the active interest of the student is engaged. The classics must not be taught for their own sake - the living force of Greek and Roman civilisation must be invoked - corporal punishment is to be avoided at all costs and fagging should be abolished.Mens sana in corpore sano - a healthy mind in a healthy body is Staunton's ideal.Yet this book was published in 1865! Howard Staunton was a superb example of High Victorian self-confidence, a polymath who in turn acted on stage, became a noted chess writer and champion, edited an edition of Shakespeare and, in this volume, scrutinised the educational system at the core of the British Empire. Staunton organised the first international gathering of chess masters for the inaugural tournament of London in 1851,and for many years his works were the standard teaching tools for generations of aspiring chess players."},{"Title":"7 Ways to Build a Better You","review":"Sheri Rose Sheperd is wise beyond her years, and her book is a reflection of this and an inspiration.

She walks with you as you work on yourself emotionally, physically and spiritually.

This novel offers an interesting theory as to Perkin's true paternity, but its unlikely we'll ever know the truth of the matter now.For me, this book is good enough to make me keep my eyes open for any old copies of other historical novels by this author I may be lucky enough to find."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I got this book some 20 years ago and have experimented at a time with just about every single spell mentioned in that book. They have all worked beautifully - actually some have worked way better than I expected and they taught me some other lessons about the importance of mastering the control over one's thoughts and emotions, alongside with playing with power.This is not really a Wiccan book. It is eclectic book and mixes deities from an assortment of traditions. It has nothing to do with any religion, merely with using different tools to help you focus your mind on your outcomes effectively, helping you to create outstanding results.If you use it a lot, eventually, you will not need the external tools any more - but will be able to rely fully and completely on using the power of your mind alone. The book will help you to train your mind.A note on the \\"spells\\" in this book. They are beautifully written as a rhyme. Now, 20 years later, I still remember them. Using a rhyme is very effective way to impress ideas upon your subconscious mind.When I began using this book, I was experimenting with everything, just to see what happens. In those experiments I was repeating the \\"spells\\" verbatim as they are written, out of curiosity, and well, some things manifested in interesting ways, the wordings from those spells, even though I didn't really care to have them manifest. As you learn to write your own spells, you may incorporate the wording in them that you're certain you'd like to experience, because your subconscious mind has a tendency to accept everything literally, and then create it in your experience.In any event, this book is bound to bring you many interesting experiences."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I bought this book because my teacher asked me so in order to using it for a Psychic Self-Defense class. At first, when I read the first pages, and all the stuff about the author's boasting over results, I thought: what a nonsense! But then I tried one of the spells, I did not even provide incenses or candles or anything, just read one over and over in front of a candle. And it worked right away! I was in shock, but kept trying. One after another, all the magic proved to be worthy. As for evil spirits being attracted by some of the spells, I have not experienced anything of the sort.But once I tried one spell over getting rid of an individual I did not get along with. I asked no harm for anyone, and the result was I got an opportunity at another place, so I stopped being obliged to deal with that person at once. That was not what I had planned, but still it was what I had asked. That happens a lot of times with the spells in the book: if you are careful, they do not backfire (you always can add or modify lines to prevent it asking for no harm to come), but they may surprise you.This is one book I will never get rid of. If you need to prove yourself that magic exists, just try it."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I have the original version of this book (1974) It's true that some of the &quot;look how so and so found a job&quot; testimonials can be tiresome at times. However, there are excellent teachings in this book such as the cleansing and protection rituals and I loved the &quot;building of thoughtforms&quot; ritual, you don't see that in alot of current Neo-Pagan/New Age books. I also like how the chapters are broken down, and the &quot;homework&quot; at the end of each chapter, ensures that the individual has truely mastered the techniques and lessons of that chapter. If followed ,his instructions will leave you with a true sense of knowledge in the area of spell casting. It's been 20yrs since I bought the book and it is still one of my most cherished. Just a reminder if you are looking for information on the &quot;Religion&quot; of Wicca or any other path this is NOT what this book is about, This book focuses on spellcasting and building your own personal powers and abilities."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I purchased this book many years ago. I would not recommend it to someone just starting out because you may not recognize errors and be able to know how to make adjustments. There are also some spelling errors throughout the book that do not detract from the usefulness of the material. That being said, I have used the recipes in this book and they WORK! The rituals that I have used work extremely well. There are chants in this book that will pack a punch. A must read, but use with caution. This book was first published in 1972. Dr. Manning's rewrite of this book titled \\"Real Ritual Magick\\" came out in 1987 and did a much better job.

I understand he's not happy with the 'commercial' manner in which he was made to present the techniques in this book by the original publisher, but he has more than made up for it, because I think the material is very accessible. More power to him (and you, too)! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"Helping yourself with White Withcraft by Al G. Manning (founder to the ESP Lab) is THE classic text on white magic. It is a practical, clear &quot;how-to&quot; text... showing you by step in step instructions how to help yourself and others-- through spiritual healing nad future seeing.., with right thinking, spirit contact, divination, rituals, herbs, love spells, prosperity rituals. A celebration of life through better and better daily living.As Al says in his introduction, &quot;by using yhe great powers of white witchcraft you will quicky find that there is plenty of good to go around.&quot;Al is the founder of the famous ESP Lab ... offering fun, joy, esp and results, to an international white magic organization."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I bought my copy of this classic text years ago in a Florida bookstore used. I was just beginning to study Wicca & Magic at that time & thought this may be a worthwhile text. Well much to my surprise (and delight!) when I discovered it had nothing to do with Wicca's religion & more for simple Magic.Like all Parker Publishing books, Manning gives you simple yet effective instructions then gives you the case histories. Most of the case histories from other authors in the Parker line seem to be B.S. The difference here is that Manning has had his ESP Lab public since the 60's so it stands to reason that he has run into a LOT of people with problems that he could feed techniques like this to for experimentation. Thus my belief that the case histories in this book (& Manning's other books) are most likely real.What you get here is simple, easily performed spells & rituals along with nicely made chants that will give you some backbone in Sorcery. Clearly if you're tired of the typical McWiccan nonsense from Midwestern Sheeple publishers, then this is something you'll want to try. Why? this book does not have preachy ethics, boring history lessons & five pages of practical how-to. Rather this book is primarily how-to & very little of the filler material (re: ethics, morality, thou shalt nots, karma & blah-blah-blah).I don't have my copy in front of me at the moment but suffice to say the ritual using the Jupiter pantacle is quite powerful and the accompanying chant is worthwhile to learn & use. Make the pantacle using some plain white card stock, consecrate it, use the chant over it, present it to the Spirits of the Four Corners & carry it in your wallet or purse. Watch as money starts to come to you more effortlessly.Using this book is straightforward and easy. There's enough material in here to make you a Witch but not a Wiccan. Manning has made all of his book offerings well worthwhile to obtain, study & use. Just don't expect to find material about covens, three fold rules, karma, ethics, history, Gerald Gardner, Ceremonial MagicK or any of that nonsense.I do recommend this book as a primer for performing Sorcery as it can help you with performing Magic for the things in life that matter: home, career, relationships & money. I give it five out of five stars for being a complete system in and of itself as well as being highly practical."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"I found this book in a libary about 5 years ago. When I returned it I had to go buy me one. I picked it up for fun, but it started me on my path.It is a good book for someone new in the craft."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"This is one of the better books on witchcraft. It is very well organized and the author knows what he is talking about. The book is positive, because the author believes in what he is saying. It is not a con or false information. The spells and his advice work, if you work at them. With a lot of practice , witchcraft does work. There is no royal road to success and the occult is no exception. You must practice for a long time to see results. This is what Manning says in the book. I give the book a full thumbs up."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"First of all, I'm thankful that there is a book which defines witchcraft in a very meta-physical way, getting rid of the hocus-pocus and mumbo-jumbo stuff, at least, giving a good shot at presenting the public with white witchcraft. Another thing impressive is that it does not deny the existence of evil spirits, unlike many Wiccans and Pagans who refused to believe so. Therefore, with this two strong points, Mr. Maning has written a very profound introductory guide to white witchcraft. I'm really thrilled the first time I got into the book, because it covers from everyday magic to protection guide, it never denies and its application, I can say is quite universal. I'm glad to know that Mr. Maning has such insight into witchcraft, which has turned out to be the craft of the ignorants these days if you as me. Peoplem, epspecially teenagers are jumping on the bandwagon, heading only to trouble themselves with true responsibilities, unable to be coped. White witchcraft is a healthy process and it helps progresses one's life, many testimonies where given in the book and all I can say is that if it works, why not? Another great thing about the book is the simplicity of the topic, not going in too deep, we can understand the mechanism of witchcraft. We can understand its usefulness and its importance in our every day lives. Supposedly if you're a hippy and just become a Wiccan for the fun of it, then you will never really understand the importance of the book. This is a great book to be shared. However, I do not agree with Mr. Manings manipulation of the Goddesses. He treats them as if they are energy mining pools or spiritual slaves, at least in hs very scietific discussion to please the atheists."},{"Title":"Help Yourself with White Witchcraft","review":"This book is a good beginners window.

It is an excellent introduction to magic. Al Manning definitely knew what he was talking about.

All they want is their love or their money. If this is an accurate description of the person reading this review, then this book is for you. In this book Manning tells you how to safely cast spells, invoke Deities, and travel in the astral. Many people who attempt these things on their own get a lot more than what they bargained for.The prospective reader should note that there is a very good chance that the rituals in this book will fail for them. When you are not serious about something, things often do. However, it should also be stated that the more serious you the reader are, the better the chance of the rituals working. Their are some good ones in this book, including excellent ones to invoke Deities of love.The only problem with this book is there is nothing about the God and Goddess aspect of Witchcraft and it is not very religous.

I happen to be a Taurus, and the Diamond is my birthstone.2. He identifies Carnelian and Bloodstone as one and the same. This is NOT so. I happen to have both stones in my rock collection. I buy stones from a trusted lapidary.Bloodstone is a dark green stone with bright red dots. Bloodstone is a form of Jasper if memory serves.Carnelian is a translucent redish orange stone. Carnelian is a form of Agate if memory serves.

The story takes place in 1939 on the tarred flat roof of her family's Harlem apartment building where her family and friends gather in the warm summer night air. While Cassie enjoys and appreciates her family, her boundless imagination transcends debilitating socioeconomic boundaries and allows her to feel self-confident and capable of anything. Through both the inspirational text and illustrations, Ringgold urges that life's circumstances, no matter how hurtful, should not be taken at face value. Instead, one's attitude can overcome and triumph over anything.Ringgold's depiction of an African American female greatly furthers the effectiveness of Tar Beach. Cassie is a strong young lady who will not rely on a prejudiced society to determine her future. Rather, she constantly creates her own ambitions, regardless of how radical or impractical they may seem. For instance, Cassie dreams of her father being rich, having a more respected job, and even owning The Union Building. The character of Cassie encourages limitless dreams, especially for young African American readers.Cassie's model attitude is conveyed through her imagery-rich narrative that faces adversity head on. Her father is a blue-collar construction worker who must search for jobs in the winter. Society also excludes him from the privileges of union membership because he is \\"colored\\" and considered a \\"half-breed Indian.\\" In addition, Cassie's family doesn't have much money.Yet despite all this, Cassie says she feels \\"rich\\" from \\"lying on the roof in the night, with stars and skyscraper buildings all around [her].\\" She appreciates the surrounding beauty and fancifully talks of flying to those places she admires. She talks about the imaginative flights she takes, leaving the roof much like Peter Pan. This creative way that Cassie addresses her situations adds an unparalleled beauty to her life. For instance, she talks of flying over the George Washington Bridge and wearing it \\"like a giant diamond necklace.\\" Ringgold uses Cassie's narrative to inspire by first explaining the potential beauty that can be experienced, and then explaining, \\"it's very easy, anyone can fly. All you need is somewhere to go that you can't get to any other way.\\"To compliment the text, Ringgold created amazing illustrations using acrylic on canvas paper, which were designed to resemble a quilt. The creative and colorful illustrations further this idea of overcoming life's obstacles by beautifully depicting Cassie's flights over her home, surrounding skyscrapers, and the beloved bridge. Ringgold also uses a two-dimensional style to depict Cassie when she is flying. This adds a visual separation between real-life images and Cassie's surreal fantasies. Overall, the illustrations are bright and include many patterns and geometric shapes. These intricacies communicate the cheerful complexity of life.By transcending reality, Cassie is able to rise above her problems and feel triumphant and empowered. Tar Beach is an appealing and creative work which offers hope and encourages the continual search for beauty and self-empowerment."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Tar BeachThe name of the book I'm reading is Tar Beach,the author is Faith Ringold. The book is published by Dragontly books. There are 24 pages, the ages should be 8-10 years of age. The main character is a girl who dreams she can fly over many things. I don't know why the call it Tar Beach, because it is not really a beach at all. My cousin has a connection to the book, because he dreams he can fly to. My unanswered questions are dose her dad lose his job, and dose she ever dream of flying again after she gets in trouble from her dad? My least favorite thing is when they said her dad was going to lose is job. My most favorite thing is when she said she had ice cream every day for dessert. I like it because the girl has a good imagnain. The book I think should have 4 stars, because she helpped her father build thier house, help around the house, and help her mom make dinner. I think Faith Ringold should make a version two of this book and tell if her dad lost is job, and if they took down the icecream factory. The book is really good because she really exspress the characters feelings about where she lives, and what she lives like. Dad feels horrible when he finds out he is going losing his job. Mom says it is okay, because she is steal working and she gets a lot of money. The daughter is telling dad that mom is right. After a month or so Janet has to stop going to school. I think you should read this book. I think you would like it to. So go to the public library and check out Tar Beach!"},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Tar Beach is a wonderful, encouraging book.

The book was a 1992 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This book exemplifies Faith Ringgold's genuine love of children and art.

The illustrations are beautiful.This book is a Caldecott Honor Book. I can see why it won this award. This book describes a young girls dream of flying above her home, which is something many children could identify with."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"First off, this book would pair brilliantly with Deborah Hopkinson's, \\"Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt\\". Utilizing a style not unlike the classic slave quilts featured in \\"Sweet Clara\\", \\"Tar Beach\\" tells a contemporary story while tying its narrative to the history of African American storytelling. Before I say anything else, though, I should warn you about something. When I first read this book I had borrowed it from my local lending library. The copy I got out was a hardcover from 1991. Now, do you remember getting books when you were a kid and they, not to put too fine a point on it, stank? Certain picture books have some kind of binding glue or something that, over time, makes them stink to high heaven. This book was especially smelly and even as it sits next to me here on my desk I'm reluctant to open it up for reference because of its offensive odor. It's quite possible, even probable, that the editions of this book being sold now (being paperback and all) are smell free and no longer printed so as to attack one's olfactory senses. Just don't buy a used hardcover copy from 1991. That's all I'm saying.In this tale a small African-American girl dreams of flight. In her flight she is powerful and free. The George Washington bridge, a magnificent structure that her father helped to build, is a diamond necklace around her neck. Flying high, the girl gives her father the union building he's working on, \\"Then it won't matter that he's not in their old union, or whether he's colored or a half-breed Indian, like they say\\". With her father so gainfully employed her mother \\"won't cry all winter\\" when her dad goes out looking for work. She'll be able to sleep late and (this is the most heartbreaking part for me), \\"we can have ice cream every night for dessert\\". The girl daydreams these flights while the family goes up to what they like to call Tar Beach. On the roof of their building they have peanuts and chicken and watermelon as well. She sums up by explaining, \\"it's very easy, anyone can fly. All you need is somewhere to go that you can't get to any other way. The next thing you know, you're flying among the stars\\".On the last two pages of the book a long history of author/illustrator Faith Ringgold explains her life, the history of her work, the history of African Americans in the 1930s, and the basis of this tale. A quilter by trade, the left page displays the amazing quilt that inspired \\"Tar Beach\\" the book. In this quilt, the girl and her brother sit not too far from their parents and neighbors. Above, the girl soars over the George Washington Bridge and the words of the book are written into the fabric of the quilt. Parents reading this book to their kids would do well to read the summary at the end of the tale to themselves before reading the picture book to their children. That way they'll be better equipped to answer any potential questions the children might bring up regarding labor union practices regarding African Americans or the history of flight in the stories of slaves. This book covers a lot of ground. The basis of the tale itself is rooted in Ringgold's own experiences of growing up in Harlem as a child. She even gives a little background on the characters discussed within the tale and their lives.The book is drawn using acrylics on canvas paper with the occasional quilted piece appearing on the sides. As for the plot, kids reading the book may be a little confused as to whether or not the heroine of the tale actually is flying or if it's just in her head. After all, there's a pretty clear picture of her little brother lying below looking up as his sister soars. If kids are able to get past that little detail, however, they'll probably love the tale. I mean, who hasn't wanted to fly freely over friends and family? Who hasn't wanted to give their parents everything they'd need to be happy? Or, for that matter, own an ice cream factory?The book is well rooted in history, imagination, and colorful storytelling. With a pedigree such as this, it's hard not to admire it thoroughly. And if you'd like yet another book to pair it with during your storytime, consider \\"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\\" by H.H. Smith, which is ALSO about the building of the George Washington bridge. Altogether this is an important book with a well told message."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"My students read the book, talked about where they'd want to fly to, and then created their own art similar to Faith Ringgold."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"The best scenario: The child has been to a museum and viewed the quilt \\"Tar Beach\\" or has spent a summer evening on the roof of a New York City building that doesn't have air conditioning and knows that there is no actual beach in the book. That is not an inference a child would make on his or her own.As neither of these things are likely, I found that there was a lot of peripheral information needed for a child of 9 to enjoy and understand the book. We looked at Faith Ringgold images on the net, especially her wonderful sculptures, so that one got the idea of who she is. I explained why a person building a bridge would be nicknamed a \\"half-breed indian\\" and what a \\"union\\" is and why that would be important. I was reading with a black child who recently arrived from her first home which was in England. She didn't know that African Americans were formerly known as colored, nor that there had been restrictions in America for African Americans (or in her case, British Americans of African origin). I probably should have begun with the Michael Venezia Book on Faith Ringgold which would have been more biographical in general, and then, later, to \\"Tar Beach\\" which was about the artist's relationship to that one work of art.So, this is a good book, which needs adult guidance.

That is one reason I love Clare Beaton's illustrations so well.Faith Ringgold's Tar Beach is just marvelous in the illustration department -- fabric and quilts and a child who flies above the things she can not have, and makes them her own.We're not city people, and so my kids love the illustrations of the city and the rooftop.Just wonderful -- every kid can relate to it."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"A Caldecott Honor book for excellence in illustration, Tar Beach tells the story of Cassie Louise Lightfoot's imaginary flights around her tiny apartment rooftop in Harlem and the George Washington Bridge. It's magically inspiring as Cassie soars to freedom. Faith Ringgold created Tar Beach as a story quilt and it is part of the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City.-- Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Tar Beach allows Cassie Louise Lightfoot to dream while her parents play cards on the roof. The book demonstrates how children use their imagination to solve problems. In addition, Cassie Louise Lightfoot wants to help her father by giving him parts of New York. In other words she wants to help him avoid working for a union. Finally, the author also presents illustrations of quilts that she has made and learned from her grandmother, who had been enslaved."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is an excellent book to read to young children. The author gives the reader indepth information about her family but also some historical information about her hometown, Harlem. The illustrations sweep the reader along on Tar Beach and keeps you turning the brightly colored pages. You are able to hear Ms.Ringgold's voice when you read this book and get a taste of life in her family."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"I don't know why this book was called Tar Beach, but it's interesting. It's about a little girl who is picked up by the stars and has the ability to own everything she flies over. Pretty cool huh? Whether she can actually do this or she just dreams of doing this, who knows.A neat feature of this book is it was actually written and illustrated first on a quilt before being converted to paper. Maybe next somebody will try writing a book on a sculpture."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"An excellent book for its literay value and artistic illustrations. A great memory for anyone who has lived in New york City and remembers going to their own rooftop gatherings in the summers."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"My class loved this book. It was part of an African American History unit."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This is a picture book in the style that I call \\"dreamy\\". The girl is dreaming about flying through the city, wearing the bridge her father helped build as a necklace, giving him the union building he can't join because of his race and so on.There's no real storyline, just her thoughts as her family goes up to \\"tar beach\\" (the roof of her house - I did that as a child, and sometimes regret that my nieces have a nice yard but no walking-on roof!) to laugh and be together and have fun.This book would be very appropriate for bedtime. That's why I call this style of book \\"dreamy\\", in fact. Pick up a copy, you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"'Tar Beach&quot; by Faith Ringgold is a book that a child of any age could enjoy. Any child could relate to Cassie Louise Lightfoot. Every child has dreams and this book supports the need for children to escape into their own world of imagination. Ringgold is a talented author and illustrator. I feel that children can truly relate to her stories and paintings."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"This lovely picture book has appeal not only for it's artistic value, but also the sensitivity it provides for African-American History. In viewing Cassie as she flies over her city and claims buildings and a bridge, we see a little girl's dreams of a life in which her family will rise to their own freedom from discrimination. This imaginative book is beautifully depicted from it's original quilt story. Ringghold is a wonderfully talented artist with the ability to make Tar Beach come alive in these pages."},{"Title":"Tar Beach (Caldecott Honor Book)","review":"Faith Ringold is a fantastic artist and storyteller.

Unfortunately, we were notified rather late as to this text being required reading. What a help it would have been to have this compassionate, wise and humane guide prior to seeing clients! I have used Morrison's &#34;The First Interview&#34; as a standard; Lukas successfully takes the clinical content and weaves a cogent, structured and narrative means of addressing the first interview without the clinical edge inherent in Morrison. Lukas also includes sections on children and couples.

Thank you so much. I highly recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"Don't be misled by the cunning title. This book is of use only to the most vapid and self-absorbed therapists or social workers.I resented almost each of the 184 pages that I read in excruciating agony. Don't get me wrong, I was enthusiastic at first, then I started reading it. Her writing is less than inspiring. \\"Why?\\", a reader might ask, is an assessment important? Ms. Lukas is quick to respond that without an assessment, we wouldn't know what the problem is. It's insight like this that earns her a far, far down in the Amazon bestseller list.I was watching this episode of \\"American Idol\\" last night, and saw this kid singing. I thought to myself, Wow!, this kid is good! I hope he wasn't abused! This is exactly the kind of caring that Ms. Lukas calls for in making assessments. I seem to have all the right attributes. Time for the next chapter, although it's going to be hard to top this one!In her best moments, Ms. Lukas almost overcomes her powerful sense of self-importance to convey something useful, but never quite makes it happen. It's a shame that this book ends up as just another pointless slaughter of perfectly good trees. This wasted paper and wasted my time. Ms. Lukas again attempts to use her innovative \\"Powerpoint Bullet-point\\" style of writing to convey a sense of urgency, but comes up dry, like the Sahara on a hot California Friday afternoon in Summer, when there hasn't been any rain in a long, long time. I am reminded of the review on the back cover of the book, where Mr. Strean lauds the book as \\"highly readable.\\" I would have to, like, totally agree with him. My initial analysis suggests that this book is composed of largely english vocabulary loosely organized into a framework of sentences and paragraphs. I didn't have the time to get much further than this, however, because it all seemed so schizophrenic. She hops from one half-finished thought to the next with the frequency of a cheap portable radio.Why is there no zero star rating?"},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"These days, in preparation for my internship in the fall, I'm trying to read books that will remind me how to work clinically. This one is excellent, and I deeply wish I had read it in my second or third year of graduate school. I had to learn a lot of this stuff on the job, through floundering and making mistakes, and my field experiences would have been worlds easier if someone had just told me these things. This is an extremely practical (NO theory) how-to book for social work/psychology students who are just starting out and want to know how to conduct initial interviews with various clients -- adults, children (and their parents), couples, families, etc. It also covers issues such as assessing for violent potential, suicidality, and child abuse/neglect. It's written in a very simple manner and the style and information is appropriate for students rather than professionals. However, it's serving as an excellent review for me. I also recommend it to supervisors as a good resource for providing guidance to their supervisees."},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"This book is a quick read that clearly outlines exactly what the title says, where to start and what to ask. Questions to assess for suicidality, homicidality and abuse are provided. Intake interviews and the specific nuances involved are written about as well as a comprehensive set of questions to ask during an intake interview. There is a set of developmental and medical questions that really help to cover all the milestones. Some of the questions are quite detailed, but you can easily pick and choose what you want to utilize or leave out. I used many of the questions when developing my own intake interview questionnaire. Working with children, adults, couples and families are addressed as well as questions to ask during an initial intake interview for them. Pitfalls to look out for are given. This is a highly applicable book for those in the mental health or social work field."},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"This is a really good book... I only wish I had it when I was a graduate student social worker. It would have helped me so much. What a terrific resource. My only regret: Susan you ought to write more books for student and entry level social workers. The reading was enjoyable, clear and took the mystery out of how-to-begin. Thank you, Susan."},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"I read this book as a beginning graduate student, and underlined, highlighted, and marked up many relevant passages. Now as a professor teaching graduate students in Counseling, my students find it every bit as useful as I did. They consistently rate this the most useful of all the books and readings they've done. As another reviewer noticed, you won't find theory. Just the practical, how-to nuts and bolts of how to do a mental status exam, describe a client's affect, what to say in your first meeting with a family, couple, child or adult, and how to keep youself safe when working with potentially violent clients. If you are starting out in clinical work, this book will be one you will reference often."},{"Title":"Where to Start and What to Ask: An Assessment Handbook","review":"I found this book to be very helpful in supervision of both students and professionals preparing for licensure.
