I thought it would be fun, and it was at first. My daughter would compare Kermit's potty chair to hers (&quot;Kermit has yellow handles! Anne has green handles!&quot;) and so on, comparing Kermit's bathroom rug, towels, soaps, toilet paper, etc. But after only a day, the book started to bother her, and I didn't notice it myself right off, but Anne sure did...on the first page of the book, Kermit is in a sand box, playing with a friend. The friend has a green truck which she has filled with sand. Kermit has a yellow pail and a shovel and he is, presumably, about to fill his pail with sand. Then he stops to go inside and use the bathroom. When he comes back, on the last page, his little friend has filled the yellow pail with sand and is still holding the pail and the shovel. Anne said, &quot;Kermit want yellow pail&quot; the first time she saw it, then she started insisting, &quot;Kermit wants fill up yellow pail!&quot; And then she went through a period where she didn't want to interrupt what she was doing to go to the bathroom; even the mention of &quot;potty&quot; brought insistent cries of &quot;no! no! no!.&quot; She's so afraid that when she comes back, somebody else will have done or finished something for her that she wanted to do herself or that she was in the middle of doing. Although I'm sure that feeling of not wanting to interrupt the play or miss anything is a common set-back in potty training, I've put the book out of sight... because this book sure doesn't help ease a child's concern over the issue!"},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"i am 15 years old and this book was SO useful for my potty uses. i would like to thank old kermie for helping me through my...problems..."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"My 2 year old daughter enjoyed it, she was able to relate it to herself and I am sure she will benefit from it.

It features a little Muppet boy who has been learning to use a potty seat. The youngster talks about how happy he is to be a big boy and wear pants and go potty by himself. He interrupts play, takes down his pants, sits on the potty and \\"goes\\", wipes, flushes, pulls up his pants and washes his hands before going back to play, where his friend and toys are waiting to pick up where they left off.The book features a potty seat that sits on the big toilet rather than a free-standing potty chair, and no phrases for defecation or urination are used. A good choice for families in this interesting phase of development."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"The strength of this book lies in its straight forward approach. Kermit tells the reader exactly what to do when you use the potty, in a step by step fashion. I noted that this was one of the few books that included washing hands. When Kermit is done he reviews the steps of pottying. Granted this is not great story telling, and I would have liked to have seen a sentence saying that it is good and clean to use the potty and that Kermit was proud. However this particular approach was very helpful for my autistic toddler."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"I have been working with my son in toilet training the last few weeks and this book hits the spot.

This book helped my daughter deal with all the steps in going to the potty. Where she was resistant -- well, if it was good enough for Kermit, it was good enough for her. She does all the steps in order, and would not dream of returning to play without washing her hands. We've returned to the book for follow-up lessons in things like not using too much toilet paper and pulling up your own trousers.The &quot;hip-hip hooray&quot; part at the end (&quot;Look how proud Kermit is!&quot;) is very important. The song fits the ABC song tune."},{"Title":"I Can Go Potty (Muppet Babies Big Steps Book) (Golden Books)","review":"This is my favorite potty book because it is actually the most realistic. Step by step, it matches what a child really does when going to the bathroom. First, Kermit must stop playing -- a very important point! He runs to the potty, unsnaps his pants, goes potty on a toilet with a child's seat on top, snaps up and washes his hands. When he goes back to play with his friend, the toys and his friend are still there. If you have a child that doesn't like to stop playing to take time to go potty, you know how important that is.

Unfortunately it fails to convince anyone because Sinclair is so self-righteous and so boring that he makes cirrhosis of the liver sound preferable to following his advice."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"Sanity is not always called for. This story explores one alternative. It's a dark alternative, but it's an alternative to an even darker reality.This is another of Mack's lavish painted comics. To call it 'painted', though, is faint praise. Drawing, lettering in a few different hands, collage, painting - the visual layering and intensity are incredible. The story itself is stark, physically static the with dynamics all in Kabuki's mind. Somehow, Mack conveys and sustains that moment when even desperation fails.Mack's images are filled with deconstructed text. My eye instinctively tries to read it all, but that would defeat the purpose of the imagery. On the other hand, ignoring it defeats the purpose of the writing. This is a book I'll come back to, to give it all the different readings it deserves."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"I stumbled across David Mack's breathtaking Kabuki: Circle of Blood in a second-hand bookstore and found it absolutely amazing. The story follows Kabuki, a young female Japanese assassin involved in a tangled web of espionage, murder, and revenge, engaged in a deadly game of chess with an archenemy from her past. The black and white artwork gave Frank Miller's art from Sin City a run for its money, and the storytelling-- filled with allusions to philosophy, pop culture, literature, and Japanese culture-- was simply amazing, on par with Jeph Loeb and approaching even the great Alan Moore. Halfway through the book I went back to the second-hand book shop and picked up the used copy of Kabuki: Dreams that I had seen sitting on the shelf next to Circle of Blood. Upon finishing the first book in the series, I immediately turned to my prize: Dreams, the second book in the series, and began reading.Dreams begins right where Circle of Blood left off. What I saw when I turned to the first page was beautiful black and white imagery that could have come straight from the first volume. As I continued to read, the artwork began incorporating much more color, and the type of media began changing from inks to acrylic, to watercolor, to oil, to photography, then back again. When I finished the first chapter I was amazed at what I had seen-- David Mack was surely an artist on top of his game; however, as I tried to remember what I had read, I could not come up with anything. Such is the case with the rest of this book as well: great art, but very weak storytelling. What little story there is unfolds mainly in images, with little to no words at all. Though his sparse use of words makes what few words are there carry extra weight, there is only so much story that can be told with pictures, especially when the story is as metaphysical as it is in Dreams. Perhaps though, that is the point of this work, to try to convey ideas that are not very well expressed with words. Perhaps this is why I was disappointed with this volume: after the complex story of Circle of Blood, and the heady mix of action, suspense, and thoughtful contemplation contained therein, I was expecting more plot and action in Dreams, and there was neither.Some have written Kabuki: Dreams off as rubbish, while others have lauded it breathtakingly amazing; however, I believe it to be neither. To call it rubbish is to admit that this book flies over one's head, but to call it breathtakingly amazing is to place undue weight on deliberately vague storytelling that could be accused of masquerading as brilliance. This book is designed to be a bridge between Kabuki: Circle of Blood and Kabuki: Masks of the Noh, a bridge that gets the reader into the main character's head in a way that Circle of Blood was unable to do, and, when treated as such, this book succeeds. If you are interested in this book because you are expecting it to be in the same vein as Circle of Blood, as I was, then you will be severely disappointed. You will miss nothing in the overarching Kabuki saga if you skip this title and move on to Masks of the Noh. However, if you are interested in the psyche of Kabuki the character, if you want to find out more about her subconscious before continuing her journey with her, or if you simply want to see some art that is ahead of its time, then you will thoroughly enjoy this title.In summary, the artwork contained in this title is spectacular, and David Mack should be praised for his innovation and fearlessness as an artist. The story, though, is barely there, and will likely leave you disappointed and feeling fairly unfulfilled as a reader."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"I'm not going to say that the pictures were by any means all perfect. There was lots of gorgeous artwork in this book, and it was a visual treat. However, some of the pictures felt rather slapped together or amateurish, and I do wish there could have been more to the story. Still, it does get better in the next book, so just consider this one as even more of a 'graphic' novel than usual."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"The artwork in Kabuki: Dreams is breathtaking. It is unlike anything I have seen in a graphic novel before. Stylistic does not even begin to describe it. Mack takes you on roller coaster ride of different styles and shows why he is a master of his trade. From begin to end you are presented with page after page of some of the most beautifully rendered \\"abstract story telling\\" you will ever see... at least how much of it is actually there.This is where Dreams falls short and why despite how much I loved the artwork and the style of storytelling, I can't give it more than 3 stars. It's short. Really, really short. Even pausing to take in each page to grasp the subtle message each is trying to portray to you, it's still a really, really short experience and definitely not one for everyone. Coming off of the first volume I was expecting something completely different. While delighted with the beauty of this entry, it is not \\"essential\\" to the story of Kabuki and can be safely skipped for those who would rather continue the story where it dropped in the last volume.If you are into breathtaking art with lots of existentialism, by all means, buy this novel (I purchased the Hard Cover myself and do not regret it). If not, borrow it from a friend or from the public library if you are lucky enough to find a copy and skip this purchase."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"Not one of Mack's greater accomplishments. I love the artistry of his hand. The curves, the movement, the violence he displays with drawings. Real ink and paper. Towards the end of 'Dreams' he resorts to pictures of live blurry women and children's plastic dolls with Kabuki masks on black backgrounds. WHERE IS THE INK!? The real expression, not the highschool photography class. I pray his future expression is a little more from the heart and a little less from the lense."},{"Title":"Kabuki Dreams (VOL. 2)","review":"I read the first Kabuki: Circle of blood. Great story.

He kind of just needs to move things along and make his point, then he could be free to speak as much as he would like on all the other stuff. Even Friere himself admitted much later on, that some of his stuff was inaccessible. it must be hard to love all the great philosophers and not aspire to write the same kind of neurotic diatribe.

A few years later, a few really enjoyable English courses, and a better appreciation for literature I decided to give it another try. I was able to follow the way he wrote little moments and started to understand the connections. It was really exciting and I started to get in his style. I read it very quickly, because it is easy to get stuck in his details and images. I did go back and read it again slowly. I wasn't worried about understanding the plot, and I was able to enjoy the images and details. One must read in the style that he writes in order to enjoy the book. I like the difference between the book and the movie. It's not gripping, but it is very good."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Wonderful and detailed story however a very,very long read.

She knows his body as well as a lover would, but knows very little about who he really is. The Bedouin found him in the Sahara when he ejected from his crashing blazing airplane. They put out the fire engulfing his body, wrapped him carefully and brought him to the Italian villa where the allies set up a hospital amidst undetonated Nazi bombs. Now the others have left except for the maniacal nurse and her English Patient.Hana is not concerned with who her English Patient is and what he might have done or even if he is married; as he has given her a reason to live. Still grieving the death of her father, Hana feels that the unknown burn victim is her family. However, her idyllic parasite is invaded by thieving spy Caravaggio who was tortured and maimed by the enemy, and Kip the Sikh from India working as a sapper mine detonation expert for the British army in North Africa. The newcomers feel as displaced by the war as do the Canadian and her patient.This is reprint of one of the most haunting classic war stories ever written. The story line focuses on displacement of four people who had diverse roles in WWII. Each character is fully developed coming from different cultures though all are part of the sun setting on the British Empire as the war closes. All's quiet on the African front, but the aftermath of war remains as volatile as the unexploded ordinance; symbolized by these protagonists who come together over the mystery of whom is the English Patient.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"If you are looking for a book with a great plot and action of any kind look elsewhere. With that said, I didn't love this book, but I also didn't hate it. Ondaatje is clearly talented and his writing reflects that talent. However, this seemed to be more than \\"a. . . web of dreams.\\" It seems to me to reveal a weakness in the author. After reading, I feel like he just sat down and wrote whatever came to his mind and in the beginning that was great. He established a beautiful yet tragic setting that ultimately reflected the characters interacting within. He also built characters that seemed very complex and for awhile everything seemed to be running smoothly. Then somewhere in the middle of the book everything became stagnant for quite a while, until the end where I felt like everything went crazy and the ending was ultimately rushed."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I arrived with high expectations: this novel won the Booker no less, and I adored the movie. Unfortunately I disliked the book for the very reasons I loved the movie: it is an epic, poetic, sweeping vision of romance. For three hours on screen one can be carried away in this way. But for 300 pages? Ondaatje asks too much of us.The characters do not speak to one another or think, unless it is in the most meticulously floral language. There is not an inelegant passage in the book! Of course, there are many readers open to such a book, but others should steer clear of this long winded rumination on love and war."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is novel motivated by intrigue. In story that is as mysterious as the shadowy Tuscan villa in which it unfolds, Ondaatje skillfully weaves together the lives of four war-ravaged individuals. There is Hana, a young nurse who has renounced emotion after the deaths of her father and lover; Kip, a stoic and mechanical Sikh sapper who has embraced a tenuous and solitary existence; and Caravaggio, a once suave thief who has been discharged with maimed hands and an uncertain identity. Flotsam of the Italian Campaign, these three disoriented souls drift around the centerpiece of the novel - an encyclopedic man burned beyond physical recognition. In unraveling the cloak surrounding the English Patient's past, the others begin convalescence.Ondaatje is a masterful visual artist. By communicating the story through sequences of stream-of-consciousness recollections and haphazard but vivid flashbacks, he impresses images of \\"the white plain of her stomach\\" or \\"the permanent desert winds that live in present tense\\" into readers' minds. These fleeting glimpses into the characters' complex pasts never constitute an entire piece of the puzzle but serve their purpose by engaging curiosity. By intertwining elegant statements such as \\"\`Give me a map and I'll build you a city. Give me a pencil and I will draw you a room in South Cairo, desert charts on the wall,'\\" the author creates mystiques unique to each of the characters. An intricately connected web of human emotions, The English Patient is a compelling read. While its appeal may not be towards the general audience, engaged readers will find it near impossible to untangle themselves from the labyrinthine lives of this novel's characters."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"&quot;The English Patient&quot; by Michael Ondaatje is a fantastic book, a must read. Mysterious, fascinating, enthralling, Ondaatje deserves all the most laudatory adjectives. A heart-warming love story staged amidst a fascinating historical background, and spiced up with a touch of mystery (who is the English patient?), this novel is terrific. The film was also very good, but the book, as usual, is in my opinion better."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This novel is sensual and thrilling. The characters are so interwoven and intricate. It is a fairly quick read with a complex story. Even more fasinating are the allusions to history and art. Allusions that work themselves into the plot unlike anyother novel I have ever read.The only flaw in this novel (and it is a major one)is that the character of Kip (one of the most interesting characters) behaves out of character and more for the political protest of the author. This is the only reason why I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5 stars."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book is lovely and its tell in such a particular way I just can't describe. I love the characters, and the situations.While I was not so interested about The English Patient's story, is thing whith Katharing adn the problem with Clifton, I just loved the love story between Hana and Kip. I swear I was this near to cry when he left the Villa.The movie is lovely. It isn't better than the book, neither is it worse. It is just a great adaptations that captures the exact same spitir of the novel, which I saw AFTER reading, but puts everything in a magical visual way.The only thing that I don't understand is how Ondaatje is pronounce."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje is a superb writer. The English Patient is a brilliant book. Ondaatje's genius is to reveal characters as people are revealed in life - not in linear chronological narratives, but in glimpes, flashes of lightning, disconnected anecdotes. Sometimes contradictory, always fascinating. The book takes the shape of these disparate images and recollections slowly coalescing to form four protagonists: Hana the Canadian nurse, Almasy the English Patient, Caravaggio the thief, and Kip the Sikh deminer. They are isolated from the world in a postwar Italian villa, each with subtle motives defined by Ondaatje's profound attention to detail.The prose is evocative, like Almasy's comment on Kipling: to be read slowly and then reread. Images and scenes slowly take shape like a jigsaw puzzle. It is not until the final few pages that we finally learn what compels Hana to tend so devotedly to the mortally-burned English Patient, it is not until the final pages that Kip reviews his dedication to the British war cause. The characters' evolutions come slowly and naturally as Almasy's stories of the desert catalyze the entire book.The movie is not this book. Read the book - it's brilliant."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"not my favorite book of all time but still good. if you have problems getting through the beginning stick with it because the end is pretty good."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"An odd tale of four wounded persons meeting in an Italian villa.

Strange and quiet, but entrancing with unforgettable characters."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje, simply put, is one of our best living writers. He writes in seamless prose that could almost be called poetry. But unlike some writers who write beautifully but can't fashion it into a good story, Ondaatje has mastered both.I won't bother going over the plot, plenty of people have done that, but the character studies are truly amazing. I know it's cliched to say \\"I felt like I was really there,\\" but this is one of the few books I've read where I can honestly say that.Another thing I love about this book, and all of his books, is that I loved it the first time I read it, and I loved it even more the second time. He's one of the few writers where I can turn to the middle of one his books that I've already read and just be swept away again, reading several random pages and finding things I didn't notice before. A true modern masterpiece."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"If you want to be transported to a different place and time, if you love romances that are so powerful, this is a great read."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book is actually really interesting. The author does a good job with this book - the story is told in bits and pieces, jumping back and forth between time and between the perspectives of different characters. Ondaatje explores a variety of themes: boundaries, identity issues, love, war and war scars, nature, religion...The English Patient really transcends normal books in that respect. It covers a lot of different thought-provoking themes. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one strange story. The English patient is being cared for by anurse in a broken down villa in the hills of Italy in 1944 or 1945. The war has passed by here and is being fought further on.. You become familiar with those two and their history, then a family friend of the nurse hears of her and comes to stay. A bomb disposal expert, a sapper, comes for the beauty of the churches he has seen and wanted to show to his friend.The story is told as if from a distance. You are not really intimate with the characters. You do get to know all about them, but you just do not feel like you are being told everything. It may be the back and forth from one character to another, from here and now (1945) to the past of one or the other person that makes for the distance you feel.An odd point is the love of one for the others. They each love each other for different reasons. They are each working through their own hecks created by the war. In the end they have all worked out their shell shock, except the sapper: he has found a new, permanent heck that no one can help him get away from. They end going their own ways, but you get the feeling that they will always carry within themselves a bit of each other."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Booker Prize winning The English Patient by Sri-Lankan born Michael Ondaatje is an incredibly original piece of fiction that, despite some lengthy parts, is a very satisfying read. Adapted into an Academy Award winning movie, it is the story of a young nurse in post World War II Italy who lives in solitude with a burn victim known only as the English patient. The nurse, Hana, remained in the abandoned and booby-trapped villa to care for the English patient even after everyone there had moved on. These two found the basis for what comes to be the temporary home of four people: the English Patient, Hana, Hana's late father's best friend Caravaggio, and an Indian sapper named Kip.The story plays its part differently from the perspective of each of these main characters. Most of this book is character development; it delves into the past of each character, and switches viewpoints often. It is a story of love past and present, and the difficulty that World War II posed on people's lives.The writing style is interesting, and while not unique, not commonly read. The book does drag at some points, and is not in any way a quick read. The story jumps around a lot, and while this leads to good character development, can make it hard to get involved with the story. You feel attachment to the characters, but only one at a time it feels like. It is filled with solid, interesting themes, but they are separated so much it is hard to see it as a whole.That being said, it is a good story, with incredibly filled-out characters, and makes for a good, thoughtful read. The premise makes for one of the most unique plots that I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book with theme, thought, and heart."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's prose is lyrical and poetic. More than anything, Ondaatje creates an atmoshpere that is as much a presence in this book than any single character. The story delves into the lives of four people living in a war-damaged Italian monastery as World War II ends. Hana, a nurse, attempts to nurse the English patient back to life. Caravaggio, Hana's childhood friend, and Kip, a skillful bomb difuser, make up the rest of the cast of characters. Beautifully and evocatively written but slow at times."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"To Hana the nurse, English patient is \`a white lion'. I've come to expect movie characters to bear a marginal resemblance to those of the novel from which they are extracted. Seldom do the people in the novel voice anything resembling the clever lines from the film. Ondaatje describes brilliantly his story settings and the psychoanalytical introspections of his characters like an omniscient Nanny narrator.Some of this book's visceral content presents itself as juvenile voyeuristic, not to be confused with the sort of obligatory 'adult content' that's required to provoke a publisher to finish reading a manuscript submission.While the main storyline describes some heroic coping mechanisms adopted by it's characters to survive their various war-induced neurosis', the English patient suffers physical and emotional wounds which will kill him. maybe it should have been called 'The Great Escape'. Except that the author seems to have wanted a title that would be hemorrhaging irony. The critics called Ondaatje, 'poetic'. And his skill with words may be described as accomplished. he has been researching the writings to the Royal Geographic Society by explorers of the Libyan Desert. We have a glimpse into \\"the tact of [Ondaatje's] words.\\" \\"In the desert to repeat something would be to fling more water into the earth.\\"\\"Here nuance took you a hundred miles.\\" AND\\"A man in a desert can hold absence in his cupped hands knowing it is something that feeds him more than water.\\"I know the feeling of being enveloped in the 'emptiness' of the Mojave Desert, which sometimes can belie the impression that there maybe is nothing, maybe never was nor ever will be anything to come back to."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"In reviewing Michael Ondaatje's recent novelDIVISADERO, I remarked that his narrative technique involved writing short fragments, loosely connected in theme but jumping around in subject and time, and leaving it to the reader to connect them. Such an appeal to the imagination is rare and gratifying, and the results are complex and evocative. If I try to forget the movie, the same could be true of the earlier ENGLISH PATIENT, although here Ondaatje is dealing with a subject of greater historical resonance -- the Second World War in Egypt and Italy -- and the interplay of personal narrative and hard fact is more difficult to bring off than the largely private scale of DIVISADERO.Both books are about people recovering from trauma. In DIVISADERO, the scarring was psychological; here, it is physical as well. The setting is a ruined Italian villa north of Florence, just after the German retreat. It had been used as a temporary hospital, but now only one patient remains, the supposed Englishman of the title. He is attended by Hana, a young Canadian nurse, who has seen so many men die that she can no longer weep the recent death of her own father. She is joined by David Caravaggio, an old friend of the family, a professional thief recruited to work in intelligence, who has had his thumbs cut off during an interrogation. And camping in the garden is Kirpal Singh (Kip), a Sikh bomb-disposal expert, who has only his rigid self-discipline and skills to protect him from disaster. The English Patient himself is an unrecognizable figure, burned all over his body, brought out of the North African desert by Bedouin tribesmen. It later becomes clear that he is not English at all, but a British-educated Hungarian count, Ladislaus de Alm&aacute;sy, an explorer of some renown.Each of the characters is gradually opened out. Caravaggio is the least fully realized emotionally, but he becomes increasingly significant in the back-story. Conversely, Hana's history needs little filling-in, since we see life in the villa mainly through her eyes and feel through her skin. Her relationship with Kip is one of the loveliest things about this rich book, and the Sikh's character is developed in considerable depth, especially as he finds a purpose to his life during his training in England. His work as a bomb-disposal expert is described in always fascinating and sometimes breath-stopping detail.But the most space is devoted to Alm&aacute;sy's time in the desert, his years of patient exploration of the Great Sand Sea and the Gilf Kebir in the 1930s, his passionate but intermittent affair with the wife of a colleague, and his activities during the war itself. These things are dug up gradually, as shards of memory, some relatively objectively, some under the influence of morphia, some that might even be hallucinations. The events of the thirties emerge most clearly, but more recent happenings must sometimes be pieced together from the briefest of references. I am not sure that a fully coherent scenario would ever emerge from reading the book alone, or that it was intended to.Here, of course, I have to mention the 1997movie. Anthony Minghella, the director, has in fact written such a scenario, connecting the fragments into one persuasive interpretation of the novel. Largely focusing on Alm&aacute;sy's story, he has tidied the narrative and greatly compressed the time-frame to create a combination of war story and grand romance with the epic sweep of Tolstoy or Pasternak. The movie is filled with such unforgettable imagery and such strongly-acted characters that his version cannot easily be put aside. But the fact that Ondaatje approved this adaptation does not make it the only possible one, and it is now much harder to enjoy the open-ended quality of his story-telling in its own terms.For those who have seen the movie, the greatest pleasure in the book may come from the elements that Minghella played down: the stories of Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio, and Ondaatje's quiet portrayal of life in the ruined villa. Consider his description of a bonfire of weeds that Hana would gather and burn \\"...during the late afternoon's pivot into dusk. The damp fires steam and burn, and the plant-odoured smoke sidles into the bushes, up into the trees, then withers on the terrace in front of the house. It reaches the window of the English patient, who can hear the drift of voices, now and then a laugh from the smoky garden. He translates the smell, evolving it backward to what had been burned. Rosemary, he thinks, milkweed, wormwood...\\". It is simple writing, but a passage that excites the imagination, involving all the senses, creating its own images in the mind. The whole book will do the same, if you are lucky enough to be able to come to it without preconception."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I found the book to be slow moving. I never felt a connection with any of the characters and, thus, didn't find the story worth finishing.If I didn't read a lot I'd have gotten a complex from my feelings towards this book. While everyone else is ranting about it, I found it a good cure for a couple nights of insomnia!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"the writing makes love to your mind."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"&quot;The English patient&quot; won a prize and a number of favorable reviews;it inspired a film, equally well received (it won an Oscar, if that means anything ). I think both the novel and the film grossly overrated. The story is almost incredible; the characters are phony ( an Hungarian count in the desert?, a man really named Caravaggio?, an Indian that seems to be in the story just because the author is also one); two love stories not too engaging nor as romantic as the author seems to think they are. All this is dressed up with a WWII that loose any significance whatsoever, and seems to be there for the sake of melodrama; a desert that have little to do with the story, except to put an exotic touch ( and although very well filmed is put to shame by the desert filmed by David Lean in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;).The book suggest permanently some kind of symbolism, but it escaped me, nor I felt interested enough to look for it. Worst of all, the story is told in a relentless &quot;poetic&quot; style, that sounds forced and sometimes kitsch.The &quot;tragedy&quot; is quite banal and operatic; and don't we all know that the nurse is not going to loose the Indian sapper as she lost all her loved ones in that damn war? Are there no more realistic, psycological credible and really humane and truthful novels somewhere to win prizes"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"There is no doubt that Michael Ondaatje is a good writer, but I couldn't help but see that this book was just too boring in too many places to give it more than a 3 1/2 star rating. The story is also very choppy, switching between characters and time periods so often I got confused more than once. The only points where I was deeply glued was during the romance between Katherine and the English Patient, which is barely a quarter of the book.All in all I prefer the movie over the book. I mean come on it won Best Picture, and the story depicted in the film is more flowing and goes deeper into the romance, being one of the most romantic out there."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one of the most beautifully-written novels that I've ever read. The characters are interesting and you feel for all of them, whether you intially like them or not. It's probably better than the film and the descriptions and prose certainly top the movie's visuals, as good as they are. The only problem with the novel is the conclusion. The finale feels rushed, incomplete and just strange. It doesn't really fit with the rest of the novel and is quite jarring."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient is worth your time because it's beautiful. Ondaatje's writes like a Renaissance painter - eclectic voices like Herodotus, Kipling, even the Book of David in the Old Testament are artfully woven with entirely fictional narrators into this story of what comes after war within and without a human being. Four main characters cross paths after the end of World War II in an Italian Villa, their bodies and souls twisted and maimed from their experiences with violence, their stories brought to life by Ondaatje's quasi-mystical language. \\"They were,\\" as one of the characters states, \\"what had been left behind.\\" This eddy also collects David Caravaggio, the thumb less ex-thief, Kirphal Singh, a coldly analytical sapper, and the English Patient. The body of this last perhaps represents the souls of the others - charred and fragile, \\"like a burned animal\\", from conflagrations of a world beyond control. His constant companion, Herodotus' Histories, is a reliquary for scraps of memories, stories, poems, and Biblical scripture, pasted onto the book's pages so that the Histories in the end belongs more to English Patient than to Herodotus. The writing throughout The English Patient is intriguing and sometimes overpowering, like a strong perfume: traces of its tone curl into the corners of your mind and linger long after you've finished reading."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I love Ondaatje's work, but there is none better than 'In the skin of a lion', there is no book more deserving of any award, including this one.I have began and put down this book so frequently it is already dog-eared from my constant indecision. I think I feared that perhaps I would be disapppointed.I adore both'In the Skin of a Lion' and 'Anil's Ghost' (to an extent) and I thought the film was amazingly beautiful. I must admit, I was slightly disappointed, but certainly, I could never regret finally reading the piece. There is a beauty captured many books, and no author captures the beauty of words and creates a more stunning and remembered image than Ondaatje.I hate history books. Certainly, I see the importance of recording history, but I am far from a budding historian. This book has a substantial portion devoted to the events surrounding the second world war. I also hate sand and probably would despise deserts should I one day find the need to venture into one. This book has a substantial portion devoted to the desert. So we began on bad terms.But there is more to this novel than sand and history; there is striking romanticism on several levels, wonderfully crafted descriptions and stunningly vivid characters. There is immense heartbreak and a fine weave of several sub stories. It is deep rich and vivid and worth reading. Particularly if you like sand, history and explosives. (Thankfully he hit a note with me there.)'In the Skin of a lion' seems that tiny bit better, but I would have no hestitations in reccommending either, or any, of Ondaatje's work."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I loved this book! &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a story of love and betrayal in World War II. One can live and breathe this novel, and come away from it longing to go back and read it again, because it will have swept you away."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A delightful, sensitive and realistic insight of a man's mind and relationships during his stunningly narrated geographical explorations in Africa, as well as the sentimental and ethic dilemas he confronts towards a woman dalled Katherine while the German Army finds a way into Kairo during WWII. All remembered through his invalid situation and been taken care by Hanah McGann, a canadian nurse, being the bond between the two beautifully narrated. An instant Classic!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Firstly, I should say that I found this novel to be excellent; very readable, very atmospheric and the general basis or idea behind it I thought was fantastic.Some of the most interesting aspects of this book are detailed most clearly from how it was adaptated to film. For example, I felt that the author was being rather too ambitious by attempting to explore every character so intimately. Although I recognise the effect he was trying to acheive by bringing these very different 'shell-shocked' characters together, the result is that the reader's attention is never completely focussed on any section of the novel. The film makers, perhaps coming to the same conclusion, decided to concentrate on the love story between the patient and Katherine.However, perhaps as a result of this change in direction, the film revealed a few gaps in the plot that were not obvious from reading the novel.It is almost certainly to late, but I would recommend to anyone that they should read that novel before they watch the film."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I thought that the book was too long. The author could have definately made his point in much fewer words. Much of the subject matter I found gratuitous and irrelevent."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"English patient has some interesting characters and the plot does have some intrigue, but please, an astounding book? Not. Too many little-finger-in-the-air chardonnays for the book review set. The author's prose is like reading a college literature student's overdone ramblings, he tries way to hard to be artful with words, which is really an inconsideration to the reader. The author's ability to be creative should be secondary to his ability to communicate. A lot of the metaphors don't work, simply leaving you puzzled. This book is like going to dinner with people who can speak the same language as you, but decide they will talk in another, company be damned."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Before I start I have to say that I loved the English Patient film. Minghella (director) manages to capture the beautiful romance between the characters and the stark beauty of the desert like no other director has been able to.This book however, doesn't. Don't get me wrong. Ondaatje isn't a terrible writer. He's just not great. He tries very hard to be different (speechmarks are obviously passe?) and it shows. The English Patient novel doesn't really have any of the elements that make the movie so likeable. For starters, the book isn't coherent. It jumps everywhere. Some of the jumps are clear. Others are not. One gets the feeling that they're in there just for kicks, not for any real story-driving purpose.Secondly...a LOT of Ondaatje's metaphors just.don't.work.For example you have the ones that almost work:\\"I don't think (Clifton) he loved the desert, but he had an affection for it that grew out of awe at our stark order, into which he wanted to fit himself - like a joyous undergraduate who respects silent behaviour in a library.\\"The ones that seem very high school:\\"He (caravaggio) rides the boat of morphine. It races in him, imploding time and geography the way maps compress the world onto a two-dimensional sheet.\\"And the bewildering:\\"He (Kip) knew he was now a king...it was strange to him. As if he had been handed a large suit of clothes rhat he could roll around in and whose sleeves would drag behind him.\\"This is not so say that Ondaatje doesn't paint some beautiful imagery as well. He does. But those instances tend to be few and far between. He also has the infuriating tendency to marr prefectly stunning imagery. For example, at the beginning of the book, he gives you this fantastic image of a young boy dancing next to a fire. Next thing you know, semen is being picked up from the sand. ?!? He does this over and over again.I have never said this about any book/movie, but honestly, watch the movie as it is an infinitely better interpretation of the the book, than the book itself. The characters in the movie are likeable, and the story is complex and beautiful. The same, strangely, cannot be said of the book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book has too many central characters each with her / his own separate story resulting in a disconnected patchwork of human tragedies. Taken together these tragedies sample the confusion following WW2 but fail to capture together anything revealing about humanity during such tormented times. The prose can be original and quirky but the author doesn't handle the language well enough yet to bring creative originality to the English language."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"On page six Ondaatje writes how the Bedouin who have found &quot;the English Patient,&quot; &quot;had come each night and chewed and softened the dates and passed then down into his mouth.&quot; It is an intensely evocative and memorable image. Yet back on the first page, we have Hana in the Italian villa where the Patient has ended up ruminating over her care of him and in particular &quot;the penis sleeping like a sea horse.&quot; Another memorable image, but as Nicholas Spice pointed out in the London Review of Books, sea horses are, like all small fish, extremely alert and cautious, so it could not really be said that the organs of a horribly burned and helpless man sleep like them.If there is one note that Ondaatje consistently strikes through the novel it is the false one. I may be the only person I know who thought The English Patient was a better movie than Fargo, but the book is deeply flawed. Consider the following. The crucial love triangle at the core of the novel consists of three archaeologists, a Hungarian aristocrat and an English couple. They spend much of the thirties wandering around Libya which appears largely as exotic desert where great monuments are buried under the desert wastes. No mention is made of the fact that people actually live in Libya, and that in the twenties and thirties where the novel takes place, Libya was a victim of horrendous Italian aggression as Mussolini slaughtered tens of thousands of people fighting for their independence.Likewise consider the moral dilemma that arises when the Hungarian Count de Almasy gets entangled with the Nazis. A better writer would note Hungary's authoritarian and anti-semitic political culture, and the fact that Hungary was Germany's ally in the Second World war. Likewise would a crack thief like Caravaggio really wander around naked in carrying out a job? One suspects that Ondaatje just thought that the image was evocative. Finally Kip, the Sikh bomb expert who has an affair with Hana at the end of the novel angrily leaves the British Army in outrage over Hiroshima, saying that the Allies would never have treated a white city like that. The problem is not the outrage. The problem is that during Kip's tenure in the army, the British had imprisoned Gandhi and Nehru, suppressed the 1942 Quit India movement, caused a disastrous famine in the Bengal costing millions of lives, had committed a large number of imperialist and selfish acts which can be seen in the works of Christopher Thorne, and, incidentally, had bombed Dresden to ashes. That Kip should be upset NOW begs the question. The problem is that Kip does not think like an Indian soldier, but like his author and his audience who no doubt heard of Hiroshima first and learned of the rest much later if at all. Indeed were it not for the fact that Ondaatje is a Sri-Lankan-Canadian writer, one might say that the English Patient was a classic work of orientalism."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I amazed by the amateur &quot;critics&quot; who have written reviews of this book. Did they fail to see the lyric language and full, beautiful characters?

But it doesn't really grab you; it meanders here and there, exploring different characters, different back stories, different tangents, but without following any one of them to a satisfying conclusion. The one meaty, suspenseful issue - the matter of the English patient's identity - is built up to for some time, but then brushed off with hardly a passing thought. It would have been nice to have been hooked, to have had something hit home, rather than have it always swooning about you, looking pretty but not really meaning anything. Still, it did earn the dude a chunk of money and fame; he won't be wanting for work again!Now tell me - does he have sex with her after she's dead? I rather think he might..."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's a good movie in satisfying those who PEEP! As the name, the English Patient, silently implies, the man with the face in complete distortion is &quot;sick&quot; not only due to the serious air-crash burn but also to the post-colonialism, aremed intrusion into others' territory as well as into others' marriage. That is, the nameless patient is quite sick both physically and mentally. He is typical of a peeper, coveting after other country's land, superficially probing the cultural heritages, the wall paintings, and stealthily following Katharine Clifton to the market at the unforgiven beginning. However, he is not the only one peeper, but there are three others in the book. Hana, a spiritual peeper to some extent, who nurses the patient from bodily pains on the surface by her occupation, and also actually plays both a mother's and a psychologist's roles. She feeds him, and reads him stories, through which they get acquainted with each other step by step and in this way they cure each others' latent vanity in life. Then, Caravaggio, the mained thief, a government spy, not to mention, is absolutely a peeper in identity and between the English patient and Hana. And because of Caravaggio's incessant quests for truth, the patient reveals everything, which liberates himself and Caravaggio. Namely, they both are each other's doctors. At last, the wary sapper, Kip, another peeper, eventually sweeps away Hana's empty spirits by leading her to the ceiling paintings, and becomes Hana's doctor. To sum up, they seemingly abnormally spy out others' secrets, but in the long run they become each other's doctors, curing each other. Namely, the four characters are seemingly hostile in their different nationalities during the war, but alternatively interdependent, which implies the nature of post-colonialism.

This piece of literature is difficult to follow; However, it is well worth the endeavor. Pictures are drawn by the prolific words of the author, Michael Ondaatje. The English Patient is a portrayal of life during and after World War II, through the eyes of four unique individuals. This motley quartet consists of a young, Canadian nurse; a relatively young Sikh, serving the British as a sapper (a mine-disarmer); a middle age \`thief by nature, turned spy by the war'; and a charred patient. During their time together, congregated in a deserted Italian villa, their stories unravel, revealing past circumstances, existing emotions, and unfolding ambitions. Enfolded in the plot of this fictional narrative, are several fine points of relevancy, pertaining to war. Ondaatje intertwined pertinent pieces of information, which served as substantial grounds from which the setting was contrived. In numerous cases, the author succeeded in evoking an empathetic point of view from the reader. The tactics are convincing, and the theme is not devoted to a complete genial complexion. The English Patient is one I will have to read again, in favor of my understanding."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book was a rambling mess.

It goes all over the place and you either like that kind of thing or you just don't."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This month, my on-line book club decided to read THE ENGLISH PATIENT by Michael Ondaatje. I was really looking forward to reading it since this book has been sitting on my bookshelves for over 10 years. I admit that I had high expectations since I knew this book had won the Man Booker Prize, and many people think say it's one of their favorites. After finishing this novel, I can definitely say that I'm glad I read it; but I don't think it goes down as one of my all-time favorites.I feel like something might be wrong with me because I didn't love this book. I kept asking myself what was wrong with me -- what was I missing? I did feel a little better when I found some others on Twitter who agreed with me that the book was a little hard to get into. I think I had problems connecting to the characters; and I even wonder if the writing style kept me fromactually becoming absorbed in the story. (plus, I just felt it read very slowly.) The author also backed into the story, and it wasn't until the end of the book where everything came together -- I found myself a little confused at times.While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't until the second half that I really understood what all of the praise was about. Don't get me wrong - from the first paragraph, I knew the writing was something very special. Mr. Ondaatje's descriptions are just incredible, and I could almost \\"see\\" the villa and the characters. My problem was that I just didn't love the story or the characters. It wasn't like I wanted to quit reading -- it was more like I just wasn't dying to go back to the book after I put it down. However, I can honestly say that I am very glad I kept with it because THE ENGLISH PATIENT was a beautiful and deeply touching story.By the end of the book, I did feel a connection with the characters especially Hana and Kip. They both were so young and had seen and experienced so much pain in their lives. I was glad that they found some comfort in each other, and I think their relationship helped them both to heal. I thought the author did an amazing job of developing both of their characters and allowing the reader to actually \\"feel\\" the devastating effects that the war had on each of them. I also enjoyed that I saw a glimpse (albeit brief) of them in the future.One thing that I really appreciated about this book (besides the lyrical writing) was how everything came together in the end. At times, I wasn't too sure where the novel was going and how everything was going to work out; but I have to say that I thought it was brilliant how the story lines were all tied up. I loved how the author interwove the characters' pasts; and I definitely was surprised with a few of the associations -- parts of this story were almost a mystery.THE ENGLISH PATIENT was a difficult book for me to read because so much of the story was incredibly sad. Naturally a book about the effects of a war is going to be depressing, but I liked that the book was also about love. There were actually two love stories woven into this novel that showed that even in hard times, the love of another can help someone cope. I truly appreciated that the love stories and relationships were very honest and not at all overdone.I also really enjoyed how much this book made me think. Not only did I find myself thinking about each of the characters, but I also like that the author showed that people and events aren't always what they appear to be at first glance. Once you spend the time to really learn about a person, you can discover so much more about them and even appreciate their differences. There were quite a few powerful messages in this novel. One that I walked away with is that \\"life is not black and white, but rather many shades of grey.\\"There is a terrific reading guide which I hope we'll use to start some of our discussion. I read over the questions and they really do give the reader a lot to think about. I think it's going to not only be interesting to hear whether everyone enjoyed the book, but also to learn what they think about the characters and their actions. There are also so many deep themes to discuss such as Hana's relationship with all three men (as well as her father) and the effects the war had on each character."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje is one of my favourite writers, and this is one of his greatest works. Ondaatje, who defies conventions and blurrs the line between poetry and prose, is not bound by the same grammatical formalities as most writers. The result is a shocking, unique novel that presents an honest, though sensational, look at life.The themes are sharp and tragic. I now feel an odd understanding of Almasy. He was, to some, insensitive and brutish. But, truthfuly, he was passionate and, though unstable, he was a genius.The ending left me angry, but spellbound. The characters, given free will, reacted in ways realistic but saddening. The novel is a tragedy of epic porportions.The writing extended beyond simply telling the story. Ondaatje, a gifted man, made profound inferences regarding life and expressed them eloquently. He is, and should remain to be, one of the greatest Canadian novelists now living."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The rich writing conveys the desert setting, powerful love affair and intriguing adventures of five main characters. It keeps readers on their toes as it jumps from past to present, one character's point of view to another's but is well worth the effort required . Themes and nuances are many. The book is worthy of a dissertation topic.Reading the book and then seeing the film make a very fascinating duo. Surprisingly, each is strong in its own way."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's true that most of my recreational reads are action/adventure/mystery with a lot of movement. But I really am trying to get a bit more introspective and appreciative of different writing styles. It was recommended by a friend that I read The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje. In a word, wow. It was far from my normal fare, but I quickly got drawn into the imagery and way that Ondaatje was able to take four separate individuals with different stories and weave them into a single plot.I did have to take my time and trust a bit that it would all come together. The first scene involves Hana, a fatigued nurse holding vigil over her last patient, a severely burned pilot known as \\"the English patient\\". While the end of World War II is almost there, she remains at the converted hospital, just her and the patient, amid the rubble of bombings and shellings. There's not much background as to who they are and why she refuses to leave. In the second scene, Caravaggio, a thief who's hands were mutilated as punishment, arrives at the hospital, and tries to figure out who the patient is in real life, as well as how he feels about Hana. And finally, Kip arrives at the hospital. He's an Indian \\"sapper\\", one who goes in and disarms unexploded ordinance. He's never allowed himself to be close to anyone due to his particularly short life expectancy. But Hana is under his skin, and he has to start understanding someone else aside from only himself.Once all the characters are given their time and space as individuals arriving at the hospital, the stories start to merge. Caravaggio thinks the English patient to be someone else entirely. Caravaggio teases the story from him, learning exactly what role he might have played in the war. And via the wireless, they all hear news that completely changes their view of everything they stood for and believed in. And that causes their own shared universe to go spiraling out of control once again...I enjoyed this far more than I expected I would. I learned to slow down my pace and just let the story flow over me and unfold as it wanted. I also had to trust that it was all going to come together in a way that was not going to make me regret the time I had spent reading it. I also learned quite a bit on how a good author can paint the surroundings with words, and put you right there in the middle of the scene, complete with the appropriate emotions and atmosphere.Of course, now I need to see the movie version of it. :)"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one strange story. The English patient is being cared for by anurse in a broken down villa in the hills of Italy in 1944 or 1945. The war has passed by here and is being fought further on.. You become familiar with those two and their history, then a family friend of the nurse hears of her and comes to stay. A bomb disposal expert, a sapper, comes for the beauty of the churches he has seen and wanted to show to his friend.The story is told as if from a distance. You are not really intimate with the characters. You do get to know all about them, but you just do not feel like you are being told everything. It may be the back and forth from one character to another, from here and now (1945) to the past of one or the other person that makes for the distance you feel.An odd point is the love of one for the others. They each love each other for different reasons. They are each working through their own hecks created by the war. In the end they have all worked out their shell shock, except the sapper: he has found a new, permanent heck that no one can help him get away from. They end going their own ways, but you get the feeling that they will always carry within themselves a bit of each other."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This was the book that helped me find my \\"voice\\" as a writer. The intense, unique, exquisite, seemingly random details Ondaatje uses to convey characterization, motivation, and mood continue to amaze me each time I read his works, but THIS novel has the ring of poetry in every sentence.The movie is an entirely different animal, and it HAS to be, because Ondaatje's power lies in his descriptions; his similes and metaphors; his own private way of viewing the human experience--not in the beats of the plot or the wit of the dialogue. This book is not driven by action but by the heart-wrenching ache of slowly unfolding details that peel back the layers of each character's past until they are completely bare.The meat of this work is found in what is NOT being said, but always implied; a casual reader will miss the depths of Ondaatje's meaning. (And perhaps I myself have misunderstood his intentions--who knows?) But here are a few samples of passages I'm sure are profound enough to make a wary buyer an avid reader:\\"Water is exile, carried back in cans and flasks, the ghost between your hands and your mouth.\\"\\"His hands held together like a human bowl.\\"\\"She paused after each set of notes as if bringing her hands out of water to see what she had caught, then continued, placing down the main bones of the tune.\\"\\" 'Read him slowly, dear girl, you must read Kipling slowly. Watch carefully where the commas fall so you can discover the natural pauses. He is a writer who used pen and ink. He looked up from the page a lot, I believe, stared through his window and listened to birds, as most writers who are alone do. Some do not know the names of birds, though he did. Your eye is too quick and North American. Think about the speed of his pen. What an appalling, barnacled old first paragraph it is otherwise.' \\"\\" 'I wanted to touch that bone at your neck, collarbone, it's like a small hard wing under your skin. I wanted to place my fingers against it. I've always liked flesh the colour of rivers and rocks or like the brown eye of a Susan, do you know what that flower is? Have you seen them? I am so tired, Kip, I want to sleep. I want to sleep under this tree, put my eye against your collarbone. I just want to close my eyes without thinking of others, want to find the crook of a tree and climb into it and sleep.' \\"\\"She sits on the bed hugging nakedness. He slides his open palm along the sweat of her shoulder. This is my shoulder, he thinks, not her husband's, this is my shoulder. As lovers they have offered parts of their bodies to each other, like this.\\"\\"Everywhere she touches braille doorways. As if organs, the heart, the rows of rib, can be seen under the skin, saliva across her hand now a colour. He has mapped her sadness more than any other.\\"Sometimes, I feel like the only one who can describe the mastery of Ondaatje's style is Ondaatje himself, but he seems far too humble for that. I've learned so much from him, from this story; I wish I could afford to give a copy to everyone I meet, just to show them that even the most horrific and agonizing of situations, real or imagined, can be expressed beautifully, and therefore, transformed."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"How fortunate I was years ago when the film, The English Patient, was two weeks from release and a friend said, 'Oh, the movie is based on the novel. I think you'd like it....' I bought the book the next night and stayed up late reading it. Ondaatje sees the world through a poet's eyes, and he gives us artistic renderings of people and places in a rich time in history. This novel would definitely be included in my list of Top 20 favorites. Ondaatje is a writer's writer...."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Few books are felt as much as read, but \\"The English Patient\\" falls into this category. Like the film, it is hauntingly beautiful, but for different reasons. The story of people haunted by love and war, their damaged souls converging at a villa in Italy, remains, but the focus and method in which the story is told on paper is spellbinding and stunning.The passages are like water moving to and fro over rocks, shifting back and forth in time so that the beauty beneath can still be seen, but as a shimmering mirage in the desert. It is a strange instance where it is almost recommended that you see the film first in order to see more clearly in your mind the characters as their stories unfold.Whereas the film focused more on the burned Almasy and his memories of the unending African desert, where he would meet the enigmatic and beautiful Katherine Clifton, sealing the fate which would leave him a charred and hollow shell of his former self, Hanah is the centerpoint of Ondaatje's lovely poetic prose in the novel. You can almost feel the ghosts hovering over each character as Ondaatje paints a masterpiece with words.Deeply romantic and lyrical, it is the same story, but a more impressionistic and less linear portrait of love and loss. The book is like a delicate flower just beneath the waters, its beauty evident but achingly kept just out of reach. The film brought the flower into the sun so we could enjoy its texture and fragrance in a more real fashion. Both are magnificent, just a different picture of the same flower.If you love the film, you must read the book. It is a hauntingly beautiful novel different from anything else you'll ever read. A masterwork of rich and evocative prose that will touch the heart, an organ of fire."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"If you did like the movie based on this book, you'll most probably like it. As usual, the book is better than the movie, in this case not just because it goes into detail but because of Ondaatje's style of writing. Most of the people I've given this book to read said they sometimes had to give it away for a minute just to take a new breath. It really makes yoy stop and enjoy the stong effect it has on you and wonder how someone can put the words in an order with such an effect. A beautiful story beautifully written which is a rare combination.To make this short, if you did like Alessandro Baricco's SILK (which is my most favourite book), you'll probably like this one too and vice versa. This book is a must for all people who don't mind reading lovestories but find most of them trivial and banal. This is a book about love - strong and rare, forbidden and scathing, a life-and-death love many of us wish to find. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is not for everyone, only for people who want to drown themselves in an opus of words. It is a love story, but it's about the love of desert solitude, of great art and sculpture and literature, of history, of defusing bombs, of stealing artfully, of caring for the dying, of old monasteries, of peoples and tribes and cultures, of passions, and, most of all, of friendship -- and about how love is destroyed by war, nationalism, conventions, and the madness of jealousy"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a work of great prose by the brilliant Michael Ondaatje. The book is hypnotizing in style. The characters are haunted with their dreadful pasts. They are slowly uncovering the wounds of their pasts while getting used to the quieter ambiance following the Second World War. The English Patient is an absorbing novel of war, honor, romance, and courage. The parts written in the point of view of the English patient while under the effects of morphine are strenuous, but lyrical, dense, and fascinating."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This very original novel has more style than any other novel I have read from the last twenty years. Ondaatje's style jumps points-of-view and timelines but does it in an understandable and clear way. It often follows a train-of-thought style but is a much easier read than any books I have read with this style. The mood is a somber war-time mood that really creates the story and adds an intense feel to the novel. This is a brilliant book. Everything from setting to character relationships to style melds to create the perfect historical romance. Ondaatje has done a wonderful job here.This novel brings together four varied characters at the end of World War II. Hana, a Canadian; Caravaggio, an Italian; Kip, an Indian; and the nameless English patient. Hana is a nurse staying in an Italian villa that had been used as a temporary hospital; she is looking out for the Englishman who was burned when his plane crashed and caught on fire; Caravaggio is a friend of Hana's father and is at the villa because he has learned she is there; Kip is a sapper who is staying at the villa while extinguishing bombs in the area.This book taught me much about the time period, but more importantly, it taught me about relationships. The relationships between Kip, Caravaggio, Hana, and the Englishman were each very different but all very real. Ondaatje creates a realistic world with here that you can just fall into. My interest was maintained all the way through the novel, regardless of the sometimes choppy style.This is a great book for any lovers of history, romance, or simply any good book! I highly recommend The English Patient."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I must say first of all, this is a work which requires the reader's utmost concentration and participation. Definitely read this alone, even if it means being without your lover for awhile. I guarantee that you will want the company after reading only a few pages. This work is so stunning, I truly feel that Ondaatje has transformed the pages into a canvas with his words serving to color each page with vivid detail of the characters. From descriptions of clothing to temperatures, burning desire, heartbreak and joy, I recommend this work to anyone who has ever truly known the definition of love and experienced all the emotions possible from loving another. I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie. If you do see the film, see it with someone close to your soul."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book and was completely captivated by both. When you read the book (if you love beautiful words) you will see the images shown in the same breath-taking style as was shown on film. If you like common, ordinary, 6th grade use of vocabulary and romance novel-style love stories, this book is not for you. If The Bridges of Madison County is your idea of lost love, I would suggest that you stick with that style of writing and leave the poetic and beautiful writing of Michael Ondaajte to those who LOVE great writing."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Though he is verbally reticent,we soon become conversant with Kip,the intrepid young sapper who spends every waking hour increasing the safety of those around him.Does his rapport with the drained nurse go deeper than skin?His chosen &quot;mission&quot; is vastly undermined(no pun intended)by a catastrophic event he can neither comprehend nor forgive.Perhaps the badly burned English patient will suffer less in the end than the robust young idealist"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Before beginning the text of _The English Patient_, I read the acknowledgements Michael Ondaatje had compiled: three pages printed in a miniscule font where he'd cited titles and authors of very specialized books on winds, bombs, desert studies by the Royal Geographical Society. I realized this book would teach as well as entertain. Ondaatje spent years researching this book before he linked all of the narrative images and ideas together; _The English Patient_ is a patchwork quilt of a story. If you don't like books that shift back and forth between plot lines and various characters' points of view, you might not be thrilled by _The English Patient_, but the writing is so fine and lyrical, the characters, setting and plot so painstakingly and lovingly textured, that if you don't read this book, you're missing out on a meaningful sensory and literary experience. &lt;PR&gt;There is often a tendency to discount a novel's literary merit when it has been made into a film, and I've found that friends sometimes scoff at my suggestion to read this novel, but _The English Patient_ as a novel stands stoically on its own. The book also explores various characters much more deeply than does the film. The novel is Hana's story and because of this, there is also more of Kip's story. Ondaatje swathes the Count Almasy-Katharine Clifton affair in mystery; it is more mythical than Kip and Hana's romance, and thus more likely to attract a filmmaker's interest; there's more room for embellishment, for conjecture. &lt;PR&gt;The landscapes of Italy and North Africa and the machinations of warring countries are given their fair share of the story as well. Ondaatje manages to make the long chapter on Kip's British bomb-defusing training as lyrical as the love affairs. _The English Patient_ is a book to be admired and envied, to be turned to again and again; each reading will seem like a discovery."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is one of the best books I have read. The one aspect that I like most about this book is it's rather poetic prose. Even though the story moved rather slowly, the style of the prose kept me going. None of his lead charchter seem to have it altogether except Kip. Yet, we realize that the war has taken its toll on him as well. Kip was one of the best characters I read in a long time. The author proved to have a deep insight into the Eastern world. It is a pity that his chararcter was not portrayed well in the movie version. The movie makers had nearly three hours to make a film of this novel, yet missed some vital parts of the story. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has the patience and perseverance to stick with a slow moving novel. The rewards are great. I was left thinking about the novel for days after I finished the book. Read it on a lazy saturday when the kids are out playing and the spouse is out paying his weekly visit to the hardware store"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"&quot;The English Patient&quot; is a momentous turning point in English letters. Don't look at these statements in dismay, dear reader. &quot;It is only a book,&quot; you're saying? Only a book... Only words...\\"Words, Carravagio. They have a power.\\" This quote sums up the main theme of the book. It is a homage to words. A tribute to the unarmed devastation words, books, literature can wreak in a person's life. They shatter worlds only to rebuild them in their own image.Translation. Ondaatje uses this word a lot. What are books, but translations of life? And all those references to books; all those references to words... Ondaatje, himself, is a participant in this story. He is the ubiquitous magus, reinventing words, adorning them in the stardust of boundless imagination. By putting words through the dance steps of his own invention, he makes them stand out in a new light. Brilliant choreography, custom-made for his favourite ballerina -- language. The book screams of his love. The book reverberates with his powerful, yet tender presence.There are other themes. War. The war waged by the outside world against our souls. Healing. The process of healing the wounds of our souls to discover our true identity under the thick scabs of scars. Foreign lands. Where familiarity stops being a buffer between us and our demons, but where, through facing those demons, we are free to shed the accoutrements of roots and expectations and to reinvent ourselves in our own image.Yet through all this, there is an underlying melody of Time and Words. Sometimes enemies. Sometimes allies. Words in time. Words through time. Timeless words. Time is a river, carrying the barges of books with their immortal passengers -- words.Perhaps not everyone will recognize the importance of this novel immediately. Perhaps our society must breathe through the realization of its impact. Amid artists who throw paint on the canvas of their works with reservation, Michael Ondaatje has the audacity and the bold strokes of an accomplished and confident Master. In the literary world full of brilliant followers, Ondaatje stands out as a profound innovator. It is inevitable, that in time &quot;The English Patient&quot; will become universally accepted as the little novel that shook the world."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje puts American writers to shame. This book is not the kind of book that you read in one fell swoop. It's the type of book you savor, to read over and over and over. Some passages are so incredibly beautiful that I've memorized them like a favorite poem.The English Patient is about loss and the lives of characters destroyed by arbitrary boundaries--geographical, physical, and spiritual. It's about man's primitive instincts, and the need to make meaning of what we cannot understand.Read this book for the pleasure of its prose. Read it for a story that reveals how we are all ultimately trapped in the vortex of our own mortality"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English &quot;Patient&quot; is a literary masterpiece.The non linear format is one the most captivating features of the book. Of course, the work deserves its own share of credit, the complexity of the interwoven stories, and the artistry which Ondaatje used to tie the plots together make this book an unforgetable read. The story grows on the reader and in the end one cannot help but cheer for each of the characters. This is a book for the serious reader, not a quick read. If your literary tastes lay along &quot;bodice ripping novellas&quot;, you are wasting your time. &quot;The English Patient&quot; is to be savored, to be read more than once, to be put with your other treasured books. This is a serious candidate for the title of Classic. &quot;The English Patient&quot; deserves to share the shelf with Austens, Brontes, and Alcotts."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje is a fine writer. I have read many negative reviews here about the work being &quot;artsy farsty&quot;; literature is an art. The English Patient has such beautiful imagery, I can't understand how you could be bored- unless you are not a literature reader. I think this attitude is perhaps derived from the movies success. Ondaatje's brillance really comes through in the details, his original descriptions. He has the ability to make prose sound like poetry. In many passages you can here the poetic quality clearly, this is the writing only a great writer could do. maybe it is not his best story, but it is far from bad. for those who said it was boring, what literature do you like"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"As a high school student reading this book for an assignment, I was not expecting to be entertained by any means. However, I enjoyed this fantastic novel. The complex web of mystery surrounding the charcters was gripping. Reading the sensuous discriptive passages was more like reading a wonderful poem instead of reading a novel. This splendid novel is definitely worth the read"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's rare that I read an original novel AFTER seeing the movie first, but, once I saw the film version of &quot;The English Patient,&quot; I wanted to read the novel itself because if the movie was as good as it was, the novel had to be just as good (if not better). I was definitely not disappointed. This is one of the most beautifully descriptive novels I have ever read. The author's choice of words is exquisite, and he conveys the images in his novel perfectly. Had I NOT seen the movie before reading the novel, I could have gotten just as good a visual from just reading Ondaatje's words on the page. This is the only novel by Ondaatje that I've read, but I'm anxious to read some of his other works."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I saw the movie first and fell in love with the story. All too often film adaptations are a betrayal of an author's splendid story-telling. Anthony Minghella is a rare talent in the film industry who does not allow his ego to get in the way of Michael Ondaatje's good story. Anyone who saw the movie will love the book for its added insight and detail. Anyone who read the book will love the movie for its splendid visual adaptation. The reader and the viewer enjoy the best of both worlds.My only criticism of the book is that the poet occasionally got in the way of the novelist. Several times, I found myself having to reread dialogue to figure out who was saying what to whom."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I cannot add more than what others have already said about this book. Each page, each paragraph, each sentence and each word sings with descritions of time and place that carry you off to not only the distant world of 1944 Africa and Italy, but to whatever world your subconscious longs to go.Those who assert the characters are not fully developed or that the plot is thin, I would not argue the point. I can only say this is not a John Grisham novel nor should it be read by those who desire such. Read it for the love of the beauty of language, when done for that reason the book will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The story of love betweeen Almassy and Katherine is a story to live on through the ages of mankind. The sadness and beauty of it totally captivates the reader and brings them into the world of Count Almassy and Katherine Clifton. An endless story of love, loss, and acceptance."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's style is very wordy, and the plot gets somewhat lost in the description. The plot is somewhat entertaining and did keep us somewhat intrigued. The only good part about the wordiness was that it conveyed many definite beautiful images of far off lands. Sometimes, the plot wasn't expressed clearly enough, and we didn't realize that certain things had taken place until we saw the movie."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient swept me away from crowded commutes and transported me into a mystical world of memories, raw and confused emotions, and heartwrenching stories. Ondaatje's unique writing style seems to set before us a mystical puzzle (of what? read on!), each piece intense and beautiful, and each fit mysterious and provocative. I have read the book three times and no experience was the same, as there is a different path to follow with each read. Ondaatje's puzzle elicits some of life's deepest questions, and like the desert to your body, makes your mind and spirit thirsty."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It is interesting to note that so many of those reviewers who gave this book a thumbs-down seem to be themselves lacking in expressive facility. Perhaps the book bored you because you couldn't get your mind around Ondaatje's admirably creative use of language. BY THE WAY, MICHAEL ONDAATJE IS FROM SRI LANKA, NOT INDIA!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read 132 pages into the novel confused as hell. I then rented the movie and cleared up a lot of confusion as to where Ondaatje was trying to lead the reader. His beautifully eccentric poetic style of writing was deeply effected by the intertwining mess of a plot. After finishing the movie the novel became much more understanding and beautiful."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read The English Patient years before it was made into a movie, and i was stunned and recommended it to everyone; it is one of the most rewarding and beautiful books you'll ever read; to many it seems challenging at first to focus and understand what's going on--but it's absolutely worth it and it's VERY different from the movie (which did the best thing possible by not trying to imitate the style of the book)! This might be expected from an author who is a poet, who alludes rather than literaly describing. Ondatjee writes his characters in an often elliptical and detached way, but at the same time his writing is viscerally lyrical and piercingly evocative of a place and time of war and post-war devastation. Kip is perhaps the warmest and in some ways most fully fleshed (and my favorite) character, and through his voice Ondaatjee probes the issues of race, class, political and national allegiance in a very moving way without giving us any easy answers, or any answers really at all. (Kip and all his important scenes and issues were completely left out of both the movie and many were missing from the abridged cassette version)For those who liked The English Patient, try John Berger's to The Wedding."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Like many others, I came to the 'English Patient' having already seen the Minghella film. However, I was encouraged first to read the 'prequel','In the Skin of the Lion'. This book is probably more difficult to get to grips with than the 'English Patient' and does not contain the same beauty. However, it will give the reader valuable context about Hanna, her mother Clara, and Caravaggio. In particular, it resolves the puzzle as to how Caravaggio knew Hanna.The film is a masterpiece of cinematography but some of the images are more startling still in the book. The first meeting between Kip and Hanna, for example, is far surpassed by the book and I am surprised Minghella didn't use it (maybe there wasn't a thunderstorm during filming!). In terms of how I rate the book, it is the only one to date that I immediately started to read again once I had finished. And despite my best endeavours, I am still reading it slowly and savouring every moment."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"There are few things in life that give me greater pleasure than good books. The &quot;English Patient&quot; by Michael Ondaatje, is not an exception. Indeed, my pristine hardcover copy is lent out to no person of questionable literary tastes. Granted there exist certain historical liberties, but I for one can offer a bit of latitude. Afterall, Ondaatje never claimed to be a historian, just a writer of compelling fiction. His style is original, and at times certain passages bend in their re-reading, toward profound. Still, this novel is not for everyone. There are many that can not comprehend a journey as intertwined, loves so fated. Love, as a genre, is so popular among today's authors. Finally one breaks from the formulaeic school, offering his readers discovered swimmers, saffron, water, sand, wind, and war"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient by Micheal Ondaatje should be savored. Its words, its phrasing is poetic and profound. Very different from the movie, quite unique in perspective, this book offers mental bonbons that can be devoured quickly or rationed for weeks. Many of the phrases that sounded awkward on screen become delicious in print. The interplay between the characters and even the plot twists carry new weight when read. It is a story of beauty appreciated and love that just misses out, of bad decisions that lead to the wonderous moments of life that we would never have avoided no matter what the cost. Ondaatje's work ranks with Milan Kundera in its sheer beauty and &quot;rightness&quot;. My first introduction to his work, The English Patient will not be my last. Now I plan to order and feast on his other offerings"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read this book without being biased by hearingabout or seeing its epynymous movie, and Ithought it was one of the three best booksI've ever read (the other two are The Grapesof Wrath and Huckleberry Finn). It may seemstrange to write a book about World War IInow after so many others have been written, butafter all, that event shaped our current society like no other. And, as I see it, thesecond world war resulted in the usurpation ofGreat Britain as the dominant world power. Evenso, everyone still recognizes the British accentas commanding, although the face may bedisfigured. That theme, coupled with the nurse'sconnection by gender to the nuns - who left themonastery providentially stocked - is deftlyplayed upon by the nurse's alternating sensualattractions to the helpless/dominant Englishpatient and to the assertive/effeminate bombdefuser. I recommend this book to anybodywith a sense of recent history, good literature,and the intricacies of attraction and love."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient is easilyone of the finest novels that I have ever read. As a PhD candidate in literature, I am fortunateto have had the opportunity to read and analyzemany fine works of literature. I can honestly saythat this book ranks among the best. He skillfully weaves the narrative with flashback, slowly, inexorably drawing us into the lives of Hannah, Carvaggio, Kip, and Hannah's dying patient. With each little bit that one is given,one only wants to learn more. As the book ends, one is left with a sort of sadness that it has come to an end, but there is also a feeling of delicious enjoyment, like we have just enjoyed a sumptuous literary feast."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is not for everyone, only for people who want to drown themselves in an opus of words. It is a love story, but it's about the love of desert solitude, of great art and sculpture and literature, of history, of defusing bombs, of stealing artfully, of caring for the dying, of old monasteries, of peoples and tribes and cultures, of passions, and, most of all, of friendship -- and about how love is destroyed by war, nationalism, conventions, and the madness of jealousy"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is different from any other book that I have ever read. My moods changed with the story. I realised the impotrance of various things from each cahrecter, things that I had taken for granted earlier. Ondaatje shifts the story line from past to present with ease, and most of the time I could follow the shifts.The story begins with Hana, the young nurse in love with the English Patient, but with the arrival of Kip she begins to fall in love with him and(I feel) becomes a little disattached form the English Patient, though she stills cares for the English Patient. Caravaggio also encourages Hana's relationship with Kip from afar; not liking her obsession with the English Patient. Caravaggio's suspicion about the English Patient leads to the patient's revealing his love from his bygone days for a woman, and this helps Caravaggio numb his suspicions and in a way heals the Patient.The fate of the war changes the fate of these four charecters in a way they never imagined.This book is definetly worth checking out, it's one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"As a writer and teacher of literature, I've read many good novels in the last 5 years. In Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT, I've found a novel that achieves &quot;greatness.&quot; Such writing is why I first fell in love with literature...the novels of Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, and Sherwood Anderson. This book has a masterful control of plot, characterization, themes, and style. And yet it reads like a dream...compelling and clarifying, ultimately revealing. I know Ondaatje as a poet of myth and mystery, of personal detail and intuition. I am struck at how much of that he brings to this novel. It is a inspiration, in part realized by the THE ENGLISH PATIENT film by Anthony Minghella under Saul Zaentz's production. The only thing the film has added are a few scenes to capture relationships; everything else you'll find in the book, including a deeper sense of theme and significance. It is, quite simply, the best book and film of our decade. -Larry Smit"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"What a smooth and effortless delight.

But the ending leaves something to be desired.I found that the part where Caravaggio shows interest in the patient's past (and on) hurried and lacking depth. The concept that Caravaggio knew anything at all about the patient didn't show up until over half the book was finished. And then the whole affair was speedily finished within a few pages. It seemed as though the author treated the count and Katherine's affair like a newspaper that you read only a few lines and throw away.But beyond this, the book comes out as an over all triumph."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Any reader of _The English Patient_ is so much more fortunate than any of the novel's four principal characters, for the reader cannot help but fall in love, not with the characters, but with Ondaatje's fluid prose, if not on the first page, then surely no later than the second page where this stunner of a sentence will instantly and irrevocably seduce even the hardest heart: &quot;He whispers again, dragging the listening heart of the young nurse beside him to wherever his mind is, into that well of memory he kept plunging into during those months before he died.&quot; In Italy in the aftermath of World War II four disparate and, in some ways, desperate people find themselves together: a psychologically wounded young Canadian nurse, a middle-aged thief turned intelligence agent whom the nurse knew back home before his wartime enemies punished him by amputating his thumbs, a Sikh soldier who is expert in the delicate art of disarming explosive devices, and the badly burned &quot;English patient.&quot; Because all of them have learned through their own disillusioning experiences to survive the war by isolating themselves, they struggle to connect with one another. Their interactions, often conducted at cross purposes, are set against the patient's unfolding recollections of his pre-war past in Egypt where he carried on historical explorations in the desert and an illicit love affair in Cairo. Only after his lover's death does this affair resolve itself, ironically in an incident--his one act of kindness towards her, as futile as it is dramatic--that seals his own fate. Ondaatje masterfully weaves together past and present through rich prose that, at the same time it evokes mental images as brilliant as fireworks, soothes the ear as gently as water burbling over worn rocks in a clear mountain stream. Through his characters, unable to love and unwilling to be loved, Ondaatje has created a powerful parable indicting war's brutalization of the human spirit even when it spares its survivors' bodies"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This author was a poet before he was a novelist, as you will see from his beautifully precise use of language. For example, one of the characters has had his thumb cut off by Nazis as a punishment for spying. &quot;They found a woman to do it. They thought it was more trenchant&quot; (pg. 55). Trenchant not only means ironic or biting, it also comes from the French word for &quot;to cut&quot;. There are five stories told in the book; the movie only tells one (they should make four more movies!). Read the book once for the plot and the mystery, and the second time for the words, the subtle discussion of history versus memory, and Ondaatje's love of descriptions and poignant portraits of people in pain, physical and otherwise. You'll never forget the last image, where Hanna, unhappy still and living alone in Canada, drops her coffee cup and as it falls the author shifts you to India where Kirpal, to the delight of his laughing daughter, slides across the floor to catch a dropped fork"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Yesterday I finished &quot;The English Patient&quot; crying. Each page contains a gift like finding a $20 in your jacket pocket or a winning lottery ticket in a parking lot. Each page is an invitation to take a trip, write a letter, make a wish. I dreamed every night of sand, making love near an ocean, trapped in the airplane under the sand, cold, heat. I breathe sand at night, wake up feeling gritty. I started noticing the colors of people--at work, on the street. Pale men, dark men, dark women, smooth and rough and covered in sand. I eat olives, peel plums, lay in the dark on my back in the library and weep. And then I read &quot;Coming Through Slaughter&quot; and lost my mind further to the beauty of Ondaatje's voice"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I was originally drawn to this book, The English Patient, by a trailer I saw of the recent film adaptation. I thought the epheremal quality of the scenes, not to mention the actors and actresses, were good omens. I have found many films to be weaker than the books upon which they are based. So I bought the book. I read it in one night. The book was mesmerizing. The interweaving of character, milieu, and history was captivating and moving. I just saw the film yesterday. Although I admire all parties involved in its creation, it was not the same. The ending and plot were different and thus lent a completely different spin on the motivation of the characters. In addition, the ending is different and I believe not as potent. Ondaatje is a consummate storyteller. Although, sometimes I found his writing annoying. However, he captures the post-war feeling of emptiness with understated grace. I was nonetheless happy after finishing the novel. His characters grew. Betrayal and injury left scars, no doubt. But those same deceptions and traumas provided a common ground for growing. The end is therefore that much more disturbing. I recommend The English Patient. The language is not too difficult and the characters accessible. At least read Ondaatje's novel before you see Hollywood's view of a story about people after a war as an &quot;eternal love story&quot"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Gary Kamiya : Let me ask you about the genesis of The English Patient. I was curious how it came into being. Because it does have a narrative skeleton, but over that is a fantastically imaginative, rich overlay of words and images. What came to you first - an image? Or was the entire plot present in your mind from the beginning?Michael Ondaatje : No, the plot wasn't there until I finished the book, probably. I don't really begin a novel, or any kind of book, with any sure sense of what's happening or even what's going to happen. Almasy [the badly-burned &quot;English patient&quot; whose tragic love affair with Katherine Clifton forms the heart of the book] wasn't in the story in my head. Kip [the Indian sapper, or bomb-disposal expert, whose love affair with the English patient's nurse, Hana, offers a counterpoint to Almasy's story] wasn't in the story. Caravaggio [a shadowy thief with bandaged hands] wasn't in the story. It began with this plane crash and it went on from there. Now, why did this plane crash? What did that have to do with this guy in the plane? Who was the guy? When was it happening? Where was it happening? All those things had to be uncovered or unearthed, as opposed to being sure in my head.Then there was a nurse and there was a patient, there was a man who was stealing back a photograph of himself. It was those three images. I did not know who they were, or how they were connected. So I sat down, I started to write and try to discover what the story was. And build from those three germs, really. I tend not to know what the plot is or the story is or even the theme. Those things come later, for me. -INTERVIEW : Delirious in a Different Kind of Way (Gary Kamiya, November, 1996, Salon)Long time readers of these pages will be familiar with the concept of &quot;Letting the Tiger out of the Cage&quot; (newcomers may want to read a brief definition.) Well, what are we to make of a novel whose genesis in the author's mind was the scene where the tiger gets let out? Because as I was watching the movie version, I desperately wanted the husband to succeed in crashing his plane and his wife into Ralph Fiennes. I mean, I know this is supposed to be a great tragic love triangle and all, but I'm not big on adultery to begin with, added to which is the fact that they are just horrible people and what passes for love amongst them is really little more than sado-masochism. So, yes, I wanted them dead. Nor did I particularly care that the petty sneak thief, Caravaggio, had been dethumbed by the Nazis.The characters that I did care for somewhat were Hana and Kip. I realize that Hana was supposed to be this horribly damaged woman, but c'mon, she's played by the luminescent Juliette Binoche, who, by herself, nearly suffices to justify the continued existence of France. Kip, meanwhile, is all earnestness and courage, easy to like, even if his role onscreen is pretty minimal. But then, just as it seems these two and their relationship will rescue the story, Kip has his little freak out over the atom-bombing of Japan, and we're left with only Hana. After three hours, that just wasn't enough for me.So I probably made a mistake when I tried reading this book right after seeing the movie; bringing too much baggage along from the film to give the novel a fair shake. Now, rereading it several years later, I do like it better, but I still don't like it.There's still the basic problem that the English Patient and Katherine Clifton are so profoundly unlikeable and that their affair so little resembles what healthy humans think of as love. Even more disturbing, when the English Patient leads the Nazis across Northern Africa in exchange for access to the cave where he left Katherine, he acts out the most abhorrent sentiment of the 20th Century, E. M. Forster's monstrously selfish dictum : &quot;If I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country.&quot; It would even be more honorable if the English Patient helped the Nazis out of a genuine feeling of Anti-Semitism. It would at least reflect a capacity to think of people beyond himself. But the nature of his relationship with Katherine is exactly this selfish and destructive, so perhaps aiding the German Army follows from the logic (or illogic) of their affair.Hana and Kip are more central to the story, and that helps greatly. Kip's background is particularly interesting. The scenes of him being taught about bomb disposal and of his relationship with the Brits who trained him are especially well done. Unfortunately, they only serve to make it even more jarring when he reacts so hysterically to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. His meltdown reads as if it's driven more by Ondaatje's ideology than by the dictates of the character.That ideology is troubling too. In some ways, this is one of the most racist novels I've ever read : Ondaatje is obsessed with skin and not merely it's substance but it's color. He mentions skin so many times and in so many ways that I lost count, but, of course, the central metaphor of the story is the English Patient, this vast repository of Western knowledge, with his white skin burned away. Then the old European lovers, he and Katherine, are supplanted by the new multiracial coupling of Kip and Hana. Finally, after Kip indicts the West for it's racially motivated bombing of Japan, he leaves the Villa San Girolamo, this wreckage of Western civilization, and sets out on his own, symbolically abandoning the white past and heading towards the brown future. And just in case that's too subtle, the final image of the book is Katherine knocking a fork off of a counter in Canada and Kip catching a fork in India, the tools of civilization being transferred from white hands to brown. There's a real air of racial triumphalism and moral superiority to the story that perhaps only Third World authors can get away with these days.Ultimately, I did like the book somewhat better on rereading and it's much better than the movie. There are some great images and the language is lyrical and often captivating, though after three hundred pages it does get kind of cloying. I guess this is one that I have some significant problems with, but find interesting enough to give an extremely cautious recommendation.GRADE : C"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I didn't get this book, but I tried to keep reading. I am an avid reader, but I finally had to quit wasting my time. I couldn't identify with any of the characters (thank God). I can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This novel is (forgive me for a regrettably trite analogy), like rich chocolate cake. It can either be devoured with a fiery voracity or savoured for its intricate nuances, and, in fact, should be read in both ways. The extremely complex and suggestive web of motifs present in Ondaatje's masterful work makes this novel tasty and satisfying the second and even third time through. I have heard it criticized for excessive sentimentality and romanticism, but that is exactly what is needed in response to the desolate emotional wasteland of a post-war world. Additionally, the end of the novel, I think, might disabuse many cold cynics of such notions. In any case, a striking, artistic masterpiece that would be a disgrace to overlook."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"\\"Lyrical\\" is a term that frequently came up in our book club's discussion of Ondaatje's poetic novel. Set in a Tuscan villa in 1944 as World War II dies down in Italy, this novel is significantly different than the popular movie a few years back. To begin, the often-dense prose style of Ondaatje-a poet and novelist who was born in India, educated in England and immigrated to Canada-does take some time to get used to.The novel emerges as the four protagonists play out their drama in the ruined villa. They are Hana, the Canadian nurse; her patient who is burned beyond recognition; Caravaggio, a thief who knows Hana from before the war; and Kip, a young Sikh who spent the war disabling bombs for the British. All the characters have been damaged, physically and spiritually by the demands of war, but the real brilliance of the work may be the desert setting and the drama that unfolds as the English patient recounts his story spent mapping and exploring North Africa before the war."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"its the best poetical work ive read in a long time you have to savor the dialogue and the descritions close your eyes and see the desert hte burning man dropping from the sky the night like poison being washed away by the dawn and the chapter in situ is marvelous for its understatemtn of the life and identify of the inidan kip. the book has a beauty all it sown as does the movie but the book is better i wish id read it first"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's writing is sparse and moving. I can't say whether the history is correct, I don't think that was the point. Another reviewer fussed about the character's unlikely political allegances, again, I don't think that was the point. The story is about the unpredicatble, powerful forces of love in an uncertain and turbulant time."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Writing is very lyrical, with excellent use of imagery. Ninety percent of the metaphors work. However, some of the metaphors do not make comlete sense in context and are mixed (See LRB article by Nicholas Spice).Although some reviewers dislike the books non-linear storytelling and structure, I thought it worked well. Each of the scenes feeds into the next and allows reader to get a better understanding of character, events, or themes. The book is not entirely historically accurate and is more similar to taking a trip inside a very imaginative and talented person's stories based on history. The use of imagery and the creative, if not entirely accurate, use of historical events or people as \\"snapshots\\" that evoke feelings or ideas is a theme that occurs extensively throughout Ondaatje's poetry (ex: \\"Elizabeth\\"), so it is not surprising to find it in his novel.Another weakness with the novel was that the characters and events often functioned more to explore themes, which made the character behave in ways that would not be truly realistic. The English patient, Katherine, and Hana and lost some depth becuase of this. Kip is probably the most multidimensional character in the book. The movie, especially Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas, did a far better job of bringing the other characters to life.You would probably enjoy this book if any of the following are true: you like the poetry of Wallace Stevens, you like and prefer historical fiction that is romantic or has strong story telling elements over historical fiction that is 100% true to its time (think Tale of Two Cities, Love in the Time of Cholera, Gone with the Wind, etc.), or you are not a historical event nitpicker. A novel does not always have to be historically 100% accurate (hence the term FICTION), but is often an exploration of emotions, themes, or ideas. I enjoyed the novel, even though it was not \\"perfect.\\""},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"\\"The heart is an organ of fire,\\" says Michael Ondaatje in his novel, The English Patient. Showing absolute belief in these words, Ondaatje's tale is a fiery love story about individuals, their hearts, and the pasts that plague them. In addition to this weighty theme, lyrical language and a stunning ability to relate and interpret the deepest human emotions make Ondaatje's novel a stirring read anyone can enjoy.Ondaatje primarily uses characterization and description to relate his points. For example, in one of my favorite passages the English patient says, \\"I am a person who if left alone in someone's home walks to the bookcase, pulls down a volume, and inhales it. So history enters us.\\" Is that not beautiful? History, the stories of those who have gone before, is as necessary and natural to us as oxygen. Our very survival is dependent on the consumption of the lessons of lives past. Toward the end of the novel, the English patient once again speaks with a gentle wisdom that touched my soul. \\"Words,\\" he says, \\"They have a power.\\" He is absolutely right. Words have the ability to construct images of great beauty, to relay profound messages, to communicate ideology, and simply to ease the perpetual loneliness of the human life. The words of Michael Ondaatje's masterpiece The English Patient do all of these things. It is a force of unspeakable strength and beauty.

From the deserts of Libya, through the lounges of the Geographical Society in London and Cairo to the Florentine countryside of Italy. This book takes you on a guided tour of several historical places and times.But by far the best attribute of the book is in its characters.

Hanna, the nurse who has vowed to stick by the English patient's side no matter what, Carravaggio, the brilliant thief whose hands are mutilated after an operation gone sour. There is also Kip the Sikh, the young sapper who falls in love with Hanna. They are the dwellers of the Villa San Girolamo. They are all fascinated by the English patient in their own different ways.Enter the trail of the Gulf Kebir in the Libyan desert. Here you'll find Maddox, who goes back home and just can't stand the hypocrisy in the Church supporting the War effort. He eventually takes his own life right there in the Church. The Cliftons (George and Katherine). Fresh out of English Ivy League, George flies to Egypt with his newly wed, Katherine, to join Almasy and Maddox on the trail of the Gulf Kebir. Katherine Clifton turns out to be the nemesis of the English patient. Their adulterous love is of a self-destructive kind.The dropping of the \\"A\\" bomb on Japan eventually disenchants Kip. This just totally tears him up. Hanna eventually loses him. They all return home to new lives after the war.This makes very good reading for those who don't like rushing books. The painstaking attempts by the author at describing the peculiarities of the African desert, Herodotus' accounts, Kip's bomb disarming operations, and the English patients' narratives, might turn out to be boring for some.

When I was finished with the book, I didn't really know what to think. My teacher began to go over this book in class and explain it more. I found out that I hadn't looked into it very much and I realized there was a lot more to the story than a burned man with a story to tell and a woman falling in love with a man that just got finished with war. I fell in love with the story of 'The English Patient.' I think this is a wonderful book that can change a persons way of thought and make one realize how different each person really is.

See the film; forget about the book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I thought this was going to be a great book to read but as I started it ,I was greatly disappointed because it is extremely boring. The author has added in so much unnecessary detail and boring descriptions as well as characters of no significance. However to be fair, the book starts picking up pace towards the middle with the descriptions of the desert trips that I really enjoyed. Parts of the plot are loosely connected for instance the change of Hanna's feelings from her love to the English Patient to the sapper. Also the attitude of the sapper after the Hiroshema bomb. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Firstly, all the individuals who have read this book solely on the basis of seeing the movie should shut up. Any expectations created solely by watching the film are idiotic; don't use one genre to base the worth of another genre. Anyone who criticises Ondaatje's structuring of the plot obviously hasn't read as many novels of intellectual worth as they think! Granted, this is not exactly one of my most cherished novels. The romance elements in the book, and in the movie, are at times &quot;suspect&quot; in their attempt at realism. However, the beautiful and poetic prose is a highlight. Admiring the style is justification enough to buy this novel."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It has been a long, long time since I didn't finish a book. The ramblings and looseness of plot did not hold my attention long enough to finish this book. After reading other reviews, maybe I should try it on a better day. After 200 pages, I gave up"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A very thought provoking book. It projects you into the emotional dispair of World Way 2, contrasting with the love and attachment of some of the characters.Quite interesting"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A stunning work. Ondaatje's style is unparalleled by other moderen writers. The English Patient is written with a richness of language and imagery that is equalled only in the works of such giants as Milton. The shifting time and setting may be confusing at first, but these elements really do enhance the work. It is basically an anti-war story that would probably not be considered a masterpiece simply for its themes and the treatment of themes; however, the richness of language Ondaatje uses easily makes him one of the greatest writers of modern times and makes The English Patient a masterpiece of the English language"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one of those books that deserve whatever literary award they win. It's just too much of a classical and well-researched piece of work. From the deserts of Libya, through the lounges of the Geographical Society in London and Cairo to the Florentine countryside of Italy. This book takes you on a guided tour of several historical places and times.But by far the best attribute of the book is in its characters. The yarn revolves around the English patient (AKA Almasy), an adventurer and an avatar of knowledge- who suffers from the worst possible burns- and the way he influences all those around him. Hanna, the nurse who has vowed to stick by the English patient's side no matter what, Carravaggio, the brilliant thief whose hands are mutilated after an operation gone sour. There is also Kip the Sikh, the young sapper who falls in love with Hanna. They are the dwellers of the Villa San Girolamo. They are all fascinated by the English patient in their own different ways.Enter the trail of the Gulf Kebir in the Libyan desert. Here you'll find Maddox, who goes back home and just can't stand the hypocrisy in the Church supporting the War effort. He eventually takes his own life right there in the Church. The Cliftons (George and Katherine). Fresh out of English Ivy League, George flies to Egypt with his newly wed, Katherine, to join Almasy and Maddox on the trail of the Gulf Kebir. Katherine Clifton turns out to be the nemesis of the English patient. Their adulterous love is of a self-destructive kind.The dropping of the \\"A\\" bomb on Japan eventually disenchants Kip. This just totally tears him up. Hanna eventually loses him. They all return home to new lives after the war.This makes very good reading for those who don't like rushing books. The painstaking attempts by the author at describing the peculiarities of the African desert, Herodotus' accounts, Kip's bomb disarming operations, and the English patients' narratives, might turn out to be boring for some. But they are all part of what gives this book that edge that I enjoyed so much. It is surprising that this is a work of fiction. It really comes alive as you read on. I really must go back to this book once more.A must read!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a story about love, friendships, war and how all of these intertwine to become a novel about four lives and how they are entangled in ways the reader would have never thought. The setting of the desert and the italian villa in the time of world war 1 brings A fictional love story into a historical time period and captivates the reader. We want the english patient to continue with his story so we learn more of Katharine. We want the bombs dismantled because in a way Kip's only other passion excluding the bombs is Hana and her body, soul, her being as a whole. We want to be told of the curve in Katharine's neck and The episodes in the tent. We need to be told how to read it and when to slow down. We need to hear what Kip says when hearing of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. These are life lessons that need to be learned. I loved this book for the lessons it taught me and the romantic tales of woe that captivated my imagination. I wanted to be in Hana's place or even Kip's place. I want to be playing hide and seek in the library and I want to hit my knees from the pain that just seperated my soul. This was a great book, the only part you could play with is Katharine. She has no voice and may need one. We feel a male opinion of her and not her opinion of herself or the english patient. The other thing I had to say was that caravaggio even though he was not really developed as deeply, he played an important role and that was an interesting way to portay a character. Give him no hands and just about as much personality and then give him the most important role. Finding out who the English Patient really is. Interesting."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Desipte Minghella's focus on the romance of the English patient, this book is not a mere tale of doomed love (presented as gorgeous as possible however on the big screen, thus leading most of us astray). Ondaatje intended a lurid story of identities, so many different identities of utterly uncrossable lives that come fusing into one rhapsody. This tune is so soulful and the rapport between the 4 main undertones is truly amazing. Yes, in a way, these undertones lose their distinctions as they are weaved in the burned patient's story in the deserted villa on the Italian front, during WWII Nazi's retreat.Count Almasy is the burned patient--faceless and nameless, for whom the emotionally scarred nurse Hana stays behind. He recalls details w/ such alacrity and recite senses w/ such keenness, the young Canadian nurse immediately finds herself enamored with this &quot;ghost&quot;. Hana herself lost her father in the war, what she holds as protection against the acidity of warfare remains the English patient, who remembers much yet refuses to accept any. Shortly after, joining them is a maimed thief, Caravaggio, an enigma during the war working as a spy for the allies. He is in possession of one piece of clue to the English patient's identity, and he is desperate enough for that identity b/c much of his own remaining dignity and hope have long intertwined with the burned man's past. Last of all, the supposedly strongest vibe in the blues tune creeps warily into the villa--Kip, a Sikh sapper with Ondaatje's alienation in the white man's world all over his skin.The romance between Kip and Hana seems inevitable, but their youthful affection has none of the realistic ownership overwhelmingly expressed between Almasy and his lover, Katherine Clifton, a married woman that took his face away from him. Ownership, more than anything else, keeps Almasy's desert romance alive, the blinding flame of its passion and its ignorance during rapid colonization. Almasy, a linguist and explorer, sees the world as one preserved mural; in some way, he sees love the same way--as pristine as the uncharted desert of North Africa. Love may have long been conquered as nomads roamed the desert, its devious curves remain charted and mapped and grasped. He seeks out the shortcuts and wakes his proud soul with a possessive force. What dooms his love? His sense of the world, or rather his lack of it? Love is multifaceted, and the forbidden territory is divided, much like the &quot;civilized&quot; world.Civilization has instigated much progress and much enlightenment. But to these 4 shattered souls, humanity is nothing but enlightened by the tremendous darkness of the human mind. The mind that is so eager to conquer and to suppress and to differentiate. The primal alienation comes from Kip, and as he befriends a man who may have compromised the lives of allied soldiers for a simple promise, he himself fades away into the night with the woman he knows he can never have. Caravaggio's injury of the hands symbolize humanity crippled by warfare, and as he even grows weary of morphine, as much as Truth, he comes to see Almasy's decisions judgments made not for any country, but overlooking all nationhood.Poet writer Michael Ondaatje deserves all the recognition this book has brought him. There has rarely been such tender force behind a modern writer's pen-nonchalant on the surface, but pounding at the core of truth. And truly, seldom have I been so moved and touched by plain words weaved together with naivety, yet such rhythm! This is not a novel of anguish, or of anti-war sentimentalities; it simply records lives, so many different lives existing in parallel universes of humanity, looking over for intersections that never come."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's book is sheer poetry. Though the prose tends to get heavy and super-serious, the way he fleshes out the characters is superb. His scarce use of punctuation other than periods contributes to his highly personal style of writing. However, aside from Ondaatje's writing style, the plot is the heart of the novel. Some compare it to Anna Karenina, but it is a completely different tale, not just a tale of an adulterous affair. It is a tale of love against all odds, the ultimate tale of chivalry and sacrifice. This novel testifies to the power that love can hold, and how two people can shut out the world even if it's in the midst of the worst of wars, become traitors even to the good, and see only each other. It is a tragedy, a love story, a shock, and a poem at the same time. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"What A Book!This was one of the best books I have ever read. I read it as a school project. At first it takes a little while to get into but soon it starts to pick up. I suggest reading it nice and slow so that you don't get confused.(TRUST ME!) The slower you read it the better it is, also. For me, the last two pages made the book. They made up for the confusion and frustration in the end. I have also read &quot;In the Skin of a Lion&quot; by Ondaatje and it is also an excellent book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Oondatje conjures images and feelings that take the reader into the desert alongside the characters.

But as you continue read it, it opens up to you, each fold falling away to reveal clarity to what is going on. It is an absolutely amazing book. Very elegantly written. Wonderful prose. I adored the book and I adored the movie. Both are great to watch and read."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book was profound - I have never been so touched by mere words in this way. Ondaatje has command of the English language like a pilot has of his B-2 Bomber. I would recommend this book to anyone who's a die-hard romantic.

But Michael made me love them, and he told a story about Herodotus, the man who wrote histories, the man that you might never forget. If you hold an emotion in the heart, read this book, and you would read nothing any more."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A strange book, this novel. I read it twice in the space of a few years. On my first reading I was mesmerised by Ondaatje's beautifully suggestive prose and the ravishing exoticism of its characters and locations: the Lybian Desert, pre-war Cairo, war-torn Tuscany, ... But on my second reading I fell through the author's magical web of seduction into a great void. The magnificence of Count Almasy turned out to be a vapid pose of a would-be 'universal man'; Kip, the 'war saint', crumbled and became hardly more than a dexterous clown; Caravaggio, the thief, is a poor bugger rumaging the site for dope. And the nurse, well, she just kind of dissolved into thin air. Despite the frantic gesturing, there is nothing that ties these four characters to the earth. Their relationships are static, transitory, ephemeral and remain unexplained. The novel teems with fleeting simulacra: Herodotus' Histories (why not Coupland's Microserfs?), the Giotto frescos, the Tuscan landscape, and many more minutiae of Italian folklore. And of course there is the grand, magnificent desert, that primeval, mystical landscape that suddenly turns into a cardboard background for a cheap film. Think of it, at what point in the book does the desert really become more than a mantra of exotic names? It does, only once, at the very start of the book when the camels, smelling the esoteric aromas emanating from the mysterious healer's phials, are heard shrieking in the distance: a moment of great poetic tension and physical suggestiveness! But otherwise, nowhere we get into the thick of it, as we do in Bowles' Sheltering Sky or Patrick White's Voss. For my part, Ondaatje could have set his novel in the Borneo jungle or amidst the glistening peaks of the Hindu Kush to similar effect. Finally, there is the war, this violent conflict which is most emphatically present when it is absent, as in the epic scene towards the end of the book where the city of Naples is turned into a ghost city for just a few hours. Ondaatje has written a great novel of our times. There is no depth in this book, only surface. But, God, is this surface beautiful!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Have not read the book yet, it is waiting on a tall stack of still-to-be-read books, but I must compliment the bookstore on the beautiful condition the book arrived in"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"yes, I missed the part in the discription that said Abridged. I purchased this as part of a college reading assignment. I did not have time to read the book so I purchased the CD's. In the class discussion and on the test I found out that abridged really meats that they cut out all of the meat of the story. Most of the fine details have been removed. If you are looking for recreational reading or listening I do highly recomend this selection, however as a reading assignment it is not good enough for an \\"A\\". If you are happy with a \\"C\\" great you are all set.I also had a very difficult time with the shipping from Amazon. I had the selection shipped to me UPS Red or Next Day Air. Next Day Air usually means next day before 10:00AM, but Amazon puts a little suffix on the end of the shipping code that saves them money on the shipping and changes the delivery to next day before 7:00PM. I payed more for the shipping than I did for the selection and received my package at 6:30PM the next day. I was and am still very upset about that. So, if you need it order sooner than later and don't pay extra for quick delivery. I found out that Amazon ships from all over the country and is usually one day ship to everyone, not guaranteed but usually."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I watched the film long ago and have enjoyed reading the book as its own piece.

The underlying plot of love, adultery and quests in the dessert called to my heart and I longed to read the &quot;real story&quot;.What I found was the movie represented the book - for once- at its downfall. In order to have a &quot;vilian&quot; as the main character, the reader must connent with him. I did not. I wanted to, I wanted to see one redeaming quality revealed. I searched a searched to be only dissapointed.The images are beautiful, the writing poetic and inticing. One can smell dry air and taist the sand in one's teeth. But the characters are 2-dimentional, emotionally flat and did not &quot;captive the soul&quot;.

There must be some attributes that I don't see. A very talented author friend complimented the style - very matter of fact...which it is and which the author has mastered. As for the plot - there isn't much of one. Four people come together in a ruined villa in Italy near the end of WWII. They each are haunted by their experiences of the war and they somehow find solice in each other's company. A chapter here and there I found very interesting - I thought perhaps the story was picking up. It quickly fell off into dullness again. I just don't know how to critique this book beyond my personal opinion that it was a very dull, slow-moving story with brief glimpses of interest and intrigue followed by more dull droning. I truly skimmed the last 100 pages with little interest."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, SUSPENSEFUL ROMANCE NOVEL! After reading The English Patient, by Michael Ondaatje, a booker-prize winning novel, you will finish the last chapter with a sense of triumph and passion for life. Written in 1992, this story takes place during World War II. A burned man, the English patient, finds refuge in an Italian villa where a compassionate nurse, Hanna, tends to his dying wishes. Through all of the scars and wounds readers will discover the lives of four mysterious people as they unravel and share the dangerous secrets of the past. Controlled by morphine, the English tells of his love and loss of his friends wife Katherine. We also learn that Hanna, the nurse, is discovering her own love, Kip. Clifton soon hears of his wife's, Katherine's, torrid love affair with the English patient. It baffles me to think that a more beautifully written novel of romance and betrayal could exist. There is, however, a movie that does serve it justice, The English Patient. Though I do recommend the movie, which won nine Academy awards, I do wish you'd read the book first. This book is for the romantics and those looking for a challenge. The characters being and details of their life are only brought about between the lines. This novel takes you through a series of lives, places , and event which are in no real chronological order. The outcome of events is revealed through such imagery and sometimes lack ther of, &quot;They would carry a severed arm down a hall, or swab at blood that never stopped, as if the wound were a well, and they began to believe in nothing, trusted nothing.&quot; or &quot;Blood. Tear. He feels everything is missing from his body, feels he contains smoke.&quot; The story also provides images in the desert and in the villa with life like qualities. The story also gives insight into the culture and lifestyles of the characters in that time period. An example of the difference in culture portrayed in the book was when one character had his thumbs removed as a punishment for commiting adultery. There are a few setbacks such as the confusing order of events. The story jumps from place to place and period to period. Overall, I strongly recommend this book for the romantic in all of us."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This, as my teacher told us, is a novel one must reread every five years or so.Not a quick or easy read, The English Patient one of those books written in language so distilled, so concentrated, that one phrase can be explicated for pages. Its images, many of which I do not yet understand and many of which I'm sure I missed this time through, slip in and out of your consciousness long after you've finished the novel. The effect is that of someone tugging gently on your sleeve and saying &quot;hey, pay attention -- this is important, this is what meaning is made of.&quot;The story is that of 4 characters who have come to inhabit a bombed-out, ruined and abandoned Italian villa towards the end of world war 2. With supreme skill as a storyteller, Ondaatje dips us into their pasts, so that we are made aware of their stories snapshot by snapshot; this is particularly true of the mysterious nameless faceless 'English patient', a severe burn victim with a deep, secretive history.There is such power in this novel I'd like to bottle its spirit, its poetry and its beauty, and carry it with me. This book is IMPORTANT to me. I cannot say any more than that."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The plot of the story had a great potential. It portrays four people coming from different walks of life and experiences during WW11. Each character has an intriguing and sad story that has altered his or hers life for ever. Unfortunately, the author spends so much time proving to his readers his proficiency in the English language that the book looses its charm after few chapters. The most influential writers and philosophers (of present and past) make their writing unforgettable not by using the longest and at times inappropriate words but by eloquently putting them together."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"To be absolutely honest, I read &quot;The English Patient&quot; about two years before the film came out and swept the awards. Had I not read the book, I would have liked the movie just the same (after all, it is a pretty awesome movie). Both the book and the movie enhances and deepens the meaning of the other, in a way. Michael Ondaatje's prose is vague and harrowing, yet when all becomes clear, the words are like deep gashes on clear glass. It does not seem to have much of a plot, but it's the way he adds emotion, reason, and consequence to it that makes it so gripping. The movie is this poetry on screen, but it simplifies the characters and the plot in order to get through to us (if it were exactly the same as the book, we'd probably have no idea what they were talking about), and it works. Both work brilliantly in its own way, but my personal preference would be the book--its raw emotionalism and power always strikes me."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje's \\"The English Patient,\\" deals with four individuals who lived together in an Italian villa which used to be a hospital during World War II. There was the mysterious \\"English patient,\\" who suffered tremendous burnt to a point that he was almost completely black who no one seemed to know what his name was or who he was and there was Hana, a nurse who took it upon herself to nurse and care for him.In addition, there was Caravaggio who was a thief, spy, and a friend of Hana's father who stayed at the villa because of her. Lastly, there was Kip, a Sikh who was a sapper with the British forces and who fell in love with Hana. All four had baggage/burden of their own and this book deals with how lives intersected with one another. This setting of this book was of course the World War II.This is not one of the easiest books to read as the author goes back and forth with each of the individual's stories and as Newsday wrote, it has \\"many-layered mysteries.\\" At the beginning of the book, we don't really know much of the individuals but the author gradually released bits and pieces of their information. The style of the author was very poetic and lyrical and at times this posed a difficulty for me to fully comprehend the book. The pace of the book was a bit slow for my liking. I like the idea behind the book but I didn't really appreciate his style of writing."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"At the closing of the Second World War, amongst the chaos and destruction, four people's lives intersect at a battered villa in Italy. Each individual carries a scared past. Hana is a nurse drained from war and seeking a hideaway. When the unit she is with leaves, Hana stays behind to care for a horribly burned, enigma of a man--known only as the English patient--who fell from the sky with a fiery crash into the desert. Later, a scarred thief named Caravaggio and a bomb-wary sapper cross into their lives. Each stranger unfolds and slowly is given character. Laced with the current story is that of the bed-ridden English patient; haunted by his ghosts, whose constant recanting gives light to a dazzling tale of the obsession of love for a woman and passion so strong it is worth betrayal.Many abstract memories of each character interlace into the main tale, which many readers are discouraged by. If a reader takes the time to understand and pay close attention to detail, the story unfolds brilliantly. The characters are some of the most human and diverse that have been crafted. It is introspectively healing, but more importantly it is a tale about love and the obsession that it brings, including the human need and lust for it. This story is for meticulous, passionate readers, seeking to simply looking for the human truth about love and pain. I enjoyed this book and have granted a special place for it as one of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is a tremendous book by an enormously gifted writer. Ondaatje's prose is both langurous and sensuous as the story glides back and forth in time, recounting the love affair between the eponymous &quot;english patient&quot; and Catherine Clifton, a married British woman. When Ondaatje is on, he is on with full force, and this book serves as testament to his fluid narrative skills. Passion and love--themes that almost defy original writing--are presented plainly, even austerely; yet Ondaatje's phrasing and style lend immense lyricism to the starkness of his words. More absorbing than Almasy (the english patient) and Catherine's affair is Hannah and Kip's, perhaps because the latter shows an honesty and reality that the former somewhat lacks. Theirs is a wary, awkward courtship punctuated with frustrations that are recognizably human. But &quot;The English Patient&quot; is more than just a twin love story--poetic and haunted, it is about the ghosts of the past and how we strive to reclaim them, even as we try to escape them."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Reading this book, it's easy to remember that the author is mainly a poet, not a novelist. In fact, this is perhaps closer to an epic poem than to a novel. There isn't much of a plot, and there isn't really a theme or message put forward by the author, but the prose is beautiful and a joy to read.Unlike most books, I would definitely recommend seeing the movie before reading this book. The reason is that the movie relies very much on a sense of mystery- it's told in flashback, revealing bits of the story to the viewer a bit at a time. Much of the enjoyment of the movie (it's pretty good, but Lawrence of Arabia it ain't) stems from wondering who the characters are and what events led them to where they are, and discovering the answers a piece at a time. Having read the book will spoil the mystery which is the heart of the movie. On the other hand, the book is not about plot at all- it's more a series of flowing images than a coherent storyline. The book relies on its beautiful language to entertain the reader- having seen the events in the movie doesn't really detract from that.Again, if you're expecting a rousing adventure story in this book, you will be sorely disappointed. If you take it for what it is, a vehicle for poetic language and an experiment in a different medium by a fine poet, then you will be able to really enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The book was contrived, contrived, contrived. I would never assume that one's personality could show itself so clearly in fiction.&quot;Just read Ondaatje's notes in the back&quot;, I tell people. He constructs the novel from a bit of research and some letters. He already has the story in mind, he just needs to prop it up with historical background and a bit of authenticity. The story could have happened anywhere, really. Then he took it and tore it into pieces, mixed it up, so that the reading would not be so linear. This is a nice trick that makes story telling more compelling to the reader. And of course, a little bit of poetry at the top of each chapter is a nice touch. We don't know what it means, but make it vague so it seems deep and interesting. No wonder the characters are bereft of any life.I try to tell this to other readers, but it frustrates me all the more when they say it is a &quot;beautiful&quot; book. Given such a subjective response, how can one argue? Perhaps they mean beautiful imagery; I too can conjure up beautiful cliches.It doesn't help that a movie was made. I suspect that this is where most people's appreciation of the novel comes from. Nevertheless I liked the movie much better, for there was less to present that one could find fault in. And for all the terrible movies that do come out, The English Patient was sure to outshine them.As a footnote, I also suspect the historical &quot;facts&quot; that support the story. Without researching the facts myself, I could tell the story was slapped together on top of a few scant personal letters and what seem like references from a Time Magazine book on WWII.I don't like to be so critical, but when an author goes out of his way to insult the intelligence of the reader, I must respond. Ahh Ondaatje, you show yourself to be a true charlatan!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient lacked all but one of the characterics that make for a truely great novel.

For me, lovely prose just isn't enough."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"&quot;The English Patient&quot; is one of the few books that i have ever read which have truly inspired me. I utterly adored the lyricism and poetic, musical quality of the writing. On every page i found passages that i would have to underline to read to my friends simply because i thought they were beautiful. This high praise, however, was not immediate. The first time i read the book i was somewhat confused by the switching narrative, and the description which seemed to outweigh plot and character. However, as i re-read the book, i came to see that it cannot be viewed as a straight story, rather, you need to read it once to get a general idea of the parts of the story, and then as you re-read, you are able to see how the various episodes fit together. You can also see the clear character deliniation which is not at first obvious. Ultimately, i believe that &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a story of such beauty and subtlety that it must be read several times before the full impact of the drama, the tradgey and the poetry shines through."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I started this book with great expectations only to be greatly dissapointed!

The characters were not fully developed, but I continued to read thinking I would eventually come to the great love story and I would become excited about the plot. It never came. The narrative by the English patient did not tell me of any great love. Just a fling behind the husband's back. I was very disappointed by this book"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"While most are raving over this novel, here's another &quot;thumbs down.&quot; Ondaatje gives little life to his characters -- but mostly relies on descriptions of their surroundings to convey their thoughts and emotions. Very well, it's been done before with great success. But the problem here is that Ondaatje is obviously too in love with his own prose.Reading this book is sort of like being lectured to by a snooty english prof. who thinks he's got a better handle on setting symbolism than you ever will. Oh well, folks seem to love it anyway. Go figure."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Once you've been to Ondaatje's Africa and secluded Italian villa, you will never be the same again. His character studies of how four damaged souls converge melds seamlessly with a poignant narrative of love and loss."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's quite obvious from the tone of the book that the only character this author cares about is himself! Soooo tedious that every time I sat down to read, I found myself thinking about watering my tomato plants, which would have been a LOT more interesting. I could write more, but that would just give this book free advertising, which is something I DEFINITELY DON'T want to do."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"When a book has won the Booker Prize and the film that it spawned has taken Oscars, the casual reviewer might be tempted to conclude that everything has already been said on its subject. Having just revisited the film after several years of absence, I decided to re-read the book. I don't remember how many times I have read it now: let's call it several. I have seen the film at least six times.First let it be said that the film, The English Patient, claims only to be based on Michael Ondaatje's book. It is a film from the book, not of the book. The distinction is crucial because, despite the film's admirable attempt to recreate the complexity of part of the novel, the book always went much further.In the book we have characters who have been scarred by war, by a war that none of them particularly wanted to fight. I suppose there are occasional wars where some of the participants want to be active. But here Caravaggio just wanted to stay a thief and thus keep his thumbs. And who would take over thieving if he is drafted to fight? Perhaps Hana's father really did intend to see out the conflict and restart his previous life. Perhaps the English Patient, himself, did really want to be English. I doubt it. Or perhaps the idea, that of nationality, given war, was mere irrelevance. It was sides that people counted. He certainly had much to hide, but from whom? What does it matter what side you claim to be on when it is only ever the innocent who fall victim? This last point is crucial to the feelings of Kip, the character who only just makes it into the film.For in the book this Sikh sapper, this bomb disposal specialist, who risks his own life to protect others, is a complex anti-colonial thinker. He has a sense of justice that transcends victory, especially when that victory is won at tremendous cost in the lives of those who did not fight. This aspect the film makers largely ignored. His character became a suspiciously like an aspect of the noble savage that remains gratefully unthreatening to colonialism. In the book his standpoint is far more radical than this.And as far as Almasy is concerned, if that really was his name, he eventually worked for those people who would accept him at face value, without a racism that was suspected. On the other hand, he was Hungarian, and in that war the nation was sympathetic to fascism. So did he merely support his own country's line? Whom would you believe? Whose motives are honest?Almasy's love for the wife of a British war-monger was undoubtedly sincere, but at the same time obsessive. Might it have burned out if given the freedom to flame? And did Katharine know of her husband's contribution to war? If not, who was betrayed? In the film it is unclear that it took Almasy three years to return to the Cave of the Swimmers, and also spent much of the intervening time doing significantly more than merely handing over maps. Such is life in war. In film, it's the gloss that counts.In The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje's book, we are never clear about motives. These change whilst apparently remaining both consistent and sincere, despite remaining unknown, often unstated. There is continued life after the conflict ends, albeit utterly transformed, still dangerous, and then there is death which, for some seems the preferable option. There are principles, and these are largely underpinned by pragmatism. Above all there are actions and reactions. Ask any fuse. It might just blow you away from what you are. Light the blue touch-paper and stand back, well back."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Just finished reading the English Patient. I looked forward to reading it, and maybe it was turned into a good movie, but the book sure didn't hold my interest. The story was uninteresting, depressing, and unnecessarily drawn out. I was not drawn in to identify or care about the characters. I wasn't sure who was speaking at times, and after 50 pages I didn't care. The flashbacks were confusing and seemingly disconnected. No plot. No tangible mystery, though there was some which in its revealing toward the end of the story didn't matter to me. The story could have been told in half the amount of pages without all the unnecessary descriptive passages. It was a cold and godless kind of story from beginning to end.This book struck me as the kind of novel that was put into a certain kind of prose that only some readers appreciate, and its style is probably embraced in a way that those readers laud as unique while smugly declaring that other readers did not appreciate it, thereby allowing themselves to feel better than others. The book was boring and taught me nothing about life except that it can be inhabited by some characters that appear to be stumbling along learning nothing of value except how to be despondent and confused."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"At the tail end of the Second World War, a young nurse, Hana, and her sole patient are locked away from the rest of the world in a crumbling monastery in the hills north of Florence in Italy. Not only is the Villa San Girolamo in ruins, its previous German occupants have booby-trapped it to blow sky-high with one unsuspecting act. But Hana's patient cannot be moved, and Hana refuses to leave him. Into their lives wander two other men: David Caravaggio, a friend from Hana's past, and Kirpal Singh - Kip - a young Sikh soldier with the British army. The power of this book lies in the lyrical beauty of its language, and the fleshing out of these four wounded souls against the backdrop of a brutal and dehumanizing war.The story does not proceed in any linear fashion, and the reader is caught in the undertow of the protagonists' flickering memories and emotions. Each has their story to tell. Hana, the youngest of the four has seen the specter of death too often in her brief career tending to the wounded and the dying. Caravaggio, a charismatic thief, has been compelled during the course of the war into playing a far more shadowy and dangerous role, and has paid dearly for it. Kip, the sapper, has an instinct for finding and defusing bombs and mines. But his work has him living life on the edge, alert for danger from any direction and keeping the world at a distance, finding safety only in himself.The most intriguing is the man known as the English Patient, to whom Hana devotes all her care. Dying and in an agony that can be palliated only with morphine, he still seems intensely alive, a compendium of erudition, who bears his pain with dignity, with patience. Nobody knows if he is even English, only that he might be, but then, he might be so many things. He is a man who owes his allegiance only to the undulating sands of the desert:He has been severely burned in an airplane accident in the deserts of Africa, and has barely made it alive to the hospitals of Italy. The army, ever on the look-out for enemy spies, grills him without much success. He gives no satisfactory answer to their questions, but slowly reveals his secrets to his companions at the villa. The secrets of his life, and of the forbidden passion for a woman that has destroyed them both. The sensuous language of this book encompasses both the anatomy of desire and the landscape of longing. Love must lie somewhere between the two."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I found The English Patient to be a fantastic book, but one which is a bit emotionally taxing, particularly the utterly heart-rending ending, which I won't give away, but which tears the community of World War II survivors apart.I know that for most people The English Patient conjurs up ideas about a great tragic love story between the main character--the English patient--and his forbidden love. For me, however, the love story fell a little bit flat. Maybe it was because I had heard so much about the romantic side of the narrative and perhaps had expected too much from it in terms of romance. And while the love story certainly is central to the plot surrounding the English patient, it's hardly the kind of romance for which anyone would hope themselves. This is not the kind of love story which will make young women fantacize about being Katherine and falling for the mysterious desert-obsessed English patient. Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I didn't shed any tears over the end of their doomed romance, as I had found it rather uninspiring myself.*note that I have not yet seen the film of The English Patient. My understanding is that the impact of the final scenes is significantly different, bringing more focus and attention to the love story, and for this reason the love story may be more powerful in the film, but I'm not in a position to judge.*What truly touched me about the narrative of The English Patient was everything but the English patient. Hana was one of the most interesting characters in the novel, in my opinion, as was Kip. Now that I consider this, it's really not all that surprising given my interst in postcolonialism--particularly Indian literature--since Kip and his relationship with the other characters in the novel, all of whom are western define the final conflict of the narrative as a conflict between the west--symbolized in England--and the east--symbolized in both Japan and India. I'm afraid to go on about the powerful nature of this relationship and the consequences for the end of the novel because I don't want to give away too much about the end of the book. My hope, after all, is to inspire others to read great literature, not to make reading great literature unnecessary as I summarize it all. :)Another very powerful relationship within the novel was the relationship between Hana and her father. I found Caravaggio a rather uninspiring character, but his role within the context of Hana's relationship with her father was crucial. I found that Caravaggio was most interesting and complex when he reminisced about his history as a friend of Hana's father and his memories of her as a child. Hana's final coming to terms with her relationship with her father, with her place in the war, and with the circumstances of her father's life was also extremely powerful, but again I don't want to give too much away.Suffice it to say that The English Patient is one of those books which everyone ought to read, though be warned that while it is a deceptively slim novel it is also powerfully heavy and an incredibly serious novel. This is one which you won't forget any time soon, and which you will likely mentally chew over for a long time to come.Read all of my book reviews on my blog at [...]"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a complex novel that interweaves four characters and their separate stories in a plot centered around WWII. While the movie focuses on just one story attached to the present narrative, the book is much richer, fully developing all of the characters. The main narrative creates a moving world of its own, as the characters find a safe haven from the war and their personal tragedies.

I mean cheap, tawdry, breath-less stuff with Fabio on the cover; I couldn't bring myself toread more than two pages without laughing. It was a shame,too, because I'm as romantic as the next person. SO imaginemy shock of delight when I ran across a REAL romance, withimages that resonate as deep as an ocean, written in Englishthat best represents the state of modern literature. CanadianMichael Ondaatje's lyrical and disturbing tale of four woundedlives at the close of World War II and the memories of loss andhope that flicker across the pages is a book to be read out loud,a book that inspires through its sheer force of poetry. It hasall of the intrigue and wonder of a romance, but without theguilt; this is a tale of love for adults. Forget those nicelittle novellas about geriatric passion and read passages thatcan illuminate corners of your mind, those opinions that scoffat such silly matters as those of the heart. Ondaatje wonEngland's Booker Prize (equivalent to our National Award orPulitzer) for his work, and it was well-deserved. He doesn'tcondescend or cheapen emotions to snare an audience, insteadhe lets the story unfold in layers until we've come to learnmore about these people: a nurse, a thief, a soldier, and aterribly disfigured English patient; as if we've lived alongwith them. A stunning, welcome example of the very best moderfiction has to offer. And... there's no bare-chested malemodels gracing the cover! &quot;The English Patient,&quot; by MichaelOndaatje.

This is one of the best novels I've read in my life, including all those so-called &quot;classics,&quot; not so much for the story, but for the prose. The prose is hauntingly beautiful, almost to the point of giving you goosebumps. It's totally compelling.At heart, the underlying story of &quot;The English Patient&quot; is not new. It's about an adulterous love affair that ends in tragedy. But of course, I don't think that's really the point of the book. There's a reason the novel is written in the present, with flashbacks to the past. The book explores how the characters, from different walks of life, react to the situation they find themselves in, from the traumatized nurse Hana to the stoic sapper Kip.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book to read. You'll feel good after you're done with it."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I don't have the heart to give bad ratings to books that really deserve worse. I actually enjoyed the book more while reading it than after I was done with it. It's like eating some kind of food that tastes good but leaves you with the worst after taste. I think that Ondaatje is a good writer but the English Patient is not a very good book. It was relatively hard to read, and only slightly rewarding for all the drag. The ending is horrible, I thought. The comments made by people who gave this book a bad rating are much more objective than the people that praised it. Unless you are a literary freak that does not have anything else to do but read strange and complex books, don't bother with it."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing.

It was too good to put down! My father was a sapper with the New Zealand Engineers in the Middle East and in Italy during the Second World War. This book described in full detail the stories that my father had tried to tell me as a child. When I had finished, my first thought was to phone my father and tell him that now I understood. But he is dead. It lead us through the horror of war in such a documentary, matter of fact style, that it all seemed so real, so cruel but in the circumstances, so necessary. I had seen the movie first and found the book to be so much better. So tragic. So simple. Just like life. Some readers will regret that there is no instant, sugar-coated ending to this book. If a reader wants that then he/she should watch sit-coms. The most beautiful thing about this book is that it deifies the human spirit, the majesty that exists in each of us, despite the surroundings and the circumstances, if only we will let it come through."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is a novel that I can easily see why 90% of the people that bought it, placed it back on the bookshelf at page 80. This is a novel that you have to be in the mood for and really look forward to getting something out of it. If I wouldn't have preped. myself, who knows what I would have done. Really, I loved this book, great characters and a great story of love but I believe symbolism played an active roll in this novel and it is one of the hardest techniques to catch. I would read this book anytime, just as long as YOU go into it will a very OPEN MIND. It really stands out because the last author to write this kind of a novel and have it sell was Steinbeck; only one problem, the people want popular novels by the popular authors like Sheldon, King, Clancy, Steel, and who could forget Grisham, and then comes this book, that stands out above the rest and most defiantly gave all of its readers a reality check on literature. Sorry for the novel, and I honestly believe you will like the book.

What made this book so special to me was that the answer to the question: &quot;Could we ever have forgiven Alm&aacute;sy had he not worked for the Germans to be able to pick up K. from the cave?&quot; was a wholehearted &quot;No!&quot; People who do not love this book cannot possibly know romance, love &amp; the all-consuming fire of the heart.

Thanks to this India born Canadian for bringing us greatness."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The most popular so far of Michael Ondaatje's novels, The English Patient is a devastating postmodern epic that takes place during World War II, yet speaks to us of the state of our contemporary souls. Hana, a young Canadian nurse psychologically damaged by the ravages of war, cares for her mysterious burnt patient in an abandoned Tuscan villa. They are soon joined by Kip, a Sikh sapper working for the British army, and by David Caravaggio, a charismatic thief-turned-spy who knew Hana as a child, and who has since lost both thumbs to fascist torturers.The burnt patient, whom everybody believes to be English, but who may also be the elusive Hungarian explorer and Nazi collaborator Count Ladislaw de Almasy, remains in his bedroom and comes to befriend the other three characters. He is a born storyteller, and his loquacity takes on the erotic appeal of a siren's song against which neither the other characters nor the readers can close their ears. Through him we learn of the impossible love affair between Katharine Clifton, a married Englishwoman, and one of the members of a team of explorers and archaeologists in the Lybian desert of the Thirties. Meanwhile, Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio weave their way in and out of the villa's wrecked rooms as they remember or try to forget what happened to them during the war and attempt to rebuild their shattered selves through love, friendship and, in Caravaggio's case, the occasional shot of morphine.Through his characters, Ondaatje asks fundamental questions. What is the nature of our selves? What is the nature of our world? What are the effects of war, division, and fragmentation on our lives? Ondaatje allows his characters and setting to provide the reply. Because the villa was booby-trpped by the Germans, whole walls are missing, thus letting in trees, sunshine, and rain. The burnt patient's room, however, was left intact, yet someone painted an entire garden upon its walls. The burnt patient writes his life on the margins of a book by Herodotus.

I am amazed at how Ondaaje used sentence fragments to completely tangle me in this book. He is a brilliant writer.Katharine's chapter is the most beautiful piece. It is the way you would want a lost love to describe you. I read the book before the movie- and although both are lovely, the book brings you to a point in you imagination that you cannot control. &quot;Who lays the crumbs of food that tempt you?

In the first place, every page is littered with fragments of language that stick to your brain because they are so melodic, poetic, perfect that you don't want to forget them. Beyond that, it's an excellent story, an excellent way of looking at the world, a powerful commentary on life in general (and not in the least bit cliche\`; its message is very original and appropos in our age of &quot;globalization&quot;). The single disappointment is for those of you who have seen the film version: in the novel, the characters of Hana, Caravaggio, and Kip are explored in greater detail; when I was finished with the last chapter (an Epilogue dealing solely with Kip's subsequent life) I wondered why the novel was entitled The English Patient: he had not been the focus. But read it anyway...as soon as you can."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje is a true craftsman of characters. Read this if you think you could be &quot;in love with ghosts.&quot; What other author has the ability to craft robust introspective phrases out of solitary and hollow words?

This novel was clearly written by a poet,who leaves with you multi-layered, powerful memories of the allure of the desert, the obsessiveness of the love affair, the characters' sad longing for everything they've lost and can never recover. Except for a few tedious passages about bomb defusion, this is one of the most intelligently romantic (not sentimental) novels of the late 20th century. The images stay with you--the cave of swimmers, the hunted monastery, the desert winds--as much as the well delineated characters, making you want to come back again and again to their distant and magical world. The novel holds you in its lyrical grip and you won't want to let go."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a beautiful portrayal of human love and loss during a time of war.

(No, I don't live in a bubble. I just don't follow the Academy Awards.) I tracked down the book after reading Ishiguro's &quot;The Unconsoled,&quot; where, on the back, Ondaatje called Ishiguro &quot;the finest prose stylist of our time.&quot; I was deeply intrigued. Having read the book, I now understand that Ondaatje sees himself as the finest poetic stylist of our time. Rightly so. I enjoined the words and language of the book and would recommend the book to readers of serious fiction. And yes, there is plot. And, yes, there is continuity. I don't buy the love story elements, which seem to include the worst elements of &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; merged with the best of Hemingway. Nevertheless, the themes of isolation, despondency and retrospection, played out across the spectrum of the somewhat shattered or totally shattered lives of the four characters provide an alternative story line even if you choose to skip over the love story. I haven't seem many comments here reflecting on the corresponding damage between the villa and the characters. It is refreshing to know that novelists still exist who are willing to explore language, theme, irony and so forth. Too bad they aren't from the United States. I can recommend the book very highly.

He will haunt you long after you have put his book down. You will read him again for his writing after you have read his book for the story. His imagination and love of beauty has few comparisons.

I don't know if I can really say \\"finished\\" since I skipped quite a few pages due to the dullness of the book. It is one of the dreariest, most slow-paced and unnecessarily wordy books I've ever read. I wonder how it even won a prize? You never really get to know or like any of the characters, who are all terribly boring. The book jumps from scene to scene, and you're never really sure who's saying what. And like other reviewers have commented, nothing really happens. I'm yet to watch the movie, but I hear it is really good. But as for the book, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje has a marvelous way with words but somehow the story seems a little too romantic and self-serving, given the situation in which he embeds his characters. The story loosely revolves around Count Almasy, who was quite a different person in real life, especially in terms of his sexuality. But, Ondaatje doesn't let such little things deter him from telling his tale.Ondaatje approaches his works as an Impressionist. The colors are muted and blended into each other to create a stunning variety of illusions which carry the reader along with their figurative charm. The situations seem drawn largely from romance novels but are given a more earthy tone in the way he tells his stories. He weaves together essentially two stories, with the Count as the bridge between these two worlds. It is a way to tell of WWII on two fronts: the African front at the height of the war and the Italian front after the Americans had overwhelmed Mussolini's republic. Ondaatje uses romance to soften the effects of war with the only gritty character being Caravaggio.The book translated well to film, with wonderful performances by Dafoe, Fiennes and Binoche. But, in its own right there isn't much to hold the reader beyond its well worn images of love in the time of war."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I didn't think anything could top the movie but this did.

At times, it was hard to follow but that is part of the nature of the text and prose. We have four characters and their lives and more importantly how they all come together in one place.

Read it slowly.Where else have we ever read of a desert being described as a &quot;...rumour of wells...a palace of winds?&quot;Ondaatje is a master of poetic prose and uses the stream of conciousness technique in a manner more accessible than any writer before him. Sometimes the plot and character definitions get lost in the descriptiveness, but that's not the point of this novel. The characters are somewhat ambiguous (intentionally), but a deep reading shows them to be intricate.Kip and Hana both serve the same function in the war - they save lives, one a nurse and the other a defuser of bombs and mines. The interrogator Caravaggio and the English Patient are both veterans of the darker side of the war, one a spy and the other a traitor.There are morals in this story (and preserved in the film). The hot romance of the English patient and Katharine is bankrupt if beautiful. Violent, even. This is a deception and their loss of each other is ironic; her dying in the desert, taunted by the swimmers in the cave, longing for wet England, her homeland by the sea where the wished to die; he burns and stays burnt in a purgatory, and, similar to Herodotus his master, always thought of as a liar, doomed to recount his story, his wrongs and have revealed his mistakes that cost them both their honour and their lives. Both are punished.Kip and Hana are opposites to this. There love is ripped away by the blast of atoms from Asia. The outside world of war and circumstance, the irredeemable nature of their different skin colour (when Caravaggio asks her why she cannot marry Kip, she responds by pouring white milk over Kip's dark skin) conspire against them. Theirs is the lost love, the romantic love.Ondaatje fools us. Blinds us with passion, so to speak.And the language...Has the English language ever sounded so good?Read parts aloud and the power of poetry is revealed in his prose.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"As I started reading, I was taken in by Ondaatje's masterfully poetic prose, his gift to be able give any situation that mysterious, misty-eyed epic feel. I was infatuated with the novel, I read and savored a couple pages at a time, all the way through the wee hours of the night....But that passed. I found myself for some reason, after a while, lacking all gumption to pick up the book and open the pages. I realized the it was just plain uninteresting. What Ondaatje does in his narrative so well, magnifying the smallest detail into something beautiful and extraordinary, is entirely what the book itself is. Nothing but a small story, with small occurences, magnified to a thousand times. The only factor that makes the plot in any way engaging is Ondaatje's manipulation of time, somewhat reminiscent of Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot;. Otherwise, I wouldn't have cared! Although most of the characters seem pretty &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; in their development (but they are developed, which is interesting coupled with Ondaatje's poetic style) the only real-seeming aspect, character-wise, of this novel is Kip's struggle for identity and, consequently, his relationship with Hana. The other characters seem too distant and contrived.Bottom line- it's a pleasure to read, if you can bring yourself to actually do it.Great quotes, though! &quot;If I gave you my life, you would drop it. Wouldn't you?"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The Booker Prize Committee got hoodwinked. A writing style entirely lacking in subtlety and full of bad metaphors (one character compares her step-mother to a barge...); far-fetched plot divices; self-absorbed, unlikeable characters with no voices of their own (they all speak like the poet Ondaatje).

The author uses words so odd that, although I understood them, they seem designed to confuse the reader rather then paint a better picture of the lives of each of the 4 major characters. The author also seems to have difficulty deciding which character he wants the book to focus on: whether Hana, the nurse; David, the thief; Kip, the sapper; or the mysterious &quot;English patient.&quot; Hana, David, and Kip are not described in detail or well, and so they are all easily forgettable, but the English patient's story of his life in the desert before and during the Second World War is excellent, a &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; romance that is easily the best part of the book. Unfortunately, to get to these good parts, you must sit through 140 some pages of dull love scenes between Hana and various men. Huzzah.Even with these faults, the English Patient's tale of its titular character is very good, but I wish it had gotten a fairer treatment. It is the kind of book you must reread every few years, simply because it is so difficult to understand."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book does not pose any questions I care to have answered.

In one, the woman is a dead witch, and the man is in a bed lying very still. In the other, the woman is a nurse whose boyfriends tend to die, and the other DEFUSES BOMBS!!!Which couple do you find more interesting? The movie focuses on the dead witch and the man lying in bed. The book gives them space, but focuses more on the other two lovers. You know, the ones who we care about a whole lot more and whose jobs are real interesting.Oh, and in case you haven't heard, Ondaatje is a weaver of words unchallenged in North America. Maybe South American authors (mostly dead) can give him a run for his Booker, but they aren't in the commonwealth, are they? This text is a gorgeous jewel. Check this one out and avoid that awful, boring, tedious, cowardly film.

I needed even more than before to visit Toscana (in the end, also a disappointment compared with Piemonte, Veneto, ...). Unfortunately, novels and films not only need not tell the truth but are free to distort it badly. The real story of Almasy can be read on the web, in English or German. He was a German agent, was never captured, had no great interest in women and died on the way home sometime after the war of a disease contracted earlier in Africa. He indeed was an Africa researcher and did write a book, Schwimmer in die W&uuml;ste, about the pictures on the rocks in the desert. Almasy means apple, more or less, his family made money from apple orchards in Hungary and bought the castle, never quite attaining official status as nobility from the Austrian government. So, the film is largely a charming, romantic fabrication, as are most films.Somehow, it is very unsatisfying to be seduced by a book or film and later discover that harldly anything in it is correct. The fortress where Laszlo Almasy grew up, Burg Bernstein, lies south of Vienna and is now an attractive little Schloss-Hotel run by my wife's only aunt's best friend, a K&uuml;ffstein-German who was adopted by the Africa researcher's brother after WWII. The castle does have a fantastic kitchen and a wonderful high view of the surrounding territory, maybe the best view in the region. Also, there are nice wine 'villages' not far away."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Wow. 300 pages of nothing. This book is certainly amazing. Everyone tells me the style of this book is breathtaking. Yea, it truly is. He has absolutely no writing ability whatsoever. The \\"imagery\\" and \\"description\\" that everyone rants about is pointless, boring, uninteresting, and rambling. There is zero structure to the novel, and to add insult to injury, this hapless book doesn't even lead you to anything. There's no plot. It's just a winding nonsense festival of shallow observations and condescending themes. If you would happen to like a book about 4 people living in a random villa TALKING for 300 pages, you'd love this book. For all others, avoid this book like the plague."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I find it incredibly funny that so many people are gushing over this book.

That's why my expectations were very high and now I am a little disappointed (but nevertheless the book receives an 8). I like the story very much and the way it's written. You can see before your eyes how Kip disarms a bom,... He's the carecter I liked the most.Ondaatje knows very well how he has to describe a person, a situation,... and that's very nice to read. You don't need a movie to see it all"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I had to say the book is not what I expected, but nevertheless it is an enjoyable read. I had anticipated more coverage on Ralph Fiennes character, and the romance with Kristin Scott Thomas, which is so memserising on screen. But the book has put more emphasis on Kip and Hana's relation. Apparently, given the background of the author, this is intented to be the major storyline. I think it is a pleasant read, the narrative part is excellent, but the movie treatment slight outshined the original"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The book is certainly very good, but the movie is stunning.By focusing on the love story, certainly the movie losessome of the depth of the original (see the review that givesthe book a &quot;5&quot;), but it more than makes up for it in beautyand clarity. The visuals brought home the beauty of thevision far better for me than the book, and I wasn'tdistracted by the hunt for Almasy's identity the way I wasreading the book. But, oddly enough, it is the differencesbetween the two that, for me, fill in the gaps between thetwo most clearly. It's as if I understand the story, thecomplex ineffable &quot;point&quot;, better by the rearrangement of the scenesinto the film."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Open the book and you are plunged into another world, peopled by shattered humans who will rouse you from the complacent present, and draw you inexorably to their world of suffering and (sometimes) redemption. Filled with incredible details, written with grace and knowledge, you cannot help but be caught up in the lives of these mysterious survivors. There is much to learn in these pages, and Ondaatje is a marvelous teacher. The story flows seamlessly along until the last few pages. There it unaccountably falls off track, into an incongruous jeremiad against racism, which contains a vital message, but seems artless and contrived. The ending in no way detracts from the grand achievement of the book, which will linger in your heart for years"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This was a Booker Prize winner (1992?). I was prepared to dislike it--seemed a little too introspective for my tastes (not to mention I usually avoid WWII stories). What a pleasant, if unsettling, surprise; this book is marvelous. The writing is sensuous, the characters dramatic, and the setting surreal.The book opens with Hana, the war-fatigued nurse, left behind (by her choice) after the evacuation of the Allies from Italy. She has seen so much death and so much devastation that she cannot move on with her fellow nurses. She throws away her uniform and cuts off her hair and settles in to finish the war in her own way.Hana is caring for a man she presumes is English, but who is so badly burned that he has no identifying features. He is an encyclopedia of knowledge of Bedouins and the desert; he quotes from Herodotus frequently, and he has thorough understanding political forces behind the war. He cannot move but is dependent on Hana to relieve his pain, feed him, and read endlessly to him.The Italian thief Carravaggio hears tell of the young nurse who refused to leave with the evacuees and realizes she is the daughter of a former friend; he joins her and the patient in the villa, initially out of concern for Hana's well being, and later stays out of compulsion to discover the identity of the patient (which he does). Incidentally, Carravaggio has had his thumbs cut off for theft and is a morphine addict.Kip, a Sikh sapper from Lahore, arrives to do his job--finding and defusing Nazi mines and bombs. He and Hana become romantically involved, but this touchingly described part of the book truly is an incidental part. Kip is so far from home, so young, and so confused about life that he immerses himself into his treacherous work. He compares much of his life to his job--what harm can lightening be, when he runs the risk of being blown up several times a day? He keeps himself isolated from the others as much as he can, to the point of sleeping in a tent outside, but like the other characters, he is dependent on the others to find himself.The story of each character is lovingly told; even the most gruesome vignettes are told with words to wrap yourself in and just roll around. And although nothing in this book could be classified as too pleasant, the book is immensely satisfying. I finished it with a modest &quot;Oh, my!&quot;"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I guess these are the books the jury likes for awards. I was looking for a good lively love story, but ended up reading one of the most complicated and dragging novel of all time.There is no begining or ending and the lives in the book have no meaning. a boring and dissappointing saga of a burnt patient and the nurses love for him or who, i could not understand.My worst read so far"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is the kind of book that some English teachers might point to as &quot;great writing,&quot; but I found it incredibly pretentious and overblown. The characters ultimately are cardboard and uninteresting, the plot is not particularly riveting, and I found the writing style to be pompous and irritating. In trying to wade through this thicket of inpenetrably stuffy verbiage, I ultimately was bored silly. This book gets my &quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; award for this year."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Without a doubt the worst book I've ever read. If you are looking for an ending, don't waste your time. Here's the story in a nut-shell: Nothing happens"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"While I loved the movie, the book left me dry and perplexed. Normally I prefer the book to the movie, but in this case, it was the other way around. The story jumps around a great deal and you live in the heads of Hana, Caravagio and Kip, but only graze upon those of Catherine and Almasy. If you expect to read about that great romance, better just rent the video because it's not in the book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a beautiful novel. One of the reason is much more detail. The passages of dialogue between the english patient and the other characters are excellent. And his recollections of the desert. While I read this novel I can feel the taste, smell, touch and sound and I can imagine the characters and situations.When World War 2, a women who name is Hana, the nurse is very tired by the death of her important people. She decided to take care the last of the English patient who forget his name and his past. Caravaggio is a thief. He tries to set the patient to recall his past, what he did, and what happened because of him. Caravaggio has lost both of thumbs. Kip who dismantles bombs, fall in love with Hana. But the accident which Hardy died divided them.Almacy recalls his past, his passionate love for Katharine who is married became a big tragedy for them. Also it made some big tragedies around them.This novel is difficult to read because of the two stories, Almasy and Katharine, Hana and Kip. For me, as Japanese, more difficult. I can not understand the meaning, just one phrase.There are many meanings include. I need knowledges about them to read. For example dominanse of England and geographic knowledge.I am impressed descriptions of this novel. Michael Ondaatje described the view of the desert as a women's body. According to Almasy, a hollow of women's thorat is Bosporus. I am fascinated by his beautiful work.He wrote this novel very poetic. So sometime it is hard to recognize the pronoun. \\" who is he?\\" or \\" who is she?\\"I also want to write about wonderful character,Count Almacy. He is a most enchanted character I have ever read. Before he got burned he didn't like to talk. But after that, he used to talk. As if he is a different person. He has a lot of attractions. He is knowledgeable. He can speak many language. He likes to sing a song. Even he is a gerous man. His character still continue to exert a powerful hold on me.\\"The English Patient\\" is the most hauntingly beautiful book in my mind."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Historical WWII, mystery, and love. ' \\"Who is he speaking as now?\\" Carravagio thinks' (location 3236/4158). He is referring to the English patient of whome extends his arm to receive another morphine shot. The thought processes are deep and symbolism ties events and feelings to what seems to be destiny, characters express themselves as if the mind has been stimulated. Remembering the very instance one fell in love and how they knew it, every instance, every glance, every word, and everything about that person he has figured out. A hightened mind may speak of these things as if wise to everything in life, yet real events prove that love is really a small thing the grand scheme of things. That's kind of sad isn't it? The novel makes me wonder if that can be true, however, I am not a veteran of a world war, and war changes everything.Four WWII veterans, each who have served a different and unique role, and each who have become become disabled each in a unique way as a result. The stories that unfold throughout this novel are deep. So deep, they are open to a reader's interpretation. A bombed out Italian villa, a deserted hospital still wired with hidden explosives, becomes a beautiful, peaceful place where time stands still. These four beautiful people are surviving their pasts the best way they know how. Inner depths of their hearts, thoughts, and conversations are revealed by the author's unique writing style.I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys taking time to digest everything as they read; to take time to think about and try to fully understand a character. If read slowly, one can get so much out of this novel. Read slow, just like in the novel where time is standing still.I own the paperback, and recently downloaded the kindle version so I could travel with it and read it again on peaceful sea days. I have now read it twice, the first time about five years ago. The kindle version ends with some discussion questions, and upon mulling them over I have realized I still have much more to understand from this novel. It is a novel to keep on your bookshelf and treasure, a novel to discuss in groups, book clubs, or on on-line forums."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"\\"The English Patient\\" brings together all the elements of a classic story - love and mystery, history and exotic settings, told with Ondaatje's beautiful, poetic prose.

A beautiful book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I am quite new to Kindle, but wanted to add my praise for this beautiful book. I had seen the film and read it on a friend's recommendation. I am so glad I did - the book is even better than the film. A must read."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A lyrically written book, with I feel, no great substance (and not much humour either). The characters (four of them) are not very convincing. How this book could be compared to \`All Quiet on the Western Front' is beyond me as they are entirely different stories (this was cited in one of the comments in my edition). The author skips endlessly from one time sequence to another time sequence - as if he cannot hold a thought for more than a few pages. This out of sequence style strikes me as contrived. There are nice sentences thrown together but little cohesion.At the end the author lists his sources. It is as if he read the sources and used these to try to inspire a novel - about deserts and dismantling bombs."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This novel is very well written, as one would expect from Ondaatje. The four characters are woven together brilliantly and it is an excellent example of Ondaatje's skill in doing this. It's not my favorite of his, but it is still a wonderful book and a great read."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read the book because I loved the movie so much. I have to admit that if I hadn't watched the movie first, I might not have liked the book. It is definitely a different style of writing and it took a little while to get used to. It's probably worth reading more than once just to take it all in. Probably about 1/3 of the way into the book I got more used to the style of writing and the characters started to grow on me. There are a lot of historical and literary references that I didn't get, but it doesn't necessarily take away from being able to enjoy the book. Not my usual \\"beach reading\\" by any means, but takes a little bit of focus to be able to lose yourself in this book. The book does a great job of not just giving you the answers to all your questions about the characters and their motives, but making you figure it out for yourself."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"this is near the top of my best loved books. Beautiful, descriptive writing. A book whose complexity allows for a second or more visits to find hidden themes a single reading might miss."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's too bad they make movies out of all the best books because they never do them justice. My other favorite authors are Annie Proulx, Anais Nin and Don Dellilo.

I always meant to read the book and finally found a copy. I made several attempts to get started and found it confusing and impenetrable. finally, I decided to plow through to the end believing it must be good since the movie was, and the book was a best-seller.I must say that there isn't much to the book. nothing happens; no real plot develops. it just ends, with a little end-note about Kip the sapper after the war which was both jarring and unnecessary.the most unsatisfying loose-end is the fate of the patient Almasy. the book ended with him in bed just like it started, and never having been forthcoming with Hana, Carvaggio, or Kip.also, once in the book it says the Bedouins treated Almasy with tannic acid which turned his skin dark. that is truly bizarre. this is how you tan animal hides to make leather. it kills the cells and makes them non-porous. is there a dermatologist in the house to comment?"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is by far one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The words are so generous and descriptive, each page was an adventure into the lives of the characters, and every work delicious. I have not read any other books by Michael Ondaatje, but I will certainly be looking for others.I would recommend this book to anybody who can appreciate good literature, not to the lover of the Mills and Boon type book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It started out as if it was going to be pretty interesting, with the fantastic description of the setting. That's okay for an intro, but the main thing is, THE ENTIRE BOOK SHOULD NOT BE AN INTRO. We wanted to see Odaantje step off the setting for a few moments and start concentrating on other things... like plot, maybe. Don't get us wrong, Odaantje had a brilliant writing style. But it just didn't work for a novel. Maybe he should stick to poetry."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Mr Ondatje should have at least consulted the available WWII material about both the Canadian Army, and about the Italian Campaign. No basket case patient would have ever been sent from Egypt to the &quot;front line&quot; in Italy to be taken care of. He says the English Patient was transported by train from Cairo to Tunis, which couldn't even happen today, much less back then. His nurse turns 21 in 1945, after serving with the RCAMC since 1943, when she would have already graduated as a Nurse. That means she started nurse training at 14. The RCAMC did not even accept nurses until they were 21! His nurse simply refuses to leave when ordered to, as though that could happen in the military world. She finds an english language version of a J.F Cooper novel in the library of the Italian convent -not very likely. The sapper is shown to be about 300 km. north of the Allied battle line when he is on the beach of Mare Gabicce in May, 1944 (the allies were still trying to punch through the Gothic line in the Liri Valley). Even a high school essayist would be failed by his teacher for such blatant errors. What a co-incidence that the nurse should read Cooper to the patient. What a pity the author never read Mark Twain's celebrated essay on Cooper's rather similar stupidities of fact. What a pity the Governor-General's Award judges don't even bother to learn about the facts. They are NOT that hard to find! I think one star is generosity personified! Space permitting I could go on for pages about dim-witted errors of fact."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I must confess that I expected a novel more along the lines of the movie, which is -by the way- one of the most beautiful movies of all times. To my surprise, the book barely resembles the movie in its pace, its stories, its dramatism, and made me not only love the movie even more, as to stand in awe before Anthony Minghella's ability as scriptwriter, because he managed to be faithful to the spirit of the novel and, nevertheless, write an altogether different story.Contrary to what you might think (as I thought when I bought the book), this novel is not a tale of that love story personified by Kristin Scott-Thomas and Ralph Fiennes, although love and deception are present in the lives of everyone there. WARNING: if you loved the drama, the rapturous passages of love between Katherine & Alm&aacute;sy, and the beauty of the photography in that movie, but are not attracted to either poetry, nor long, detailed, beautiful descriptions of the desert, or how Kip becomes a sapper, well, you'd better stick to the movie, because this book definitely is not for you.But if you can get past all that chapter, and have some flair for a not-so-fast-paced style of storytelling, you'll be greatly rewarded; beautifully written and poetically descriptive, the stories of Hana, Caravaggio, Kip & Alm&aacute;sy are carved into the big fresco of the WW II and its last days in Italy; the atmosphere of this novel is not as intense & passionate as the movie's, probably for its lack of a plot. Instead, four stories are told, each of them a world on its own, broken lives each with their own dose of love & betrayals, and only touched between them by the circumstance of the war. After I read it, I could only recommend its reading to those who look after beauty, despite everything else."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"For many, an excellent novel establishes connections with its reader either through character development or from the adversities that the characters face. In the case of The English Patient, however, the prose Michael Ondaatje chose to employ hampers any such bonds from being made. The plot and the unique way that Ondaatje goes about telling it makes for an interesting read, but not a captivating one.The interactions between the characters in the villa also bring little in the way of descriptions. The characters are so jaded that they merely journey from one place to another reminiscing about their past. Even the interactions between Caravaggio and Hana, the pair who used to be childhood friends is short and halting. An excerpt dealing with Caravaggio's hands demonstrates this succinctly as it ranges from, \\"I would remove those bandages on your hands. I am a nurse, you know.\\" To half a page later spiraling into nostalgia with, \\"It is a strange time, the end of the war.\\" \\"Yes. A period of adjustment.\\" \\"Yes.\\"The sacrifice of the character development is not entirely in vain, however, as it allows the use of a skillfully done method of introducing and advancing the plot. Ondaatje paces the book in superb form to heighten the mysteries surrounding the English Patient and his past. At times it makes a somewhat unwieldy appearance, but the reader is relentlessly driven on to wonder who or what the patient really was.I would only recommend this book to anyone who has a large amount of time so that they are able to engross themselves completely into the winding plot and the various intrigues of each character's past. If read casually the general haze that surrounds the characters will most likely detract from the experience as a whole and ruin the book entirely."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book is amazing; it is lyrical, poetic, mysterious, complicated and thought-provoking. Those who have seen the movie only know the story at its surface level (although the movie is indeed fantastic). The book, more than just a romance, deals with themes of loyalty, patriotism, the nature of war, friendship, loneliness; and that's what I thought of off the top of my head.This book deserves a close, slow reading. Its language should be savored, its characters pondered, and its themes analyzed. This isn't a beach read or a sappy romance; instead, it is an intelligent, beautiful book that will stay with you long after you have turned the last page."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Obviously from the reviews, one can infer that you either love it or hate it, a lot of fives and ones. Those who hate it said that they have found it boring which i highly disagree on. This is definitely one of the best books i have read and i recommend it to anyone. Even if you have seen the film, read the book. The movie chose to concentrate on Katheryn and the patient while the book goes deeply into the other characters. Not boring in the least...You have to read it"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"There are three books I keep by my bed to dip into on occasion before going to sleep: War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy, The Master and Margarita by Bulgakov, and The English Patient by Ondaatje. I can read segments of these again and again because with each reading I find something new at an even deeper level. The movie version of the English patient, while visually evocative, was untimately unsatisfying because it took the easy way out and focused on only one of the many emotional relationships explored in the book. And if I could read the original Russian I am sure that I would find the same extraordinary use of language in War and Peace and the Master and Margarita that I find in The English Patient, which is masterpiece of evocative prose - indeed rivaling the best of poetry. This book is not for everyone. You need to work at reading it, savor it, return to it often, suspend the need for instant understanding, and be willing to think."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I am a lover of books and enjoy nothing more thana &quot;good read.&quot; I was looking forward to readingthis book prior to seeing the movie, and anticipated an &quot;all-nighter&quot; staying up until the book was finished. It is a small book, after all. I was SO disappointed to find it a boring, ponderous artsy-fartsy book which relies on stream of consciousness and endless narrative to tell an uninteresting story. There are very few books I find unable to finish, but I have put this down three or four times to read another book instead. Although I keep coming back to it to try to press onward to see what all the fuss is about, I find myself caring less and less. The characters are shallow and pretentious, and could use more development; the plot(s) entwine and separate but never engage the reader. Thumbs down!!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The numerous comments I've read on this page along the lines of &quot;this book didn't make sense&quot; and &quot;where was the plot?&quot; remind me of the time someone I knew finally got the chance to see &quot;Cats&quot; and was disappointed because there was no plot. Now, I am NOT a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, nor would I dare to insult Michael Ondaatje by comparing him with such a person (although I am a fan of T.S. Eliot). My point is that if you read novels only &quot;for the story&quot; you (a) are missing several whole other worlds that can be opened by really intelligent fiction, and (b) you should NOT try to read Michael Ondaatje. If, on the other hand, you are a lover of words, a reader (preferably &agrave; haute voix) of poetry, a dreamer; if your imagination runs away with you; if you have loved someone, not necessarily &quot;romantically&quot;, but passionately at least once in your life; if you are not always in a hurry to get to the point; if you often talk to your best friends for hours about life, the universe, and everything ... then you will love this book. The love story, I can't say this enough times, is not the point (which is why I refuse to dignify the movie version, although it's not a bad movie, by comparing it to the novel); it's the convenient peg on which the whole beautiful web of mystery hangs. One of the things I love about Ondaatje's work is that he refuses to be confined to a single genre, and such is the case here: there are love story, a mystery or so, some war history, a lot of truly poetic word-painting, and a great deal of insight into the human condition, all woven seamlessly together in language that I always feel I should be reading aloud so as to slow myself down and savour its beauty. Oh, and read In the Skin of a Lion too, especially if you live in Toronto -- you'll get a whole new perspective on both The English Patient and the Bloor Viaduct, and I will say no more."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I can't imagine who would not enjoy &quot;The English Patient&quot; since the book has all things for all people. It's a love story, that contains historical fiction, espionage, hints of the super natural, hope, tragedy, and a degree of mystery.The premise of four different people coping with their damaged lives in an Italian Villa at the end of World War II is a compelling one. Hanna, a nurse must deal with the loss of her father and numerous patients. Kip, the engineer who difuses bombs is haunted by the loss of his mentor and teacher, Lord Suffolk. Caravagio the thief has lost his ability to steal after having his thumbs cut off by the gestapo. And Almasy, it seems has lost everything including his lover, his friends, and his body.Unlike the film version of &quot;The English Patient&quot;, things in the novel are quirky and never fully resolved. We learn of Almasy's death before it happens and are exposed to his omnicient recollections in the mean time. As a result, his death becomes irrelvant and we are able to focus completely on his narrative of the past. Similarly, Almasy's affair with Katherine is stranger and darker than the overt passion between them in the film version. Long after Kip returns to India and marrys, his mind is still very much in sink with Hanna's. When Caravagio returns to Canada he is still reminded of Kip years later. In life and in death an invisible thread connects the characters to each other even after they have gone their separate ways.I thought the film was as wonderful as the book but for completely different reasons. The film was a very compelling drama and love story. But in order for that to happen, Almasy needed to be more of a cut and dry character. He was a taciturn, pseudo Nazi with burried emotion and a tragic streak. In the novel, Almazy was odd humorous and possessed knowledge of almost everything. Instead of appealing to us as a doomed lover, he teased us and made us wonder who and what he really was. In the end his story remained a mystery.I am glad that this book has not been classified as ethnic literature simply because the author is of Indian decent. Many readers may disagree with me, but I think of literature as the ulimate equalizer. A person's prose stands on its own regardless of who the person is or where they are from. Michael Ondaatje is a great writer more than he is a great Indian writer."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read the book after watching the pictures, which may be a mistake. The book is a bit hard to read, and it's hard to follow its thread. While reading, you can'i imagine the magnificent feelings, love and light wrapping the film. A bit disappointing."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje. Recommended.In this poetic novel by poet Michael Ondaatje, the author explores the past and present (the closing days of World War II) lives of young Canadian nurse Hana, her English patient, her family friend and accomplished thief David Caravaggio, and Indian sapper Kirpal Singh (nicknamed Kip).Hana, who has lost her father and her lover during the war, has been desensitised and traumatised-only 19, she has held cigarettes to the lips of armless boys and moved patients only to find that they are already being consumed by worms. When the Italian villa-turned-hospital where she works is abandoned toward the end of the conflict, she insists on remaining behind with the one patient who cannot be moved-an enigmatic English patient whose skin is burned black from a plane crash in North Africa and who does not seem to remember who he is. The only clue he carries is The Histories of Herodotus, which he uses as a commonplace book.Caravaggio, thief turned intelligence agent, has lost the practical use of his hands when he is caught stealing by the Italians and loses his thumbs as a physically and emotionally brutal punishment. A morphine addict, Caravaggio cannot rest until he knows all the secrets-those of Hana's heart but especially those of the mysterious Englishman.Like the others, Kip belongs nowhere to no one. Estranged from his family by his nontraditional beliefs and pursuits, he is also a man without a country-an Indian sapper in an English army that does not welcome foreigners, especially Indians. A loner by nature and by circumstances, Kip finds respite if not meaning in Hana's arms.For a professed amnesiac, the English patient remembers great detail, from his post-accident discovery in the desert by Bedouins and their subsequent treatment of his injuries to his earlier life as a member of a 1930s group of explorers seeking to answer such riddles as how Cambyses and his army could attempt to cross a desert-unless there were a Zerzura to be found. Of equal or greater importance to his exploration reminiscences are his memories of his hot affair with a fellow explorer's wife that burns itself out in tragedy.The long passages in which the English patient slowly unravels (but never admits to) the mystery of his identity and past are intriguing, spellbinding, revealing, and poetic. Those with any curiosity will find themselves wanting to read more about not only 1930s European expeditions into the desert, but about the desert itself-where dozens of different types of winds inspire the Bedouins to don them with dozens of beautiful names descriptive of their moods.On the other hand, Caravaggio, who feels safest revealing nothing, pieces together his own knowledge with the clues dropped by the English patient to come up with a plausible theory about his identity, actions, and movements during the war-but not his motivations. Even as his name and his past are gradually unveiled, his character remains elusive-perhaps explaining why Hana is in love with the living remains of a dead man.Hana and Kip, and their relationship, are the least interesting elements of the novel. Hana's character functions as the center around which the others meet. As a sapper, Kip's duty of disarming bombs becomes virtually his sole focus in life. When he learns of the ultimate bomb, the ultimate weapon that even he cannot disarm, and who it is used against, he in his ignorance confronts the English patient-a moment of irony. The villa, an island surrounded by a sea of turmoil and change, is not so remote that the \\"death of civilisation\\" cannot reach it.The best of The English Patient reminded me at times of Mark Helprin (Winter's Tale, A Soldier of the Great War) in tone and evocations. While not a great novel, it is certainly an interesting, thought-provoking, and worthwhile diversion.Diane L. Schirf, 21 May 2003."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Three people. Strangers. Together at a time when the Second World War is on its end. Shattered. Battered lives. In an Italian Villa - trying to reconstruct of all thats left, with the help of a burnt English Patient in a room upstairs...with a past like all of us...I loved this book right from the word &quot;GO&quot;. No book has enchanted me this way in months now. The English Patient is a treat for the soul. Michael Ondaatje has created a masterpiece in its own right. Soulful, Poetic and so Real. Stories that come to life. Dreams that exhale memories of a different land. All lost. Souls in transit. That is the theme of this magnificient novel that enthralled me so much....Love, Betrayal, Passion and above all a story of the Human Heart and Compassion.A must must read for everyone who loves a good book..."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's style is truly what stands out in this book: at once poetic and intellectual, sensual and political, it always catches you by surprise. Often I had to read a paragraph or a page several times, because meaning comes in subtle hints and images. It's frustrating at times, and there are still some parts of the book that are slightly confusing (why does Cavaraggio rob a house naked?), but it's worth the trouble for the sheer beauty of it. Consider this passage for example:\\"We die containing a richness of lovers and tribes, tastes we have swallowed, bodies we have plunged into and swum up as if rivers of wisdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have hidden in as if caves. I wish for all this to be makred on my body when I am dead. I believe in such cartography- to be marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. We are communal histories, communal books. We are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience. All I desired was to walk upon such an earth that had no maps.\\" (p261 paperback)Read this book aloud or listen to Ralph Fienne's beautiful voice. Read it once, leave it for a while, then read it again. And again and again."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and its beautifully told intertwining stories. Nonetheless, it does appears to be several stories loosely linked into a central narrative. Each of the stories is suberbly crafted and the writing is exceptional. But at times, I could not see the overall theme of the writer and where he thought it all fitted.It is almost like several short stories mixed together and then placing the characters togther at the end of the war as they sort out their lives.Despite this weakness, I loved the description of the desert and the trips through the wilderness. The love story is imaginatively told and the bomb decommissioning scenes are harrowing."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I am reading this incredibly lyrical and emotionally complex novel with my high school students. Most of it, admittedly, is above their heads. But they do recognize its beauty, it's easy grace-like we do in really good poetry or in great songs, or like in falling in love. The English Patient is beautiful in most imaginable ways, and has become like a song we sing together in class everyday. Ondaatje says, &quot;a novel is like a mirror walking down the road.&quot; He slips into lines like these as if they were nothing at all, but they will leave you speechless with their unadorned truth and honesty.I know years from now, when these ninth graders have their own kids, and find love or not; when some of them slip into affairs and disappointments, and even joy, they will remember Katherine and Almasy- and the emptiness of the desert. What else is literature for?In the middle of our national crisis, Katherine's words seem to haunt all of us with their portent- &quot;We're the real countries, not the boundaries drawn on maps, or the names of powerful men.&quot; Try beating that. There is nothing left to say, really. Is there?"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The only flaw in this book is that there isn't much of a plot. It's an exploration of how each individual's life is affected by the war; it explores the people they were before the war and how it has changed it. In a sense they ALL are patients. They all need treatment. The writing is exquisite. Though much of the novel is difficult to get through, the writing more than makes up for it. If you are to read this book, have patience and time. Don't take it on the beach. It's cerebral. Very intelligent. And this isn't a Harlequin romance; it's one you can actually believe in. But it should be read--I think it's a very important book in CANADIAN fiction."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is my all time favorite movie, which people say is strange considering I'm only 14. Unfortunatly, I saw the movie before I read the book, which sort of spoiled the novel for me. If you are going to experience both, then I would definatly read the book first. Otherwise you will be dissapointed with the difference between the book and movie."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Ondaatje's works are too oblique and difficult to follow; only in The English Patient has he managed to insert enough understandable, sympathetic details to create a worthwhile novel. It transforms your view of the world, turning it into a glorious, magical place... but the story itself doesn't merit much."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book by Mr. Ondaatje pulls the reader in, and loses him in a sandstorm of beautifully descriptive passages. Granted, the language was of a high quality and deep meaning, however, the amount of flowery language overwhelms the otherwise encapturing plot. The parrallels between what once was and what now is (for example, Hana's relationship with Kip and with the English patient) lose substance and freshness with superfluous description. All in all, a good story and intent is undermined by a passionate author's insistence on making everything obvious to the reader."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Sorry to give it all away. I saw the movie and laughed at all the wrong parts... well I thought they funny. I had to read the book to clear up a big dispute I had with my girlfriend. &quot;I don't get it - if they were flying down to pick him up in the desert why did the wife come too... The plane only has two seats so where was he supposed to sit on the trip home ???&quot;. Alas I was none the wiser after reading the book"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Okay so this is not intended to be a realistic novel. It is a fable. In a fable trees are allowed to talk and frogs become princes. One of my very favorite books, \\"Catch-22\\" is a fable. Thus the author is entitled to expect us to suspend disbelief at all the numerous implausibilities.Usually fables, like \\"Catch-22,\\" are written in absurdist style. That tells you up front that you're not supposed to take it seriously. I think that some of the previous negative reviews have been misled into thinking that Ondaatje intended to be literal.The visual descriptions are strong. I could see the villa, the bedroom with the patient lying supine and nude, the fountain.I could not see any of the characters. In the modern style, few descriptions are given, but I haven't had this problem before, not even with Leonard and DeMille who would sooner commit hara-kiri than tell you anything about a character's appearance.Hana was the only character who had any character, perhaps because she seemed sexy and I'm a dirty old man.Heinrich Dahms, the indie movie producer and my critical lodestone, insists on \\"a bitch of a dramatic dilemma.\\" I couldn't see any dilemmas here, nor drama. It was all pretty tame. People floated around pointlessly and made mundane utterings.About a third of the way into the book I realised that I was not enjoying it. The mostly plain prose, which I would otherwise have admired, only described the characters being flat and boring.Elmore Leonard says that he leaves out the parts which the reader skips over. If Ondaatje had done that here, he could have ended up with quite a tantalising short story.The entire premise is just too thin for me. I regret giving up so many hours of my life to read this book when I could have been doing something useful."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I liked this book much better than the boring movie. It was beautifully written but some parts flashed back and the ending was weird but the story was lovely about 4 lives during the war and you got into some of the characters lives. His style of writing in this book and the story was much better than Anil's Ghost which I found to be boring and redundant. A good book. I've read better but I've also read much worse."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje has the touch. Like a painter, he brushes the landscape of war-ravished scenes into our mind. He dabs into his watercolors and paints such unforgetable characters as Hana and Carravaggio and the kipper--and, with a truly genius stroke of person, the Patient himself. A masterful work."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"greatly tested my patience. though i must say katherine and almasy's love story is simply beautifully tragic."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Strange and boring. Difficult. Rambling. At the end, you will have decided it wasn't worth the effort. Dry, tasteless, cheerless. If you want to give it a try--acquire it at the library.

Best advice: pass on anything labeled &quot;The English Patient.&quot;"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"An excellent example of a book written with an audience in mind. Contains all the right trappings for appeal to the modern upwardly mobile. Oh! yes, how strange, the book has also been made into an award winning movie.

It was so dry - and I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I was really disappointed."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is Michael Ondaatje's masterpiece and one of the most hauntingly beautiful books of the twentieth century, evoking an eroticism and emotional connection with readers that many would not have believed possible. It is a novel that asks questions for which no answers exist; a poetic and multi-layered mystery that unravels slowly, only very gradually revealing its fatally wounded inner core of a love that could never be.The English Patient takes place in World War II Italy. A man, the &quot;English patient,&quot; his skin burnt to a crisp, lies dying in a makeshift hospital amid the ruins of an ancient monastery. The Canadian nurse who has stayed behind to care for him, Hana, is fighting demons of her own. As the novel opens, Hana and the English patient are alone but they are not alone for long. Soon, two bomb disposal experts and a mysterious man named Caravaggio arrive at the monastery. Caravaggio is a murky character with even murkier motives in life, but it is clear from the outset that he harbors a tremenous amount of rage at the capriciousness of life and that he carries with him a hidden agenda all his own.Although, from the beginning, there is apparently no hope for the English patient's survival, Hana cares for him tenderly, bathing his rotting skin, even bestowing gentle and sincere kisses upon his burnt lips. Perhaps if she can heal him, she might have one more chance at healing herself. The English patient cannot drink, he cannot speak, he can remember nothing. He reminds Hana of other men, countless men, she has seen die during this terrible war. Afraid that her own presence might contribute to the specter of death, Hana wonders, &quot;I must be a curse. Anybody who loves me--who gets close to me--is killed.&quot;The bomb disposal squad includes a handsome Sikh named Kip. When Hana finds herself attracted to him, she resists the attraction, feeling that the curse she unwittingly places on the lives of others could affect Kip as well. When the English patient is given access to a book found near his body, a very old, leather-bound volume of Herodotus, his memories begin to return. As Hana reads to him he remembers fragments, flashes, nuances. He dreams. Enough to tantalize but not enough to tell us everything...at first.The deatils of what the English patient remembers are the threads of love and betrayal that weave the poetic and lyrical tapestry of this gorgeous and heartbreaking story, so I will not give them away here. The skeletal outline, however, becomes clear very early in the book. The English patient is not really English at all, but Hungarian. He is a Hungarian count, named Laszlo de Almasy who was sent to Egypt, attached to the Royal Geographic Society as a pilot. A pilot who flew over the desert making maps for research purposes as well as maps that could also be used by the English during the war.In Cairo, before fate strikes one of its cruelest blows, Almasy meets an energic British woman named Katherine Clifton. Although newly-married, Katherine is not happy with her husband, Geoffrey. Her attraction to Almasy is immediate, as is his to her. Later, when the two find themselves alone in the desert, they will be called upon to confront their love. Their decision will have lasting repercussions for both of them.Almasy is a man who, in life, as well as in death, conceals rather than reveals. It was Katharine and Katharine, only, who, with her energy and her zest for life, could release all the pent-up passions of Almasy. Without her, he becomes withdrawn once again. His personality is perfectly suited to the slow unraveling of the mystery of The English Patient. For it is a mystery, and one that can only be exposed by the charred man who lies in the bed in the ruined monastery. Little by little, Almasy remembers and the pieces become clear. As they do, the lives of these four people, Hana, Kip, Caravaggio and Almasy become more and more entwined.The English Patient is a labyrinth of a novel, yet it has a skeletal quality as well. Perhaps that is because Ondaatje's prose is a perfect reflection of the love shared by Almasy and Katherine: so lyrical, so poetic, so gossamer in its beauty that it feels as though one breath would be enough to cause the entire thing to simply dissipate before our very eyes. The plot is not a linear one; Ondaatje fades back in time, then loops forward to the present, then fades back again. But the story is so perfectly-crafted, so beautifully and hearbreakingly told, that nothing could flow more easily. Ondaatje works his magic slowly, quietly, but surely unraveling the web that comes to bind these four tragically wounded and disparate lives.The English Patient is a book that will, without a doubt, withstand the rigors of the test of time. It is a lavishly poetic love story and one that touches the depths of love and romance inherent in the human heart like no other."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I have amassed a rich collection of audio books and this is by far the worst. I bought it several years ago, started listening to it, and stopped halfway through. I just couldn't get into it. Recently, I tried to listen to it again, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around. It was just as bad. Whereas, with most audio books, the narration adds to the content of the book, in this one, it kills it. If you want to read this book, stick to the paperback version."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"As some other reviewers, I have read this story after watching the film first. I am very glad that I did, because I have discovered a talented writer, of whom I knew nothing before. Some people, who were very impressed by the film, might have found the book less satisfying, because of some plot differences between the two. These differences doubled the pleasure for me, personally. Both men, Anthony Mighhella and Michael Ondaatje, are absoltutely genious and it is nice to have the same fantastic story told twice from a slightly different perspective. Bravo to both men!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"&quot;There is God only in the Desert...&quot; Anyone who has been to Saharah and felt the Ham-sin winds strangling you and forbidding you to breathe inn-can fully appretiate the wonderful description of the desert. &quot;Love is so small, it can tear itself through the eye of a needle...&quot; Anyone who has loved,and felt how the Greedy Love feeds on your soul,can identify himself with afflictions of Hana &amp; Kip and Kathrine &amp; Almasy.A certain pattern to the juxtoposition of these two couples exists. &quot;They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation...&quot; Anyone who is awared of the Hiroshima Millitaristic disaster, can see the paradox in the present &quot;Harmony&quot; between Japanese and U.S.&amp; Europeans.Forgive?Forget?

Although many critics comment differently, Almasy IS the main character.The paradox of a filthy traitor possessing no repentance represented as the &quot;Hero&quot; of the novel- roflects the natural unconfessed contradictions of qualities in all of us.

When I read it, I am humbled and awed by the English language. The prose is exquisite, every word, every sentence is carefully crafted. One needs to invest time, and silence, and an appreciation for the written word in order to reap the benefits of this book. Ondaatje does not serve his readers with larger than life charaters or whirlwind action. These pages are a meeting ground for his marvelous language and our ability to be moved by his words. Language is really what this book is about. Ondaatje is a superb craftsman and poet. PS; He was born in Sri Lanka, not India, though he has lived in Canada for almost forty years. Read his excellent memoir, Running in the Family, in which he writes about his privileged, Dutch-Ceylonese heritage."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is simply a beautifully written novel.

A couple of times I got lost in the descriptions, most notably in the scenes in the cave (I would have rated the book a 10, but I had to see the movie before I knew if she died or not...couldn't tell from the book, and I read that passage several times before I gave up). If you likes stories to fall &quot;neatly into place&quot; and be more-or-less chronological, don't read this book. If, however, you like interwoven plots and artfully crafted text, this is for you."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I felt I had to comment about the novel vs. the movie. The movie gained mass appeal by simplifying the story into a basic harlequin romance and a couple of steamy scenes. Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, but the screenplay may as well have been an &quot;original&quot; work, loosely based on the title of an existing novel. I do agree that the book is not for everyone. By trying to capture all the subtleties of the many characters, Ondaatje tests the reader's ability to stay focused. Personally, while I think the book was a worthy read, I have read many other works of literature that are more deserving of the praise that has been heaped on this novel."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Michael Ondaatje weaves a web of memories with Hana, Caravaggio, Kip, and Alm&aacute;sy in his novel The English Patient. Near the end of World War II, Hana the nurse tends to her last surviving patient. Caravaggio the thief and Kip the Indian sapper accompany her within the deserted Italian villa. Each character searches for their identity through the remnants of war and forbidden romances.Every night, Hana opens a book at any random page to read to the English patient, and Ondaatje tells his stories in the same way: with unconventional yet interlaced narratives. There are multiple realities as the point of view shifts from one character to another, rejecting the idea that only one version of the story exists. Along with the unusual narrating is Ondaatje's beautifully crafted prose. They are lyrical and elegant, flowing like waters over a smooth riverbed. His detailed, poetic metaphors create indelible imagery. The tense shifts back and forth from present to past, and settings change randomly as each character's past unfolds.The fragmented anecdotes are like a mysterious jigsaw puzzle. It begins with a vague plot; the storyline almost unrecognizable and certainly difficult to follow. The novel's melancholic atmosphere may become frustratingly sullen, tragic, or even futile. Readers must have the patience to tolerate and wait: once the narrative smoothes out, a whole new perspective will open. As the identity of the English patient is revealed, so are the inner selves of the rest of the characters.Ondaatje creates a sensuous atmosphere through lush diction and poetic metaphors. The story seems to begin aimlessly, yet ends with an invaluable collection of profound themes. Readers discover the clash between nationality and identity through Kip; the power of love through Alm&aacute;sy; the inescapable destruction of war through Hana and Caravaggio. The English patient is a web of traumatic memories that challenges readers to reconsider the nature of love, war, and identity."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I don't know how to describe what it is that mostly fascinates me about this book.

I buy it and then give it away, pressing it into the hands of yet another person I know will love it. While there are many books I loved reading as a kid, I think this was my first adult love; the first book that took my hand, whispered tales of foreign lands and seduced me shamelessly.It has been twenty years since I first read The English Patient, and I love it as much now as I did then and yet it is a very different experience this time around. Back then I read it as someone who was setting out into the world, who had explored the world page by page, not step by step. I read it as someone who had never set foot in the desert, who had never climbed to the top of a towering sand dune:The desert could not be claimed or owned-it was a piece of cloth carried by winds, never held down by stones and given a hundred shifting names...The grooves and the corrugated sand resemble the hollow of the roof of a dog's mouth.I read it cocooned in the comforts of Australian suburbia, never having seen a harmattan sunset:The harmattan blows across the Sahara filled with red dust, dust as fire, as flour, entering and coagulating in the locks of rifles. Mariners called this red wind the \\"sea of darkness.\\" Red sand fogs out of the Sahara were deposited as far north as Cornwall and Devon, producing showers of mud so great this was also mistaken for blood.And I read it never suspecting that one day I would attempt to send my own novels out into the world:The word should be thinkering. Caravaggio's mind slips into this consideration, another syllable to suggest collecting a thought as one tinkers with a half-completed bicycle. Words are tricky things, a friend of his has told him, they're much more tricky than violins.I feel like I am reading it with new eyes (or perhaps older eyes would be more appropriate) and yet there's a lovely familiarity of being drawn back into the intertwined worlds of the four central characters; following them along familiar pathways, and watching their lives and loves unfold.A novel is a mirror walking down a road.This is one to add to your personal library, but if you have the chance, buy two, then you'll never have to give away your own."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This story has awakened many deep reflexions about human nature and the blurring boudaries of truth and fantasy, love it"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Fascinating and horrifying story of relationships and living in the residue of war.

The book was amazing and I cannot see what confused people so much. Well thought out plot. The characters are real beyond developed. Definitely would read again.

I, however avoided The English Patient because it was so popular and so many people who I knew did not care for it. I should know better than rely on even those readers whose taste are similar to mine as we have enough divergences. I've discovered this before and I discovered it yet again with Ondaatje's The English Patient .I love Ondaatje's writing. His prose is beautiful and I can find passage after passage that moves me. What I particularly love about his writing that he uses it as a shroud to envelope his story in a mystery so dark that this reader is compelled to continue. I can't wait to find out what is really going on, but Ondaatje like a magician with a sleight of hand leaves me wondering, \\"did that happen or was it that instead?\\"The story begins towards the end of World War II in an abandoned Italian villa with Hana, a Canadian nurse caring for a single badly burned English patient of unknown name or origin. Soon Caravaggio, a friend of Hana's father arrives. His skills as a thief were valued for espionage during the war. His hands are bandaged and he sought Hana's company:\\"At night sometimes, when the English patient is asleep or even after she has read alone outside his door for a while, she goes looking for Caravaggio. He will be in the garden lying along the stone rim of the fountain looking up at stars, or she will come across him on a lower terrace. In this early-summer weather he finds it difficult to stay indoors at night. Most of the time he is on the roof beside the broken chimney, but he slips down silently when he sees her figure cross the terrace looking for him. She will find him near the headless statue of a count upon whose stub of neck one of the local cats likes to sit, solemn and drooling when humans appear. She is always made to feel that she is the one who has found him, this man who knows darkness, who when drunk used to claim he was brought up by a family of owls.\\"Shortly after Caravaggio's arrival Kip an Indian sapper, who is an expert at finding and disarming bombs, IED's and explosives which are scattered about Italy. Each of these four are compelling characters who Ondaatje examines, but always leaves some doubt as to their true purpose and the demons and hurt which drive them.This is a novel about war and its consequences, and about love and betrayal . The reader is left in the end with much to consider. Lovers of happy endings may indeed be disappointed, but I loved it."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Twenty-year-old Hana is living in an isolated villa outside Tuscany. It's 1945 and the Germans have retreated, leaving mines and burned-out buildings behind. Hana's nursing a badly burned man she calls the English patient, as his identity is unknown. She's later joined by a man named Caravaggio, an older friend of the family, and Kirpal Singh, a young military engineer who defuses bombs for a living. These four exist without electricity, little running water, and large holes in ceiling and walls, yet none of them seem overly eager to leave. In fact, each character seems almost complacent about their living arrangement, but why?This beautifully written book is about physical, emotional, and psychological isolation due, in large part to war, yet there's more to it than that. Slowly, truths and motives are unraveled, as each character comes to terms with past and present. Interestingly, the future isn't considered much until the end, and this was problematic for me. One key question wasn't answered, (or if it was, it went right over my head) and after investing time to read 302 pages, the ending was a bit of a letdown."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"My in laws took us to see the film when it played at the Rialto in South Pasadena. The cinematography was beautiful but the movie was missing substenance. It felt like someone had taken a wonderful story and shreaded it. A couple weeks after seeing the film I ran across a copy of the book at the Book House (an excellent used book shop if you're ever in South Pasadena). I bought the copy and read the book in one or two settings. I LOVED the book. The movie then came to life for me in my mind with the book filling in the details."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one of my favorite books! Ondaatje writes beautifully, and is able to convey so much through just a few carefully chosen words. The characters in this book are very richly drawn. It is really a wonderful novel about the human condition. I just wish Ondaatje would write more often!!!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is a moving novel that traces the collapse of Western civilization -- and the imperialism which underwrote it -- in a number of characters following the end of WWII. I came to this novel only long after seeing Minghella's film version of it -- the few comments I will make here are aimed at encouraging others who have seen the film to read the novel as well. I usually wouldn't make a point of chastising a film to celebrate the text from which it was adapted -- but in this case, I think that the changes Minghella made are indicative of a deep-seeded colonial sentimentality in the unitedstatesian, or at least Hollywood, imaginary. In other words, I will not critique the adaptation in order to uphold some concept of the pure original text, but rather to compare them in order to highlight the ways the film manages to sidestep the more challenging aspects of the novel.Readers may be surprised to find that the novel, unlike the film, is not focused on the character of Count Almasy to the expense of the others. The Count's character is important -- especially since only he, the apparent Nazi agent, represents the ideal of a European renaissance man, someone who whose grasp of history, language and art approaches the universal. In the novel, the attractive aspects of his character are clearly linked to European colonialism and to fascism -- the problem posed by his character is just this, how he simultaneously embodies the highest values of European renaissance and Enlightenment, the chauvinism of the European imperial mindset and also, by his association with the Nazis, the darker values of European &quot;humanism.&quot; By choosing to transform this character into a romantic hero -- a la T E Lawrence -- the film not only missed out on what is most interesting about Almasy's character, but transformed him into a figure of nostalgia for the &quot;exciting times&quot; of European colonial rule. In contrast, the novel compels readers to think far more critically about the ability of Europeans to legitimate the rule of colonialism in the name of Western human values.Similarly, the character of Kip, the sikh Sapper, is not just a background figure in the novel as he is in the film. Rather, he represents a person who has been colonized by the West, but whose relation to Western civ is fully ambivalent. He not only loves the sublime frescos of Italy, but knows how to distinguish them from the culture of Europe in the wake of WWII. He loves European art, but is not dazzled by it.Finally, perhaps most interesting are the many, many figures of ruin in the novel -- the body of the Count, most obviously, but also the landscapes in which the novel takes place -- the Italian villa, or even the rock drawings of Libya. As ruins, all these figures challenge one's ability to claim greatness. Ruins always challenge the one who looks upon them -- as if to say, &quot;I once was grand but now am no longer -- beware your own sense of greatness.&quot; This is what the landscape of this novel suggests over an over again -- but with a twist: so much of this landscape -- the landscape of Western civ -- is also boobytrapped. Thus, it not only suggests a comparison with a present moment of poverty, but also precariousness and danger. Any one of these icons of Western civ -- the statuary, the piano, the frescos, the monuments -- could explode at a moment's notice. Western civ, for all its beauty, never appeared so fragile!The novel succeeds in critiquing the pretensions of Western civilization then, but he also renders its decline into the Sublime. What lovely ambivalence! What a welcome departure from colonial sentimentalism! Is this the book that Minghella read?"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time, even though I found it frustrating the first time through. I kept wondering &quot;where are we now? what's going on?&quot; and re-reading passages to pick up the thread of the plot. The second time through, with a grasp of where the book was headed, I was able to enjoy the sheer beauty of the book's mood and atmosphere. I would advise first time readers to savor the book, and not worry about the sense of drifting among plot lines - the book will take you with it. I have noticed in conversations with people about &quot;The English Patient&quot; that there are those who like the book, and those who like the movie. The movie has a much more traditional narrative flow. It took two readings for me to understand that the book has to be read like poetry."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Poetic and engaging. I like the way he handles time, as though painting in layers, going back to a point and elaborating on it, coming back to a &quot;present&quot; and then going back again and again, and then finally moving forward to the end, although I don't think the last parts of the book live up to the promise at the beginning.I have remarked elsewhere that the book disappoints with its phony PC notions about how Kip and some others might have reacted to the atomic bombing of the Japanese cities, the author imagining that Kip would be offended that the bomb was dropped on &quot;brown people&quot; and not on Europeans; but in truth, few at the time really comprehended nor cared about anything other than ending the horror of the worst war in human history. I was more horrified by the booby trap bombs left behind by the Germans that Kip had to disarm because they were left specially to murder people whereas the atomic bombs had at quickly as possible and with a minimum of lost life. Would Ondaatje have wanted to storm the island of Japan? I don't think so.But that is not the novel's only conformance with the current politically correct climate. The English Patient, like the preponderence of contemporary novels focuses on a woman, in this case the nurse Hana, surrounded by various interesting men, mainly because that is what the market place requires. My point is that even the most skillful and accomplished artists, and Ondaatje is one of them, must conform to the dictates of their age in commercial terms or not be published at all.I saw the movie first and then read the book, something I almost never do, and I was reminded of a remark by a student of mine who said that she preferred to read the book first because that way she drew in her mind her own picture of what the characters were like. I found myself greatly influenced by the actress who played Hana (Juliette Binoche), so much so that I did not form any independent conception of the way Hana appeared in the book. I think and the actor's interpretation.Good book, but not the masterpiece I had hoped for."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I read and re-read &quot;The English Patient&quot; several times...and in different places. In my garden, on a ship at sea, and lastly, by the shore of a quiet lake in the northern part of my state. Each time I found a new relationship with the characters that I had not realized before. At first I focused on The English Patient as the book seemed to revolve around &quot;his&quot; story. Somehow I did not pity him though. He made the mistake of loving another man's wife. His punishment was dying, helpless and alone with her inside his mind's eye. Katherine, easily dismissed and important in that her being caused The English Patient to begin his journey towards his fate. Hana seemed the most human. She was so strong but determined in a strange way to live with a dying man and ease his pain. Kip was Asian and had a code of honor which the author tried to show us in fragments. He was a mystery. But that is what the author wanted, I believe. The torture victim Caravaggio was interesting. In fact, each character was a victim of torture - either the sad result at another's hands or self-inflicted which can be the most miserable. This is a story that will linger with you long after you have put the book away."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book reads like fine poetry. Yet, it still retains the necessary form that stiches together the memories of a dying man into the tragic story of forbidden love and the triumph of the spirit over a withering body. The story lazily follows the stories of several remarkable people before, during, and after World War II. Hanna is a young nurse who is embittered by a terrible war and finds sanctuary in the care of a mysterious war victim, who by a random occurance gains the title of the English Patient. By his side are Kip, an Indian bomb dismantler, and Caravaggio, a Canadian thief, both suffering from wounds on the exterior and interior. In the midst of their temporary home in an Italian villa floats their stories, each marked by extraordinary traits. As the English Patient drifts between their world and his own, each tendril of story slowly completes the complicated weave that Ondaatje has created. This book is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read. I most strongly recommend it to anyone who wishes to experience, instead of read, a book."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"While I count the movie as one of my favourites, I found the book The English Patient to be incoherent, too loosely drawn with some of the densest prose this side of Heart Of Darkness! Gossamer images clog the narrative leaving the reader with an impression of holding a cobweb - one is left reading nothing but air! Like A Room With A View, the movie is better than the book, and the soundtrack is worth buying as well."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"While acknowledging that the prose is flowery, I much prefer direct novels with something to say. The film made some sense of it all. If you liked this book, you will like Possession, another Booker Prize winner. I say the co-winner of the Booker for this particular year was much better."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Our Colorado Springs book group read this. Overall, we would not recommend it to anyone as a good read. Unfortunately, it was our first selection, because it did not start us off with a bang or much enthusiasm. Two of us could not even finish it and the rest of us found it to be trite, ponderous and a chore to read. The story line did not begin to get interesting until the mid-way point of the book. We felt that was a lot of work to ask of the reader. We all wondered what the raves were all about for this book and its screen play adaptation. If it is supposed to be a great love story, then we all missed it. The story line of the English patient's desert exploration and possible war time spy connection was more interesting than his affair with Katherine. Likewise, so was Caravaggio's war time life. Hana and Kip seemed to be nothing but shadow characters which was disappointing, especially, since the story starts off with Hana and leads you to believe that her life will be the focus of the story"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Set at the end of World War II in an Italian villa, The English Patient brings together four unlikely characters: Hana, an emotionally-wounded army nurse who refuses to leave her last patient even when ordered to evacuate; Caravaggio, a friend of Hana's father, thief and spy, a man who is drawn to Hana in ways he cannot articulate; Kip, an Indian sapper loyal to the British military who disarms bombs by day, loves Hana by night; and the mysterious burned invalid, the English patient of the title, who unites them all in unexpected ways. Told in poetic, often elliptical language, this novel demands to be savored instead of read voraciously. The images are just as likely to be visually precise as they are inexplicable. Unlike the movie, which concentrates on the love story between the English patient and the woman he loved, the novel is more about the confusing impulses that lead to both passion and danger in all the characters.Serious readers of literature should read this novel more than once, for its subtleties, imagery, and the force of its lyricism. More casual readers may find it tough reading, not because the language is inaccessible but because of the way Ondaatje backs into his story. Those who stick with the author's poetic turns will be well-rewarded by the end."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"There was a time, not too long ago, when you could sit in a cafe and hear the words The English Patient within the half hour, either that or see someone with their head ducked into the pages of the book between slurps of coffee. Of course this popularity made me wary of the book and the movie and I formed ready stereotypes and turned my attention elsewhere. Then the paperback copies of the book started to come out with the actors faces on it, and I have vowed never to by a book that brandishes its connection to the movie version of the story - call me a grumpy old man, but it seems that the book was the book before it was the movie and I'd much rather form my own visual and dramatic accompaniment to the text without seeing the face of some actor. (Disclaimer: I might love the movie if I actually saw it, but that's not the point!)And yet, poetic justice prevails. On a slow winter morning at my coffee shop, I looked warily over at a copy of The English Patient that someone had left on the shelf months ago. In fact, I didn't even think that I was picking up \\"The English Patient\\", and instead looked to the merits of the book's fine author Michael Ondaatje. I thought of Anil's Ghost, which I enjoyed, and Coming through Slaughter, and thought it might do me good to start off my day with a glance at the inspired prose of a great writer. Later, I would read about Hana reading to the English patient: \\"When she begins a book she enters through stilted doorwas into large courtyards. Parma and Paris and India spread their carpets.\\" In the first paragraph of this book, we enter into The Villa, following Hana into the room where the English patient lies. \\"She turns into the room which is another garden - this one made up of trees and bowers painted over its walls and ceiling. The man lies on the bed, his body exposed to the breeze, and he turns his head slowly towards her as she enters...\\" We are introduced to a relationship, and through the relationship, to a place, and through the place, to a war, and through the war, to the strange lurches of a civilization in a time of great change and to individuals trying to situate themselves amidst the absurdly ordered chaos of it all. Once you fall under the spell of the story, you are left to dream, and to be changed forever by the experience."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"\\"The English Patient\\" is, without a doubt, one of my very favorite books. It is lush, beautiful and gorgeous. And the glory of it is that it got that way with fine, first-rate writing. You won't find any gimmicks or ... tricks here.Unlike the movie, the book begins in war-torn Italy (1944) where we encounter Hana, a Canadian nurse and a horribly burned man known only as, \\"the English patient.\\" Alone in an isolated, abandoned convent, Hana stays behind when her friends move on to care for the dying English patient. Hana is a rare individual and truly caring. She spends her days reading to the English patient from the volume of Herodotus that was found with him and, when his pain becomes too great, she injects him with morphine.Hana and the English patient aren't alone long, however. A mysterious man named Caravaggio soon arrives and it becomes clear that he has an agenda all his own. Nevertheless, it is Caravaggio who succeeds with the English patient where others have failed. This trio is soon joined by a Sikh named Kip, a man who will play a role in Hana's life, just as she will play a role in his.Eventually, of course, we learn all about the English patient, who really isn't English at all, but a Hungarian count named, Almasy. We learn where he's been and why and how he came to be so horribly burned. We learn about the great love of his life, a love that sadly, was doomed from the very start.This is a book that is told on two levels and contains two love stories. One takes place in the past and the other takes place in the present. While Hana's story is told in the present tense, it is not as involving or as intense as is the love story involving Almasy that takes place in the past. I think this is because Hana and her lover are not as fully-realized as are Almasy and his lover, though Hana is by far the most sympathetic character in the book.The character of Caravaggio is as mysterious as is the English patient. We do learn about him, however, and about his mysterious connection to Almasy. The stories of Hana and Caravaggio are heartbreaking and heartbreakingly beautiful.\\"The English Patient\\" is a quiet love story, one told without the necessity of melodrama or \\"fireworks.\\" However, it is one that cuts deep, and one that any reader will remember long after the book is finished. This is a story that simply rings with universal chords...of love, of loss, of sadness, of betrayal.If I have one quibble with this book, it is with the denouement. I didn't really want to know what happened to some of the characters in the distant future. I wanted Ondaatje to leave a little for my imagination. But he didn't and that's his choice. It certainly didn't ruin the book for me.The writing in \\"The English Patient\\" is lyrical and beautiful, though spare. Ondaatje is first and foremost a poet, and it shows. This is a book that flows, that cascades, that washes over you with its words.I first read \\"The English Patient\\" years ago and I haven't forgotten a single detail. \\"The English Patient\\" is a book that captures your heart and never lets go. It is a book that will haunt you with its beauty and with its sadness for many years to come, perhaps even for the rest of your life. Yes, it's that good."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient written by Michael OndaatjeMichael Ondaatje's stunning novel takes place as the Second World War is ending. The author creates four unforgettable characters and brings them together in an abandoned and damaged Italian villa as the war retreats around them. It is their lives and memories that \\"The English Patient\\" follows and explores.Hana is a young Canadian nurse and her late father's friend, Caravaggio, is a professional thief and Allied spy who was brutally maimed during the war. Kip, a Sikh &quot;sapper&quot;, lives on the edge of death in the fields of bomb disposal.And the central force around which the action spins is the mysterious title character - the English Patient, the nameless, burnt victim who lies in an upstairs room and whose memories of passion, betrayal, and rescue illuminates the book.They are all fascinated by this dying man, burnt beyond recognition and who refuses to unveil his name or country of origin. His story, set in the deserts of North Africa, unfolds through a series of flashbacks taking place in the abandoned villa. Through the rest of the novel, Hana, Caravaggio and Kip try to discover his true identity while he tells them stories of his past.\\"The English Patient\\" is fabulous. It is all very poetic, the plot, the descriptions. It transforms your view of the world, turning it into a glorious, magical place that does not exist or does it? The author I read on the inside of the cover was first a poet and then became a novelist. And this novel is filled with page upon page of poetry, though it is written in novel form. \\"The English Patient\\" is perhaps the most beautiful novel I have ever read.When I started to read the book I was a bit surprised that it was written in a third person. But later I discovered that the third person narrative voice make some kind of justice to all the characters.Though I have to admit that it was not a very easy book to read. The author's language is lyrical and beautiful, but it requires an investment of energy from the reader especially from one whose mother tongue is not English. Sometimes the lyrical language like steels away your breath so that it becomes hard to follow the plot.I strongly want to recommend this book and then trust me and take as long as you can to finish it. Discover every single phrase of it because it is worth it.I want to end this book report with a sentence from the book. \\"That night I fell in love with a voice. Only a voice. I wanted to hear nothing more.\\" This breathtaking sentence really hit me and stayed with me for several days."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The cover copy of my version of &quot;The English Patient&quot; indicates that the book within is &quot;A rare and spellbinding web of dreams.&quot; Even though I'm not sure what that means, strangely, I agree. Ondaatje's language is lyrical enough to transport one to his dream world, a world of half-glimpsed comprehension, passion and sensuality. His descriptions of the world he has created are certainly dream-like; when the English Patient first emerges from the wrecked plane, he is afire, his headed sporting &quot;antlers of flame&quot;. From that moment, I belonged to Ondaatje.Narrative is an important part of a novel. But if you like yours linear, you will be disappointed here. &quot;The English Patient&quot; flashes backwards and back to the present, rarely giving one warning or even a way to tell where we are, chronologically. It is a quilt of a book, much like the patient's copy of Herodotus' &quot;The Histories&quot;, which has been woven from the original text and additional maps, notes &amp; drawings. It is at once what it appears to be and something different, something organic, alive and changing with us as we read it.Most of the characters are fascinating. Caravaggio, the thumbless thief, who, naked, once stole a photograph of himself from the woman who took it. Kip, the Sikh &quot;sapper&quot;, or demolitions expert, who spends his days communing with the bombs that surround their villa. Hana, the nurse, who finds solace and support in books, to the point of rebuilding a portion of the staircase by nailing heavy books in place (If that isn't an incredible metaphor, I don't know what is).Then there is the patient himself, burnt black, quietly awaiting death and reflecting on its nature. For much of the novel, we don't know who he is, except a reminder of death and betrayal. This is barely his story at all; he is merely a catalyst. Without him, we have the idea that the other three would never have come together,would never have discovered their identities.For that's what this book is, an examination of the nature of identity. Who are we, when the lights are out? Is it only the presence of other people that makes us who we are? Michael Ondaatje isn't telling, rather, he leaves it up to us."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"If I can give one bit of advice (which alas is utterly too late) it would be: read the book before you see the movie. I believe you will get so much more out of it. I do not believe I liked this book as much as I could have because I went into it with such impossibly high expectations. The English Patient is one of my all time favorite movies and I have seen it several times.I bought the book about the same time the movie came out (late 1996) but never read it. I finally picked it up during this year's flu season... and expected to be carried right into the same story that I loved so well.It is very very difficult to shake the images you have been given by a movie. I believe I would have enjoyed the book much more had I been able to draw pictures with my own imagination first while reading this book, then later filled out the picture with the movie. Who knows, perhaps I would not have been as enamored with the movie then, although I doubt it - the English Patient as a movie was truly visual poetry."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"It's hard to believe Ondaatje wasn't inspired, above all else, by \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" especially in his characterization of a Katherine and Almasy whose obsession with love as possession is a latter-day equivalent of the undifferentiated passion of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff. And Ondaatje's related but contrasting pair of lovers, Hana and Kip, appear to occupy a place comparable with Bronte's Cathy Linton and Hareton, whose recognition of each other's separateness at least holds forth the promise of a relationship between two individuals.But Ondaatje surprises us. His Kip and Hana finally retreat to the boundaries of nationality, race, and past traditions, reclaiming for themselves as much identity as such markers are capable of offering. In \\"The English Patient\\" Almasy plays both the roles of Heathcliff and Hareton. It is the latter who is redeemed from the primitive through the books Cathy finally shares with him, teaching him to separate himself from the primeval natural principle and to love. Almasy learns much the same from his Kathy, who shows him the true meaning of Herodotus, of history, of words themselves. He learns he cannot remain a free agent, avoiding responsibility and \\"ownership,\\" because without incurring debts to another person, agency is pointless and freedom is an illusion. Almasy must lose his fabricated identity--symbolized by the \\"features,\\" or mere markers, of history, the desert, and the physical body--in order to gain his soul, which turns out to be Kathy.When Almasy makes good on his promise and returns to the cave, the necrophilia scene (as subtle as any in all literature--compare its obvious counterpart in \\"Wuthering Heights\\") is an electric and electrifying intercourse of tongues, an exchange of lying words for a shared language. Kathy's sacrifice in taking into herself the old words of Almasy is her answer to his own sacrifice, an exorcism of the qualified, secretive language Almasy had formerly insisted on calling love. With that act Almasy is transformed from \\"demon lover\\" to lover, from a desert nomad and recorder of landmarks to co-author of and mutual participant in a new \\"text,\\" an authentic discourse of love between two independent people who ultimately relate as one.To those who distrust the story's representations of history, remember that the story itself questions all such representations. Which is not to say it's a \\"romance.\\" It's a love story--above all, a love \\"history,\\" and as such it rings as true as any history since Emily Bronte's."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I admit it. It took me quite a long time to finally purchase the book, due to the fact that it just sounded too depressing for even my dark soul to stomach. When I finally did read it, in 1993, I not only loved it with every fiber of my being, but also found myself drawing bits of the sentiments expressed about love, such as &quot;seas move away, why not lovers?&quot;. In short, the novel has been more than just a story, but instead has served as a bible, or at least as a substitute for Prozac. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to attend a lcecture given by Michael Ondaatje at the University of Texas at Austin in 1995, and when I joined the throng to have my paperback copy signed (the edition with the beautiful Beaton photo) Ondaatje took a disdainful look at my raggedly book, &amp; asked me what the hell I had done with it. I was forced to admit that I read it in the shower &amp; the bath. I also asked him a question regarding the word &quot;felhommny&quot! ; or the dusk of graves. He was as enigmatic in his answer as the passage is in the story. I think the novel has a great deal to teach individuals coping with the realities of a post-modern world: our survival as a PLANET depends on our sucess in being able to transcend nationalities/ethnic identity( and by this I do not mean that people should not be free to express/live their cultures) and in our ability to make the most of the present. The movie was inadequate in that it ignored Kip's significance as the moral center of the novel, and also for the fact that it could not resist simplifying the war into what Americans can understand easily: the good guys (i.e. Americans) against the evil German (Nazi's: not that they weren't abhorently evil, that is a fact beyond dispute). But the end of the novel is a strong statement about what the browm and black people of this planet have faced since WWII."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I'm only 13 years old, and I love this book. I couldn't put it down. It just draws you in, forcing you to read more. I can't get enough of it. I can't believe there are people that actually hate this book. It's not hard to read (as some people said) and very interesting. Some people who wrote the reviews for this book said that a younger person couldn't understand or relate to this book. If I can, then any kid my age could."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I made it halfway through this book before giving up on it. As an avid reader, I seldom put a book down. I just couldn't find anything to compel me to finish this one. At the mid-point, I still felt that the characters were being introduced - endlessly. In a character study, I expect to know something about what is going on in the heads of the characters, but aside from brief flashbacks inserted randomly into the text, you are told nothing about what is in the characters minds. Occasionally, they are said to look mournful, or pensive, etc, but however picturesque the descriptions are, they are no substitute for mental activity or plot. If the author's intention was to paint an outside portrait of the survivors of a war, that was accomplished. There is a strange other-worldly disconnected feel to the characters. You can feel their isolation from world; but it makes for a one-note read. There is a patina of unreality to their world that reads almost like a fairy tale - but one where nothing happens. The characters seem to be stuck in an amber of PTSD. Most of the book to the halfway point was just very nicely written descriptions of their day to day life. How they bathed, what they ate, which room they slept in, etc. Basically, this book was like watching a silent drama. You could see what they were doing, and what they were remembering, but there was no significant action going on, and no way to get in their heads. It was kind of like trying to do psychoanalysis on a picture."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is one strange story. The English patient is being cared for by anurse in a broken down villa in the hills of Italy in 1944 or 1945. The war has passed by here and is being fought further on.. You become familiar with those two and their history, then a family friend of the nurse hears of her and comes to stay. A bomb disposal expert, a sapper, comes for the beauty of the churches he has seen and wanted to show to his friend.The story is told as if from a distance. You are not really intimate with the characters. You do get to know all about them, but you just do not feel like you are being told everything. It may be the back and forth from one character to another, from here and now (1945) to the past of one or the other person that makes for the distance you feel.An odd point is the love of one for the others. They each love each other for different reasons. They are each working through their own hecks created by the war. In the end they have all worked out their shell shock, except the sapper: he has found a new, permanent heck that no one can help him get away from. They end going their own ways, but you get the feeling that they will always carry within themselves a bit of each other."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Few books are felt as much as read, but \\"The English Patient\\" falls into this category. Like the film, it is hauntingly beautiful, but for different reasons. The story of people haunted by love and war, their damaged souls converging at a villa in Italy, remains, but the focus and method in which the story is told on paper is spellbinding and stunning.The passages are like water moving to and fro over rocks, shifting back and forth in time so that the beauty beneath can still be seen, but as a shimmering mirage in the desert. It is a strange instance where it is almost recommended that you see the film first in order to see more clearly in your mind the characters as their stories unfold.Whereas the film focused more on the burned Almasy and his memories of the unending African desert, where he would meet the enigmatic and beautiful Katherine Clifton, sealing the fate which would leave him a charred and hollow shell of his former self, Hanah is the centerpoint of Ondaatje's lovely poetic prose in the novel. You can almost feel the ghosts hovering over each character as Ondaatje paints a masterpiece with words.Deeply romantic and lyrical, it is the same story, but a more impressionistic and less linear portrait of love and loss. The book is like a delicate flower just beneath the waters, its beauty evident but achingly kept just out of reach. The film brought the flower into the sun so we could enjoy its texture and fragrance in a more real fashion. Both are magnificent, just a different picture of the same flower.If you love the film, you must read the book. It is a hauntingly beautiful novel different from anything else you'll ever read. A masterwork of rich and evocative prose that will touch the heart, an organ of fire."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book was given to me on an airplane and I read it because I had nothing else to read. I had seen the movie and thought it was OK. The book however, I absolutly loved. The movie focused primarily on the English Patient, but the book was different in that you got to know each character quite intimately. They all were in the house for different reasons and each of them had very unique and intrieging backgrounds. I was sucked in immediately. Each charachter is developed and you are able to understand who they are and why. All of their strengths and weaknesses are revealed and they are quite vulnerable. If you are someone who likes to bond with a characters and watch them develop, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I have been meaning to write a review for The English Patient, a semi-sequel to In the Skin of a Lion. I've been reluctant to do so because these two are very much alike with regards to style and characters. The two characters from In the Skin of a Lion, Hana and Carravagio, are also found in The English Patient. As always, it's always hard to accept that a sequel of a novel you love so much is as good as, and possibly better, than the original novel. My mistake here is to think of these two novels as interconnected for The English Patient stands beautifully on its own.Here we have traumatised characters emerging from the war. Hana is a young nurse who has chosen to stay behind in an abandoned Italian villa to care for a nameless and burnt English patient. She has chosen to retreat from the world to serve an almost sanctified patient in order to forget her past - the loss of an unborn child, a lover, and her beloved father (Patrick). The patient Almasy's story begins prewar in a fractured narrative. His story involves a tragic love affair with the desert and a woman (Katherine). Then there is Caravaggio - the thief, a spy, an old friend of Hana's father, who has lost his nerve due to the brutality of the war, who finds refuge in Hana's dilapidated villa. The novel however, is more about theme and character than plot.Ondaatje has mined these characters beautifully. He has managed to reveal to us that a life is like a landscape - it can be mapped, explored, and very much loved, but it can remain as much a mystery as when you first discovered it. The curvature and beauty of the desert becomes a symbol for a woman's body and the painting of a Queen becomes meditative relief for a traumatised Sikh during the war. In this manner, Ondaatje reveals to us the complexity and richness of a life.It is also a treaty on grief, loss, nationhood and isolation. All the main characters that populate this novel are outsiders in search of some sense of belonging - Hana is stricken by tragedies and displaced from her homeland Canada; the patient found solitude in the desert; Katherine, a young wife who finds herself among foreigners and men; Kip is a Sikh; Caravaggio - our thief. Their discovery of each other and the change in their inner lives parallels the realignment and disappearance of national borders. To each other, they surrender a little bit of their territory by sharing a journey of recovery, and their individual stories.I will not deny that this novel can be difficult to read and I am not surprise that many people have found the prose too difficult to grasp. That is reasonable because the cross-cutting of Ondaatje's narrative, his particular style, and the themes he explores do not make for an easy or even entertaining novel.This novel however, is undeniably one of the best - if not the best - I have ever read. Ondaatje possesses the kind of mind that feeds on poetry, that finds the profound in the ordinary. His ability to explore themes through the subtle use of symbols, allegorical examples, and language places him in a league all of his own. For me, his novels are landscapes and a way of seeing the world that you wish to carry with you always. I hope that the reader who picks up The English Patient will cherish and love this novel as much as I do."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Director Minghella may have had a lot to thank Ondaatje's writing for the inspired technical brilliance of the movie version of \\"The English Patient\\". One realizes this after reading the book.Over the last one year, the book has become a constant in my life. Not only do I recommend this highly to everyone I know, I have read sections of it to people on occassion. Sometimes over the phone... long distance. Perhaps this will give you some idea about the savoury old-wine sensuality of Ondaatje's words. Just read how he describes words -- like Zerzurra, or even, Libya..It is a simple enough story of four wounded lives coming together in a war-torn Italian village for some days. They relive a little of their past, mingle their pain and desolation, heal what little they can, and finally, part ways. And yet, how exquisite the story telling -- with the lightest touch, how subtle the art!The deserts of Ondaatje's Africa is a sea of sand without borders, that even while rife with politics, holds its timeless secrets close to the heart and remains utterly inaccessible. It's a lost world that he writes about - and this is a book about loss. The count Almasy (who was cursed with the wrong name) summarises it best when he says to the thief Caravaggio (of the missing thumbs), \\"Everything I have ever loved or valued has been taken away from me\\"."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"While the English Patient explores a panoramic story line - covering the deserts and bazaars, the ravages of World War II on two continents, the languid days and haunted nights - the real depth of this story are the love stories. The enigmatic Hungarian aristocrat Almasy and his immorata Katherine, a married English Ice Queen; the fragile and damaged nurse Hana and the shy reserved Indian army engineer Kip; Caravaggio the damaged thief and his love for women in general. Their tokens of affection, their whispered tributes, what they are willing to do and willing to forgo for their love - this is the true beauty of this book. This is a romance, but a grown up, beautiful romance that is delivered with some of the most haunting and evocative style in modern literature. If you are looking for story about love that avoids the graphic and the self-indulgent, the vulgar and the tacky, and instead inspires you with romance in the tradition of Tristan and Isolde alongside the pleasure of everyday treasures, please read this book, it is pure rapture."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I will endeavor to keep this review as brief as possible:I have not read that many books, to be honest with you; but Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; is the most enjoyable of all the ones that I have read.Ondaatje's style is unique and one can see that this is a poet at work; the breadth of his vocabulary is immense and his extravagant use of poetic devices make the book a work of art. Suffice it to say that I have never read a novel which incorporates so much of the literary scope into one product: this is not just a novel; it's poetry and art as well.The only thing I did not like about this book is that, at times it can go off topic a bit and become quite drab- but this is the exception rather than the rule, and the novel as a whole is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book could have been so much better. Ondaajte is a master of the written word, but things seemed to get confused and the ending was very bland. Amazing writing, bad planning."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is a beautifully written book full of sadness and survival. However, I recommend reading In The Skin Of A Lion first, because it introduces the reader to two main characters Hana and Caravaggio. Ondaajates descriptions of places and emotions stay with you like a lingering dream in which the details sometimes fill you with saddness, incomperhensable beauty, and stark ugliness. I don't want to give away too many details one should read the book for themselves. My only other suggestion is NOT to see the movie. The movie unnecessarily changes the relationship between Caravaggio and Hana and simply does not do the book any justice at all."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I loved this book and think that it's probably one of the best I've ever read. It's engrossing and the characters are beautifull portrayed and not superficial like many popular characters. As seniors in high school, myself and two friends found ourselves completely in this book. It's brilliant, the story of Katherine and the patient, Hana and Kip, and Carravaggio! This is one of the finest pieces of literature ever written!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I think a better title for the book should have been &quot;Kip-the wary sapper.&quot; Ondaatje only devotes, at most, three chapters to the English Patient. The rest of the book is devoted to Kip, the bomb sapper. I honestly thought that the book would be about the title, but I was wrong. Although the book was written well, I was disappointed in it. I wanted to know more about the English Patient and his journey's through the desert. I would only recommed this book to others after informing them that it is about mainly about Kip."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"There are no more words to add to the depths reached by this novel. Afterwards, one can only reflect on how one lives . . . and then to try to live more deeply."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The best romance book for all seasons, especially if you are visiting or living in An Arabic country with desert, the words chosen are passion heated, the description and details real and if you can listen to the soundtrack when reading, it will be graved into your heart!"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"i had a good experience ordering this book. it was in good shape,cheap,and shipped quickly."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"The English Patient is like a present under the Christmas tree. It is beautiful at the start, and fills you with anticipation, awaiting what is to come. It is a many layered story. Hana, the nurse and the nameless English Patient inhabit a villa north of Florence, Italy near the end of World War 2. Soon, two new characters, Caravaggio a thief and Kip, a sapper are introduced to the plotline. As they all live their lives at the villa, Ondaatje feeds us snippets of their pasts and how they came to the villa. The novel is well-written, and easy to get into. It is an experience I won't soon forget."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I have read The English Patient over and over again almost compulsively. I have also watched the movie several times. Each time I read or watch the English Patient I discover something new and am usually stunned by its poetic brilliance. The English Patient should be read like a piece of poetry. The language is gorgeous and the author manages to make the two relationships in the novel romantic without being trite or cliched. Reality seems to pale in comparison to the mysterious evocation of the atmosphere in the novel. Real life seems drab compared to the the lives of those in the novel."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Beautiful English. It is really a classic novel and will be remembered by the future generations."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"When a young nurse and a maimed thief from Canada, a bomb sapper from India and a half dead man from the Libyan desert --probably a Hungarian-- gathered in a villa in Tuscany, Italy, it was not due to a joke of geography. It was mostly the cruelty of a war of nations, whose heads of state wanted to change the border lines among nations. That was the beginning of the memories by a man who mapped the desert and learnt to hate nations. Although desert-wise he had put the heart into the wrong place. Eventually he lost his identity and was told us as &quot;The English Patient&quot; by Michael Ondaatje's namesake novel (1992). If not the geography let's respect at least the men who made and loved it!

This is one of the best books I have had the pleasure of reading. I laid aside the &quot;Who done its&quot; as I could not put it down. I usually read several books at a time. It appears the author was indeed in these places at these times. I could feel with the subjects. I highly recommend it to those who love literature as well as good detective stories. Thank you. HJS Clark"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I haven't read anything better. To dwell on the historical inaccuracies is to miss the point (I'm something of an amateur military historian, but I was enjoying everything too much to let them ruffle my feathers). The writing is beautiful, lyrical and evocative. I spent several months reading and re-reading it, enjoying the imagry and the characters. The only problem is the ending, which is both abrupt and seemingly somewhat at odds with the rest of the narrative. Kip is a relatively minor character for most of the novel, and it is a mistake to center the ending on him. Fortunately the movie, which is excellent, avoids this faux pas. That aside, I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This book feels much like a dream, with bits and pieces of its various storylines falling into place over the length of the novel. The language is lovely, though frequently pretentious. It is full of contemplative observations and philosophical meanderings, along with the bits and pieces of the several plots. This is sometimes overdone. But the book nonetheless sets a beautifully dreamy atmosphere for the reader. I was not surprised to see criticism on the factual aspects of the book; the youth of the nurse, and several other bits and pieces of the novel struck me as rather &quot;off&quot;. However, the human drama of the stories still holds merit."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"What can i say? This book is like reading the most beautiful poem you can imagine. The English Patient transports you into different worlds- let's you experience feelings and sensations that would be impossible to find on your own. You will never look at things the same after you read this. It's plot is one of mystery, passion and life."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"This is an incredible book. I won't describe the storyline because you'll hear that a million times in other reviews. What I will say however is that this is one incredible book, so full of beauty and foreboding that it will crumple the strongest of hearts. Somewhat overpowering imagery coincides with subtle, yet passionate character development to create a book extremely worthy of the booker prize and any other awards there are. A classic of literature, to be savored again and again."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"A strong and personal voice is all that can be asked of an author but it is rarely delivered. Ondaatje suceeds by weaving a lyrical novel in the traditions of Homer that merges modernism with classicism. One can only hope that those readers who read this book only because they enjoyed the movie (or were impressed by the number of awards it received) and were disappointed will be pleasantly suprised by the resonance of Ondaatje's images and prose that may come to haunt them when they return to more mainstream stylists. This is a book for readers who acknowledge the words they read but also a book that will seduce many who usually forge through sentences looking for the plot."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"For those of you who wonder why it is called The English Patient, I am wondering if you have ever taken the time to think about the novel. For example, perhaps it is thus called because Almasy is what links all three characters. Without him, or his past, Hana, Kip and Carvaggio would have no reason to be in that place together, and some of the central themes would be irrelevant. This is a beautifully woven book, and requires more than a simple read through, but even a simple read through is probably rewarding."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"drawn into the souls of the four discarded victims of war, my heart ached for every one. the author is a master of his craft. looking forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"the english patient is my favorite book for a million reasons. the writing is amazing. if you're looking to read quality writing, this is it. the book is so original in its style that it had me mesmerized. the third person narrative voice does justice to all the characters and the narrative voice of almasy creates haunting beauty on the page. this is a book with a complex story, incredible, three dimensional characters, and writing that is the best that i have ever read. the spiritual nuances are phenomenal. this is a book i have read time and time again and it touches me on a mental, emotional, and spiritual level. there are a few books that help complete a person. this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Savor every single phrase.

I decided to read a novel by Michael Ondaatje, if I may add, a genius. I read the book in four days. It was a beautiful book that captivated me in thinking why we fight wars. The movie, which I saw immediately after, was much different and to tell the truth, I enjoyed the book more since there is a difference between what your imagination thinks and what Hollywood makes it to be. It is no wonder Ondaatje won the Booker prize and the movie won so many awards. From a teenage point of view, it is a magnificent book to read and romantic if you wish to watch it on the tube."},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"Reading this book is like travelling not only time, but space. The author takes you on a journey that defines the true meaning of what life really is. The book simply allows you to fly with each passing word and whim. The book has been interpreted successfully in the movie. The sights, sounds, and the events are so realistically described. Reading it was more of an art and that makes you question how it was written. The English Patient joins all the other characters together and through it all it's his presence that guides them through all the events going through their mind. This is a wonderful book, with amazing literary value. It touches more than anyone thought it could. It even does more than that. It makes you dream"},{"Title":"The English Patient","review":"I had to read this book twice. The first time I tried to readit as a novel, without serious thought. This was not the way toread this book. The author weaves his story with a slow anddeliberate web encircling the characters and drawing themtogether. Events in their lives are told from one angle andimmediately repeated from another to give the reader a morecomplete understanding of the story and the impact eachcharacter has on the other. The second time I read the bookslowly, savoring each character and the place each fit intothe others life. It is a book about love, levels of love, the loves of one'slife. Complex love stories: of Hanna and the love of a nurse for apatient, the love she and Kip share, as two who have loved andlost over and over again. Of the English patient and Kathrine,two people thrown together, finding each other during the most difficultof times. Of Carraviago and his relationship with all threecharacters, Hanna, Kip and the English patient, all a caringrelationship on different levels. I found myself constantly thinking ofthis story.

Bukowski and Ondaatje are two authors who reside on different ends of the spectrum as _English_Patient_ is anything but abrasive and blunt: Ondaatje imbued this book with a bunch of subtleties, well worth a second, third reading to capture the emotion just like Copland's &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; required a second listening in order to catch the the essence of the mountain range described by the musical piece.

I decided to read this book after noticing the inclusion of an article by Noam Chomsky; given the fact that Chomsky is exceedingly anti-America and anti-Israel, I felt compelled to know just what this book (and others like it) might be teaching our children. I found a number of good things in these pages, but I also noticed several problems (including a small but significant bias toward the liberal viewpoint).I would have thought it needless to say that this book does not feature arguments for and against terrorism; unfortunately, Chomsky's typical screed is all but pro-terrorist and, much to my surprise, the book actually contains one essay that originates with Hamas itself. I have no problem with essays seeking to explain or even defend Hamas, but I personally don't think propaganda taken directly from a terrorist organization belongs anywhere near this book - especially when there is no counter-balancing article or essay reflecting the views of the Israeli or American governments.Most of the issues are addressed in pairs and set the framework for honest debate, but a couple of articles stand alone in their argument, which I have to chalk up as a negative. The book begins by posing a seemingly nonsensical question, namely whether terrorism is an actual threat. Paul Bremer and John Ashcroft do a good job encapsulating the seriousness of the threat, while other contributors argue that the threat has been exaggerated. (Chomsky, of course, contends that the U.S. and Israel are the only two terrorist groups or nations in the entire world.) The debate then turns to the origins of terrorism: whether Islam itself, economic conditions, and/or the Israel-Palestine situation encourage terrorism. The next item on the agenda is America's proper response to terrorism, which gives us pro and con articles on the Patriot Act (which is never given an adequate description), racial profiling, and immigration restrictions. Finally, the proper response of the international community to terrorism is addressed, with contributors arguing the merits of UN leadership, military action, and the brokering of a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.For the most part, Terrorism: Opposing Viewpoints can serve as a decent starting point for youngsters coming to terms with the threat of terrorism or those who wish to get a better feel for the debate - but only in conjunction with other sources of information. Each article is rather short (3 to 8 pages or so), so there is not a great deal of detail included. I see a major weakness here, as what you get is debate in the absence of the basic facts you need to know about the issues. I do believe there is a discernible amount of liberal bias overall in the selections chosen by the editor, as well (particularly in terms of the views expressed about Israel). As a result, I cannot really recommend this book in good conscience, especially to young people, unless it is complemented by other sources of information and debate."},{"Title":"Miss Tibbett's Typewriter (Weekly Reader Books)","review":"This fun little book taught me to type, and now my daughter is enjoying it.

Beverly Huber Albanese and I wrote this book. We were Chronic Care Medicaid co-workers for the Ontario County Department of Social Services in New York State. We received hundreds of calls from families, Elder Law Attorneys, CPA's, Hospital Medicaid Liasons, Nursing Home Admissions, and advocates. All callers had questions about Medicaid for Nursing Home Payment. We decided to write a book that would answer those questions. Our book is a step-by-step guide designed to lead you every step of the way through the Medicaid process. We worked very hard to make sure the book was not written as a technical guide from the Medicaid Examiners point of view. It speaks specifically to the patient and their families in understandable terms. It details how to begin, who to call, and how to complete the Medicaid application. The book has an index, appendices for the State Long Term Care Ombudsmen, the State Office for the Aging contacts, and each states County Medicaid Offices.This is a print on demand book.

From the Young Turks and their influences to the rise of Bashir Al-Assad, late dictator of Syria, Be'eri charts the progression of the myriad coups that occured, as well as the changing aims as stated by the officers involved. The relationship between the army and the government in any third-world country is a crucial aspect to be studied, but even more so in this region. Countries covered in depth include Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Jordan. The only difficulty is in the sometimes interminably dry iteration of information, but for a translated work it is far better than it could have been. The author had access to works in several languages, and portrays a complete picture of an often contradictory maze of statements, retractions, and diplomacy. Of immeasurable help to anyone who seeks to truly understand the changing dynamics of Arab leadership in the twentieth century, and Middle East politics in general."},{"Title":"Korean cooking (Golden cooking card book)","review":"Vary good cooking book,Easy to use."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"I stumbled across this graphic novel in a used bookstore, not having any idea the impression it would make on me. This is an incredibly powerful story, very effectively told through the medium of comic art. It is an affirmation of the power of visual media, and an example of how comics can be used for much more than funnies and fantasies. It is also probably the most effective anti-nuclear material I have ever come across."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"Barefoot Gen: The Day After is volume two of a four part series. It tells the story of the day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima as seen through the eyes of seven year old Gen Nakaoka. Based on the real-life experiences of the author, Gen, his mother, and his newborn sister face the horrors of the day after the bomb. They have no food or shelter and are surrounded by the dead and dying. Even the soldiers sent in to gather and burn the dead bodies are succumbing to the radiation sickness and dying. No one understands what is happening and there is no one to turn to. Gen goes in search of food for his mother whose breast milk has dried up from malnutrition. Alone he faces the horror of the devastation and the destitution of the people of Hiroshima. This the hardest of the four books to read because the carnage of the day after the bomb is almost beyond belief. Gen's compassion, humanity, and determination makes this an inspiring book about the strength of the human spirit. Although the graphic scenes may turn some people off, this is still an important book for its message on the dangers of nuclear war.The work has been wonderfully translated from the Japanese original: Hadashi no Gen. It was originally published in serial form in 1972 and 1973 in Shukan Shonen Jampu, the largest weekly comic magazine in Japan, with a circulation of over two million. The drawings are all in black and white. This US edition was published as part of a movement to translate the book into other languages and spread its message. It is a wonderful testimony to the strength of the human spirit and the horrors of nuclear war. There are a few introductory essays at the front of the book that help to put this book into perspective. It is a powerful and tragic story that I highly recommend for anyone interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"Keiji Nakazawa, Barefoot Gen: The Day After (New Society, 1988)The story of Barefoot Gen, spunky atomic bomb survivor, continues in this second volume of the four-part series. It's not a stretch to predict that how you feel about The Day After will probably reflect how you felt about Barefoot Gen, without much variance.The Day After (which, in fact, covers the next two days) opens just after the end of Barefoot Gen, and is concerned entirely with the survival of Gen, his mother, and his baby sister Tomoko. Gen's task during this time is to find food for the family, and this quest takes him on a number of small side adventures the present a much larger picture of the greater Hiroshima area after the bomb than the first book provided of Hiroshima before the bomb. Gen meets a number of different people, helps some, and learns that even after the bomb, when everyone around him is shrouded in misery and horror, the banality and prejudice around him doesn't disappear-- in fact, people are worse than they were beforehand. Nakazawa, as is his wont, tells us all this in his stories, and never allows his messages to get in the way of his storytelling. Ironically, Barbara Reynolds' introduction to this edition is a perfect contrast to Nakazawa's story; it's awfully-written, ham-handed, flat-out wrong (Reynolds harps on about American denial of responsibility for Hiroshima, and she's writing ten years or more after the release, and vast popularity, of John Hersey's Hiroshima) polemic whose sole purpose in inclusion, it seems, is to highlight how subtle Nakazawa is. Skip the introduction. Or, if you're a completist, read the book first and come back to the introduction afterwards, so it won't taint you.This is very good stuff. Well worth your time. ***"},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"Barefoot Gen Volume Two picks up where volume one leaves Gen just after the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. It a gripping and very painful story of survival in the fist terrible time after the bomb devastated Hiroshima.

If you have read Volume One, you cannot skip this one, just as you have to read Volume three and four too."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"Just by glancing at its cover, Barefoot Gen appears to merely be a cheery Japanese comic book, or manga, as the medium is called in Japan. But the actual contents belie the surface of this exceptionally sad memoir. A story of the hard times war brings that culminates in the nuclear annihilation of Hiroshima, Barefoot Gen was written by an actual survivor of the bombing: Keiji Nakazawa.This true story of a little boy in wartime Japan presents a view of what life was like for Japanese civilians at the height of World War II. It shows in great detail (a picture is worth a thousand words, as the saying goes) the effect the war had on the Japanese: malnutrition, bombings of almost all cities, etcetera, while still keeping in mind that Japan was also guilty of war crimes. But the end of Barefoot Gen is a nightmarish vision of the worst war crime of all: the dropping of a weapon of mass destruction on a heavily populated, civilian town.The images of injured, haggard victims of the atom bomb moaning and weeping that are shown in this comic are terrible, but far more terrible still is the knowledge that this isn't fiction, it's a memoir. This really happened to women, babies, children and all other unsuspecting civilians. Although Barefoot Gen is not widely known, it is still arguably one of the best anti-war books on the subject, and highly recommended reading.

Vol 1 & Vol 2"},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"Volume 1 & 2 of Nakazawa's famous comic series about a boy called 'Gen' and his life in Hiroshima during the WWII and soon after the atomic bomb. The first two volumes of this series are probably the most important ones. After I read the first two volumes, I just had to lend them to everyone I knew. If you read this story, you'll realise how silly to hear some popular opiniton 'Dropping two atomic bombs in Japan was necessary to end the war'. Nakazawa says that each and every event is true. You'll see, for example, that two young brothers fight against each other for a little grain of rice. The bombs were dropped onto civilians in the middle of the two cities, and, in Hiroshima alone, 100,000 people, including western prisoners of war, were killed instantly, and the pain they suffered from afterwords was tremendous. The way some of Gen's family members, including a new born baby sister, were slowly dying is simply too sad to look at. But the reality is that it actually took place and was caused by human hands.I sincerely hope that many people will find an opportunity to read this book at least once in their life-time, and I strongly believe that this book will enlighten the whole world with its message: 'what really happens when a nuclear bomb is dropped onto humanity', which hasn't really been talked about in history books for some reason. But I think it's time to face reality."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"A masterful continuation to Volume 1. The power of Nakazawa's narrative and graphics translate the reader to the loss and inhumane torture wrought by the bomb dropped in Hiroshima. Like many stories from holocaust survivors, it is based on a deeply personal account of the horrors experienced by a group of people in a place closely resembling hell. The extent of the devastation is almost beyond the sane imagination, and the loss is more that may be borne. If it may be thus worded, the author elegantly pens his chronicle of unspeakable sadness, miraculous survival, terrible loss, and superhuman courage."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"The title is not of my making, but is the epitaph for this, the second installment in Keiji Nakazawa's personal story of the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. Volume 2 covers the immediate aftermath of the bombing, as survivors focus on disposing of the dead, caring for the wounded and seeking food and shelter. Gen, the book's young hero, encounters more than his share of gruesome sights - bloated corpses floating in rivers, burned remains of victims found in once-watery cisterns, radiation sickness and horrible deformities. Gen and his mother, grieving over their own losses, must scour the countryside for food for themselves and for Gen's newborn sister. But in an economy of bare sustenance, there is little room or pity for bombing victims looking for aid. Gen must use all his wits to beg, borrow or steal enough to stay alive. The legacy of the atomic bombing has begun. The bomb, which took a split second to detonate into a brilliant flash of terrible heat, now stalks its secondary victims with deliberation and ineluctability. \\"Barefoot Gen\\" chronicles real-life horror, far more horrible, grave and enduring than any science fiction."},{"Title":"Barefoot Gen","review":"The book's totally new and the price's low.

That's Cool!"},{"Title":"Rhetoric in Postmodern America: Conversations with Michael Calvin McGee","review":"Michael Calvin McGee died last month after one of those maddeningly cruel lengthy illnesses that prematurely forced him out of the classroom he so dearly loved. \\"Rhetoric in Postmodern America: Conversations with Michael Calvin McGee\\" is a cherished reminder of McGee as a mentor to those of us who studied under him at the University of Iowa and elsewhere, and an introduction to his approach to the study of rhetoric for the rest of the world. The conversations themselves are based on a series of seminars in which McGee developed with complex web of ideas. Those who studied with McGee will quickly find themselves in familiar territory as they read these five conversations (for me it was the Todd Willey anecdote about why English Departments consider rhetoricians bastard stepchildren unworthy of entry into the ivory towers of academia):The volume begins with what amounts to an introductory first chapter entitled \\"McGee Unplugged,\\" written by John Louis Lucaites, who was the first American born student to complete his doctorate under McGee. Lucaites reminds us that stylistically, conversations were McGee's forum of choice and that the conversations included in this volume do not have to be read sequentially. You can just as easily get from Isocrates as an example of \\"phronimos\\" in Chapter 2 to the notion of collectivity in Chapter 5 as you can the importance of representation to rhetoric. From the materialist conception of rhetoric to the need to remodel liberalism, the topics McGee talks about dance in and around the pivotal relationship between rhetoric and social theory, which was on one level simply the conventional name given at Iowa to McGee's work.Chapter 2, Formal Discursive Theories reconsiders the relationship between rhetoric and dialectic and then the notion of wisdom, for which Isocrates and not Plato is the Dead Greek of choice. This leads to representations as the key way of characterizing our study of human action.Chapter 3, The Postmodern Condition follows the lead of Walter Ong and Marshall McLuhan in considering orality to be humanity's state of nature. Ironically technology has allowed us to return to a more oral view of the world and creates new problems for looking at a \\"text,\\" which can no longer be considered a single, finite entity.Chapter 4, American Liberalism is more about the Whig-Liberal tradition that harkens back to Edmund Burke than it does to contemporary left-wing politics. With the shift from the Aristotlean rhetoric of persuasion to the Burkean rhetoric of identification, McGee posits the goal of scholarly endeavor to be political effectiveness in general and remodeling liberalism in particular. Within this context McGee looks at property and capital (i.e., how to tell the difference between liberals and communists), and how morality creates the space between law and liberty that establishes a code of conduct. Multicultrualism raises the issue of heterogeneity in our society while McGee returns to a favorite topic when he talks about the dynamic between \\"male\\" sovereignty and \\"female\\" solidarity.\\"Chapter 5, The People reconsiders the key elements of McGee's first seminal QJS essay by contrasting the spectatorship created by a world dominated by television with the collectivity that television can create in crisis. This returns us to the intellectual problem of subjectivity and ontology, which is what gets McGee to his friends Jose Ortega y Gasset and Jurgen Habermas.Chapter 6, Materialism is established as a coherent philosophical position that is a variant of realism, which historical materialism (a pivotal term) as coded human practice. The idea of objectivity merely reminds us that human discourse is both referential and subjective at the same time. McGee uses the term instantiation to help us tell how materialism is different from the word as used by Communists and Wall Street types. A materialist's morality takes a more political turn that the Christian morality that serves as an idealistic exemplar.As an example of McGee's \\"performance criticism,\\" the volume concludes with a previously unpublished work \\"Fragments of Winter: Racial Discontent in America, 1992,\\" in which McGee finds an extension of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech in Spike Lee's film, \\"Do the Right Thing.\\" Without getting into the particulars of this compelling essay, I would point out that McGee considers Lee's film on a cultural par with Picasso's painting \\"Guernica.\\"After reading this book the comparison between McGee and Kenneth Burke is perhaps the most relevant (flashback: McGee escorting the elderly Burke, who was about half McGee's size, at an SCA convention), for the simple reason that their public arguments display the same astounding breadth and depth of sources. For McGee reading Burke alone provided a superficial understanding; the only appropriate alternative was to read everything Burke had read (a premise fated to stay the heart of many a graduate student). For this reason you will find McGee talking about everything from Louis Althusser's understanding of the relationship between aesthetics and power to Thomas Szasz's study of the myth of mental illness (and that is just the names \\"dropped\\" over the course of these five conversations and one essay).It must be noted that both of the reviewer comments by colleagues of McGee on the back of this volume use the word \\"exasperating\\" to describe these conversation, the term being contrasted with \\"stimulating\\" and \\"intriguing\\" respectively. The explanation for such exasperation, dear friends, lies within the cognitive realm of the receiver. I would advance this brief example of exorcism by appropriating a political slogan McGee would have found unsettling in his younger days: in your heart, you know he's right.Lawrance M.

He was very much still dependant on his family for financially support; played well with children and animals. From my understanding he was put into a boarding home at age 2 years old--so, this may somehow interferred with his bonding with his mother and father that caused some of his problems. Later in his teen years and adult years he became a severe alocholic; an abuser to women and a person when his mother was not around dependant on other women. Would rather sat at home playing games all day long than working and when working would fantisize about being someone he was not; and tried to convince other people he was a zillionaire or should be treated as royalty.I also have a brother who is like this; and I too do not know today how to deal with him,but, the book opened my eyes letting me know that I am not the one that is crazy nor the one with this snydrome.

It gets good reviews from angry women who can't control their men and make them behave as they want them to. The book has no testable hypotheses.

However, I do not have this so called \\"Peter Pan syndrome.\\" It really is just a case of boys will be boys, and its different to how women react or perceive things. Absolute load of rubbish, it just gives fuel to people in dysfunctional relationships. On the same hand if a book was written about women detailing their insecurity, nagging, moodiness and their want to control their partner and give some fictional syndrome, then every man would be giving it great reviews and proclaiming that he had finally discovered what was wrong with his partner.

This was the second of this pairing and Batman being listed first marks it as the \\"DC one.\\"These are interesting though - J.M. DeMatteis wrote both with different artists. Given such they are not as related as you might imagine, but there is a continuity to them and a couple of nice touches carried between.Batman & Spider-Man features a pair of more calculating villains than the highly insane ones of Spider-Man and Batman. There is less parallel storytelling this time but DeMatteis uses it beautifully in a memorable page giving contrasting exposition. The story is deeper here, with one of Spider-Man's foes unexpectedly vulnerable and in need of help from The Demon's Head himself. I liked the twists and turns and found this exceptionally good for it's length and scope.Graham Nolan's art shines. He has a more grounded style than Mark Bagley, which is just as appropriate for this story as Bagley's was for his. The details of these stories from themes to common elements to artist assignment were clearly carefully thought out.This is the stronger of the two Spider-Man/Batman one-shots, and a great story in it's own right, but both are solid and they form a nice set together."},{"Title":"Batman & Spider-Man (New Age Dawning)","review":"This is a nice read.

I believe that Dematteis does a superb job with all four characters. Spider-man is a wise-cracking but compassionate man who has an overwhelming sense of responsibility. Batman is a dark, menacing figure with no super-powers. Perhaps the only reason he teams up with Spiderman well is because he identifies with Spidey's strong sense of responsibility. Kingpin is a scheming, criminal mastermind, which lends itself to a good plot twist near the end of the story. Ras Al Ghul is a self-proclaimed visionary and savior who believes the path to salvation involves rebuilding the world after nearly wiping out its population.The Demon plans once again to upset the balance of the earth. He approaches Wilson Fisk, believing that the Kingpin can finally help him realize his ideal. However, betrayal is very likely with these two.

He wrote &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot; in 1930, but that book is still very useful to analyze reality in many countries, despite the fact that the author intended to study only the situation in Europe...What is the subject of this book?. Well, the subject is the advent to power in Europe of what he calls the mass-men, who, according to him, are characterized by being just like everybody else. The mass-men have always existed, but whereas in the past they allowed the men of excellence to direct society, now they claim all the power. Ortega y Gasset says that what is new is that &quot;the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will&quot;. Thus, the mass-men claim that everything that is different needs to be crushed: uniformity is good, all else should be suppressed.But are the mass-men capable of leading society?. According to the author, they are not. He displays an enormous amount of elitism when he affirms that the culture of the mass-man isn?t true culture, because there isn?t culture where there are no standards to which anybody can make an appeal. He gives an example of the modern mass-man when he points out what was happening then under Fascism, due to the fact that &quot;there appears for the first time in Europe a type of man who does not want to give reasons or to be right, but simply shows himself resolved to impose his opinions&quot;.Ortega says that the way the mass-man behaves in public life arises from his psychological structure. Each mass-man considers &quot;his moral and intellectual endowment as excellent, complete&quot;. As a result, he doesn?t listen to others, and will try to impose his point of view on everything. Does that sound familiar to you?. Ortega was talking about something that was happening in the 1930?s, but...couldn?t what he said also be applied to some of the things that happen nowadays?.I really liked this book, despite the fact that I certainly do not agree with everything that the author wrote. For example, I think that everybody can learn if they want to do so, and that elitism isn?t the way to change things. However, I think that Ortega noticed a danger that was present in his society, and that we still have in ours: lack of communication, and a tendence to impose opinions on others. In this review I have only made a few remarks regarding some of the points Ortega y Gasset discusses in &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot;. Notwithstanding that, you will find that he talks about much more.All in all, I highly recommend &quot;The revolt of the masses&quot;... You might not agree with the author, but you need to read the book :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Read this book; it applies to America in the 21st century even more than it did to Europe in 1932, when it was first published. Ortega told both the commies and the fascists where to stick it way back then and showed the right path for civilization to follow, but no one listened. Above all, every person that feels misunderstood or underappreciated should read this book and find out why. They're most probably unwitting victims of the 'mass man.' Ortega isn't just any writer, the guy's a master philosopher who provides reasoned, unassailable arguments for everything he asserts--so be forewarned: this book will CHANGE YOUR LIFE and MESS WITH YOUR HEAD. Don't come with any preconceived ideas expecting to keep them, you won't be able to, not if you consider rationality a virtue."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"I know the word &quot;philosophy&quot; gives many people nausea. But this isn't an ordinary philosophy book; it is the best. Though smartly written, the reader isn't alienated by outsized vocab words or references to too much trivia. Yes, he is very proud of the fact he is Spanish. But this book is very readable by anyone with a decent HS or higher education...no PhD needed!It gives a unique perspective on society. Especially interesting considering many of the trends he discovered in the 1930s are extremely timely and valid today.He is also one of the philosophers most assiciated with Objectivism. (The other being Ayn Rand.) However, anyone interested in Rand (or not turned on to her style) would gain a lot from reading this book.I cannot reccommend this book high enough.

Its prose is stunningly lucid and concise. Its analysis of the \\"mass man\\" is so penetrating and insightful as to be almost superhuman. Its predictions of the rise of Naziism and Fascism, made decades before they actually occurred, were uncannily prescient. Its explanations of the factors underlying modern political trends were so cogent and forceful as to require assent.Overall, one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"After reading &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; it would be easy to criticize Ortege y Gasset's elitism and Euro-centrism. However, the importance of this book lies not so much in Ortega y Gasset's exposing the ignorance and ineptitude of mass man, but rather in his expressing a concern with how he will be able to come to terms with the modern world and its new level of social complexity. Ortega y Gasset, recognizing the social, economic, and political trends of a de-historicized and de-humanized Europe can do nothing less than place mass man at the center of an uncertain destiny--a destiny that becomes his inheritance as a result of blind force and numbers. Throughout the book, there is a constant tension between the historical present and the possible future, a tension that can be seen in much of Ortega y Gasset's other writings. As we experience the psychological force of the coming millennium, Ortega y Gasset's ideas provide us with a general blueprint for both the new possibilities and the inevitable complications that we must face. If Ortega y Gasset were here, he would perhaps wonder: Are we about to enter an age that will be able to unify the energies of mass man toward a common and transcendent purpose, or are we to enter an age that will, like on the eve of fascist Europe, lead mass man, not forward, but into the murk and mire of an apathetic commonality. At the heart of this book is the fact that whatever happens, and for better or worse, mass man is here to stay and his potential must not be ignored."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Given there are posted reviews going back 10 years on this book and given the intellectual culture of the reviewers, I find it astonishing that many of them have failed to grasp why this book is so chillingly relevant to understand the formation of modern democracy.First remember it was published in 1930 and written at the end of the 1920's. It is a mesmerizing prediction of coming somber events and an invaluable report of the political and philosophical ideas being debated then. 85 years after we can live the futility of extremist arguments and their disastrous consequences in history. Having had in my family people fighting for all sides in the Spanish civil war, it gives me perspective, understanding why the folly of putting fancy avant-garde holistic ideas before natural freedom and justice is simply an intolerable basis on which to build human societies.Second, saying that Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset is an elitist, insinuating he supports a self-perpetuating commanding class is in my view a MAJOR and awkward misreading of his work. Because he is EXACTLY the opposite of that: a man who profoundly believes in liberal democracy and is afraid of how lightly the established elites are using Freedom to satisfy their own power-seizing urges, overlooking its fragility and the enormous price paid to establish it in the first place. In the original Spanish version, he calls them \\"los se&ntilde;oritos\\" which is a derogatory term to talk about self-sufficient elites who acquired their status not by merit but by heritage or undeserving means. Suffice to read other essays from him like \\"The Dehumanization of art and Ideas about the Novel\\" to understand from a complete different angle, his nuanced position towards the elites, on the one hand admiring and calling for the leadership and creation that comes through meritocracy, on the other despising the self perpetuating and castle building mechanisms that come with elites that do not owe their current position to merit.To me the Revolt of the Masses is a must read work from a brilliant philosopher whose intellectual honesty and realism allowed him to passionately try to perform a Crime Scene Investigation of extremism before the crime had even happened. With the retrospective of 85 years, you will succumb to vertigo when comparing your knowledge of future events with the initial vision from Ortega y Gasset. The kind of vertigo that comes with profoundly impressive and relevant revelations pertaining to our very nature as human beings."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Of any of the political texts that I have read, none comes closer to predicting what the future would be. Written in the early part of the century, Ortega presents what are (will be) the failings of mass government. From the coming of war to the prevalence of the &quot;self-satisfied&quot; man, the author tells of a grim future for mankind."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Although I have a lot of sympathy for the author's clearly written critique of the modern mass's self-authorization to have its hands in everything, I needed more clarification about whether (in the author's view) individual mass men are capable of overcoming their inertia and bettering themselves. If Ortega y Gasset defines as &quot;mass man&quot; the person who though capable of enhanced self-reflection chooses instead to watch TV and absorb opinions from without while calling them his own, then I'm in his corner. In either case, very much worth reading."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"&quot;Imagination is the liberating power possessed by man.&quot; (p. 155)[In the book Ortega y Gasset uses the terms &quot;men of excellence&quot; and &quot;mass man.&quot; I will use his terms in this review, rather than trying to be politically correct and be more gender inclusive. If you need more gender inclusive language, be a person of excellence, read the book, and write a better review &#65533; ;-)]Jose Ortega y Gasset, once a &quot;Liberal&quot; legislator in the doomed Spanish Republic, wrote Revolt of the Masses 70 years too soon. This elitist book, although seriously flawed, makes numerous excellent points, demands to be read in these opening years of the 21st Century, and should be quoted, frequently, publicly, and with great fervor. His elitism echoes through the writings of authors such as Robert Heinlein. This is exemplified in Starship Troopers, where men of excellence are chosen via military service; as does The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, where men of excellence outwait the yammering groups of &quot;Mass Man&quot; and then create a constitution, perceived as being democratically created.Ortega y Gasset postulates that &quot;mass man&quot; has come to demand privilege without responsibility. With no idea of the workings of modern life, mass man expects it served up to him on a silver platter. Mass man pays no homage to the &quot;men of excellence&quot; who create, who move society forward, who shoulder responsibility. Ortega y Gasset's fatal flaw is his inability to separate the passivism and immaturity in &quot;mass man,&quot; which is a response to the infantilizing power of a hierarchical paradigm of domination, from the inherent state of mankind, which is excellence. While only a small vanguard may rise out of that passivity while dominated and enslaved, numerous historical examples clearly demonstrate the fallacy of Ortega y Gasset's argument.Two brief counter-examples: the Spanish anarchists (see The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years 1868-1936, by Murray Bookchin; Homage to Catalonia, by George Orwell, and the movie Land and Freedom) and the open source community. In the areas of Spain where anarchists took control, people worked together efficiently to oppose the Fascist insurgency. Franco's forces were held back by anarchists militias, working democratically, with little hierarchical structure. Anarchists organized the labor forces and ran factories by worker control, producing weapons and supplies. Bookchin tells us that these anarchists were a disciplined lot:The more dedicated men, once having decided to embrace the &quot;Idea [anarchism],&quot; abjured smoking and drinking, avoided brothels, and purged their talk of &quot;foul&quot; language. They believed these traits to be &quot;vices&quot;--demeaning to free people and fostered deliberately by ruling classes to corrupt and enslave the workers spiritually.&quot; (p. 48)&quot;Anarchist-influenced unions gave higher priority to leisure and free time for self-development than to high wages and economic gains.&quot; (p. 50)This is not the behavior which Ortega y Gasset attributes to mass man. This is the behavior of his &quot;men of excellence.&quot; Examining this evidence we find that when people are free, they are also free to be excellent. In the &quot;open source&quot; community (those who brought us Linux, Gnu, etc.), we also find &quot;men of excellence.&quot; We find people, free from corporate domination, who, without remuneration, have created one of the most sophisticated and reliable software systems for the mass market today. (Linux has been described as far more stable, efficient, and powerful than any Microsoft Windows product.) Again, freedom breeds excellence. The paradigm of domination and power-over does not exist in the open source community the way it does in a commercial environment.Nevertheless, Ortega y Gasset has served up an apt description of the &quot;typical&quot; American, who watches 35 hours of TV each week and feels the ideas he absorbs from Rush Limbaugh, Jerry Falwell, Matt Drudge, and the late news equal the work of serious scholars and intellectuals. Most of us Americans have long since abdicated our power and responsibility to &quot;somebody else.&quot; We don&#65533;t really trust our government, but we expect somebody else to fix it. We are the &quot;mass man&quot; who demands more government services, fewer taxes, and a higher quality of living, while refusing to volunteer our time in our communities. I conducted an informal poll in the weeks following the 9/11/01 tragedies. The more American flags a person displayed, the less likely he was to have voted in the 2000 presidential elections! While tens of millions of Americans fought terrorism by putting cheap flag stickers on their windows and automobile antennas, only a small minority of the citizenry took action: from donating blood to working for peace.Ortega y Gasset's contempt for mass man echoes the fear of the Spanish Liberals. They feared both fascism and proletarian liberation movements. They wished to hang on to their middle class privilege without being dominated from above, or being equalized from below. A social and political hierarchy helped them to maintain their privilege. Contrasting this stance with more equalitarian writings is an interesting experience. I recommend that Reane Eisler's Chalice and the Blade also be read, to lend insight on how societies of people of excellence were compelled to become mass man. Daniel Quinn, in his Ishmael books, also deconstructs how societies produce mass man to maintain power hierarchies.One of the most prophetic parts of the book was Ortega y Gasset's exposition on the union of Europe. He saw that the creation of a single European state was an inevitable part of the historical process. Watching the European nations struggle to come together as an economic unit it is easy to see his &quot;prophecy&quot; being fulfilled. He also made a profound statement about the democratic process; one that every flag-waving American ought to consider deeply:&quot;The health of democracies, of whatever type and range, depends on a wretched technical detail&#65533;electoral procedure. All the rest is secondary. If the regime of the elections is successful, if it is in accordance with reality, all goes well; if not, though the rest progresses beautifully, all goes wrong.&quot; (p. 158)Regardless of how many flags get waved, regardless of how many red-white-and-blue ribons get pinned on clothes, the 2000 election went terribly wrong. The Supreme Court prevented a full and accurate count from being conducted. The man in the White House was not put there by the vote of the American people, but by the vote of the United States Supreme Court. &quot;All [has] gone wrong.&quot;The book is full of concise, brilliant, quotables. Here are a few of my favorite:&quot;All of life is the struggle, the effort to be itself. The difficulties which I meet with in order to realise my existence are precisely what awaken and mobilise my activities, my capacities.&quot; (p. 99)&quot;Human life has arisen and progressed only when the resources it could count on were balanced by the problems it met with.&quot; (p. 101)&quot;If that life of mine, which only concerns myself, is not directed by me towards something, it will be disjointed, lacking in tension and in form. In these years we are witnessing the gigantic spectacle of innumerable human lives wandering about lost in their own labyrinths, through not having anything to which to give themselves.&quot; (p. 141)&quot;There is truth only in an existence which feels its acts as irrevocably necessary.&quot; (p. 182)Who should read The Revolt of the Masses? Everybody. This book throws down a gauntlet challenging us all to become people of excellence, to participate in shaping our own destinies, rather than handing that over to a few rich men in suits in corporate boardrooms and congressional offices. Ortega y Gasset writes well, better than the average philosopher. The translation from Spanish sacrifices no readability. Although I disagree with him on a major premise, I still must find this book to be a solid, five-star read.(If you'd like to dialogue about this book or review, please click on the &quot;About Me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email.

At times, it seems as if the author was just throwing random words on a page. I would recommend reading a chapter, then pondering what the author is talking about.

That complaint is like denouncing the Bible as being biased towards Christians.) Additionally, the fascists, though thuggish and violent in their actions, at least made a pretense to their past and heritage (a la Rome). A far greater representation of mass man is found in the socialistic and communistic nations, then and now. Communism makes no appeal to the heritage of civilization but instead seeks to separate itself via Revolution. Additionally, communism is not a revolution of the bourgeoisie, but against it. What could be more mass man than that? In this I wish to make no defence of fascism, not in the least. But rather to form a distinction between the two and to note, sadly and a little fearfully, that though 99% of us agree that fascism is a dangerous counter to civilization, there are far too many proponents of communism still swaying the opinions of mass man for us to feel comfortable.

While some reviewers may view this volume as elitist, or a book on fascism only, its analysis has far broader application. The deeply realistic gut-check perception of this book is the insight that, while the larger body of the populace aspires to achieve governing control of state policy, they inevitably lack the understanding and knowledge to formulate proper policy. This is the rock in the popcorn for fans of populist politics, and a chastening for those who believe that democracy must lead to superior governance. Populist leaders are invariably lost in the wilderness when implementing good-sounding promises, because their short-term simplistic remedies, which simply pander to the masses, are not calculated with the complexity needed to have positive economic effect.Ortega's book has told generations of open-minded, explorative readers about the real traps that prevent an easier and more rational administration of the democratic enterprise. Not a politically correct survey of reality, but one which the independent thinker will want to read cover-to-cover."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Because a book of ideas always tends to abstract discussion, readers have to be darn patient to wade through pages upon pages of tedious and turgid prose.

I'm glad Mary Duffy has come up with a new translation and at first impression it seems more to our times (quick, fast-paced, and athletic). This is what I saw in Ms. Duffy's blurb: \\"From Plato to Rousseau, to John Locke, and to our contemporary Francis Fukuyama, political theorists have always attempted to look back to find the agents of change of civilization.

The problem now is that these mediocre people are PROUD that they are as they are and refuse to recongize, in fact they revile, the excellent among us. The author makes no goofy theories as to who is excellent (like Neitshze did by awarding that prize to the decadent artistocrats of his day) except to say they are those who push themselves towards excellence. So readers of John Grisham and viewers of Friends need not apply..."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Having been outvoted on any major issue that I would like to address, I feel that I have been the victim of mass man as a political phenomenon as much as anyone has. The book ends with a real question, but to keep the book short, no effort is made to solve the problem which remains to plague thinkers after all these years. Ending up with this wisdom is about like finding something by Nietzsche about an animal crawling off by itself to be alone when it dies."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"This work is one of the classics of twentieth- century political writing. Ortega sees that the world has been transformed, that it has become overcrowded with a kind of pleasure- seeking irresponsible 'mass man'. He contrasts this figure with the responsible elite , those who demand much of themselves and would contribute to society as a whole. Ortega's work is often seen as observing and condemning the rise of totalitarian society.But it seems to me that however well he formulates his observations the distinctions he draws is far too broad and simplistic. The great evils and destruction in the century would come not from masses alone but rather from ideological driven elites whose ideas led to the tormenting and murder of millions.I would also say that there are all kinds of other social, political changes which occur in the century which it seems to me Ortega does not see. 3"},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"The book occupies a peculiar position. Written by a person of aristocratic predisposition against fascism and communism, and also democracy, this book was ironically celebrated by democratic, capitalist countries for its denunciation of Bolshevism and fascism as false starts.The aristrocratic (anti-people) strain in the arguments apart, the book represents a powerful analysis of what 'power to the people' does.Ortega y Gasset correctly diagnoses the rise of expectations that results from democratization of politics, improvement in quality of life and involvement of the masses, as the reason why societies push themselves toward tyrannical systems.Ortega y Gasset blames the 'increase of life' as the reason why more people want to have a say in politics and the destiny of their country make tyrannical demands for control of others and furtherment of their objectives and finally yield to demogogues who seem to promise such tyrannical solutions.This book is a strange kind of a cure and a strange kind of a poison. By analyzing how the very liberal principle of democratization contributes to tyranny he debunks 'the revolt of the masses' but at the same stroke weakens the ideological support structure for democracy."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"A superbly written book, &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; can be considered of limited value if one views it from a strictly historical perspective. True, Ortega y Gasset, writing in 1932, offered a clear and devastating critique of the tenets of fascism in particular and totalitarianism in general. He is particularly effective when he takes apart fascism's mystical elevation of race, blood and soil, arguing that the popular appeal to these factors was shallow, explained nothing about the process of nation-building, and was used only as a political expedient for the emerging dictatorships of Europe.But one could argue that however effective his argument, Ortega y Gasset, a Spaniard, was in perfect position to critique fascism and its foibles, being able to observe it from a closer perspective than others. After all, the war for men's hearts and minds was fought out in no small part on Spanish soil in the '30s.Ortega y Gasset was also not alone in critiquing the rise of mass man, which is the book's major point. Joseph Wood Krutch, for example, in &quot;The Modern Temper&quot; (an excellent companion to this book) had pointed out that the emergence of mass society and the development of technology had stripped away Man's sustaining illusions, at great cost.&quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; decries the leveling of society that the author observes, and the reader is at first made uncomfortable by the argument. I found myself mentally attacking Ortega y Gasset's elitism. I nearly concluded that the book was simply an apologia for an anti-democratic bias and for those who would protect political power from seizure by the common man.On further reflection, though, I concluded that Ortega y Gasset's argument is more complex and that the sustaining power of the book lies in its deeper layers of meaning. While he is certainly elitist, he glorifies the elites who invest in society and contribute to it, not those who simply hold onto power for its own sake and justify their hold by clinging to the past. In fact, he upholds republicanism as the most effective form of government -- and the one most difficult to sustain.His strongest point -- and the one most important for the modern reader -- comes when he says that the mass of men have no appreciation for the labor required to build nations and societies and the commitment required to sustain them. He writes pessimistically that the mass man of his day had little or no appreciation for this effort and considered his place in the world to be justified, rather than earned.This is an old-fashioned message, but in my opinion it was one that we do well to heed today. How many of us today consider our goods and services and access to intellectual and monetary capital -- much less our political rights -- as things that we must constantly struggle to preserve? How many of us take the time to consider the societies in which we live as dynamic, organic entities that must be studied and understood if we are to appreciate their worth? How often do we undertake even a cursory analysis of the routes we have taken to get to where we are today with an eye toward seriously reforming that which needs changed and preserving that which makes society strong?Some might find the author's insistence that mass society must defer to a group of elites repugnant and of course if the idea is embraced simplistically it is just that. But if one is prodded by Ortega y Gasset's demand for a radical commitment to building society, he will quite possibly begin looking at his surroundings and the time in which he lives with a new appreciation and sense of urgency."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"In this brief but sophisticated work, Jose Ortega y Gasset argues against the onslaught of the \\"mass-man\\" in social and political life. Who is this mass-man? The mass-man, Ortega argues, is a primitive man who makes use of all the products of modern civilization, but does not appreciate nor respect the superior intelligence and effort by the individuals who are responsible for their development. He takes it for granted that civilization is \\"just there\\" and has no appreciation for the intricate processes that are required in order to maintain it. The mass-man is content in his own mediocrity, and feels it unnecessary to strive toward excellence. This mass-man who once submitted to his superiors, now feels compelled to involve himself in everything and impose his will on everyone. This is often done through violence and is done without regard for rationality or reason. The mass-man is like a spoiled child who has taken over the household.It seems that there have been a couple of different interpretations of this book by reviewers. Some have pointed to Ortega's elitism and contempt for mass-man as a sign of him being anti-democratic. And this certainly seems like a logical conclusion except for the fact that Ortega himself asserts that a liberal democracy is the ideal form of government! I was somewhat puzzled by this seemingly contradictory pronouncement myself. It seems to me that democracy inevitably leads to rule by the mass-man. After all, democracy literally means \\"rule by the people.\\" Nevertheless, on page 76, Ortega writes:\\"The political doctrine which has represented the loftiest endeavour towards common life is liberal democracy. It carries to the extreme the determination to have consideration for one's neighbor and is the prototype of 'indirect action.' Liberalism is that principle of political rights, according to which the public authority, in spite of being all-powerful, limits itself and attempts, even at its own expense, to leave room in the State over which it rules for those to live who neither think nor feel as it does, that is to say as do the stronger, the majority. Liberalism-it is well to recall today-is the supreme form of generosity; it is the right which the majority concedes to minorities and hence it is the noblest cry that has ever resounded on the planet.\\"Contrary to some other reviewers, I also found Ortega's philosophy to be very progressive. One of his main criticisms of mass-man is of his primitive and archaic way of thinking. He points out that movements like fascism and communism tend to look to some bygone glorious past as a model for government. He calls them a \\"monotonous repetition of the eternal revolution.\\" Ortega instead urges us to look to the future, to persist in bettering ourselves, and maintain liberalism until it can be superseded by something better.I found this book to be somewhat paradoxical. Although it seemed that some of the author's ideas contradicted each other, I still found it to be a very worthwhile and intriguing read. Although written in the 1930's, there is much in it that remains relevant today and I would not hesitate in recommending it. It is definitely intellectual candy for the political/philosophical mind."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"\\"The Revolt of the Masses\\" has been, I think, continuously in print since 1930 for the simple reason that it's a very important book. Its main observation is hardly possible to deny: the vast increase in wealth caused by the Industrial Revolution empowered whole massive segments of society which had formerly been nearly invisible. And they all wanted to go to the beach and stay in hotels and eat in restaurants. So, way back in 1930, Ortega y Gasset was already noticing that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find a place on the beach, or a room in a hotel, or a table in a restaurant. \\"Mass man\\" had arrived.This book also contains a lot of commentary on the nature of mass man. For example: \\"the commonplace mind, knowing itself to be commonplace, has the assurance to proclaim the rights of the commonplace and to impose them wherever it will.\\" In the 21st century, where \\"The Simpsons\\" are vastly popular, and it is suddenly fashionable to deny the very idea that a man should want to be a gentleman, the words ring true.What is more interesting, perhaps, is to speculate on how the newly-arrived \\"mass man\\" went about the pursuit of political power. But that would be another book entirely.This book, along with other fundamental books like \\"Human Action,\\" should be a part of every thinking person's education. Of course, right now it's NOT, but I think we all have a pretty good idea why not.Highest possible recommendation!"},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Ortega y Gasset had an uncanny understanding of the origins and dangers of modern mass movements. As some other reviewers have noted, this book was written in the early 30's in response to the fascist movements in Europe at the time. What is truly chilling is that, beyond predicting the unfortunate results of those fascist movements, the picture Ortega y Gasset paints of the &quot;mass man&quot; and how he is manipulated is still applicable to modern American marketing of both politicians and products. Like I said, one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"In our egalitarian age, we often scoff at any arguments that contain words like 'superior,' 'inferior,' or extol the value of hierarchy. So, many will instinctively cringe at the elitism - and it is elitism - that Ortega y Gasset exhibits in Revolt of the Masses, which essentially warns that societies who don't realize how much their existence is predicated on hierarchy of superiors to inferiors will become directionless and cease to exhibit excellence. But I hope those readers stick around, because there is more here than our egalitarian gut reactions can capture.Ortega starts off by defining what he means by 'mass man' and how he is different from the exceptional men. Mass men are those who are content where they are, have opinions but seldom really think and reflect, have no conception of themselves as creatures bounded in a a place, a time, and various social roles, and, in a sense, are simply directionless. Compare these to the exceptional people, those who live life with a sense of purpose (that has little or nothing to do with hedonistic egoism), strive for greatness, and have the thoughtfulness to 'make things happen.'Written in 1932, Ortega is concerned that several European countries are falling for doctrines like fascism and socialism that put most of their emphasis on 'mass man' rather than appreciating that civilization owes its existence, upkeep, and progress to the exceptional. Ortega is not advocating hereditary rule (has exceptionality is something deserved and earned, not inherited). But Ortega's concern - preficuring Schumpeter'sCapitalism, Socialism, and Democracy: Third Edition) is that the very processes that led to an improvement in everyone's conditions (presumably capitalism) was leading to its own destruction, by deluding the mass man into thinking that material comforts and abundance are just a naturally existing part of the world's fabric. Thus, the masses demand a certain easiness of condition that, in reality, must be worked for, and lack any appreciation that the very exceptional people they demean are the ones largely responsible for material comfort and abundance in the first place.Ortega is generally labeled a conservative, and I think this is somewhat accurate, though it would not be a stretch to call him a classical liberal either. Like conservatives in the vein of Burke and Oakeshott, Ortega displays a fierce disdain for ahistorical and rationalistic approaches to social thought - approaches that do not pay careful attention to the present as a contingent outcome of specific historical circumstances, or attempts to 'make the world over' as if we can deduce the proper first principles from pure reason rather than close historical study. In the vein of conservatism (a la Kenneth Minogue'sLiberal Mind, The), Ortega also suggests that a world where persons no longer act according to their roles in social hierarchies is a world that quickly leads to narcissism, hedonism, and directionlessness. For Ortega, one finds the most purpose in life when one sees oneself as bounded by place, time, existing social roles, and purposes OTHER THAN simple egoistic pleasure.For my money, I agree with Ortega on a good many things. His bemoaning of the purposelessness (and, because of that, the stupidity) he finds in the mass man can in many ways be read as a critique of modernism, where many people's primary goal is to keep up with everyone else and live for distraction (as opposed to purpose). Ortega's suggestion that the 'revolt of the masses' will lead to an ever-increasing egalitarianism that seeks to remove any whiff of tradition and (legitimately arising) hierarchy may also be playing out to various degrees.I have a few problems with this work, though, particularly owing to the author's oscillation between suggesting that he doesn't believe in historical determinism and reminding us that we must each fulfill our destiny. I've read and reread sections of the book, but do not see how the author can be interpreted as not contradicting himself (or what he means by 'destiny'). Also, the final chapter of the book (which many consider the best) is, to me, a very rhetorical jeremiad where Ortega obsesses over the thought that, in the future, Europe might not 'rule the world.' I simply hope this was not the primary impetus for writing the book, because if 'mass' is code for 'non-European' and 'superior' and 'excellent' are codes for 'European,' then a very interesting book becomes a mighty shallow one. (I personally read the book as if that chapter was simply a postscript.)Interesting read here, particularly for our egalitarian ears. Ortega's ideas may strike some as quaint or outmoded. But if one looks close, Ortega is, at least in some ways, writing about what we've become."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"This book was originally published, I believe, in the 1930's. It is a work of extraordinary prescience, the full import of which will continue to be measured well into future ages. Against the backdrop of the overthrow of Old World civilization, the author, a Spanish philosopher, describes the Revolt of the Masses. &quot;Mass man,&quot; the principal representative of the modern superstate, is an inert, unthinking being hostile to the finer creations of aristocratic culture and easy prey for demagogues of every political persuasion. He is characterized by passivity, an appetite for entertainment and spectacles, and a hostility toward the sensitivity, discipline and training that are necessary prerequisites to aristocratic culture. We are all &quot;mass men.&quot; This book is a compelling starting point in any inquiry into the cultural decline of modern democratic civilization"},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"Clearly a work destined to resound through many generations, it is altogether too easy for us in our hindsight to nod and say &quot;Yep, he sure had it pegged&quot; regarding Gasset's analysis of fascist and nationalist movements. Yet we should really marvel at the audicity and strength of intellect it takes to make such bold arguments at a time of colossal upheaval in Europe. He writes in a seductive style fusing metaphysics and social commentary that is a joy to read. Still, it is dangerous to suspend our critical faculties in the presence of any writer, though he be (or maybe just because he is) a master of language. Gasset's values are clearly those of the educated elite of his time, and in my humble opinion many of these are self-contradictory, if not hypocritical: While decrying the &quot;mass-man&quot; born into the priviledges and luxuries wrought by the pioneers of liberal democracy in the 18th and 19th century, he waxes nostalgic in an almost romantic way for the soveignity of a long-gone nobility similar to Plato's concept of the Philosopher King. He also takes as a given the cultural superiority of Europe in general, making a strong argument for it as the apex of civilization. Albiet he does take great pains to dispel the modern notion of the nation-state based on language, history or natural boundaries. While I don't intend to open up that Pandora's box here, readers should keep in mind how such ideas and statements regarding Europes' (and her particular peoples) golden age have been (past and present) misused and distorted into racial theories with dire consequences. Gasset frequently makes reference to Spengler, a historical theorist who's vast scope and poetic breadth is not quite matched by his grasp of historical detail. Not that I claim to be able to do better than DECLINE OF THE WEST, but the resources available to the writer of historiography today is much more accessible, accurate and updated than it was in the days of Toynbee, Spengler, and yes Gassett. I guess it takes the boldest thinkers to make grand sweeping statements about the direction of historical currents, the decline of civilizations, and so on. But I find them more gratifying in the general than in the specific."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"What a muddle (most) reviewers have made of this book. I am reminded of De Tocqueville, whom all factions regard as \\"prescient\\" and appropriate him to their own positions. Let's get some facts straight, Gasset is a reactionary and an elitist, just as De Tocqueville was an aristocrat attempting to make sense of an alien American democracy. The difference is that De Tocqueville was only a reactionary in sentiment. He felt that democracy was inevitable. Not so Gasset, who believes that we MUST in some way turn back the clock. The ways he proposes that this might be done are, as another reviewer has noted, somewhat at odds with each other. So, perhaps, it's no great wonder that the reviews are muddled.Gasset is an intellectual descendant of Nietzsche, believing in the noble man above the masses. And, truly, this book at its heart, is more about the aristocratic man, than the aristocratic society, which is merely a means to this end. And, Gasset asserts, a true \\"society\\" is aristocratic by definition. Otherwise, it's not a society. But, to return to Gasset's aristocratic or noble man, who is a spin-off of Nietzsche's notion of the artist hero. If we keep our eyes on this notion, the book is a harrowing and effective plea for his existence.Unfortunately, Nietzsche came to America in the form of the distinctly middlebrow Ayn Rand, whose terrible writing and weighted, tendentious novels found a home in middlebrow America and started a harebrained literary tradition that continues this day. One of the longer-winded reviewers mentioned some of the most recently published books of this sort. Neither her character Howard Roark nor her vision of society: \\"A coal mine is more beautiful than Niagara Falls.\\" - What twaddle - are at all what Nietzsche or Gasset has in mind. Oh well, one can't expect much from an author who can't spell her own name.Look, here is the type of soul Gasset adores and admires and is terribly worried is becoming extinct:\\"The man with the clear head is the man who frees himself from those fantastic \\"ideas\\" and looks life in the face, realizes that everything in it is problematic, and feels himself lost. As this is the simple truth - that to live is to feel oneself lost - he who accepts it has already begun to find himself, to be on firm ground. Instinctively, as do the shipwrecked, he will look round for something to which to cling, and that tragic, ruthless glance, absolutely sincere, because it is a question of his salvation, will cause him to bring order into the chaos of his life. These are the only genuine ideas; the ideas of the shipwrecked.\\" P.157I have quoted at length because I believe this passage is at the root of what Gasset is all about here: The soul with a sense of the tragic inherent in life seeking from this existential shipwreck to wring his own foundered chaos of notions he calls himself is the essence of the noble, aristocratic artist-hero, to whom this book should have been dedicated. And, finally, perhaps Gasset was (sadly) right. The revolt of the masses and the engendering of their proclivities in what we would call a society leave no room for the preeminence of such a spirit.Finally, if one wishes to read these ideas in the original, close thy Gasset and open Nietzsche's Thus Spake Zarathustra."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"The first thing I should say is that this is not light reading. With that said, read it anyway. Gasset wrote something as contemporary today as it was in the 1920s and 30s. Operating on the premise that we have seen since Thucydides, that the mass of citizens, when unchecked does damage, does not consider the consequences of its actions, its demands, its lifestyle without understanding or thinking about the system of civilisation which makes their relatively free and prosperous lives possible.\\"It is false to say that history cannot be foretold,\\" says Ortega. Obviously, since this book is equally prescient about the Fascist rallies of the 1930s and the youth rebellion of the 1960s. Perhaps in light of the 20th Century, we should look back at this philosopher from its dawn and see that Gasset saw the fundamental problem of the next century (incorporating the majority into the political and cultural realms when they had been absent throughout history) and we failed to listen to his warning."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"In _The Revolt of the Masses_, Ortega y Gasset offers us a powerful diagnosis of the modern European political arena - the rise of the mass-man. Ortega y Gasset refers to a kind of &quot;hyper-democracy&quot; in which the mass-man has risen to such a degree that he now takes upon himself the cutural areas formerly reserved only for the nobility. Rather than believing that he is granted certain rights, the mass-man now assumes that he is entitled to those rights as a given. This has led to an overwhelming mediocricy among leaders. Furthermore, a reign of specialization, with an increasing number of men (&quot;specialists&quot;) who know more and more about less and less, has brought us to a dangerous point in world history. Ortega y Gasset contends that the masses intervene in everything and that their form of intervention is solely by means of violence. He suggests that a new form of primitivism exists in which civilization is just assumed as there, in a similar way to which nature is taken as given for the primitive. He also points out the dangers of technicism and statism, which both are the direct consequence of the rise of the mass-man. Europe no longer can hold its position of world dominance, but according to Gasset this is lamentable only because nothing has arisen to take its place. Ortega y Gasset discusses and finds problematic both Bolshevism and Fascism. The idea of what constitutes nation is discussed, and Gasset concludes that it is not solely ethnic, cultural, or linguistic in nature. Ortega y Gasset concludes that European culture suffers from certain &quot;defects&quot; and that it is in these defects that the root of this phenomenon of the mass culture can be found. By determining exactly what these are and finding a moral code for Europe, this difficulty can be overcome. This book provides much food for thought, especially for those troubled by the ever-growing difficulties associated with over-crowding, specialization, and the decline of high culture."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"While Ortega Y Gasset is somewhat inaccurate about Fascism (as it applied to Italy and German National Socialism -- not Spanish), it nonetheless is a compelling book that drops a hard kick in the crotch of all &quot;Demo-Fraud&quot; lovers like 99.9% of our &quot;loved&quot; politicians and 95% of the human estate.

That this book is a translation doesn't help either, I suspect. To suggest what the overall literary style is: imagine something by Mill (who, too, was given to parenthesis) translated consecutively, via Babelfish, into a number of unrelated languages and then back into English. Coming from a literary man, how can this abominable manner of expression be accounted for? The book is exceptionally hard to read; and not because of any sort of conceptual difficulty.Second, the author's argument and the very thesis are elusive, hard to grope onto; never clear and coherent, he posits a lot but evades justification. Who are these masses to begin with? Who knows... they are not marxian classes, he says. Well then? Not this, not that. OK, still? Well, something like philistines. Is that a helpful category? Are those really in revolt? Who knows... Two-three times per page your mind rebels: Wait a minute! -- How do we know this? Is that obvious? No, no... Well, then? -- but he's already somewhere else... the author's thought drifts all over the place; his random musings are wholly devoid of focus, structure, and logical progression and at length do not amount to a philosophical investigation. The first part is vaguely about \\"masses\\"; the second drifts away from the declared topic and switches to european nationalism; the ending has nothing to do with either: this book feels like a collection of unrelated articles, poorly written and poorly thought through, bound together for some reason.The bottom line: complete and utter waste of time."},{"Title":"THE REVOLT OF THE MASSES, 27th Printing","review":"For Ortega y Gasset, \`the reality of history lies in biological power'. A demographic explosion is a sign of vitality, but it has an evil side-effect: it generates a hyperdemocracy, where the masses act directly, outside the law, by means of material pressure.Ortega y Gasset is fundamentally an anti-democrat in the Plato or Lenin style: the masses are too stupid to see or to fight for their real interests. They create a \`brutal empire'.His vision of mankind is too pessimistic. For him, the mass-man claims the right to be unreasonable. He acts as a spoilt child for whom everything is permitted and who has no obligations. His mass-man is not interested in the principles of civilization (law, politics, art, morals or religion) and turns his back on technique. He wrecks the European civilization and paves the way for a return to barbarism.The mass-man realizes his aspirations through the State. But he doesn't understand that the State crushes the independence of the individual and that ultimately he will only live for the governmental machine (the bureaucracy and the military).Science, art and technique need the tonic atmosphere created by the consciousness of authority. But, the mass-man doesn't accept a ruler who can propose a vision, a project, a goal. For him, \`L'Etat, c'est moi.'Following Ortega y Gasset's analysis, the future of Europe at that moment was far from rosy.However, not the mass-men dug Europe's grave, but its nationalist wars.The author is very conscious of this disastrous problem, for he defends one cardinal point: the need for the United States of Europe and a common market: \`the building-up of Europe into a great national State is the one enterprise'.This book is the reflection of a demoralized liberal democrat.

Compounding on this problem is the minuscule font size - you'd better have 20/20 vision if you're going to use this manual. The layout is also confusing and ugly, with no real pattern to each page.

If you're a medical student on the wards, you're better off reading actual textbooks, like Robbins and Cecil, to understand the material. Books like this will only confuse you - they're a tool for knowing what to order, not a way to learn the material.

Possession of this book will allow students, residents and staff to give patients the best care possible from evidence based medicine. You will shine on the wards and at morning report with this material. In fact, you could easily pass the Internal Medicine board certification exam if you knew everything in this book. For those practicing internal medicine from med students on up, it renders Scut Monkey, Ferre, Wash Manual, tarascon ICU books etc, all obsolete. Just look at the section about Swan Ganz monitoring -it's all there. Look at microscopic polyangiitis- it's all there. These are all real patients I've treated and this book works. More than half of the residents, students and staff in my hospital use it. Even surgeons own it. As medicine becomes more complex and scientifically based, publications such as this will be the only way to keep up. In fact, it's very inexpensive for what you get. One caution is that it may be too advanced for 3rd year med students with a poor knowledge base. A wash manual may be a simpler way to start.

Personally, I like the book a lot. What it has that Ferri's doesn't is evidence-based medicine. Several major studies (PIOPED, and the like) are summarized. Yes, it is someone's notebook in fancy form. But it's cheap, it's small, and it's good. I found that it was too light on details when I was starting out, but once I felt a little more comfortable with my ability to come up with a basic differential, this was the book for me. It was great help for those long medicine write-ups, providing clinical research correlations. Now it is the only book that I carry in my pocket, full of micrographic notes that I have made from lectures, other books, etc. Ferri's isn't exactly pocket-friendly."},{"Title":"Pocket Medicine (Pocket Notebook)","review":"I have found this book to be extremely useful during my third-year internal medicine clerkship.

I purchased this book as an interior design reference and although it does not cover interior design details the rich history provided by the author led me to want to read this book cover to cover. And what a beautiful cover it is- brown leather- makes this a great coffee table book. This would be a great gift for anyone interested in western architecture and home style. This is not one of those books that choses a certain western style and displays hundred of the same photograph-this book covers every ranch style possible. I will continue to reference this book for inspiration and ideas."},{"Title":"Rancho Deluxe: Rustic Dreams and Real Western Living","review":"The last decade of the twentieth century spawned a culture of week-end ranchers buying week-end &quot;places&quot; and decorating the interiors in &quot;drug-store cowboy&quot;. &quot;Ranch Deluxe&quot;, however, shows you what the real thing looked like, Partner.For those of us who grew up on &quot;Hop Along&quot; and Gene Autry Saturday mornings at the neighborhood theatre, Rancho Deluxe is a voyeur's dream.Motoring down the highways of the great Southwest, one occasionally glimpses an old ranch house in the distance. &quot;Is there a soul so dead who never fantasized about life in that ranch house?&quot; Rancho Deluxe welcomes the voyeur to step inside and have a look around."},{"Title":"Rancho Deluxe: Rustic Dreams and Real Western Living","review":"Nicely made book, with lovely photos.

My 4 year old son loves for us to read this book to him as well as the other two Narnia books illustrated by Deborah Maze. Keep in mind that this book is only a small portion of the original book, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.&quot; With that in mind, sit down with a little one and enjoy the story and the incredible, detailed drawings from the world of Narnia!"},{"Title":"Edmund and the White Witch","review":"As a teacher of reading and writing, I've discovered a very popular lesson among students of all ages: write a known story from a different point of view. The protagonist of this children's book is The Traitor, Edmund, but it is a different Edmund than the one we're used to, a different one from the one portrayed in the recently-released film. Edmund has always been an easy target for castigation, but this literary rendition beautifully illustrates the teaching that we should not be so quick to judge. Perhaps this rendition prepares our path to forgiveness -- a path that C.S. Lewis tried to forge."},{"Title":"Edmund and the White Witch","review":"You can also see my review of Aslan, another picture book in this series. The entire series is just wonderful. The text is pure Lewis - all excerpts from the original text. Maze is very true to his descriptions in her illustrations. My daughters love the original novels and they love these books as well! The only concern for this particular book is that some of the illustrations can be a little scary for a sensitive child. The witch is evil but beautiful. Her cohorts are evil and many are gruesome."},{"Title":"Edmund and the White Witch","review":"Absolutely a wonderful adaptation of the original for younger readers. I have younger kids, ages 5 &amp; 7 and they love this book and the others like it. It is a good book for &quot;Transitional&quot; readers in the 1st and 2nd grade.

For purposes of writing the Osprey Campaign Series title about this battle there is nobody better suited.Fletcher's battlefield descriptions are up to date as he traces out the location of every British battery in relation to contemporary landmarks along with photographs detailing key points of interest. The level of detail is exactly what one has come to expect from the Osprey Campaign Series and, in addition to Badajoz, the seige of Ciudad Rodrigo is also covered in this title.For a greater level of detail than this title permits read &quot;In Hell Before Daylight&quot;, also by Ian Fletcher."},{"Title":"Cackle Cook's Monster Stew (Family Storytime)","review":"Patricia Rae Wolff is one of my favorite children's authors!

He is a funny man and that is a good thing in his line of work.I found it fascinating that he has developed this profiling science that has helped with many, many cases involving murder.It's just that I couldn't finish the book. Though very well written, this book is very, very disturbing and gruesome. Half way through, I just could not bear to hear of one more life torturously and needlessly snuffed out. I am thankful for people like John Douglas and for the work they do, I just can't read the details of it."},{"Title":"Mindhunter: Inside the FBI Elite Serial Crime Unit","review":"As a senior at the University of Maryland double majoring in Criminal Justice and Psychology I picked up this book because of professional interests. The beginning is told like most prideful autobiographies that have the intention of communicating the God-like nature of the author (think Dick Marcinco - The Rogue Warrior, Frank W. Abagnale Jr. - Catch Me If You Can etc.)The descriptions of John Douglas' younger years were kind of tedious and uninteresting(the first 65 pages or so,) as the reason I picked up the book was to get a better overall understanding of investigative profiling.Most of the book is fairly well written, and interesting to read. Douglas points out that he has been the lead profiler in many of the serial crimes cases that Americans seem towet their pants over. (The Unabomber, The Atlanta-Child Murderer, The Green River Killer) He also describes the process by which he interviewed many serial killers after they were caught. Most of the book is dedicated to showing the accuracy of criminal profiles when done by someone who knows what they're talking about. Douglas proves this point over and over again, making ney-sayers look stupid over and over again.I enjoyed the book, but I had several issues with its content.1. When Douglas relates his first person encounters with criminal interviewing he often goes into an extremely poor writing style exchanging the first person for the second, and exchanging the past tense for the present. He also is fond of using the term \\"like\\" a lot just like a valley girl. An example of this would be \\"Then we were all like this guy is crazy. . .\\" instead of \\"I knew what the other team members were thinking, we all thought he was crazy. . .\\" Because of this, I often found myself rephrasing this poor form of writing while I was reading it in order to get a better understanding.2. It has some fallacious information do to the publication date. I think newer editions should come with extra content do to the development of what has recently happened in several cases mentioned in the end of the book. Mainly that the Green-River killer turned out to be - one person(not three) - Garry Ridgway; And that BTK was caught and shown to be Dennis Rader. Douglas also gives a bit of spurious information at the end about how Jack the Ripper was the first media sensationalized serial killer - that was actually Gilles De Rais. He probably just didn't consider the French media of the 1400's to be sensationalized enough.Besides those two points Dr. Douglas did a fine job telling of his experiences and definitely got me interested in the field of investigative criminal profiling. If your looking for a more collegiate version of this book without the personal annals check out Robert K. Resslers (John Douglas' partner)Profilers: Leading Investigators Take You Inside The Criminal Mind"},{"Title":"Stupography","review":"When did nightly news become mostly teasers, with a two-line explanation? When did Janet Jackson's Superbowl display become more immoral than public lying? Or lying to the public? (The good book says, \\"Thou shalt not lie\\" but mentions nothing about nudity)Leave it to the intelligence and wit of John Skipp to bring up the \\"Dumb that dare not speak its name\\". Skipp describes \`Stupography' as \\"media that actually makes you dumber the longer you look at it\\", and boy, are we surrounded by this very thing more than ever today.Many people, like me, have completely tuned out their TV's because of this wave of 'Stupography', and have lost hope in the ability of the American people to overcome the mind-numbing placidity shoveled over us by media, politicians, and greedy corporations. It's enough to make one give up on humans and look to the cockroach to next rule the world.But Skipp tackles these important issues without ever losing his sense of humor, his hope, his ambitions, or his integrity, which makes this one of the most refreshing books I have read to date. Skipp's personality positively bursts from the pages, a friend you would want to have over to your home, to sit and talk and watch some silly movie with.From 'Prickly vs Gooey' philosophy, to an amazingly witty diatribe of the new TCM movie, to comparing D&D; alignments to political parties, to spam emails that offer up enhancements you didn't know you needed, to \\"egregious violations of the soul in the name of oil and greed and power\\", to chaos and complacency, Skipp is absolutely unafraid to boldly step forward and stand by his opinions. At times it may remind you of a Dennis Miller rant, without the cynicism and with more good-natured humor.'Stupography' is an amazingly enjoyable break from being too serious about your non-fiction, and yet doesn't use a light message to wake us all up to the truth. Your day, and your life, is filled with Stupography. Let Skipp show you how to thin the weeds out, so that you can enjoy life to its fullest without worrying about the Jones's next door or the bimbo on TV or that ad in your newspaper. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Stupography","review":"In a world gone mad, thank god (or whatever) for John Skipp. Already a legend for his fiction (THE BRIDGE, among others, with Craig Spector, and the solo modern classic, CONSCIENCE), he explodes onto the frontlines of our culture wars with his first non-fiction book, STUPOGRAPHY, a combo analysis/critique of \\"media that actually makes you DUMBER, the longer you look at it.\\" Tackling everything from the Bush administration and the war in Iraq to venal Hollywood remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and DAWN OF THE DEAD, Skipp's laser-sharp eye for detail & nuance, his passionate & compassionate voice, and his finely-honed skills as a storyteller, make each essay (which originally appeared in his \\"Hard Way\\" column on his website www.johnskipp.com) both a challenge and a treat. Skipp looks at where we are, dares to imagine where we might go, and does it all in his one-of-a-kind mix of the sacred and the profane. Imagine if Hunter S. Thompson weren't a maniac; imagine if Jim Goad were a nice guy and actually liked people; imagine if Michael Moore played fair. Actually, stop imagining, because Skipp is a complete original, and get this book now. STUPOGRAPHY is a big one, no question: In my estimation, it's primed to become one of the primary and essential socio-political, spiritual, & creative survival tools for all thinking beings in this young millennium."},{"Title":"Stupography","review":"I bought this from the author himself and was glad to find that this book lived up to how inspiring and witty as its author is.Filled with essays that range from the political to the social, this captures the intelligence of the author wonderfully and opens the readers eyes to so many different visions and ideas that it's hard to keep it all in your head.I cannot recommed it highly enough.

Without knowing very much about wine, I was immediately carried along by the easy tone and crisp writing style of the guide. The author's suggestions are practical and useful. The book answers a lot of the kinds of questions Heidi's fans ask her when she does readings. What wine goes best with pizza, or different kinds of meat? What's the difference between wine that is corked, and wine that comes in a box? She offers tons of tips and hints, and not all of them concerning the beverage alone. When discussing wineglasses, for instance, she suggests that &quot;it's better to drink inexpensive wine in a high quality wineglass, than to drink expensive wine using cheap glasses.&quot; For solid advice and a friendly, fun writing style, you can't beat this little wine primer from a veteran author and columnist."},{"Title":"Wine Savvy: The Simple Guide to Buying and Enjoying Wine Anytime, Anywhere","review":"I really enjoyed reading Heidi Yorkshire's Wine Savvy. It's a friendly, straightforward book, and it makes it easy to jump right in and begin to learn about the world of wine. I already thought I knew the basics.

Nice non-intimidating book."},{"Title":"Wine Savvy: The Simple Guide to Buying and Enjoying Wine Anytime, Anywhere","review":"This book does a great job of explaining the basics of buying and enjoying wine, in ways that are easy for wine beginners to understand. Take the first section on why wines 'taste' differently, based on their aroma. Heidi suggests you try comparing an apple piece to a pear piece with your nose being held. Most people can't tell them apart, because the tongue only tastes basic flavors. The rest comes from your nose.Heidi further explains how wines can be broken down into pretty basic styles based on tannin, acid, sweetness and alcohol levels. She explains how to run simple taste tests with tea, sugar, lemon juice, and cream to see these differences. Have you felt that you could never understand these &quot;fine distinctions?&quot; Her tests will show you how easy it is, once you know what to look for!Other sections include how to run a wine tasting, what the various wine varieties taste like, ways to learn how to be better at tasting wines, pairing food and wine, and even how to select wines in stores and in restaurants.At 110 pages this is a relatively quick read, and the information is well written and helpful.

As most of Wagner's books are currently out of print, obtaining this collection is the easiest way for readers to become exposed to Karl's works.Included in this collection: The very first story Karl ever wrote; Short stories involving the mythical warrior Kane (set in both the past and present!); Adventures of his Western hero Becker; An invaluable bibliography for Wagner collectors; And of course his popular &quot;horror&quot; stories, which brought Wagner some well deserved critical acclaim.Most of these stories are reprints (although there are a few &quot;Uncollected Stories&quot; appearing for the first time in this book), however Stephen Jones has done a fantastic job of selecting those stories which have most likely not reached the mass market.Included as well in this collection are a series of photographs and articles from those closest to the author. I found many of these essays to be depressing as they overshadow the author's actual work, in favour of negatively commenting about his personal life. David Drake, his friend and one-time co-publisher/author, for obviously personal reasons, decided to take a particularly vicious stab at Karl as his farewell. Evidently Mr. Drake is not a sentimentalist.On a final note, this collection does NOT contain some of Karl's more popular work (including Lacunae, More Sinned Against, and Sticks), which can be found in one of his three other collections. It does, however, provide a wide range of enjoyable stories, and for those who mourn the loss of one of the most creative imaginations of our generation, this is a fitting denouement. Farewell Karl!"},{"Title":"Exorcisms and Ecstasies","review":"Having spent a lot of hours and days reading the adventures of KANE 20 Years ago, this book came to me as pleasant surprise. It does not only include some nearly perfect horror-stories but some odd Kane-pieces and a lot of information about the author and his life.

The editorial review for this book should state that this is a very limited offering."},{"Title":"Exorcisms and Ecstasies","review":"This last collection of stories By the late Karl Edward Wagner contains Wagner at his highs and lows. Most of the stories were written in the last few years of his life as his health failed but there are also previously little known or unpublished items from younger days. Of particular interest is his first completed &quot;Kane&quot; novella written at age 16- surprisingly good and very different from the rewritten/published version &quot;Lynortis Reprise&quot;. There are also a selection of photos on slick paper and a comprehensive bibliography. Strong sexual content in several stories written by a trained psychiatrist. Sex, blood, and thunder- what more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Exorcisms and Ecstasies","review":"Wagner was perhaps best known for his horror writing &amp; editing, but for me it was always the stories about Kane, the anti-hero swordsman, that captured my imagination. While this book contains mostly horror tales, and a few Kane stories, there is a surprising amount of graphic sex. It seems Wagner wrote a number of pornographic novels ,under an assumed name, apparently to pay the bills. There are also a number of remembrances by writer-friends, that inevitably descend into tales of Wagner's heroic drinking binges, and depression over his divorce from his wife. Anyone who is a Wagner fan and is interested in learning more about the man should pick this book up - if for nothing else, the picture on the back cover is tremendous."},{"Title":"Exorcisms and Ecstasies","review":"This nearly 500 page last collection by Karl Wagner testifies to his craftsmanship as a writer of horror and dark fantasy. His background as a psychiatrist is seen in several of his stories of twisted obsessions and lost souls.

He appears to read everything from the smallest privately-printed libertarian pamphlets to the cream of current cultural journals on either side of the Atlantic, and the works of the noblest present-day humanist thinkers worldwide, with the aim of furthering man's search for meaning in the fearful age of mass technocratic materialism, the atom bomb, and estrangement from the higher strata of man and nature alike. His moral touchstones - Socrates, the Bhagavad-Gita and Upanishads, Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi, Ortega, Arthur Morgan, Abraham Maslow - inspire him across four decades as he excavates weekly the philosophic and psychic roots of our present (dis)order: fear as a motivator; the replacement of religious dogma with the enthronement of a no-less chilling scientism; the constriction of the vessels of human nature with the straitjackets of biological and historical determinism; the Gordian knot of culturally-conditioned blood-lust, hyper-competitive hedonistic possessiveness and adolescent narcissism; the commonplace snuffing of the inner light of humane conscience via the craven libido to \\"fit in\\" to the structures of authority and not \\"rock the boat.\\" Robert Maynard Hutchins describes his subscribers as \\"the 2,500 most interesting people in the world\\"; and Maslow says that he is \\"the only small-p philosopher America has produced this century\\".He dies a few weeks after his final issue, aged 80.

Nancy and Michael's work is wonderful and I enjoy reading this book often. Their work shows us a whole new world that we may have never realized was there. Their love of the beauty found in the smallest details and the tiniest of creatures shines through in this book. It inspires me to do better photography. The book is well thought out and put together, as well as beautiful to look at. It covers not just the technical aspects of photography, but also the creative process required in this art. It is a very worthwhile purchase. I would recommend this book to anyone who is trying to take their photography to the next level. Between this book and John Shaw's \\"Closeups in Nature\\" you are set to go!"},{"Title":"How to Photograph Close-Ups in Nature","review":"I like this book, let me just say that. And everyone else seems to love this book. But to get real, I found this book to have too many pictures of what close ups you can shoot, and almost no pictures of the equipment she describes using, or of the positions people used to make the photos. And too much descriptive writing accompanying each photo. A bit too wordy for my taste, but I was able to take notes of the actual technical information that I was after which seems adequate for my needs. Yes buy the book for the info in it, it's good from that perspective."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Close-Ups in Nature","review":"This is a very good instructional book, from many angles.

The ideas presented here have shaped my understanding of subjects as diverse as the Bill of Rights, U. S. Mining Law, and the internet. Rather than offering a set model or structure for an ideal oraganization, Dr. Etzioni offers a standard by which any organization (or any change in society) can be measured.

It's ironic that the Christian doctrine of an eternally burning hell is the chief reason for Lincoln's rejection of Christianity; hopefully the Church will continue with wrestling with how a loving God can lose a war against evil and consign millions of normal, fragile human sinners to eternal flames.

I would definately refer you to my friends. Thanks for your great service.

With over 500 books to his credit (506, to be exact...go to asimovonline.com for the full list, if you don't believe me!), covering just about every subject in the Dewey Decimal System (except philosophy, I believe), the man was a real marvel. One of these 500 volumes, \\"Nine Tomorrows,\\" is a collection of short stories that Doc Ike first had published in various magazines during the period July '56 to November '58. As the title suggests, all nine tales deal with possible futures that may face mankind, and all feature the wit, erudition and clarity that are the hallmarks of every Asimov story/novel that I've ever read. The collection kicks off with the longest tale, \\"Profession,\\" in which Asimov presents a 65th century when one's vocation is determined by a kind of computerized psychological profile, and in which youngsters compete in Olympics-style games for plum jobs on other planets. But what happens if it is deemed that you're cut out for nothing at all? That's what happens to young George Platen, in this consistently interesting tale. (Asimov does make one rare goof in this story: George should be 20, not 19, by the story's end. Has anyone else noticed this?) In \\"The Feeling of Power,\\" Asimov tells us of a scientist who is actually capable of doing simple math problems on paper (gasp!), without the aid of a computer (!), and how the military minds of that distant century make use of these newfound skills. But the old ways of doing things lead to nothing but trouble, in this brilliantly cynical tale. Asimov has been called \\"the Agatha Christie of Science Fiction,\\" and in \\"The Dying Night,\\" a murder mystery of sorts, we see an early example of how he earned that title. A scientist lies dead, his papers on mass transference stolen, and three of his old school chums are suspect. This somewhat contrived story nonetheless leads to a satisfactory conclusion that most readers will never foresee. (The 1965 observations of Mercury, by the way, have dated the science in the tale, but this is certainly nothing that Asimov could have foreseen in July '56.) What is certainly the most humorous tale in the bunch comes next: \\"I'm in Marsport Without Hilda.\\" Written in Heinlein-like, tough-guy prose, this tale concerns a Galactic Service agent who must determine which of three men is attempting to smuggle a powerful drug out of the eponymous port. This one really had me chuckling out loud, and winds up very amusingly indeed. A most entertaining tale. In \\"The Gentle Vultures,\\" the author tells us that an alien race has been living on the Moon's far side for several decades, waiting for Earth's Cold War to blow up so that they might come to our aid...for a fee, of course. Asimov would have us believe that these folks are the source of the 1940s' and '50s' UFO's, and who knows...maybe he's right! Anyway, the interaction between the chimplike aliens and their kidnapped Earthling is very well done in this unique tale. In \\"All the Troubles of the World,\\" a computer is responsible for not only caring for everyone on Earth, but also for predicting and preventing crimes. Is it possible that this 1958 story was inspired in part by P.K. Dick's \\"Minority Report,\\" published two years before? Who knows? The story is very clever, though, and has a most touching ending. \\"Spell My Name With an S\\" shows how the smallest alteration in one's life can occasionally lead to great worldwide changes. A way-out surprise ending caps off another very clever Asimov short story. And then there's \\"The Last Question,\\" in which Asimov theorizes on nothing less than the end of the universe 10 trillion years in the future...and what might happen after that. This is a truly mind-expanding short story that offers much food for thought in its 12 pages. The collection wraps up with perhaps my favorite story of the bunch, \\"The Ugly Little Boy.\\" Here, a nurse is hired to take care of a 4-year-old Neanderthal tyke who has been plucked from the past by a scientific institute. The tale should be instructive to all those critics who have accused Asimov of being unable to depict convincing female characters. Nurse Fellowes is VERY well drawn, I think, with some psychological complexity and surprising maternal tendencies. The ending of this tale is nicely sentimental, and lingers long in the memory. Thus ends a really fine collection of stories from one of sci-fi's true masters. Trust me, you'll wish there were 20 tomorrows here, instead of just nine!"},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"Isaac Asimov, science fiction grandmaster and one of the absolute best writers in the field ever to wield a pen, wrote so much - and so much of high quality, at that - that it is difficult for a newcomer to his works to even know where to begin. This daunted me so much that, for a while, I dared not venture into Asimov's canon at all - doubtless, many others have done so as well. Now that I have finally started reading him, I regret that I didn't do it long ago. I urge - urge - you not to make the same mistake. Though Asimov wrote literally hundreds of short stories, this short and concise collection features some of his very best. Included in this collection are absolute masterpieces such as The Last Question (one of the Top 3 science fiction short stories of all-time, in my not-so-humble opinion); Profession (an excellent and very underrated story); The Dying Night (an excellent SF mystery that has been, alas, outdated by subsequent science, but is still enjoyable to the full); The Ugly Little Boy (a rare emotional moment for Asimov, and a great story at that - he called this his third favorite that he ever wrote); and Spell My Name With An \\"S\\" (a unique and clever story sprung from the lifelong trouble Asimov had with people adding an extra \\"S\\" to his surname.) This collection also includes several lighter pieces, which serve to fill space and lighten the mood. Very, very, very highly recommended to any fan of science fiction writing, an absolute classic and masterpiece of the genre."},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"Sci-fi grandmaster Isaac Asimov is at the top of his game in this collection of nine short stories. The first is &quot;Profession&quot;, which speculates on the nature of education in a future where the Earth is the technological center of a civilization of hundreds of populated planets. The story revolves around young George Platen, and the very special profession for which he has been selected. Asimov goes beyond describing the technology for imparting information and makes points about the everyman's preference for physical over social science, the nature of the creative mind, and how society findsways to placate the uncreative, including an event at the future Olympics. More menacing is the &quot;Feeling of Power&quot; in which an unassuming computer programmer discovers the lost art of arithmetic in a future society where only computers know how to do mathematics. Asimov shows how this discovery moves up the bureaucratic chain until it reaches the ears of those who knowhow to make use of it, but also makes a statement about scientific responsibility. &quot;The Gentle Vultures&quot; shows a non-competitive race that goes from planet to planet helping the survivors of nuclear catastrophe - until they encounter their first Cold War. And two of the very best tales deal with the burgeoning concept of artificial intelligence. &quot;All theTroubles of the World&quot; shows a society that relies too heavily on its guiding computer, while &quot;The Last Question&quot; is a totally unique story dealing with a theosophical question and featuring a conclusion that is perhaps the greatest in all science fiction.Although most of the stories were written in the 1950's, there's very little that's been dated by subsequent scientific discoveries, largely because this collection isn't about hard science so much as the relationships between far-reaching technologies and human society. The protagonists aren'tswashbuckling hero types, and they usually aren't even dedicated scientists single-mindedly pursuing knowledge; they're more likely to be &quot;little guys&quot;, ordinary working people with jobs to do, who when faced with something they should be helpless to combat, still summon up the courage to act during that one brief moment when they can make a crucial difference. Probably the most dated feature of this collection is its attitude toward women, who are frequently absent entirely, or serve only in the most stereotypical of roles. Only the touchingly sentimental &quot;The Ugly Little Boy&quot; treats a woman as anything like a real human being. Even so, the power of Asimov's ideasand the scope of his vision of the future have delighted readers for over half a century. If you haven't read these stories in other collections, you'll certainly want to catch them here."},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"Any one of the nine short stories in this volume would make their author's career. By assembling them in one volume it becomes immediately apparent that Isaac Asimov was the undisputed master of modern science-fiction. Asimov's style is perfectly suited to the genre--his writing style is plain and deceptively simple. Yet for all the simplicity of the writing the ideas remain profound.Asimov not only understood science and technology, he had a virtually prophetic vision of how science and technology would change the world. Our internet and cell phones would be no surprise to Asimov--he'd consider how far we have yet to go.PROFESSION: A fascinating study of a future society where one's profession is dictated by a computer according to a person's talents and aptitudes. Ideas that no longer look entirely futuristic.THE FEELING OF POWER: The guy can do math in his head! A wry take on the effects of computing power on personal computational ability.THE DYING NIGHT: A first-rate mystery story told in the milieu of science fiction.I'M IN MARSPORT WITHOUT HILDA: Like \\"The Dying Night\\" a story that demonstrates Asimov's ability to effortlessly cross genre boundaries.THE GENTLE VULTURES: Watch out for the humans. Take any work by any modern science fiction author--Asimov has already been there and has often done the story better.ALL THE TROUBLES IN THE WORLD: Artificial Intelligence issues that are still being debated today.SPELL MY NAME WITH AN S: About the societal impact of near infinite computing power and governmental intrusion into scientific research.THE LAST QUESTION: Wow. A mindblower. This one is easily among the best science-fiction short stories ever written. Asimov's take on intelligence and the future of the universe.THE UGLY LITTLE BOY: Time travel and human experimentation are combined in this gem that teaches us that our essential humanity is more important than any scientific achievement."},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"Good collection of Asimov's short stories.

However, I recently read this short story collection again after some of its stories were referred to in another book I was reading, and I decided to put some words down.When I was a teenager, Isaac Asimov was my idol. I read everything of his I could lay my hands on and, considering how prolific he was, you can imagine that my shelves are still stuffed with his books--fiction, science, biography, autobiography. But, for one reason or another, though I never stopped admiring him, I stopped reading him once he passed away and no new books were forthcoming. After rereading this, I realize that that was a mistake.Asimov was a master of the science fiction short story. I was amazed as I was reading these stories, all originally published in the late 1950's, at how well they've held up. Yes, some of the relationships smack of fifties morality and, yes, some of the technology seems a little clunky in the twenty-first century. But it doesn't take much imagination to see Multivac in our modern computers, for example, or a small digital camera as the scanners in \\"The Dying Night\\".In fact, there's hardly a clunker here. \\"Profession\\", \\"The Ugly Little Boy\\", and the two Multivac stories, \\"All the Troubles in the World\\" and \\"The Last Question\\" remain some of my favorites, outside of the robot stories. I'm sorry to say that I've missed out on too much of the science fiction of the past decade; however, I hope anyone coming to science fiction now doesn't miss out on the masters of the Golden Age, like Heinlein, Clarke, Bradbury, and, of course, Isaac Asimov. This short story collection would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"\\"Nine Tomorrows\\" is a collection of nine classic sci-fi short stories by Isaac Asimov. For those unfamiliar with him, Asimov is one of the \\"grand-masters\\" of science fiction and his writing (up through the 60s in particular) is amongst the very good or great of sci-fi writing...I think this collection is as good a place as any to start with his works.The collection starts out with its longest piece, \\"Profession,\\" a satisfying story with a nice mystery behind it that could easily have been adapted into a screenplay. Nearly all the additional stories are also very good (and several are excellent) - dealing with such topics as philosophizing on a man's future dealing with increased technological advances, such as more and more powerful computers...to our ability to wipe out each other with ever increasing more powerful weaponry. Overall, this collection is the kind of storytelling that seems hard to find these days and is representative of the thought-provoking science fiction that came out of the 50s. In my opinion, Asimov always put the \\"science\\" (and logic) in science fiction - but his readings are also very accessible to readers.There are enough very good stories contained in here to warrant a 5-star rating for the book (it's also a rather short - but very \\"meaty\\" read - at 220 pgs). Even the stories that may not be of classic quality have clever/humorous endings. If you can get a copy of this I recommend it - your brain will thank you!"},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"Many of the skills that were needed for survival even 100 years ago are now largely lost to the mass knowledge pool. The people of that time would have found it difficult to believe that what was so critical to their lives would be rendered irrelevant in the future.The first two stories in this collection take that as their premise, in \\"Profession\\" the very act of reading is lost and in \\"The Feeling of Power\\", the ability to perform basic arithmetic has vanished with the advent of accurate, handheld computers. The first seems unlikely but the second is very real, as a math teacher, I have witnessed students going into a panic mode if their calculator is not working. The fact that the numbers are simple so the operations are easy makes no difference.In \\"The Dying Night\\" an eccentric if not mad scientist professes to have perfected a process of mass transfer and he openly brags to his former classmates that have returned to Earth from various planets and moons in the Solar System. When the mad scientist is found dead under questionable circumstances, all of the classmates come under suspicion. Sleuth Wendell Urth is consulted and using his supreme powers of deduction, the culprit is unmasked. The Urth stories are especially entertaining to readers that understand that the Urth character is Asimov poking fun at himself.\\"I'm in Marsport Without Hilda\\" is a space age rendition of story of the husband out of town without his wife and looking for some action. He finds it when he makes contact with Flora and then is called into emergency service to solve what could be a monumental drug-smuggling syndicate. Solving the crime turns out to be easy, the woman problems are a more complicated situation.\\"The Gentle Vultures\\" is an unusual twist on the benevolent alien observers of humanity theme. An advanced space traveling species has set up bases to observe Earth and are willing to help, the problem is that their help will only come after there is a major nuclear war on Earth. In their experience with other species, once nuclear weapons are developed, they will be used in a massive war and then the \\"Vultures\\" land and offer their assistance. Although it may appear to be the case, they are not malicious, truly believing that they are doing the right thing to advance a species.A very powerful and an ultimately all-powerful computer are the primary story points in \\"All the Troubles of the World\\" and \\"The Last Question.\\" In the first, computing technology has advanced to the point that the Multivac computer is the only real authority on Earth and it is able to predict the potential actions of people. By taking pre-emptive action, nearly all crime has been eliminated so law enforcement is little more than watching the output of Multivac and responding accordingly. However, being the repository of all the individual problems of humans has created a personality disorder in Multivac and it becomes the source of a potentially catastrophic crime. In \\"The Last Question\\" Multivac becomes the ultimate computer, existing in several dimensions and finally it is merged with the very fabric of space and the spiritual existence of all humans. When the universe reaches the point of heat death, Multivac realizes that it is the ultimate power in the universe so it acts like it.\\"Spell My Name with an S\\" is a basic story about simple changes having significant results. Marshall Zebatinsky is an American man that wants to have a greater impact in the scientific world. To placate his wife, he consults a numerologist, only to discover that the man is actually a statistician so his skepticism is slightly alleviated. When the consultant recommends that he change the spelling of his last name to Sebatinsky, he dismisses the advice yet follows through with it. The change turns out to be significant as it is the height of the Cold War and since there is a prominent Soviet scientist with the name Zebatinsky, this causes the speculative causality wheels in the American intelligence types to churn and generate hypothetical reasons for the change. This is an excellent parody of the Cold War mentality that interpreted even trivial events as major challenges.\\"The Ugly Little Boy\\" is one of Asimov's best short stories. A scientific establishment manages to establish a stasis field that allows them to bring items from the past to the present. Their first attempt brings a young Neanderthal boy forward in time. Miss Fellowes is hired to be his nanny and while others find him repulsively ugly and call him ape-boy, she quickly grows to love him, naming him Timmie. When Timmie proves to be capable of being educated, she realizes that returning him back to his native environment would be a death sentence so in an extremely selfless act, she returns with him.In these nine stories, Asimov conclusively demonstrates that he is truly a grand master of science fiction; the tales are imaginative and in some cases have been proven plausible."},{"Title":"Nine Tomorrows: Tales of the Near Future","review":"All of the stories are good.

My copy of this book is published in india in 1983 &amp; subsequent publications may have a different format, but my copy is not the sort of book that you can open up at a page, &amp; simply copy a pose by looking at a picture, some of the newer yoga books i have noticed follow this &quot;easy&quot; format which is weak in content &amp; high in glossy pictures.. this book is very rich in content - be prepared to spend some time reading in detail about useful background information as well as the poses &amp; their effects &amp; various techniques for achieving a pose."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"If you want to learn about hatha yoga, this is a wonderful book written by Mr. Iyengar's daughter. She writes about the philosophy of yoga, how the poses fit into it, about the poses themselves, and the benefits and cautions for each, along with suggestions for a daily practice. It has detail on yoga practice for women, and since most people with Geeta Iyengar's experience and expertise are men, it is nice to get her perspective- but it is just as good for men who want to learn more about yoga. There are many pictures of the poses, including the ones meant to be done during pregnancy. If you want to learn more about practicing yoga during pregnancy, this one has a whole chapter on the subject. I used this book and the advise of my teachers during both of my pregnancies, and both my babies and myself were/are exceptionally healthy."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"This is a reference guide written by Geeta Iyengar, daughter of BKS Iyengar, probably the most famous living yogi. The book is designed specifically for women who wish to develop their own self-study of yoga (Yoga Sadhana), and it covers not only asanas (postures) but also the other vital components of traditional yoga such as pranayama (breath) and meditation.Geeta is clearly a master yoga practitioner who has created a comprehensive, thoughtful manual, but her book was not at all what I was looking for. Although I have practiced yoga at home for over two years, I was overwhelmed by the level of detail in the book. In addition, I found it difficult to follow, partly because the author uses only the original Sanskirt names for the poses and partly because the visual guides to the poses were all placed at the end of the book (rather than interpersed side-by-side to the instructional information included throughout).This book would definitely not be appropriate for the casual, Westernized yoga practitioner, especially not someone who is using yoga primarily as a form of fitness. However, for someone who wishes to extend their yoga practice beyond the poses as well as to connect with yoga's original Eastern roots, this book may be ideal."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"I first got this book from the library when I was waiting to have surgery for uterine growths. I had never done yoga, and I was looking for a way to ease my pain. This book can actually help with many mild medical conditions. It is set up in an easy to reference way, with lots of pictures and clear, detailed descriptions. Many of the positions even have 2 possible methods, one for the novice, and one for the advanced student. This is great when you are first starting out and you lack flexibility.My favorite thing about the book is that it allows you to look up positions by name and by function. If you want to ease back pain, or just get more flexibility in your back, you can reference moves that aid the spine. There are even suggestions for building a routine.I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"This book, written by the daughter of the famous teacher, B.K.S. Iyengar, is a nice enough reference book but would not be my first choice for a beginning North American yoga student. It contains brief, rather dry, descriptions of yoga philosophy (neither engaging for a novice nor sophisticated enough for a serious student of yoga). The book contains many useful black and white photos of yoga poses. There is a good section on yoga during pregnancy.However, this book is not as visually appealing as many others on the market. There are several recently published yoga books with large color photos that lie flat for use during practice and which have more readable text. For example, Mira Mehta, a long time student of B.K.S. Iyengar, has a couple of nice books. I particularly like her book, How to Use Yoga. Mr. Iyengar, himself, has written many books, and his new book, Yoga: the Path to Holistic Health, is lovely."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"Great book! Very practical information. I have bought this book when I was pregnant. I was not confused what I can or what I can not during pregnancy.

It has basic information for all women in all their life stages. From Puberty to Menopause, Geeta lays a foundation for a sound and healthy yoga practice which can help ladies everywhere connect to their own inner Goddess. This is an important contribution to any yogini's (or male yoga teacher) library."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"This book is a great resource for women. The only problem is that the photos of the asanas and their descriptions are in different parts of the book and you have to use the index to find them. Still, I heartily recommend it.

Iyengars daughter, I had high expectations of what I wanted to learn from this text and it delivered. Geeta Iyengar's book reaches to the depths of philosophy, technique and essential elements of yoga for women. This book really is a gem. I personally feel as though there is a goddess movement emerging with yoga right now. Yoga Woman is a good place to start if you don't know what I'm talking about. With yoga being traditionally for men and classically written by men for men, it was a breath of fresh air to read about Geeta's personal experience with yoga for transformation from childhood on. The book makes yoga practical and simple, available to women of all ages and physical capabilities. For me, it's especially useful since most of the classical texts all the way up through the past few decades don't really address women's issues since we were originally exlcuded to include various stages of development, menstruation, hormones, physical capabilities, emotional and psychological pressures, childbirth and all the roles we play in life as a woman. How do you evolve and use yoga as an in depth tool to go beyond societal limits? The expression conveyed in this book is a darn good starting point. Classic. A must read for serious practitioners, men and women alike."},{"Title":"Yoga A Gem for Women","review":"This book is great and really deals with specific items dealing with women (i.e. asanas for menstruation, pregnancy, etc. There are pictures and even though they're black & white, they are great and help to show the alignment.

Wonderfully comprehensive album of photographs at the back of the book explicitly showing the postures and the primary steps for achieving them. References to the pursuit of a spiritual practice are woven throughout but gently so: for those who are wary of this aspect and wish to attain only the physical benefits in a yoga practice, this is no deterrent. As daughter to BKS Inyengar, the individual credited with bringing yoga to the world beyond India, Geeta Iyengar's knowledge and experience of yoga is inordinately in-depth and her approach to explicating the practice reflects this rounded and rich knowledge. I highly recommend this book to all women practitioners of yoga or prospective ones, of any and all ages.

Though not a deep and moving book (which I appreciate) it does provide many inovative ideas about possible (if improbable) alien species; their lovable too. You really get into saving the aliens and bagging the bad guys, all in the Retief fashion (two fisted diplomat, James Bond in space?), of course.Lots of laughs."},{"Title":"Retief's War (Jaime Retief Series #3)","review":"The secret to the Retief series is their strong tongue-in-cheek attitude. Taken at face value, the unimaginative reader might stumble over the sub-moronic aliens, the unlikely settings, or the fact that reality seems to often stand on it's head, for no obvious reason. But if you read these series as a parody of the James Bond series, then you can relax and enjoy the experience.And the subtext of Mankind as having a noble, heroic streak is the best ego boost I get from Sci-Fi. Let other authors portray humans as weak, greedy, venal, flawed : Laumer's Retief is a hero in the strongest sense of the word. If the future holds people like Retief, then maybe Mankind will survive to grow out of our weaknesses."},{"Title":"Retief's War (Jaime Retief Series #3)","review":"_Retief's War_ (1967) is the third Retief book and the first Retief novel. It was originally a three-part serial in _If_ in 1965 and was accompanied by some handsome Jack Gaughan illustrations. I have always felt that the ideal length for a Retief story is that of the short novelette. When you stretch a Retief piece to novel length, you become more aware that the characters are cardboard and that the plot is all external action rather than internal conflict. Yet Laumer does better with the novel than you might expect.Part of the appeal of the novel is the snappy dialogue:\\"Closer attention to your _Daily Bulletin from the Bird's Nest_ ,\\" [Magnan said], \\"would go far toward homogenizing your thinking on the subject.\\"\\"I thought that was something they did to milk.\\"\\"The term refers to a voluntary alignment of viewpoint of group-oriented polarity; a sort of moral horsepower for maximal thrust toward the objective.\\"\\"I'm not sure that pasteurized thinking is rich enough in intellectual vitamins to satisfy my growing curiosity about what Ikk is up to.\\" (23)Another asset is the color of the setting. It is a jungle-filled planet populated with a large number of creatures who are part chiton, part wheels, part machines. The plot centers around one rascally race called the Voions who have been given police powers by the Diplomatic Corps and who are on the verge of taking over the planet. Thrown into the mix are a would-be dictator, a group of Terran rum traders, a spaceship full of beautiful girls that has crashed in the jungle, a number of bungling ambassadors, some villainous and calculating Groaci, several tribes of cannibals, some giant flying carnivores... and, of course, the unflappable Jame Retief. Laumer manages to juggle enough of these colored balls so that you are at least partly distracted from the limitations of the novel. Good, light fun."},{"Title":"Retief's War (Jaime Retief Series #3)","review":"Keith Laumer is admittedly an acquired taste, and not for everyone. Retief, in particular, requires an open mind. Laumer has a keen wit and vast field experience in the U.S. Diplomatic Corps, upon which experience he draws heavily. This is speculative fiction and satire at its best - you have to sit down with the mindset that this is keen, biting satire - set in a 27th century James Bond environment... think 007 with a nucleonic blaster instead of a Walther-PPK, but an even keener biting wit. Take it at face value and you're stuck with the sad experience of the poor, unimaginative one-star reviewer. Go in with an open mind, and you're in for a genuine treat. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Retief's War (Jaime Retief Series #3)","review":"Retief, the resourceful and indomitable diplomat who faces countless dangers in the service of the Corps Diplomatique Terrestienne, is on the planet Quopp, with its many forms of wheeled and rotored inhabitants. The Voion, one of the races, have been selected by the CDT to set up a planetary government to replace the cheerful chaos the inhabitants enjoy. Unfortunately, the Voions idea of peace is subjugating or exterminating all the others.Retief has his hands full setting up a counter-revolution to oppose the Voion, leading the army, rescuing ten Terran females lost in the jungle and preventing the execution of the whole Terran embassy. His longtime nemeses, the five-eyed Groaci, put in an appearance, getting their sticky fingers in where they aren't wanted.Light-hearted, silly, funny and fast-moving, filled with the evocatively-named embassy staff (Ambassador Longspoon, Commander Underknuckle), aliens with strange speech patterns and bizarre forms, Laumer throws jabs at diplomacy and meddling in other countries' affairs that probably come from his personal experience in the Diplomatic Service."},{"Title":"Retief's War (Jaime Retief Series #3)","review":"I got this by request for my son's birthday.

This book is utterly terrible."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Good book... well worth the read. This book is an interesting mosaic of genres - part (mostly) shoot 'em up war/western, part romance (read sex) and part political statement. Could this story really happen? Perhaps. Unfortunately, it would probably take an apocalyptic catalyst such as happens in this story to generate the public upheaval necessary for &quot;true patriots&quot; to make it so. Without that, Johnstone's societal vision wouldn't get off the ground. It may be tried from time to time, but only by cults, kooks and wacko survivalists. There is lots to learn from Johnstone's political statement in this book, but it IS fiction."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Out of the Ashes Is a must for anyone who cares about the government, the law and what happens with a nuclear war. I started in the middle of the Ashes Series and went back and bought them from the 1st Out of the Ashes and just ordered (5) more. They are the best survival books I have ever read. They are the best books for people that are getting tired of the way the government runs our lives. They have great characters and very exciting situations in all of the books. I can only hope if this ever happens in real life we will have a Ben Raines to help us start over. I have told many people about this series and encourage others to do the same. If nothing else, the books gave me a sense of hope for our future if we wake up!"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"At the time of this writing I have finished the first 27 books of the original series, and have started on book 28. I will not go into the premise of the story, that has been covered quite adaquately in previous reviews. And, I agree with many of the criticisms: Johnstone's writing is uneven. Most of his characters are 2-dimensional. There is much gratuitous violence and perversion. He goes over the top in portraying liberalism as BAD and his own flavor of conservatism as good. Anyone who has listened to the extreme Liberals in government with an objective ear, though, knows Kennedy, Carville, et al, go over the top themselves with their own - as Johnstone would put it - hankey-stomping snits. The major media, being the lapdogs of the Left, obediently report every word, every pronouncement while hardly ever checking the facts. I think Johnstone's counter attack of antiliberal rants echos what many of us who feel disenfranchised by the media want to say.Later books get strange, with the mutants, night people, and the Prophet's popping up from time to time. Some portions of the later books get downright boring. The series, as a whole though, is worth reading. Tri States, and the SUSA are places where I'd like to live. Johnstone gives us an ideal to look toward, in the world where even so-called Conservatives ignore the Constitution.Out of the Ashes opens the door to the Tri States philosophy. Maybe we can work toward that same return to common-sense government in the real world."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This is really a rather good example of the genre. This is a post apocalyptic thriller were the bad guys take over after the collapse of civilization and the good guys, led by Ben Raines, are always outnumbered but rarely outfought.The story is not rushed and Mr. Johnstone takes his time telling the tale the way he feels it should be told. I found the pacing and narration to be thoroughly enjoyable. The politics of the main character, Ben Raines, feature prominently in the book. The politic theories held by Ben are rather interesting. Ben appears to be a kind of Social Conservative. In Ben's world if you killed your neighbor then that night your other neighbors would probably judge you and kill you. If you raped your neighbor's daughter your neighbor would have the right to take you out in back of the barn and beat you within in inch of your life. Every person would not only be allowed firearms but be expected to be trained in them and serve in the army. Men and women are treated equally in politics, familial structure and the military. On the other hand, capitalism is allowed but controlled as to make sure that money continues to flow through the system and wealth hoarding is discouraged.I really enjoyed this book. There are 25 other books in the series, thus far. The other books are also pretty good but after 26 books the plot is starting to get a tad repetitive. They are still good but it is very hard to maintain tension and suspense along with originality for that long.A good book. Read it not only for the action and battles but also for the interesting social, political commentary."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This book is what started almost a cult following. It is definately not for the left wing portion of the citizenry.WWJ writes a pulp fiction style book about the obligatory post-apocalyptic world, and how a determined group of warrior idealists try and return to civilized society.The book isn't so much a work of fiction as it is an outlet for WWJ's political philosophies. Sadly enough, a large portion of what he says about the government is very true, and many of the flaws he points out are undeniable.The book is an excellant read, and the follow up books in the series are unnecessary, but decent reads nonetheless."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This book makes you stand back and think about our current form of government and the way the people are treated.

The dialogue I found to be incredibly forced in many spots. The characters are mere caricatures, over-the-top extremists with little thought to complexities most people exhibit. Of course, perhaps the book is ABOUT extremism, but it doesn't read like it--the extremists on one side have found the \\"one true way\\" and everyone else is tragically, utterly wrong. Not a complex treatment of any of the topics presented. The description of the world blowing up, often the more gripping parts of this type of fiction, is afforded little attention.Merely average, basically."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Ben Raines in the Ashes Series is the man that most men deep down want to be. Despite the liberal reviews it has gotten it touches a part of our ego in a way only Johnstone could write it. It is harsh and it is believable and that scares the hell out of most people. To all the liberals outt there watch out if the bottom ever does fall out. You would be lucky to have a leader rise up half as tough and compassionate as Ben Raines.

Ben Raines seems to be a reflection of William Johnstone, thus adding a lot of depth to the character. Johnstone manages to put the reader right in the middle of the war, and its aftermath, plunging the reader into a world where chaos exists. However, there is a desire to see things set right, and Ben Raines is the man for the job. From punks to outlaws, Ben manages to strive victoriously to clear the way for the rebirth of the country, in the way it was meant to be. First of a series, &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is a terrific stand-alone novel, as well as an enticing beginning to a wonderful series. It is a book that I never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"America after a nuclear apocalypse? What a great idea! Not many writers are brave enough to tackle a subject matter like that, much less do it well. Sounds like an idea too big for one book? Have no fear, this is just book one in an ongoing series with continuing characters (currently 25 books and going strong!) If you don't agree with the author's political stance (an eye for an eye, let me live in complete freedom - the less government, the better), you might get annoyed with it. I rather enjoyed imagining a world where you truly get what you deserve. The book is chock-full of spys, action, twists, sex, humor, and moves very quickly. The simplicity of the writing didn't bother me, allowing me to finish it in 3 days. It also helps move it along.As for the reviewer from Chicago, I'm surprised (and confused) that even though you didn't like the book, you read &quot;seven other books&quot; in the series. I would think that (giving it a rating of 1) would have you staying far away from them... but 7 others !? I guess you are hooked - whether you like it or not - like the thousands of other &quot;Ashes&quot; fans around the world! As for your comments on people not joining the militia if they had problems with the government... it's already (and has been for a while) happening in the south, with certain groups having hundreds of members. Knowing about some of the battles in history, it is not unrealistic for a few thousand people to die on one side and only lose a few hundred on the other... great leaders win great battles.If you are tired of government and big business controlling 90% of everything in society, and would like to see what could happen without them, give this series a try. It's only in theory, of course, but it's a damn good one."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I'm usually a romance book reader, but I was curious & read the back cover & decided to give it a try, something different...I found the storyline & the dialogue to be very easy-to-read & the story rolled as if written by a 'real' person (if a bit preachy, but the guy sure knows what he believes in!). It's a great 'what-if' story of the ever-popular 'end of the world as we know it by nuclear war'. What if some of the people who are left want to band together, rebuild, create a society that enforces law-abiding, the right to defend yourself & your family, & live in peace ? No racism, no sexism, everyone works somehow, no free-loaders, everyone votes on the basic laws & majority is 90%, not 51%. Anyone who doesn't want to live there, can leave. Must leave. The main character hates 'scum, thugs & slime' of humanity, rape & murder are not tolerated, for any reason, justice is swift, & everyone learns, & carries, firearms, everyone from childhood is taught self-defense. Strong emphasis on Education: if your raise children to be productive, law-abiding citizens, they won't grow up to be 'racists' or 'thugs', or will know the consequences in advance. Age-old question: Would you rob someone or try to hurt someone, if you knew that they & all their family are armed ? Parents are required to teach their children clear right from wrong, so that they are not in doubt, anyone who doesn't do that, are kicked out. These people just want to live in peace & rebuild, health care for all, everyone pulls their share, only wants people who WANT to live there, they don't 'recruit' or 'force' citizenship, they just kick out anyone who doesn't want to follow the rules. No crime, no poverty, no slums...interesting concept.& in the end, the 'NEW' government after the 'big bomb' that starts back up can't handle an independant society, living separately, prosperous, & in peace. The other side of humanity: the people who want to dominate & control, destroy for their own purposes....If you believe in the death penalty for murder, rape & child molestation; the right to bear arms; & that governments usually tend towards corruption, then you will LOVE this book. If you are a bleeding-heart that thinks that violent criminals should be 'rehabilitated' & kept in comfortable prisons with cable & access to law libraries to find a loophole to get out, then you will HATE this book. or you will cheer for the 'bad' guys in it.....The descriptions of the landscape afterwards, the effects of the germ warfare on the survivors, & how the people that are left behind interact are interesting....(it is fiction & what-if, but you never know -- possible)The weapons talk/descriptions was not as 'cumbersome' as I thought it would be, if you LIKE guns, you will like all their talk & comparisons on which is best for which situation, but if you are like me & not very knowledgable about guns in particular, you can still read without getting lost.The places that he visits in his travels have interesting back-stories.One cheesy point -- the phrase 'out of the ashes' occurs ALOT in the story...will make you roll your eyes a few times....The girl in me found alot of the parts very sad & depressing, especially the parts that are very common among people, even in this 'advanced' day & age. i.e. it's EASY to be racist & HARD to be open-minded & fair. & when some people will work hard to rebuild & help others, there are always other people who will want to kill & destroy & ruin all their hard work & good efforts.....stuff like that....Definitely worth reading, but I don't think I will attempt all 34 of them....(well, maybe #2, & remember, I'm a GIRL, ha ha !!) :)"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I like the post-apocalyptic genre. Like reading, watching, and writing in it. Unfortunately, a lot of it is pap. After hearing much word-of-mouth about Johnstone and his \\"tri-states philosophy,\\" I hoped this would be one of the better flagships for the genre.The nuclear war is triggered by a coup-gone-wrong involving rogue military hawks (think Jack T. Ripper with scads of accomplices). Ben Raines survives the dirty bomb holocaust, as do many others...inexplicably (at first I thought it might have something to do with the wasp stings). He begins touring the ravaged southeastern region, intending to document the nuclear devastation for a memoir, but is unwittingly crowned the leader of a new resistance movement. Idaho, Montana and Wyoming become his empire. But he and his followers are headed for a showdown with the other 47 states.The opening act was rather tedious to wade through. I suppose the convoluted, improbable conspiracy plot was supposed to rivet me to the pages with suspenseful intrigue as it unfolded, but I really wanted to just skim. Once the missiles struck home, and we got into Ben Raines' point-of-view, it was smoother going.If Johnstone ever explained why some people survived the radiation and some didn't, I missed it. I thought it rather unrealistic that electricity was still on for so long after a nuclear strike, and that Raines never had trouble finding gas for his vehicles. There is some mention of looting, I think, but our hero never had any trouble finding weapons, ammo, gear, food or clean water. Also, just like Captain Kirk, women throw themselves at him pretty much everywhere he goes. Nubile, supermodel-looking women, of course who \\"don't like sleeping alone.\\" All but twice, though, Raines and his current squeeze intuitively sensed that their affair would only be casual and temporary...and that was just okie-dokie with both parties. Such is to be expected from the genre, I suppose.I can go on nit-picking for a while, but I'll try to limit my exclamations of disbelief to just two more elements:1) His dialog is just outright painful in many places. I have come to expect this problem with inexperienced/immature (yet passionate) writers, but am REALLY annoyed when I see a successful, traditionally published author...of a popular series, no less...getting away with it. How did this ever get published as is?2) Raines is a Vietnam veteran from a super-secret elite unit which, I guess, would supposedly surpass Delta Force. But at the story's inception he is an alcoholic novelist. Almost everyone he encounters has heard of him, and read his books. And everyone is convinced he is destined to be the savior who unites freedom-loving folks and builds a utopia out of the ashes. Evidently his greatness is plain for everyone to see--everyone but his humble self. He ignores the pleas for his elevation to leadership, but is finally drug to his destiny, kicking and screaming (OK, perhaps I exagerate a wee bit). His greatness is so powerful as to inspire slavish, blind devotion in all the good guys he encounters. Apparently his alcohol-heavy diet and lethargic lifestyle have kept him in supreme fighting condition, too. I don't have a PHD in Group Dynamics or anything like that, but I've studied history, observed the surrounding culture, and worked in/with conglomerations of human beings both in military and civilian contexts. Unless God himself elevated someone like Ben Raines to power (as He did with King Saul and David), that person would never reach the top of any leadership ladder. People who rise to power...even in regulated structures...are shameless self-promoters; supremely confident in their own abilities (no matter how undeserved that confidence is); \\"type A\\" personalities; charismatic; ambitious; control freaks; opportunistic; remorseless; proactive and outgoing. They usually aren't the best choice for leadership, and many times are the worst. But they will beat somebody like Ben Raines in an election, mob takeover or popularity contest (which is what such things turn out to be, beneath the surface, anyway) every single time. It doesn't matter how many dead military officers have endorsed you, or even if the majority of the mob thinks you're the smartest guy with the perfect plan. The guy with the magic mouth and the zealous conviction that he is the best possible man for the job will climb higher and faster. I've taken pains so far not to be harsh or personally insulting to Mr. Johnstone, but this Reluctant Savior routine reeks of a misfit writer's closet egomania.Up to now, I've also avoided commenting on the author's political ideas, which he unabashedly rams down the reader's throat throughout the novel. I won't discuss them in detail, because they're at least as convoluted as his expository chapters. But even while preaching racial equality, Johnstone strikes me as a bigot. He also takes periodic jabs at his Religious Right Boogeymen, denouncing the cult of personality embraced by their respective sycophants (kinda like what I touched on above). Meanwhile, his own cult of personality is the driving force behind the Tri-States kingdom. Hypocritical IMO. And while pontificating on his love of freedom, Johnstone/Raines build a utopia which is, in most respects, a totalitarian regime. So while I see all the problems in the USA that Johnstone saw, our viewpoint on feasible solutions are often radically different.Plot, character(s), dialog, realism and (IMO) political savvy in Out of the Ashes is seriously flawed.Henry Brown is the author of TEOTWAWKI aviation adventure The Delayed Blitz(Krieg), as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Johnstone is clearly a very talented and imaginative man. These books are truely invigorating. WWJ takes a single man from his imagination and turns him into a Legend. Ben Raines would be a true American Hero; strong, forceful, attractive and very sexy. Raines and his Rebels face danger at every turn and come out victorious almost every time. I am currently reading #9 &quot;Valor in The Ashes&quot; and I can't put it down. The excitement jumps at you from every page. And although it is something that may never happen, it is also very real. The way America thinks needs to change and Johnstone announces this in a very bold and caragious way. These books can be frightening to the left wing Americans because they don't want violence and guns in this world. But people need to wake up and smell the Willie Peter because we already have violence and guns!!!! Now all we need is Ben Raines and his Rebels to come to the rescue!!!

He also meets the occasional woman, herself a victim of gang rape or a witness to it, who quickly and eagerly decides to sleep with him and stay, temporarily and with affection, in his company. (Rape and racism are referred to and talked about a lot in this story.)He eventually heads west and becomes the leader (the setup for this role is provided) of a break away, racially diverse, government comprising Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming: the Tri-States. Despite the (one would think) devastation of nuclear and biological war, both the Tri-States and the reconstituted US government now under the control of a radical left wing senator seem to enjoy all the conveniences of the modern world. (This is not a story about a survivalist or survivors of a world-wide war coping with physical hardship.)The Tri-States government is utopian, militant, communitarian (it seems), and judicially very severe, yet with a slight mixture of libertarian principles (prostitution, for example, is legal). Education, however, is state controlled, Biblical (the implication seems to be that evolution is out, creationism is in, although there is no explicit suggestion of anti-science) and compulsory. Those who refuse to work are deported, their children confiscated by the state, and adopted. The laws of the Tri-States are determined by an approximately 90 percent majority, and so regarded as the true will of the people. Anyone who disapproves is free to leave. Anyone who stays is required to obey or suffer the unbending consequences.The US government, now at its worst as a tyranny, will not allow the Tri-States to exist separately from the 47 other states. Complications arise.(The novel preaches against bad politics and the government which bad politics creates and then presents an alternative, utopian, society, which is not laid out well enough to really understand. The nuclear war occurs within the story merely to allow the author to clear some land, create conclaves of lawlessness to show human nature at its worst, institute a US tyranny, and set up this preferred alternative society. It is a story about tyranny and freedom fighters. This book is the first in a series that is currently 30 novels long.)"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"A modern day retired Special Forces Soldier, Ben Raines, is certainly Smoke Jensen reborn. He certainly feels that his is the only one type of justice for evil people and that justice needs to be handed out swift and hard. In this story, after a germ and nuclear war, Ben gets to defend a Tri-State conservative area of the Rocky Mountains against the corrupt and liberal Remnants of what is left of the East Coast United States goverment.Good vs. Evil; right vs. wrong; it's all here with violence and romance. But the action really drags and the story slows with the describing of the \\"perfect\\" Tri-State government. If you don't mind skim reading, the ending is OK and good enough to get me to read the next story in the series; someday. \\"Preacher\\" is still my favorite Johnstone character with the early Smoke Jensen next."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"After reading this book and several others in the series, I have learned to treasure the rights I &quot;still&quot; have. The government is trying to take away our basic rights that the constitution gives us and there is not too many people who will speak up against this. However, William Johnstone is one of these people. In &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot;, Johnstone describes how the government's increasing control over us eventually leads to a revolution. Johnstone's main character, Ben Raines, is given the job of restoring america and he creates a new nation within a nation called the Tri-States. In this new nation, people make all of the laws, there is virtually no crime, and there is a plentiful supply of jobs for people who are willing to work.One thing I especially like is the fact that Ben Raines does not put up with crime or those people who are able to work but don't. The laws are straight-forward and easy to understand. The trails are quick and to the point, but fair. These are just some of the points that William Johnstone makes in this book. All in all, it will make you think twice about your rights and it will motivate you to defend the freedom's that we still have."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"If you are patriotic, and do not want to loose any more of your freedoms...this series (over 30 books!) is for you.This series has no middle ground.

I found the now 20 year old political views that swarm the book utterly fascinating, not always in a good way. The book is a not unusual (post) apocalyptic plot, flooded with political views interspersed with rather frank sex discussions. Rather too coarse to be interesting in my opinion, but I suppose that's personal view. No desire to read further into the series because the story line is not strong and not really what the author is bent on communicating. The author's website is kinda interesting, not seen anyone that prolific except certain romance authors. However, his stories are at that level... so I suppose it makes sense."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"this is probably one of the best books I have ever read.

Great for trips, walking the dog etc. Just wish it was on CD or downloadable."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This series is the most disappointing in my reading experience. After this book, which was mediocre, I started to read number 2 book in a lengthy series. The uncalled numerous foul language and lurid sex scenes detracted from what I thought was going to be a military thriller series. Needless to say, after the 2nd book, the 3rd was very similar and also repetitive in recalling scenes from the 1st 2 books in lengthy detail. I stopped reading the 3rd book after about 45 pages.Needless to say, I gathered up the rest of the 12 books I had purchased and not read, and put them out for recycling.In closing, I would like to state that this is my first 1 star review.Out Of The Ashes"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I read Out of the Ashes when it first came out and go back now and then to reread it. In fact, I've read all of Johnstone's books, since they're quick and easy reads, something for when you have time on your hands and want something to occupy your mind while waiting in, say, a doctor's office.For the most part, I agree with the TriState philosophy as regards big government, liberals and politicians; I just have a problem with how, whenever Ben Raines speaks, everybody drops what they're doing and listens to all he says with slavish devotion (what, there aren't any others around in his age group who couldn't expound on the same subject?). People, that's a cult, especially when Johnstone continually states that the movement will live on without Ben, yet whenever he's not around to lead, it all sort of goes to hell (none of them seems willing to follow Ike or Cecil unless Ben is there to enforce it).The inconsistencies in the series are irritating: Ben is 44 when the first Ashes book begins, in his mid-fifties when it ends, yet by the end of the series, he's described as being barely 50 years old. Even Lamar Chase manages to stay age 70; in fact, none of the main characters seem to age, or else age in reverse. Hmmm.Another inconsistency: In From the Ashes: America Reborn (my favorite book in the series), Ben talks about how morals were slipping and women were having illegitimate babies left and right; uh...I lost track of how many women Raines impregnated throughout the series, so either he wore alot of faulty condoms or else he always rode bareback (not smart, one would think, what with all the STDs around). And he has absolutely no interest in any of his children (a failing common with the main characters of his other books, think especially Preacher or Terry Kovak), other than Buddy. In fact, he cares more about his adopted kids than his natural ones.And finally 'all women love him desperately', especially his bodyguard Jersey. NOT a good trait in a bodyguard, since it clouds judgment. Always had me wondering if her ear was pressed to the keyhole at the bedroom door when he was entertaining a woman. Come to think of it, why did Jersey have to always be within 5-10 feet of him at almost all times, even at closed meetings with his most trusted advisors, weapon at the ready as if she suspected one of them would kill him?One more thing: That thing full of ammo that you insert in a weapon is a MAGAZINE, not a clip.In the end, I've enjoyed Johnstone's books as a momentary diversion, if nothing more, but overall, I much prefer the writings of his nephew, JA Johnstone, who's also a much better writer."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Read this back in the mid 80's and still very relevant today with our skewed liberal parties. Will again enjoy the series."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"The main character (Ben Raines)is your typical retired 'super soldier' type that's already been done to death. The bad guys are too retarded to take seriously. The characters all behave exactly like bad Hollywood cliche's and there's a serious lack of action in the book, unless you count the constant sex Ben Raines has with every single female he meets. Roughly two hundred pages of it use the characters for social commentary; mostly anti racist critique. The author obviously did little or no research on the actual effects of NBC warfare since there are absolutely no secondary effects from the use of such weapons; no poisoned earth, no EMP,no radioactive clouds, no mutant bacteria, nothing. The author explains this away with so called \\"clean bombs\\". This book does not really belong to the post apocalyptic genre; it is really more the authors' way of telling everybody what he would do with America were he at the helm, and in that he repeatedly advocates invading the privacy of home so he can brainwash peoples' kids. So if you love political tripe you'll love this book, but if you're looking for a good post apocalypse survival novel you might want to avoid this. I'd recommend 'Swan Song' by Robert McCammon."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"After the bombs go off we have a new world but same types of people so they beginning warring all over again.

I STOP AT ALL THE BOOKSTORES IN MY AREA SEARCHING FOR ONE I DON'T HAVE.PLEASE DON'T STOP WRITING THIS SERIES ANY TIME SOON.THANKS MATT"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I picked up this book after a recommendation from a friend to read when I was finished with my other reads. He warned me, \\"you'll be reading the rest of the books in the 32 book series\\". I told him I had heard it before, but \\"we'll see\\". Well, this is an excellent start to a series and I hope it continues.Set in the 80's the USA is on the brink of nuclear war with Russia and China, no thanks in part to a government and military with their own vendetta's and agendas of which direction America should head. The story centers around Ben Raines, a former special operations soldier turned into an alcoholic. The book documents and parallels Ben's struggle and choices he makes as an author to travel the US and view and report the aftermath of the nuclear holocaust. Little does he know, he has been hand-picked by a former colleague to head the largest rebellion against the newly un-elected, self-appointed government hell-bent on toppling the Rebels and anyone who stand in the corrupt governments way.The novel is similar to a number of other post-apocalyptic stories out there, the big difference being this author focuses more on what he already had and not from the focus of a survivalist who had been stocking food, ammo, and supplies for years. The author uses what he has found or what he can scavenge from other areas with his focus being \\"it would lay to waste and not be used anyways\\".The story can be graphic at times with depictions of shooting, rape, sex, and torture; however, consider the state of mind of people at that time after a holocaust. Civility would be a thing of the past and it would become a \\"dog eat dog\\" world. His dream of the Tri-State \\"oasis\\" can be a bit difficult to accept; however, the goal of creating a utopian based society with few rules mimicking that of the 1880's wouldn't be totally un-ideal if people of like mind all sought the same goal. 65,000 people strong? I'm not sure about it, but over 9 years I suppose the possibility could exist.Overall, the book is an excellent read, better than a number of other post-apocalypse survival novels I have read in the past. I have begun his second in the series \\"Fire in the Ashes\\" and plan to continue with the series as I like his style of writing.My recommendation? Purchase a good condition used paperback from Amazon and enjoy your read. This is a good book that will keep you engaged within it's pages."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"There's a delightful touch of &quot;otherworldliness&quot; in the first few books. There's the Prophet and references to final judgement days. These topics made the series more than just a shoot-em-up bang bang men's action series. Then, alas, these references were gone: the series turned into another hum drum blase' standard run-of-the-mill blow up the bad guys standard drivel. Oh well, I still re-read the first 6 books every other year. They're great!!!! as Tony the tiger says."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"That's just the stuff I have been looking for 20 years to read and collect. Johnstone is a master of adventure and thrills. The main characters of the ASHES series are fascinanting - you like them from the first page. Ben Raines is not a typical hero - he is just a man who shares his vision with his rebels - and of course with the readers. I have the complete ASHES series and can surely say that Johnston loves his job. He is a natural born writer! ASHES is good entertainment and a true page turner. Those, who still do not know ASHES - please try it- you won't be disappointed. It's a dark picture of earth's future, but in a way very realistic and fascinating."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"So what if this could never happen, it's still good fun. Don't take it seriously and just enjoy. If you're not careful, you might find yourself reading the next book in the series, then the next, then the next, and......you get the idea.

In my eyes the wrold would be better off with more Ben Raines in it. Mr. Jhonstone, my hats off to you on the great writing in in this book. Also if i'd like to say that this book kicks of the series with a bang, with great chacters, &amp; events, and i hope they keep on coming back..... i know i will."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"William Johnstone takes an excellent and sound political philosophy and wraps it into an exciting novel.Liberals will squeal and moan when they read this book, which is good.We need the Tri-States philosophy."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Johnstone's first book in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series is a survivalist's wet dream. It is chocked full of violence, stupid but sadistic bureaucrats and heroic rebels. The main character, Ben Raines, is a former special forces and mercenary soldier who has become an author. As the world falls down around him he puts his writings into practice in order to save what is left of humanity. He sets up his own country and then battles the resurected but evil US government.By the way, in all the &quot;Ashes&quot; books, all government officials are facists who sadisticaly rape, pillage, and plunder the countryside. Ben Raine's rebels on the other hand, practice what can only be called a kinder, gentler form of facism.Interestingly enough, the author's post apocolyptic world is characterized by nearly everybody but the rebels becoming sexual deviates. I don't know if this is caused by radiation or what but hardly 3-4 pages go by in &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; without someone being raped or sodomized. By the fourth &quot;Ashes&quot; book it is difficult to find anyone left in America be it man, woman, or child who hasn't been raped and/or sodomized. Every other page is ripe with the vivid discriptions of these atrocities. Of course it is easier to justify the excessive violence in these books by the author demonizing the bad guys as sadistic rapists. It just makes it that much easier for the rebels to kill the dirty buggers.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; is classic pulp fiction. It is excessively violent, and has some form of sex act (mostly rape) at least every 4 pages. It is assinine in it presumptions about society and simplistic in it's assumptions of human nature. Ironicaly, it is just the kind of book to appeal to the ignorant masses that are so despised by the hero of the book. The fact that there are now at least 28 volumns in the &quot;Ashes&quot; series with an almost cult following merely proves the point.&quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; while not good literature, is somewhat entertaining in an excessively violent, sexual perverted and moronic kind of way. Have fun!"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I bought this book in '83 or '84. I have enjoyed them all since.

Read this..."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Knowing that this is a work of ficton one should not take the events of how America was brought to its knees. But rather you should look for the deeper meaning of what is actually wrong in our country. If you are happy with the direction that this country is taking,,, do not read this book because you will not understand what Johnstone is trying to say. As a person whom has read every book in the Ashes series this is a great starting point to better understanding current problems in America. William Johnstone has taken an issue that every American should take notice of, and has offered us an entertaining medium of getting that message across."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I am not an atheist fundamentalist, or a political correctness freak. I wanted to preface with that. I also tried hard to view the book through the lens of the time it was written.It proved impossible. I like post-apoc fiction, but this book is easily among the worst I've read. It was a long Gary Stu projection by the author, where he gets laid every third page, all the women get raped and all the people besides him are immoral freaks. It was basically tired cliches from front to end, and I suppose that is to be expected when an author is a prolific in pulp as this guy is ... but if you want anything resembling a \\"real\\" fiction book, don't get this.It doesn't even hold up to mainstream stuff on the NYT bestseller list. Never mind actual \\"good\\" books. It seems very much like reading something I would have written in 8th grade in the 80's. which is fine, if you want your stories dictated through the eyes of a 15 year old boy in heat and whose literary experience entails reading reading fanfic on the imageboards. Not so great if you are over 18 and have half a brain.The book is among the worst I've ever read ... by far. How daft was I to buy the second one in the series as well before reading the first? Pretty daft I'd say. :("},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I think a previous reviewer put it best when he summed this book up as merely pulp fiction....good pulp, but pulp nonetheless.My first introduction to the Ashes series was when I was a junior in high school. As part of \\"The Day After\\" generation, I was always curious as to what would ever happen if....and this series of books piqued my tenth grade curiosity...Years go by and a nostalgic part of me vaguely remembers these books, but not the specific titles. After some research, I finally found them and as coincedence would have it, they are in re-print.But I digress, the storyline in the series is very basic. Ben Raines, the hero, survives a nuclear and germ warfare attack brought about by the diabolical machinations of extremists hellbent on destroying the present society to allow a better one to take its place. After some reluctance, Ben accepts his \\"fate\\" to re-build a society based on very strict values and he assembles together a group of like-minded individuals for this purpose. The \\"good\\" guys are Ben Raines and his rebels, the \\"bad\\" guys are the US Government, the press and any other citizen who disagrees with Mr. Raines' views.The plot is simple, the characters are even simpler and the writing is mediocre, at best. But the story is damn entertaining, assuming you can take Mr. Johnstone's over simplified social and political diatribes with a grain of salt. These books conceivably could have been made into top gossing action films (Hell, Rambo did)... meant to entertain, not elighten."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This book deals with alot of problems in America today. Although it doesn't come right out and say that things need to change it does lead you around the edges of it. This book is fast-paced and full of action, It might start off confusing you but don't worry the book gets better the entire way through right up till the end."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"\\"Out of the Ashes\\" caught my attention immediately, being a big fan of apocalyptic novels and a closet fan of disaster novels. Although the Ashes storyline starts out typically, with nuclear war looming and double and triple crosses being played out all around the world, the novel slowly turns into a lengthy sermon that is likely to have political liberals fuming and conservatives and libertarians like myself hiding in shame.It's not just that the author espouses his views, it's just that the views are so one-sided and childish. The additional shame of it is that the author's attitude toward the political aspects of the story and one-sided mindset seep into every aspect of the novel. Everyone who agrees is angelic and justified, everyone who disagrees is stupid, savage and unenlightened.Paper thin characters and generalizations abound in this story, especially when the author writes about women. All women are either raped and helpless, sexually promiscuous and devious or just sexually promiscuous. If, as some have suggested, the author identifies himself with the main character, he must have an incredible libido and be irresistable to women. Or maybe just a case of extreme wishful thinking.The dialogue is weak and repetitive, especially in the showdown scenes between the main character and various bad guys.The only thing that saves this novel from a 0-star rating is that the storyline (when removed of the grade school ideology) is interesting (a splintered United States trying to reunite) and that it's pure pulp fiction fun. If anyone has seen Starship Troopers, you'll know what I'm talking about.So if you're looking for a well-written, thought provoking novel, this is not it. If you're looking for pure pulp fiction with a ton of sex and violence where good and bad are easily defined, look no further than the 25+ books of this series."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"Premise was good. But the thing that bothered me the most was the stupid \\"sexual\\" conquests. I was just put off with his hands \\"going down the tangle of her pubic hair\\" or \\"into her wetness\\". Heck this guy was the Terminator and Hugh Hefner rolled into Francis Marion and Thomas Jefferson. Then the stilted conservative speeches that passed for conversations and background made me cringe. As a believer in the free market and 2nd amendment I found this 7th grade writing project an embarrassment for \\"my side\\". I've read Lucifer's Hammer, Alas Babylon, Earth Abides... and many others. This was pathetic. I've finished half the book and can't get past the hand grenade trick in a Georgia roadblock. I haven't read it but I can guess that he's going to screw the liberal \\"ACLU\\" supporter over to the Libertarian side of life. I'll sell my copy and the two following books that were given to be as gifts when I mistakenly put this book on my wish list. How did this guy sell so many books like this? This is a great country.

I've noticed it described as &quot;survivalist literature,&quot; which --though an oxymoron-- is probably as accurate as anything could be. I was surprised to find out that the author was an adult when this was written. The simple plot, the terrible dialogue, and the walking stereotypes that pass as characters made me assume it was written by a high school student... and not one from the gifted program. The scary thing is that Johnstone has written so many sequels. With the ultra-right element so vocal in America these days, I imagine it really does pass for literature among the militia types. Btw... I bought the sequel, thinking it might get better. It doesn't. It actually gets worse. And after reading this one, that's hard to believe."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I really tried to finish this book, after all I paid good money for it and I like post-apocalyptic fiction, but this book is just ridiculous. I kept hoping that it would get better but by the time I was half way through I realized it was only getting worse.

I remember enjoying them. Not so much now. I have grown, my politics and my world view has expanded. My self awareness and training have reached an advanced level in many areas.This book is still a fun read, but the whole thing is a cliche. It would be the equivalent of the \\"Commando\\" movie while books along Patriots, Jarkata Pandemic and One Second After would win Academy nods.First the stuff that is not so good:The story is based on a military coup involving the USA, China and Russia that ends in biological and limited nuclear warfare. Special Forces groups discover this prior, but somehow let the war happen. The main character is former SOG that survives by being in a coma due to wasp stings during the exchange.Then he happens to bed every lady he meets. Even the ones that hate him, and they love him for it. Yeah, right.His choice of weapon is a Thompson .45, even over M-16s (the book is a bit dated). His ideas on combat and self defense are suicidal.Now the things I like:Ben is a cool character for this type of fiction. He is a typical macho my way dude.Not someone I would get along with for lenghts of time, but fun to imagine in the situations presented.The action is evenly spaced and fun to read.Politically and socially I agree with a good portion of the main characters motivations and words.Save your money and borrow this from the library.

The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to follow. Then the book degenerates into basically the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights.

Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"While this is the first review I have ever wrote I'm sure my opinion will vary.

Not very many far fetched ideas or acts that seemed stupid. The \\"sex scenes\\" were too graphic for younger crowds. I look forward to the next book in the series. I just hope that they don't get stretched out for to long and start to fade.YMMVJohn"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I've read all of the Ashes series, as well as every other book by Johnstone. The author is not trying to win an award for literature. His purpose for writing his stories is a warning to the reader about the inevitable results of the direction of our country.The most harsh critics of Johnstone's books attempt to dismiss his warnings as something only simple-minded extremists would seriously consider. These critics are in denial; they are fearful that there really is a group of Americans who would break away and start their own nation and establish their own set of laws. These critics have reason to fear. Johnstone's Ashes series is prophetic in the sense that we have no leadership with vision and we have a citizenry without the backbone to stop the government from creating such an outcome.When it comes, I will be with SUSA. There will always be critics and whiners. I would rather be part of something great that has no chance of winning than to lie down and let the left turn our republic into another failed socialist experiment."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This is by far my favorite novel of all time.

The story continues with the day-to-day survival of people across the country. Ben Raines eventually ends up recruiting a base of survivers and sets up a new state- Tri-State. This is where the book goes downhill; it goes downhill fast, in a very short period of time. He sets up his state and turns it into a conservative-utopia (an oxymoron in itself). A barbaric society results. A society with very few morals. A society that at times reminded me of Orwell's 1984.

Ben Raines and his army go around America distributing Uzi's to farmers and telling them to fight. Yeah, right. Johnstone seems to think this SUSA army is invinvcible, going around America killing hundreds of thousands of criminals and losing something like a few hundred Rebels. He seems to think everyone is fed up with the American goverenment. While we may have our problems with it, we would not just go and join some Soldier of Fortune militia. If a real life &quot;Raines&quot; ever took his army and formed a new country he would be smashed by Americans who wouldn't put up with that kind of crap. &quot;Raines&quot; real army would be filled with a bunch of military rejects.

The writing is barely above the fourth grade level, the characters are cardboard cutouts and the kindest thing that can be said about the plot is that it's absurdly choppy and uneven. The political views espoused by the author are so bizarre as to define explanation. The protaganist is presented as a far-right conservative who proceeds to excorciate the rich for failing to support the poor and seems to champion near-communistic wealth redistribution. Huh? Despite a right-wing, 'superpatriot'-initiated, worldwide military coup that has brought on armaggedon, every character is happy to blame the evil liberals for everything that has ever gone wrong in the history of the world. But it's not just the politics that make no sense: picture the scene where the protagonist calmly loads up on .45 ammo at a sporting goods store after complaining loudly several pages earlier that those damn liberals outlawed all personal firearms over three years ago. Johnstone creates such a lame apocalypse that the electicity is still on and his characters can cheerfully get gas at every gas station a full ten days after the nukes landed. If you absolutely must read right-wing, post-apocalyptic survivalist paperbacks, do yourself the favour of checking out James Axler's Deathlands books instead of this irredeemable drivel. Still, I have to give credit when it's due: most of this book is unintentionally hilarious."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This book is beyond description. It reads like an eighth grader wrote it, but without the deep thought of said middle schooler. The action is jumpy, the text almost pure exposition, and over half of the book is devoted to an extended rant/diatribe. And even the diatribe is unorganized, jumping from &quot;get tough on crime&quot; speeches to the main character's desire to &quot;screw&quot; a reporter he sees on television. All this being said, I couldn't put it down because I couldn't stop laughing. If you've ever wanted to look at truly bad pulp fiction with no attempt at organization or editing, be sure and pick up this book. I also enjoyed the author's musings on the coming race war.

Despite its glaring problems, the movie has become wildly popular. This book has lots in common with Mr. Wood's opus.I wont detail all the problems with \\"Out of the Ashes\\". The writing is shoddy, the plot is silly, there are tons of logical errors and the political/moral philosophy Mr. Johnstone seems to advocate is disjointed and childish. The action sequences are often decent but you have to put up with multi-chapter rants between scenes. All this makes for a novel so wretched and horrible you just cant put it down!A word of warning though. This book is actually the first of a series that tells the tale of super-patriot Ben Raines' effort to rebuild America as it should be in a post-apocalyptic world. Ive read a couple of the installments. The strange charm one can find in the first book does not carry on to later novels in the series. Dont bother with the rest of the \\"Ashes\\" series. They have absolutely no redeeming qualities."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"I read \\"Out of the Ashes\\" a long time ago and could not remember much about it, so I ordered it on Kindle. Right now I am burning through various \\"apocalypse now\\" novels, and I wanted to see how this old soldier stacked up. The answer is, not well. This novel has not aged well and was not very good when it first came out. First of all, there is a lot of racist language in the book. I understand that the author was trying to be authentic and that some people really do talk that way, but it got so bad that I could not deal with it. That and long diatribes by the book's protagonist, Ben Raines, on his theory of how the various ethnic groups in America can, should, or cannot, get along are pretty awful. About 2/3 through this novel I realized that I was not enjoying it and was in fact completely put off by it.Even for readers who are not bothered by the constant ethnic diatribes, this is not much of an \\"end of the world as we know it\\" or \\"survivalist\\" novel. There is almost no detail in here about how people might survive a nuclear war (the cause of the apocalypse in this particular novel.) Basically, if you believe the author, people quietly die, there are lots of cars, gasoline, grenades, guns, food, and other goodies left around for the inexplicable survivors, and everyone can just get down to the serious business of killing and fornicating. Pretty dull really. \\"Patriots\\" and other novels of this genre are infinitely better than this one. There is almost no \\"survivalism\\" in this novel. Everything is just there, including bad guys to be killed every 20 pages or so.I know that there are almost countless novels in this series, so some folks obviously like it. I tried to like it but cannot, hence this negative review.

Along the way, he hooks up with a group of survivors, and together they form a nation without crime, poverty, or injustice.Of course, the Washington liberals can't tolerate that, and destroy it.The book is over the top and sometimes thin, it's still a good lead into an exciting series."},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"This book makes an attempt to validate the most exasperating elements of the far right and far left.

Set in a decadent America (much like today), story portrays development of &quot;Tri-States&quot; philosophy of government--government truly by the people, with simple, easy to understand laws, enforced to the letter.

This book is among the worst I've ever read, not only of that small sub-genre, but of books in general. Why?-the dialog reads like the fantasy of a teenager c. 1979-the plot is even worse-it slides from \\"gun porn\\" (boring, needless details about the internal workings of the Thompson sub-machine gun) to some of the worst sex scenes written since the script for Barbarella-it's sexist (and not in an interesting way)-it's racist (and not in a provocative way)-it's deeply hypocritical in its politics, ethics, and morals-it's so poorly written it will make your teeth hurtI stumbled on this book by accident (by searching the keyword \\" apocalypse\\" at the public library). I was surprised to find not one, but a whole series of books that I had never encountered, especially since I was deeply into this genre when the book was originally published during Reagan's first term. The fact that there's an entire shelf of books by William Johnstone in the public library is testament to the fact that you can't go broke selling crap to Americans.Bottom line: if you like teenage libertarian sex & gun fantasies there are better ones out there. Out of the Ashes offers up all a fifteen-year-old Ayn Rand reading, Call of Duty playing, never-dated-a-girl-yet boy could want. But if you're 16 or older, have a thing for quality writing, aren't into rape, or think certain ideas about the separation of races went out of style in fiction before the original Star Trek was on TV, this is one you should pass by.Really.

This one was just too painful, and I gave up halfway through. I won't go into plot, others have done so already. It sounded good from other reviews, so I gave it a try. Big mistake.The book reads like a high school creative writing class assignment. The main character is two dimensional and an obvious fantasy the author wishes he was. Each of the female characters encountered turns out to be beautiful and sexually interested in the main character. Apparently all the ugly women died when the world went to hell. The writing style is abrupt and juvenile, making it tough to get into any scene as it takes place. Predominately the author describes action, and even that poorly. It is also hampered by the fact that he is writing about a military character and coup with little apparent knowledge of the military, those who serve, or firearms. While I, myself, have never served, I'm embarrassed for the men and women of our armed forces by this portrayal of them.The author's fantastic approach to firearms is obvious by the continual use of full automatic weapons by a \\"special ops\\" character. Denigrating the M-16 (admittedly not always liked by vets) by refusing to have his character take one, instead favoring a pistol, submachine gun, and explosives goes against the common sense of everyone who seriously knows firearms. A pistol is for when you don't have a rifle, and a submachine gun is a short range solution. Why not take a rifle, even a bad rifle, when in a survival situation? Points like this populate the book.Additionally, the book comes strongly across as conservative propaganda. Issues like racial tension are handled as if violence between races is inevitable, slightly veiled by the fact that the main character doesn't quite agree. And while I, personally, may agree with some of the political stances of the main character, the way they are presented and pushed makes the whole thing feel preachy and contrived.Short version, save your money"},{"Title":"Out of the Ashes (Ashes Series #1)","review":"From the first page this book will put chills down your spine.

The title is A Room With Dark Mirrors (just like on the cover) and not Room With Dark Mirror. (Edit: it's been fixed)The reader is introduced to Dorothy Wanger, who, following the end of her short marriage, is working as a stewardess on a plane headed for Paris. And, unfortunately, an unwanted passenger shares the plane: her ex-husband, Eric. His presence disturbs her calm. In fact, he's been popping in and out of her life ever since their divorce, showing up on her plane but claiming to be there because of work. This time he makes his true intentions clear and successfully ruins the peace Dorothy had so hoped for. To make matters worse, it seems that someone is out to get Dorothy, either that...or she's losing her mind.I found this book highly enjoyable. It grabbed me from the first chapter (I ended up starting it late at night with the intention of reading only a few pages and wound up reading the whole book in one sitting, which is a rarety with me), and I found the characterizations a refreshing change from what I've been coming across lately (one-dimensional characters). As a throwback to the romantic suspense novels of the 70s, this is a great example of a lighter one. I loved the dialogue, that the characters had their virtues and flaws, the fact that the main character is a stewardess (not the usual career for the heroine of a novel), and the atmosphere. The mystery can be easily solved (I'll admit that; I'll also have to admit that the way the story ended slightly lessened my enjoyment; I found it to be a little too unbelievable), but, overall, I enjoyed the book. The last few chapters (especially the very last) weren't as good as the beginning chapters, but obviously this didn't keep me from giving the book a 4-star rating.Also, of note, I did have some issues involving the main character and Eric. They briefly (oh, so briefly) touch on what led to the end of their relationship, but it isn't enough (well, it wasn't for me). I wanted a lot of things to be talked over, but this didn't happen, which left me feeling let down. And yes, this did lessen my enjoyment of the story.*******SPOILER*******Eric doesn't seem as sorry as I thought he should have been, and his reasons for doing what he did aren't explained enough.*******END SPOILER*******A note to prospective readers: as stated before, this is a light suspense/mystery; there is nothing too heavy to be found within these pages. I occasionally like to pick up some light reads, and this satisfied that need, but it may not satisfy the wants of other readers. I will definitely be looking for more books by Velda Johnston now (everytime I see her first name, I think of Velma from Scooby Doo...).

The book was out of print, so I had to secure it through inter-library loan. I have developed an appreciation of the writings of James A. Hillman of all of the Jungian psychologists. He has helped me to develop an insight into some areas of archetypal analysis that had seemed so difficult when I read the writings of other authors. Although the readings of Carl G. Jung are the classics of analytical psychology, for me it took a writer of the stature of Hillman to make sense of many of the concepts and psychological constructs of Jungian psychology.Technically speaking, this is a series of essays expounding on Wilhelm Heinrich Rocher's (1900) monograph &quot;Ephialtes: A Pathological-Mythological Treatise on the Nightmare in Classical Antiquity,&quot; a treatise on Pan and the demons of the night. I have learned in reading other works of James A. Hillman that it is very important to read the Preface. In this case, there is no preface as such, but I feel that the tone of the whole work is encapsulated in the first chapter &quot;The Psyche's Return to Greece.&quot; This is a return to Greece in an imaginal or archetypal sense, returning to the archetypes of Greek mythology that our &quot;Hebrewism&quot; or Christianity [monotheistic tradition] enjoins us to ignore. The Hellenism about which Hillman writes embodies an archetypal framework for working with the images, feelings, and moralities we live with on a daily basis. It is through the return to Greece that we rediscover the archetypes of our psyche and culture - it is a personal revelation.The third chapter, &quot;Pan, the Goat God of Nature&quot; goes further to outline the archetypal theme of much of what we are not willing to accept in our nightmares and in our own unconsciousness. As civilized people, we concentrate on the &quot;civilized&quot; often ignoring, repressing, and disowning the &quot;instinctual&quot; nature of our psyches and souls. Yet, even as we ignore and repress that part of our being, it comes back to us in our dreams and nightmares. Hillman further develops this theme in discussing matters such as nightmare panic, masturbation, rape, instinct, and synchronicity.The quality of the scholarship shown by Hillman is extraordinary. He makes full use of his credentials as a classical scholar, neo-Platonist philosopher, and leading Jungian psychologist. I was pleased that Rocher's 1900 monograph was included with &quot;Pan and the Nightmare,&quot; and I feel that it is of particular interest to scholars to be able to make use of Rocher's text in developing a more complete understanding of Hillman's work. I would recommend this book for students of Jungian psychology, as well as for those students studying both psychopathology and history and systems of psychology."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"A few \\"technical\\" mistakes, such as SS ranks and so forth, but hey, its fiction right? This book is an alternate history of what might have happened if Hitler was killed in the bomb plot of 1944. In that it is very good. However it kills off Adm. Halsey and the Big E (USS Enterprise) too easily (Halsey would have been on the New Jersey (BB62) most likely), and it gives Himmler too much credit as an evil genius. He was evil, but a genius? Perhaps not. Overall it is a very good read and even though I have listed its short comings, they hardly show through and over all it is a very good read and enjoyable book"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"As a self styled world war 2 buff, I watch the history channel buy read books, and even play games related to world war 2. I'm fascinated by how the world could have been such a different place if half a dozen things would have turned out differently. This book examines a world war 2 where hitler is killed and a himmler takes over. Himmler makes some choices that if enacted in reality may have changed Germany's chances in the war. A great read throughout. I gave it 5 stars because i can't wait for a sequel."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Niles and Dobson seem to know their stuff on World War II. Even though stories about what would have happened if the bomb did kill Hitler are nothing new, the story was handled in a way that made it hard to lose interest. The initial confusion and the conspirators' ineptitude came off very believable. I loved the way they handled Rommel's character. An honorale warrior in a country led by sadists. The conflict between him and Fuhrer Himmler was good, especially toward the end when the welfare of the Wehrmacht began to take precedence over Berlin's orders. Patton was Patton. I really liked the situation involving the production of the Me-262 jet fighters, from all the problems they had to the havoc they wreaked on the Allied air forces. Some quality combat scenes, especially when Combat Command A got plastered in a German counter-attack. That really affected its CO, Colonel Pulaski, for the rest of the book. The end leaves open a rhelm of very unique possibilities. I definitely will read the sequel."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"While I enjoyed reading this book, and thought that while well written and using an interesting plot device, that it was also fairly stretched as far as believability goes. Let us forget the obvious item of the Soviets signing a separate peace agreement with the Germans after the mass Summer Offensive of '44 when it was obvious to all that the War in the East was over, and go with the ones that try to be more believable. The first is the total lack of allied tactical air cover except for a few key plot moments. While leaving it out does give the illusion that the Germans could have achieved momentary air parity with the allies by producing the Me-262 is decent numbers, the reality was that by the summer of 44 that they allies had total air superiority not only strategically but tactically, which alone prevents many of the items that take place in this book from becoming believable. The other item that makes this difficult to believe is the total lack of mention of Germany's other fronts besides the East and West. What of Italy? Did that theatre just cease to exist? And except for a few blurbs about U-Boats, what about the battle of the Atlantic? Clearly what we have here is a stretch of the imagination and reality to basically fit one small concept (the assasination of Hitler and survival of Rommel) into a larger scheme without really thinking all aspects through to make it realistic. While the book was somewhat fun to read, I really cannot recommend it as it really cannot make you believe that what they are stating is possible. For a better look at alternative WW2 history, try SSGB by Len Deighton."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"I have yet to read the book, although I have it at home. My purpose now, though, is to point out a mistake that was made by th previous reviewer.

First, the writing. While one does not expect literature of a high order with these kinds of novels, I found the pacing to be variable and the authors' command of the language often lacking. For example, at the bottom of page 72 (in the hardcover edition), where the authors are describing Himmler's office, the word &quot;huge&quot; is used no less than four times in the same paragraph. As a published author, I find this appalling. There are many synonyms for that overused word they could have used, and the fact that their editor didn't catch this either is surprising, as well. As for that annoying fact that keeps cropping up, the authors are constantly referring to the BLACK uniforms of the SS. Field Gray uniforms were introduced in 1938, and by 1944 had completely replaced the original black. This was done as much for public relations (the German populace had begun to look upon the black-clad SS as less than real soldiers), as well as to give the Waffen SS (the armed SS) a uniform that wouldn't stick out like a sore thumb in battle. The ONLY unit that continued to wear the black uniform was the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, Hitler's bodyguard unit. Even Himmler himself had ceased to wear the black early in the war and numerous pictures of him confirm this. All this does (over and over again) is confirm that the authors did not do their research. Finally, there is the major plot point about Germany making peace with Stalin, allowing them to concentrate on the Western Front. While the authors gamely try to make this plausible, they fail for the simple reason that by 1944 too much blood had been spilled. The Russians would NEVER have agreed to a negotiated peace with the Germans for ANY reason. Certainly not for territory they would have annexed anyway. In all, while this book was mildly interesting, it fails on several fronts."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"I'm a big fan of WWII alternative history and picked up this book in the hopes of being engaged by an intelligent and well written story -- well, lets just say that it was a good idea. To get this book you have to suspend some basic facts about the war in 1944 -- but that's not the problem. The authors just couldn't deliver a well-written story. The bland and lifeless dialogue aside, at least give the characters some dignity -- for instance when Von Staffenberg accuses Jodl of kissing Hitler&#65533;s \\"rosy red rectum\\" -- come on - did these German officers talk like that? That's the moment I lost respect for the book, and that's only on page 62! If you're looking for an intelligent alternative history regarding the same time, pick-up \\"Disaster at D-Day\\" by Peter Tsouras instead. If you're looking for some low-brow chop shop writing - you know where to look."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"This attempt to show an alternate ending of the war was a much better attempt than any other I have read.The author had an obvious respect for Rommel thereby keeping the reader happy about his praise for the legendary General, but the entire scenario really does not lead to anything. Little changes in the book as opposed to history, and it takes a large leap in telling what Rommel would have done once all was lost. While I would like to believe that Rommel would have taken those steps like the commanders of 116 Pz Div. and most of (I believe)Army Group Center later on, the is no evidence to support that.The action sequences were vague and lacked depth, only one time during the attack on Bastone did it ever really get interesting.If you like alternate history, this is a good book, (I am much more into the real history,) but don't expect an action packed detailed book. The &quot;what if&quot; factor is pretty high, and afterwards I found that the book really was not that interesting."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"This book was great, but several things made it not work. First of all Himmler may have been in charge of the SS but the SS was loyale to Hitler, the most likely scenario would be the SS would start a large civil war and try for a military dicatatorship under the SS. Also, if that didnt happen, if you know alot about the eastern front, you will know hitler in January of 1945 (Just before the TOTAL collapse of the Eastern Front) appointed Himmler commander of Army Group Vistula Army Group Center and so forth. Under himmler the front totaly collapsed bringing a much quicker end of the war in the east, Himmler was a horrible general. Hitler was, before he lost it was an above average general. If hitler had appointed Guderian insted in jan 1945, according to the soviet schedule, they would not have reached Berlin until, mid May 1945. But himmlers stupidity led to the fall of Berlin in late april 1945. There fore if Himmler took power the war would have been over by December 1944 at the very best."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Fox on the Rhine details an alternate history where the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler's life succeeds in killing Hitler, but the conspirators are unable to completely wrest power away from the Nazi Party, and Himmler takes control. Rommel, recovering from injuries, is thus not forced to take poison as in our history, and is assigned to the Western Front. Himmler manages to negotiate a truce with the Soviet Union, and with forces redeployed, Rommel launches a much larger Ardennes/Battle of the Bulge, which largely succeeds until an American group cuts off the German penetration and the German army is forced to surrender.That's about all I remember from this book, because although the premise (a successful assassination of Hitler) was interesting, the execution of the plot has much to be desired. I can believe Rommel being appointed commander of the Western Front, and I can even believe that an intelligent German High Command would launch a Battle of the Bulge-style offensive, but the idea of a truce with the Soviet Union in 1944 is quite frankly ludicrous. The authors attempt to create a plausible deal with Germany handing over all territorial gains in the East, as well as their rocket and cruise missile programs, which strikes me as plainly absurd, as the Soviets would have plainly gotten that and much more in the course of fighting the war. The American counter-attack, too, was lead by a completely contrived character, the prototypical \\"do no wrong-ignored til everything goes to hell-doomsayer-superhero-type\\" leader who manages to capture the entire German penetration by capturing and holding a single bridge. There's a completely nonsensical assassination attempt by the Nazi leadership on General Rommel and the American General (whose name escapes me, as he is so vanilla), as if such an assassination attempt could keep the surrender from happening.All in all, the book starts out with such promise, but completely drops off a cliff, and I'm very glad that I read it from my library instead of wasting my money purchasing it."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The story is set up with what is likely the most used premise in alternate history, the premature death of Adolph Hitler. However, this book had Hitler staying alive until 1944 when the failed attempt on his life succeeded. With Hitler dead, the war unfolds. Hitler's inept meddling of the military is ended. For example, Hitler wanted to use the jet powered ME-262 plane as a bomber, when he desperately needed fighter planes to counteract the massive Allied air superiority. Rommell, instead of being forced to commit suicide is given the task to defeat the western allies. I would prefer not to give away the ending of this book, but I will say that this is a real page turner, I couldn't wait to find out how the war would play out. (There are a number of twists and turns to history as the story unfolds). The only reason that this book did not get 5 stars is that at the very end of the book, it was &quot;tie up the loose ends&quot; time. Usually I feel that most books could be written more tightly, however at the end the authors raced to finish it up. It was almost like &quot;Hey we only have 5 pages to wrap this up&quot;. This book begs for a sequel. I only hope that it does well enough for the authors to attempt it. I for one will be eagerly waiting!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The authors of this Alternate History have done a pretty fair job of tilling some virgin ground--World War II has not been explored or exploited as the basis of very many books in the AH genre thus far.Overall the plot seems pretty plausible;the assassination of Adolf Hitler by Claus von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators ends in chaos,leading to Heinrich Himmler becoming the new Fuehrer. At the time (1944) all seems to be lost for Germany;the Allies are bombing the Reich to rubble and both fronts are on the verge of collapse. Heinrich Himmler scores a diplomatic coup by concluding a peace treaty with the Soviet Union,and an injured Field Marshall Rommel is recalled to duty as the commander in the West. Rommel subsequently conducts a brilliant fighting retreat to the &quot;Westwall&quot; or Siegfried line while Adolf Galland,the brilliant General of Fighters, conducts his long planned &quot;grosse schlag&quot; or big blow against the American 8th Air Force with the revolutionary Me 262 jet fighters. The book title &quot;Fox on the Rhine&quot; is the code name for the alternate history version of the Battle of the Bulge led in this instance by Rommel.Many fictional characters are introduced in the course of action, some of whom are not very believable. Oberst (Colonel) Krueger seems to be a pretty vile individual to be selected by General Galland as a wing commander. Krueger's behavior towards his crew chief borders on idiotic , since the mechanics are what kept the pilots alive in the air through thorough and careful maintenence of the aircraft. On the other hand Feldwebel (sergeant) Karl-Heinz Claussen was a thoroughly likeable sort of fellow.My overall impression of the book was very favorable,although I was somewhat let down by the ending. It seemed to me that the failure of the great Ardennes offensive was based on an somewhat improbable scenario in Dinant, and based on all the previous actions taken by Rommel this ending would not have occurred.On the negative side , the book needed a lot more thorough job of proofreading. Several small nitpicking errors were carried through the entire book; i.e. there is no &quot;d&quot; in Messerschmitt! Captains in the S.S. are not &quot;Hauptmann&quot; but &quot;Obersturmfuehrer&quot;;and tanks are not steered by steering wheels,although half tracks are.A better knowledge of German and German forms of address to superiors (not &quot;Feldmarshall&quot; , but &quot;Herr General Feldmarshall&quot;) would have helped smooth out a few of the rough spots and upgraded this book to &quot;5 stars&quot;.In the realization that this was the first AH book attempted by these authors, I look forward to even better efforts in the future."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Wow! It's rare that a long-awaited novel meets my expectations, but Fox on the Rhine not only met them, it smashed them flat beneath the treads of advancing panzers!The essence of the plot is believable and eminently satisfying. The authors twisted history just a bit to create a compelling tale that takes WWII on an interesting new time-line.The characters are strong and believable, mostly historical and well researched. The technical military detail is superb. The authors' knowledge of the campaigns, command structures, and military possibilities leaps off of every page. Battles are presented in an exciting, readable manner so they are easily followed and brutally realistic.I highly recommend Fox on the Rhine to any fan of alternate history or WWII drama. I can't wait to read their next book!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Fox on the Rhine is an enjoyable piece of alternate history based on the supposition that the plot to assasinate Hitler had succeeded. The book is packed with battle scenes and historic figures like Rommel, Himmler, and Patton reacting to the new situation. The book bogs down a little in intrigues between the assasins and the NAZIs. Also one would have really liked to know how the post war world would have looked under the changed circumstances (perhaps in a sequal?). Nevertheless I could hardly put the book down, which for my busy lifestyle is praise indeed.(...)"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Bottom line: Fox on the Rhine is a darn good summer read. However, the co-author's claim that this book is a work of \\"alternative history\\" is stretching the definition of that nebulous term to the breaking point. Rather, Fox on the Rhine is more of a Teutonic fantasy where the mighty Wehrmacht - free of the disastrous meddling of Hitler by a quirk of the author's pen - is free to wreak havoc upon the incompetent Anglo-Americans. In this fantasy world, superior German leadership, technology and fighting ability can unite to reverse the inevitable Allied victory. Bearing in mind that this is a work of fiction, the author's have absorbed enough information about the real Second World War to make their alternative outcome interesting - even gripping at times - but ultimately not very credible. Read this book, enjoy it, then throw it away.One particularly troubling area I have with the book - aside from the improbable characters and dialogue as mentioned by several other reviewers - is the way that the authors deal with troubling facts of the real world - they just wish them away. A major case in point is the rugged terrain of the Ardennes, which was a crucial impediment to the German 1944 Winter Counteroffensive. In real life, the German armor was very constricted on the small, muddy forest trails and roads and this greatly slowed their advance. In Fox on the Rhine, where the authors imagine a stronger German counterattack with many more divisions, the Germans sail effortlessly across the rugged terrain to seize Bastogne, St Vith and Stavelot in just a couple days. This is absurd. More tanks and better commanders would not have speeded up the German advance one bit. A second fact that the author's conveniently ignore is the remarkable ability of small ad hoc groups of American engineers, anti-aircraft and combat support units to put up credible delaying actions that greatly upset the German timetable. In Fox on the Rhine, other than the author's spotlight unit, the fictional 19th Armored Division, no US units fight well in the Ardennes or inflict serious delay. Taken together, these glaring omissions - terrain and US tenacity - make the German offensive into an almost cartoon adventure, with the Germans effortlessly overrunning big American supply depots (obviously, the Americans were too dumb to even blow them up before losing them). Furthermore, this novel tends to reinforce the Nazi propaganda myth that American forces were helpless without air support and massive logistic support. This is propaganda, not alternate history.The other major area that is troubling about the book is the near deification of Field Marshal Rommel. In this work, Rommel is presented as a near-paragon: a military genius, a decent man and a German patriot. There is no doubt that Rommel was one of the best German tactical commanders in the Second World War (and outstanding as a junior officer in the First World War), but he was far from perfect even in a military sense. In North Africa, Rommel frequently demonstrated a shocking disregard for logistical realities - such as in his foolish \\"dash to the wire\\" in November 1941 - and he could also be very arrogant in dealing with other German commanders. Rommel might have been admired, but he had few friends among his peers. As for patriotism, Rommel was like the rest of the bunch who went along with Hitler when the Fuhrer was on a winning streak, but then rejected him once the specter of defeat appeared. During the six weeks that Rommel commanded German forces in the Normandy campaign, he demonstrated competence but hardly genius. The authors would have the reader believe that Rommel was such a military genius that his mere appearance at the front served to restore shattered morale and give the Wehrmacht a new chance for victory. Yet if Rommel is able to do so much with so little in the retreat across France, why didn't he do a better job containing the Allies in Normandy when he had an even greater edge? The reality that is missing from this fictional work is that individual leadership - no matter how imbued with professional expertise - is no equalizer against overwhelming material odds. Napoleon was also faced with this situation in his last desperate campaign in France in 1814, and his genius was not enough to counterbalance a deteriorating military situation.Finally, if the authors are going to change events on the German side of the deck, they should allow for a reverse dynamic. A critical omission is the lack of any Allied strategic debate after the unexpected German cease-fire agreement with the Soviets. Instead of including all those useless scenes with Sergeant O'Dell, the authors should have included a scene or two depicting FDR and Churchill discussing policy changes. Rather than see Greece or Norway go to the Soviets, Churchill would almost certainly have pushed for the First Allied Airborne Army to be dropped into either or both of those countries to forestall a Soviet occupation (remember, in this alternative Operation Market-Garden did not occur). If the Germans had abandoned a \\"stand-or-die\\" policy in France due to the assassination of Hitler, the Falaise Pocket would probably not have occurred and the consequently stronger German defenses on the West Wall would have induced far greater Allied caution in approaching the German frontier. Under these conditions, a German counterattack would have seemed more credible. It is far less likely that the Allies would have thinned their sector in the Ardennes or failed to maintain a sizeable theater reserve if the Germans had saved so much of their armies from the French campaign. Instead, the authors present a fantasy where the Germans are allowed to \\"correct\\" their actual historical mistakes but the Allies are static to the point of wooded-headedness."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"'Fox on the Rhine,' by Douglas Niles and Micheal Dobson, is a wonderful story of just how differently World War Two could have turned out if the Army Officers plot had succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler. In 'Fox' Hitler is killed at Rastenberg on July 20th, 1944 and Germany is soon thrown into a sea of chaos. Heinrich Himmler and his SS soon move to gain the loyalty of the army and seek a seperate peace with the Soviets. Once that's accomplished, Himmler appoints Erwin Rommel, 'the Desert Fox,' to command an alternate version of the 'Battle of the Bulge.' While at times Dobson and Niles spend a little too much time showing off the fruits of their research, which is impressive, they do manage to tell a riveting story, and while some aspects of 'Fox' do stretch the reader's believabilty, the story is riveting and builds to an explosive climax. But perhaps the most fun is the simple question that the authors ask and attempt to answer: What would have happened had Erwin Rommel commanded the Ardennes Offensive? A great ride that ranks among the best works of alternate history."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"I started this book on a flight to Seattle and couldn't put it down. I finished it that night! The &quot;what if Hitler died in the bomb blast&quot; idea has been around but an alternative story that is believable has never been so well done. In addition to those characters who are famous, the authors include many characters, from the battle-shocked American tank commander to the patriotic Luftwaffe pilot, characters who represent those who fought the battles daily for both sides.And for a change people on both sides are fairly intelligent. Of course there are the racist Nazi's but the German's aren't portrayed as being all idiots or all racists, who constantly do stupid things.The military battles are well thought out, both in terms of strategy and tactics (I don't like authors of military books who really have no grasp of strategy or tactics). However it is the politics that is really the core of the book, and after all that is what war is really about - the success or failure of politics.My only complaint is that although the book ends, the story doesn't which means I have to wait a year or so to find out what happens next.If you like authors like W.E.B. Griffen, Stephen Coonts and Harold W. Coyle, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The authors of this book have crafted an enjoyable and believable piece of fiction around interesting and exciting events. While some of the circumstances do require some suspension of disbelief, that's certainly par for the course with Alternate History writing. Anyone looking for a good read with some well-thought-out twists will do well to pick up this book. The authors are to be congratulated."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"As a coauthor of counterfactual history, I am equally interested in both the idea and the writing. Niles and Dobson come through on both counts.At its premise, this book takes that the effort to kill Hitler in July 1944 succeeds but leads Himmler to take power and gamble on making peace with the Soviet Union. His temptation for Stalin is knowledge of the vengeance weapons and the technology to make the Soviet Union potentially dominant against the Western Allies.That truce (and both sides know it is a truce not a peace) allows Germany to focus on defeating the Anglo-American armies.They then posit that Himmler would have relied on competent military leaders like Rommel, Guderian and Galland and amassed German military power more intelligently than Hitler allowed.The book evolves in a very engaging and satisfying way and I recommend it highly for anyone interested in how a military campaign could unfold and how strategic change could lead to different developments."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Too many otherwise intelligent people think history is synonymous with destiny. Even some historians think it's their job to explain the inevitable. The result makes for insipid reading and bad history. In fact, the present is contingent on a tangled web of factors and conditions, many only dimly perceived. To fully appreciate history requires a lively awareness of how a seemingly trivial incident at a decisive time and place might have turned the world upside down, for better or worse.On the other side, the overly literal-minded believe alternate history is a waste of time because it deals with ahistorical questions: What if Peter the Great had had access to railroads? What might Napoleon have achieved with tanks? True, a popular strain of anachronism runs through the alternate history genre. Further, as Tony Judt has observed, a counterfactual speculation (i.e., alternate history) must take the broader context into account. To its credit, Fox provides a fascinating take on a world turned almost upside down while avoiding anachronism by means of an exceptionally well-thought out political scenario that might satisfy even Mr. Judt.That scenario is based on two questions: If the July 20 bomb plot had succeeded, what effects might Hitler's death have had on Nazi Germany? And, with Hitler dead might Germany have had a fighting chance of ending the war on favorable terms? Fox works out plausible and highly entertaining answers to those questions mainly through the eyes of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (the Fox of the title) and the top officers of an American armored division in France. The characters, historical and fictional alike, are developed with unusual sensitivity and depth. I really came to care about all of them, even the bad guys. Echoing Herman Wouk's &quot;Winds of War,&quot; Fox uses exceprts from an imaginary postwar history to provide perspective and analysis. Although I admired Fox's respect for history and attention to the political background, my main interest was in the action. As one might expect, the action is mainly land warfare. Although a tad brief, I found the battles enjoyable and tactically sound.On the negative side, Fox gives little consideration to the conflict as a world war and not just a duel between the United States and Germany. Also, fewer of the maudlin letters from the B-24 waist gunner to his mother would have made for a better book. But, these are quibbles. All in all, Fox is a first-class work of alternate history. I recommend it without hesitation to anyone with the slightest interest in history, World War II, and what-might-have-been."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"A page turner!

A well organized story, it keeps you running to see what happens next. There are some minor flaws, as where has Martin Bormann gone? he was not a small figure and not a word is said on him. The Pilot figure is a little gruesome, the worst thing about nazis, was that they perform the cruelest deeds without being crazy psychopath. More accurate are the SS General and Himmler.

The way in which the authors achieves this creates a unique reading experience. The reader will be ready for the sequel. Recommended to anyone who likes history."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"One of the biggest problems with alternate histories is that they either tend to be poorly thought out and the worlds they create are inept, or they are so overly rah-rah that you know how the story ends after one page. The good AHs are like M.Chabon-The Yiddish Policeman, where there is a strong main character and story, with the change in history being explained in a realistic way (ok a jewish homeland in alaska is a little bit of a stretch).In this scenario, with Hitler assassinated by von Staffenberg and his conspirators, it would not be unthinkable that Himmler had planned to make himself the new 'fuhrer' by having Goring killed. That he would make a peace with Stalin is also not that far fetched, since Stalin had already dealt with Hitler and the Germans and Soviets worked together a lot in the 20s and 30s.There is no question that Rommel was there best strategist and to try and recapture Antwerp was the reason behind the \\"Battle of the Bulge\\". Niles and Dobson do a great job of using 'real' military people as characters and then creating a few of there own to enhance the action. More than anything the do a fabulous job in describing battles (some of which actually happened but in other places) and the feeling of those not only in HQ but also of those who have to slog it out on the battlefield.Historically, they have done a good job in explaining how Eisenhower was able to keep Montgomery happy, use Bradley as his main strategist and Patton as his head executor. That he represents Monty as a strutting peacock is exactly as he has been shown by the accounts of most of his contemporaries. That Patton was pompous and bombastic is true to his character, though he cared deeply for his men and the sacrifices they made. (My Dad was Third Army and always spoke well if not profanely about 'Old Blood and Gut', your blood his guts.)All in all a very satisfying story."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"As true to the Desert Fox with a tribute to his genius without glorifing the Third Reich. A compelling see-saw story between the Allies and the Wehrmacht with plenty of intrigue and surprises. Some outcomes are slightly disappointing, but then again, so is life. Very interesting how the two authors work so well to fulfill an exhilerating story. Right up there with Harry Turtledove in the Alternate History legends, I cannot wait to get the sequel, AJH."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"It made a lot of sense for Hitler's assasination to be a turning point for the war and Himmler taking over afterwards. It made sense for Rommel to be given his command back and give the Allies a very hard time.However, I had a hard time believing the Soviets so quickly coming to terms with the Nazi's. I also had a hard time believing some of the details in the combat. Everything went right for the Germans until the very end of the book and the real world doesn't work that way. I know a previous reviewer stated the end of the book didn't match what Rommel would have done, but I felt that was very believable. Rommel always took calculated risks in Africa and the Allies could never exploit them. He had to pay sometime.Overall, it was an enjoyable read. I like AH because it can illustrate that what was seen as certain in hindsight was not necessarily a sure thing. The removal of the incompetent Hitler as military leader would have made an enormous difference, especially even earlier than the book described."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The biggest and most frustrating problem with this book is that it needed a good editor and didn't get one. The authors make mistakes in their German, malapropism in their English, and silly goofs in their military history. I liked the book's overall approach and subject matter, and the first 3/4 or so is quite plausible and well done. The conclusion is the weakest part, in that it is only sketched, and even the sketch is unpersuasive. I just hope this book makes it into a second edition that refines and expands what is at bottom a promising work."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"A great book. The best of the century!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"I believe that the writers had a good, if fanciful, idea when they came up with the premise for this book. Even the unlikely separate peace with the Soviets was an interesting take.The problem with this book is in the writing. The authors are proffessional game designers which, I am sure helped in working out the fictional tactics and strategies used by the combatants, but, they should have employed a writer to at least help them with their style and substance. I found the characters to be flat and in some cases cartoonish.

I read through the previous reviews and only counted 5 (?) negatives which only proves that the detractors did not feel compelled to expend effort on a story they didn't like or the positive writers were smoking some good stuff and didn't really remember too much of what they read. I read each of the NEGS to be sure I didn't rehash prior arguments. Straight off I was discouraged by the complete lack of knowledge and/or research in their project. On page 33 there is a description of the \\"Nineteenth AD\\" division insignia; \\"a white star on a badge of crimson\\".

Fool me once, shame on you-fool me twice shame on me!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"To anyone who knows the real history of the European part of WWII, this is an idiotic premise for a book. In America--and nowhere else in the world--they teach that America, with help from the Soviets, defeated Nazi Germany. This is propaganda and makes us a laughingstock for our naivete.In truth, while we were fighting the Japanese, and crushing their hopes beyond repair in the Battle of Midway, making it only a matter of how long it would take, not who would win, the Russians did the same thing to the Nazis in the Battle of Stalingrad and surrounding areas. One huge difference is that while the U.S. lost between 292,000 and 400,000 dead in the entire war, the Russians lost beween 20 and 30 MILLION dead. (Ponder that for awhile. I find it incomprehensible.)Unimaginable numbers of men, women and children died in and around Stalingrad, and the old beast Stalin--in perhaps the only completely truthful statement of his life--said, \\"They are not fighting for me and they are not fighting for Communism. They are fighting for Mother Russia.\\" He was right.When the 12-to-18 month battle was over, the Russians' fatalities far outnumbered those of the Nazis. But the Russian people's courage--aided enormously by the climate that had doomed Napoleon, and supplies and food from the U.S.--destroyed a majority of Hitler's army. The Nazis were in full retreat back through Eastern Europe, forcibly conscripting 15-year-old Poles to fight in what remained of their great army.All of this was well BEFORE D-Day. If you read American newspapers from November of 1943, you can read about conferences between FDR, Churchill (my pick for the greatest person of the century) and Stalin--discussing what they would do when the war ended. In other words, they knew victory was a done deal--over half a year before D-Day.So, this book is another effort to say the U.S. military played a major effort in defeating Nazi Germany. That is a lie which every country in the rest of the world scorns us for believing. In World War II, we did the following things:(1) Defeated a Japanese government & military not much better than Hitler's. While we had help (as did the Russians in their immense sacrifice), we were clearly the main force in the Pacific, just as were the Russians in Europe;(2) Kept Stalin from metastasizing his way through the rest of Europe;(3) Hastened the war's end, a big deal. Nobody will ever know how much longer Hitler needed to get the doomsday bomb, but we all know what he would have done, as those Russian tanks smashed their way through those final blocks toward his bunker, if he'd had the doomsday button at his command; and(4) Lost the lives of 292,000-400,000 courageous souls, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of others who came home with what is now called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (a major mental disorder) and/or serious physical injuries.I am not disparaging any of those sacrifices, nor trivializing Items (1) through (3), nor (of course) our defeating Japan. But this country REALLY has to get past the notion we beat the Nazis or co-beat them.We didn't, any more than the Soviets co-beat Japan.A year ago, I heard an idiot on ESPN tout some movie about D-Day, a movie which was to air that night on their parent network, ABC. He referred to D-Day as, \\"The most important battle of World War Two.\\"There are a lot of places in Europe where one would not want to be heard making that statement, and only people \\"educated\\" about history in American schools could in good faith state such nonsense.This book, sadly, will only carry on this tradition of ignorance through propaganda. The conspiracy to kill Hitler had been in its formative stages well before D-Day, for the reason its major participants had already known Germany was hopelessly beaten.Here is what all reasonable people can agree upon:(A) It is a great tragedy the bomb failed to do its job, for it would have saved many millions of lives; and(B) It is too bad Rommel, a man deeply respected by many American military leaders, went down with the ship, because I don't believe he would have failed again. Moreover, he obviously knew Stalingrad had destroyed the great Nazi machine, and that the combined wraths of the Russians/Soviets over Stalingrad, and the British over The Blitz in 1940-1941, would take a horrible toll on the Germans at the hands of their victors. And he was sure right.Americans nowadays argue over the morality of Truman's two atom bombs, with the vast majority of those who were not alive then condemning him for ordering the bombings.I agree they are a fascinating subject for debate. But I can tell you this: I was born in 1953 and have asked well over 1,000 people in my life who were at least 21 on the date of Pearl Harbor how they felt about the dropping of those two bombs. And I have NEVER found such a person who disagreed with the dropping of those atom bombs AT THE TIME, though many disagree with it now or disagreed with it later. Not a single one disagreed with it in 1945.But the firebombing of Dresden? Not only does everyone I know now who knows about it condemn it as a clearly indefensible thing (which killed more people outright than either of those atom bombs), but most people I have known who were adults during World War II condemned it, too--not only to me, but when it happened way back then, finding no justification for it at whatsoever.I apologize for using a monolithic subject with which to grade this book. But it IS another book which perpetuates the lie that our military defeated or co-defeated the Nazis. And our country's perpetuation of that myth/propaganda has done our country and its civilians a great disservice in the court of Western Culture's opinion.I care a lot about that court's opinion of me and my country. I don't care at all what Bin Laden and other fundamentalist Islamics think about me or my culture, any more than I care what Falwell and Robertson think about me. But I am tired of having the rest of the Western World view Americans as naive idiots.A book which perpetuates the notion our military defeated the Nazis will only help ensure that we continue to be seen--not only by Russians, but by all Europeans--as at least naive, if not idiots.Jim F."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Those of us who have been fans of Douglas Niles for the nearly thirty books he has written would be surprised to learn he would need to &quot;hire a writer&quot; to put his ideas on paper.

The events that unfold after Hitler's assassination are improbable, but what good work of alternate history isn't full of improbabilities? Stalin agreeing to an armistice in 1944 in return for huge concessions of German-controlled territory is hardly any more improbable than the Russo-German Nonaggression Pact of 1939. These guys are as good as Harry Turtledove (and that's saying something). More than anything else this book reminded me of Red Storm Rising (the greatest techno-thriller ever written). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The authors answer the question that many have asked: &quot;What would have happened if the assassination attempt on Hitler had been successful?&quot; Without the iron hand of the crazed dictator, the authors paint a very plausible and facinating picture of a different German army under the direction of intelligent and charismatic leaders such as Rommel. As a result, new twists and challenges are presented to the allied command on the European front. Made for very easy and enjoyable reading for any WWII enthusiast. I loved the book and couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Of all the theaters in WW2, the post D-Day Western Front gets by far the most attention from wargamers and history buffs. Americans! Versus Germans! On flat ground with tanks!This despite the fact that from a strategic standpoint, the Western Front wasn't much more then a sideshow; the Eastern Front, Germany versus Russia, was an order of magnitude vaster and bloodier. But there's no clear good guys and bad guys in that scenario, and certainly no Americans, so...The best thing about Fox on the Rhine is the research; the authors clearly know their stuff. The worst thing is the plot; it's convoluted and contrived, implausibly 'neat' in places and tediously detailed in others. Through an almost ridiculous chain of events (I'm sorry, my suspension of disbelief died when Russia agrees on a German peace offer - in *1944*??), a German varsity team - lots of Tigers, Panthers, all the pretty hardware - is able to meet the Allies in a more evenhanded fight than the one that actually took place on the Western Front.Of course, it all boils down to a single key point, and to be fair: the fighting itself is done excellently. The Panzer Lehr division (much loved amongst wargamers because it was originally a tank school and its staff - and thus very, very good) comes up against the main American characters... and the authors do know how to write combat.To the authors: focus on your strengths and avoid your weaknesses, next time. Skim over the implausible historical setups, pay more attention to the character descriptions and development, give less attention to hardware details and focus on the people and the combat.If you can suspend your belief long enough, it's not a bad story. Add two stars to my rating if you're a dedicated WW2 wargamer."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"While the premise of the story is more than believable when it comes to the events in Germany - Hitler's assassination, Himmler's rise to power over the actual coup conspirators, and Rommel being exonerated from participation in the attempted coup and thus not having to commit suicide - the actual possibility of signing a truce between the Soviets and the Reich is much harder to stomach from a geopolitical perspective of the time. The fact is, the Russians were already solidly on the offensive in 1944, and extremely peed off at the Germans for breaking the treaty and invading, but mostly for coming so close to actually winning the war. Ideological disagreements with the Allies aside, even with Hitler gone, the USSR had to perceive the Reich as the largest threat to that point.Another weak point is how quickly Rommel surrenders once the German push during the Battle of the Bulge stalls. With reinforcements still pouring in from the eastern front, the Desert Fox could have pulled back to the old defensive positions to lick his wounds and re-consolidate the defense line and extoll a terrible price on the Allies with his superior armor and artillery.Overall, however, this is an interesting and engaging read, and I would highly recommend it for its recreational value even to a historically scrupulous reader."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"This alternate history develops a fascinating story around the idea \\"What if Hitler had been killed in the 1944 bomb plot?\\" It's gripping as well as intelligent and the authors delight with their fresh style. Michael Dobson and Douglas Niles wrote a book that not only the older generation with interest in WWII will enjoy up to the last page. It's also a great book for young people and will get them interested in an important part of history."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The reviews are in and this book is damn good. My two cents amounts to this; the authors revised history without any goofy mechanisms. No AK-toting South Africans, no Norse Gods, just a sneeze.They refused to let the story get out of hand and they didn't paint themselves into such a tight box that only a successful NAZI nuclear program (or Fat Man over Berlin) could get them out.Good stuff all around.I don't truly believe this is a five star book, but I did want to bring the average up just a little bit. It is, however a SOLID 4.5 stars. While I think a sequel would be harder to manage and keep as realistic, I'll certainly read it. If anyone can pull it off it just may be these guys."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Both authors seem to have borrowed much from their wargaming expertise to craft this &quot;what-if&quot; WWII scenerio. How would Hitler's death affect the war? Well, if you know anything about Rommel, Patton, and Himmler, you'll enjoy seeing them act out that plot. The character development is easy for the writers, who stay pretty close to historical alacrity. The only negative is the sprinkling of wargaming references - when describing a combat situation you can almost hear them saying &quot;the Panther, with defense factor 5, Attack strenth of 12, and in hull-down position, attacked the modified M4 Sherman from the flank...&quot; Those allusions were tolerable and actually made me reminisce about the wargaming days of old. Well done! Very highly recommended for WWII history buffs!"},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"I'm about 3/4ths through it, and have really enjoyed it, but to be truthful I feel as if the book was written for me from a demo graphical standpoint (big history buff). I wouldn't say its a work of great literature, the book jumps around quite a bit and follows the stories of six or so characters reminded me a lot of the film The Thin Red Line with the multiple story lines and jump cuts. Rommel the Desert Fox is really the star, but the book is very slow about bringing him out, as in real life and the book he was wounded shortly before the July 20th bomb plot and spends a bit of the book recovering from his wounds while the other characters fight. The book is not written from a pro-American or pro-German standpoint but rather an anti-Nazi one as you begin to sympathize with the German characters who of course were not our allies in this war, I find most books of the genre portray the Germans as 'evil'. The authors spend quite some time I'd imagine researching the American and German Armies, SS, and Nazi gov't characters because most of them were real people and their attitudes and mannerisms are similar to their real life counterparts. If your a fan of 'action' style books or a Tom Clancy style book without the technobable, I think you'd enjoy this. I liked it so much to have already ordered its sequel."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"When reading Fox on the Rhine I found myself comparing it to Harry Turtledove's World War I/II series. I recently read and reviewed Turtledove's latest, Drive to the East, so it was fresh in my mind. Fox on the Rhine provides the level of detail that Turtledove's series lacks. From details of individual tactical engagements to analyses of the strategic alignments, the author gives the reader a full view of the situation. The book opens when one man's tiny change from actual history results in a successful July 20, 1944 assassination of Hitler. Whether the resulting scenarios are really plausible is beside the point because the authors made them seem credible. The authors do produce an interesting alternate history tale while letting the reader in on more than broad generalizations of what is going on at the front. A few more maps would have been helpful though.Although Fox on the Rhine portrays the Germans on the move with a second chance, they are not glorified. The authors go a bit far in deifying Rommel, but most of the German leaders and the SS are nasty and evil as ever. A surprising feature of the book is the portrayal of the American army sweeping across France and then in counterattack mode. The Americans have practically equal billing in this book and are definitely the good guys. Readers considering Fox on the Rhine do not have to be concerned they are buying a Neo Nazi or at least sympathetic tome.So far, I am describing a book that will appeal to both Alternate and Military history buffs. However, there are also key aspects in a book such as character development and plot lines. In this area, Fox on the Rhine is mediocre at best and Turtledoves comes out way ahead. The characters are ciphers attached to historical stereotypes. In fact, a significant part of the book is devoted to worthless letters from an American bomber gunner to his mother. Letters from a tanker would have been much more interesting and fitting. The descriptions of the military campaigns in Fox on the Rhine are informative and interesting, but without characters to really care about, it falls flat. For the right audience, Fox on the Rhine is well worth the time, but when considering everything that comprises a good book, it is little more than ordinary."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"July 20, 1944: Hitler is killed by a bomb and a military coup is attempted. Little did the German military officers know that Himmler would beat them to finishing line, taking control of the Reich and bringing about changes that might save it.I found the plot realistic, along with many of the characters (with all their merits and flaws), and thought the authors did very well. I wish more writers were as good. Rommel, Himmler and Patton all seem to come alive. The alternate history was done so well it does seem like a alternate reality.One of the reviewers complained that the book felt like a wargame, where the two authors just rolled dice and such, and frankly if this is true, I also wish more authors played military role playing games. Let the 'dice' keep it fair!I plan to get 'Fox on the Front'."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Douglas Niles and Michael Dobson in FOX ON THE RHINE consider the major consequences of a minor act, a sneeze, on the way the Second World War turned out. On July 20, 1944 at Hitler's command bunker in East Prussia, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg placed a suitcase bomb under the large oaken table where he knew that Adolf Hitler would be reviewing the progress of a war that was rapidly going from bad to worse. It was Von Stauffenberg's opinion that with Hitler out of the way, he and a group of high ranking officers on the General Staff could arrest Himmler and neutralize the SS and Gestapo, thus allowing a newly reconstituted government led by Erwin Rommel to end the war with Germany reasonably intact. In reality, one of Hitler's officers moved the suitcase far enough from the Fuhrer so that the explosion hurt but did not kill him. In FOX ON THE RHINE, this officer left the bomb in its place, so that the explosion killed Hitler. At this point, the prophetic vision of Niles and Dobson weaves an intricate plot of how the plotters' attempt to control the government failed, allowing the Reichsfuhrer of the SS, Heinrich Himmler to consolidate power and take the war in an unexpected direction. With Himmler in charge, the new fuhrer puts Rommel in command of the western front, brokers a surprise peace treaty with Stalin then frees up German troops to be diverted westward to stop the Allied invasion of France, and orders the manufacture and delivery of hundreds of the new jet fighters that will regain Nazi control of the air.There is much to like about FOX ON THE RHINE. The tale of a new ending to an old war is entertaining enough in that it allows individuals to emerge from the jumble of war as recognizable personalities that had a cumulative impact on both sides. There are many real life people in the book. In particular the gentlemanly brilliance of Erwin Rommel, the fox of the title, is emphasized as the converse to Himmler, who comes across as the petty, self-serving bureaucrat that he was. Hitler and Stalin are minor players on this stage of war, with Hitler dying early and Stalin appearing late. American generals Eisenhower, Patton, and Bradley are pictured pretty much the way they were in our timeline. There are included a number of characters on both sides who are surely made up for the purposes of plot advancement. The most interesting ones include a vicious, American-hating Luftwaffe pilot named Krueger, who lived only to fly the new jets to kill Americans. Balancing Krueger's nastiness is the kindlier, German sergeant Clausen, who serves as Rommel's driver.The major problem with this book lies not in its basic assumption of altering history, but in the writing style and structure of the narrative that all too often calls attention to itself, thus distancing the reader from the threads of the plot.First, there is no single dramatic focus of interest. Field Marshall Rommel, in his earnestness of purpose, comes the closest, but the reader is left with wondering if the Desert Fox is supposed to be the 'hero.' This problem might have been avoided had the authors avoided the 'clutter the chapter' method used by Tom Clancy in his novels as Clancy uses so many characters in so many subplots that the reader is tempted to skim rather than read the narrative. Niles and Dobson's book would have benefitted greatly with a judicious editor's pruning hook, lopping off distracting scenes and characters such as the annoying and frequent letters written by Sgt. O'Dell, whose only function seems to be an omniscient commentator on the unfolding plot. Further, since many of the characters are German, it is necessary for them to speak English; however, mixing up their conversations with Germanic, 'Jawohl, mein Fuhrer,' serves only to remind the reader of who is speaking.There is much to like about FOX ON THE RHINE, but there is also much that needed to be done on the outlining stage, prior to the writing. The sneeze that so altered the war might have had its literary counterpart in that editorial red pen, the result of which would have transformed a moderately good book into one that truly sizzled rather than popped."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"What if Hitler had been assassinated? Who would have taken his place and what difference would it have made in the war? This is a novel of incredible scope and brilliance. It tells stories of High-flying aces, generals, slave laborers, and many others in an interesting, engaging manner. The scholarship shown by the authors is amazing. If you like war stories at all (and very possibly - even if you don't) this is a book you can't put down."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"The plot of this enjoyable AH adventure is a military historian's dream come true: what if Rommell had come back in 1944 for a final showdown against Patton, with hordes of Tiger tanks and Me-262 jet fighters at his disposal?Here's how it happens: in July 1944, a band of dissatisfied German military officers successfully kills Hitler with a well-placed time bomb (they tried in real life, but were foiled at the last minute). Heinrich Himmler, supported by the vast power of the SS, fills in the power vaccuum and becomes the new Fuhrer.Realizing that he needs a powerful leader in charge of the Wehrmacht if Germany is to have any hope of success, Himmler puts Rommell, seriously injured but sound of mind, back in charge of the Western Front. He also realizes the need to combat Allied air superiority, and therefore authorizes the Me-262 to be used in an anti-bomber capacity (Hitler had intended to use it for ground support).What next? Time to drive the Allies out of Normandy, of course! During the ensuing campaign, both Patton and Rommell make full use of their trademark strategic genius. Panzers roll, machine guns crackle, the roar of jet engines fills the air. Wargamers and weekend historians are sure to have a good time, and even non-historians will probably enjoy the action and intrigue."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"What if the attempted assassination of Adolph Hitler in June 1944 had succeeded instead of narrowly failed? The authors predict that Himmler, head of the SS, would have become Fuhrer and that his wartime leadership of Germany would have been more rational than Hitlers -- although equally brutal.The authors build up a complex alternative history peopled with characters both real and imagined and events close enough to fact to be believable. This novel plays itself out -- like the war games the authors invent -- into a climatic battle on the Western front. It's exciting reading with good characterization and descriptions of desperate battles and a clever, almost comical twist near the end. Patton and Rommel are the protaganists -- and formidable ones at that -- and the supporting cast is strong. The Americans tend to be cardboard cutouts, but the Germans characters are drawn with some literary skill. I recommend the novel to anyone who is interested in World War II and alternative history novels."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"As a dedicated reader of alternate history, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book. The plot was interesting, the alteration in history was thought provoking, and the writing was engaging. When Count von Stauffenberg placed the briefcase under the table at one of Adolf Hitler's meetings, he did so knowing that it would cause the death of Hitler, but what he did not know was that another man would move the briefcase out of convenience. However, that man did not move the briefcase in this book because he needed to sneeze. The idea that a single sneeze can cause such a huge effect, such as a completely different ending to World War II, is interesting to think about at the very least. It certainly seems plausible that the assassination of Hitler might have succeeded, because it almost did in the real world. What happened next in the book was one of several paths the world might have taken. Rommel commanding the German Army was probable, a treaty with the Soviet Union was not out of the question, and the mass production of jet fighters would have been attempted later anyway. The only problems with the book would have been minor issues with historiography that tend to occur with any book, but I can forgive them seeing as how this book was written for entertainment, not correctness. Overall, I found the book a good read, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre of alternate history."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"Writing an alternative history book is a challenge for anyone - since we supposedly know the outcome. Yet the authors turned this tale into a believable and spellbounding adventure. After reading the book I gave it my uncle who was an American soldier in the European theater during this event. He marveled at the accuracy of the details and how authentic it sounded. The book is an entertaining read and one any history or military history buff would enjoy. While fiction-it reads like a true account, but with all the suspense that keeps you from putting the book down."},{"Title":"Fox on the Rhine","review":"About three fourths of the way through this book, I decided to finish reading it because I'd put time into it already. The authors apparently never read the Rommel Papers or Mannstein's memoirs, two basics for anyone wishing to understand Wehrmacht capabilities and the military possibilities open to Germany. The Eastern Front still had incredible forces, they were just spread over a 3000 mile front, and constricting that front by pulling back to the border would have given Germany an eastern army that could stop the Reds, armistice or no. That front only collapsed in the summer of '44 due to the stripping of air power for France after D-Day. Bring the boys within range of some fighter cover, and they could have stood their ground. And, the 'stand and die' order rescission alone would have saved Germany, as Mannstein proved before he was fired for ignoring it. Rommel never, and I do mean never, gambled with the lives of his forces, as this book portrays. Many times, he attacked overall superior forces by creating a series of local superiorities which he then leveraged into an overall victory, but he never, ever, left himself without a solid escape route for the committed forces (and everyone else). This Bulge scenario is nonsense. Also, he routinely pre-identified and assigned sufficient guards for all his vulnerable points, and had contingency plans for the loss or reinforcement of any given point. These authors gave no hint of the staff work and staff leadership that went into creating his victories, and so the whole thing comes off like a Hollywood oversimplification for the seventh-grade-reading-level masses. Even if you leave that out, he simply wouldn't have left Dinant vulnerable or failed to build additional bridges as soon as he had riverbanks to do so, nor would the fighting have been over when the bridge was blown; when your bridge is blown, you fight the necessary battles to rebuild it. Then there's the nearly complete absence of air support at the level of wisdom Galland could have and would have brought to bear. For such an important effort, temporary airfields would have been set up in just a few hours just far enough away for security, so the whole Luftwaffe could pounce on an attack at once. And then there's the glaring question of what would happen to Mrs. and Manfred Rommel when Erwin surrendered. Meathooks all around, and he knew it, and if he were going to sacrifice his wife and son to save his men, he should have at least agonized over the choice for us.The writing was overall weak, as well. For exampl,e guns don't &quot;crash,&quot; they &quot;boom,&quot; &quot;crack,&quot; &quot;whack,&quot; &quot;bark,&quot; or &quot;spit.&quot; Splitting the good guys and bad guys so obviously that you may as well have issued colored hats was sophomoric and inaccurately portrayed the men of the various services. The Panzergrenadiers never put in a showing, despite their vital importance and great power, the US forces never seemed to think clearly, even while winning, and a Jabo isn't a fighter used for ground attack, it's a fighter-bomber (Jagdbomber=Jabo). There's a difference.I'd like my money back. More importantly, I'd like back the time I spent reading it. Sorry, guys. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Ibsen is often revered as the father of modern drama, and his influence has been compared to that of Shakespeare's influence in 16th century England. This particular play is a treatise on Ibsen's ideology. In it Ibsen is putting forth his very liberal ideas and he does not spare anyone. Both liberals and conservatives are blasted in this play that points out clearly that any individual does not stand a chance if he tries to go public with his ideas, especially if those ideas go against the majority opinion. Yes, it is a militant play, but it is also a comedy that shows real pathos and warm humour."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote An Enemy of the People in fury, after how the critics treated his previous play Ghosts. He had expected the so called Liberal press to receive Ghosts with a some what greater understanding. Instead he found himself &quot;fighting at the outposts of thought&quot;, while the Liberal press were slaves of their subscribers' opinions and following them instead of leading them. An Enemy of the People were written with satirical intention, but became one of his most brilliantly crafted social dramas. I have read it several times and admire every page of it. Ibsen was ahead of his time then, and in many respects still ahead of our time. A solid five stars!"},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Ibsen's play, An Enemy of the People is a classic example of the decision that must be made between telling the truth and doing what is right. Dr. Stockmann faces an extreme moral delema. It really made you wonder; what would I do in this situation? Would you be able to trade everything (your position, money, house, and reputation) just to be able to tell the truth? Even though by not letting it out you could become very popluar. This situation is applicable to many situations in real life ranging from events happening at a high school to things in the government. Even though it was written 150 years ago, Ibsen's characters' problems are still reflected all over the world, making this play a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Dr. Stockman is portrayed as the protagonist who champions himself as the herioc individual who makes a bleak discovery about the community.

Just to make things worse, his brother, Peter, is mayor and actually manipulates the situation to turn the press against him. This play shows how the majority is often wrong and, more importantly, that the strongest man is the one who can stand alone. What made this book lose a star is that, in fact, the first act takes a lot to finish because it appears to be so boring. I may have put this book away if I didn't have to read it.

The Dover edition is a republication of an anonymous translation. The back cover data notes that the play was first staged in 1883.&quot;Enemy&quot; tells the story of Dr. Thomas Stockmann, a medical officer for his town's public baths. When he discovers that the baths are contaminated and pose a health hazard, he is led into conflict with his brother Peter, who is the town's mayor. The tension increases as the drama moves towards its conclusion.&quot;Enemy&quot; is an intriguing piece of literature. While reading it I was struck by how similar the story is to that of the classic film &quot;Jaws&quot;: in both stories, a political leader is at odds with an idealistic public servant who is concerned about a danger involving public waters!The play contains much thought-provoking dialogue. Ibsen looks at the interrelationships among politicians, the press, science, and the general public. His characters question issues of truth, authority, and majority rule. Dr. Stockmann begins as a noble character, but I thought he becomes too over-the-top and in some scenes is reduced to a shrill, dogmatic cartoon (especially when he delivers a bizarre rant about poodles and hens). I honestly wasn't sure what Ibsen was trying to accomplish in some of the doctor's more outrageous dialogue.Still, &quot;Enemy&quot; remains a compelling piece of art. For an intriguing companion text, try &quot;Inherit the Wind,&quot; by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, which has some similar themes and motifs."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Have you ever watched a movie or play, and at the end of it you say, &quot;I don't get it&quot;? ---&gt; But everyone around you says it was the greatest thing they have ever seen... well, I will not pretend to be a pseudo-intellectual. Ibsen was way over my head with this book.Superficially the book was extremely interesting from the standpoint of: will one man be willing to stand up to a city when he knows what is right? In our story, the protagonist has discovered that the Norwegian baths are filled with a poisonous organism. However, when he voices this, the entire town goes against him because it will cost them economically, and they put the pressure on him to refute that which he knows is correct. From that standpoint - the book is excellent... and we are held to find the outcome.Where it lost me personally was when Ibsen went on his political diatribe. He further alienated me via his pages of discussion on liberalism in a manner that seemed conservative to me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed these speeches as well, and they admittedly felt more contemporary Republican than Liberal Democrat.In the end, I would have to recommend this book, but say \\"Feel free to not understand.\\" It is okay to embrace that not everything is clear, and at times his points are lost on minds as dull as mine. Embrace your ignorance, and enjoy it for what it is"},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Henrik Ibsen is the father of modern drama and his 1882 drama \\"An Enemy of the People\\" (\\"En folkefiende\\") was one of his more controversial works. In the play Dr. Stockmann discovers that the new baths built in his town are infected with a deadly disease that requires they should be closed until they can be repaired. However, the mayor of the town (the Burgomaster), who is Stockmann's brother Peter, rejects the report and refuses to close the baths because it will bring about the financial ruin of the town. When Dr. Stockmann tries to make his case to the people of the town, the mayor counters by pointing out how expensive it would be to repair the baths and dismisses the doctor for having wild, fanciful ideas. At the public meeting Dr. Stockmann is declared \\"an enemy of the people\\" by the Burgomaster.To really appreciate this particular Ibsen play you have to look at it in the context of his previous dramas, because they all represent a conflict between the playwright and his critics. In 1879 Ibsen's play \\"A Doll's House\\" (\\"Et dukkehjem\\") was produced, wherein the character of Nora pretends to be a silly little wife in order to flatter her husband, who is revealed to be a hypocritical fraud. The idea that a woman would leave her husband and children was seen as being outrageous and basically obscene. Ibsen upset his audience and critics even more in his next play, \\"Ghosts\\" (\\"Gengangere\\"), an 1881 drama that again attacks conventional morality and hypocrisy. The topic is of congenital venereal disease but the true subject is moral contamination. Mrs. Alving has buried her husband, a degenerate who has left behind a son dying from syphilis and an illegitimate daughter who is probably going to end up being a prostitute. The play ends with Mrs. Alving having to decide if she should poison her son to put him out of his misery or let his agonies persist.Again, Ibsen was attacked for outraging conventional morality. The following year after \\"Ghosts\\" the playwright responded with \\"An Enemy of the People\\" and the character that is most identified with representing Ibsen on stage in Dr. Stockmann. The allegory is quite plain when the play is considered within the context of Ibsen's work during this period, although while Stockmann is portrayed as a victim there is a sense of destructiveness to his behavior. At the end of the play Stockman has decided to leave the town, but then changes his mind to stay and fight for those things he believes are right.As is the case with most of Ibsen's classic works, \\"An Enemy of the People\\" speaks to larger issues than those in conflict in the play. The debate is over the bad water pipes at the new baths, but the true conflict is over the clash of private and public morality. Dr. Stockmann is by far the most idealistic of Ibsen's characters, and that fact that he is opposed by his own brother, the Burgomaster, harkens back to Genesis and the fight between Cain and Able. As was the case with \\"Ghosts,\\" there is an ambiguous ending where what happens next can be seen as going either way given your own inclinations as a member of the audience.Both of the Stockman brothers are flawed. Dr. Stockman's idealism is at odds with the practical realities of the world in which he lives while the Burgomaster ignores ethical concerns. Ultimately, Ibsen is not forcing us to choose between the two but rather to reject both in terms of some middle ground. The Burgomaster is certainly old school, believing those in authority get to make all the decisions and that the people must subordinate themselves to the society. But he was the one who made the mistake of putting the new water pipes in the wrong place, so even his claims that he is looking out for the welfare of the community are dishonest. Dr. Stockman argues for individual freedom and the right of free expression, but his attempt to fix the problem ignores any effort at persuasion or building public support. He also seems to take pleasure in be able to show that his brother made a mistake. Still, in the end we have to favor the doctor over the mayor because his integrity is clearly stronger, while still recognizing that his idealism is tragically flawed."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"This powerful play is my first experience reading Henrik Ibsen and WOW! The conflict is timeless and the leading character Dr. Stockmann reminded me of Sir Thomas More.After I read the play I did not want to put the book down and wanted more. I flipped to the front of my edition translated by Christpher Hampton and read his nihilistic introduction. Mr. Hampton missed the whole point and somehow thought Dr. Stockman really WAS the &quot;enemy of the people&quot;. Hampton sounded like one of the townspeople from the mob in Act Four when he wrote:&quot;This is to simplify Ibsen's intent; because however sympathetic Ibsen feels towards Dr Stockmann's cause, he is too subtle and profound a dramatist not to know that there are few figures more infuriating than the man who is always right. Stockmann's sincerity, naivety and courage co-exist with an innocent vanity, an inability to compromise and an indifference to the havoc caused in the lives of his family and friends, as well as his own, by his dogged pursuit of principle.&quot;Hampton's edition is a nice size with print that is easy to read.

The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"The action centres around a feud between two brothers -- Dr. Stockmann and his brother, the mayor of a small town in the northern part of Norway. The issue is the contamination of the local baths by bacilli supposed to cause typhoid fever. The Mayor -- (who is an impossible dolt, whose like can hardly be conceived to be a mayor in any European town) -- argues for piecemeal improvements in the bathing facility. Stockmann, whose name is roughly translated into &quot;The Chastiser&quot;, urges the drastic closure of the premisses. The disagreement escalates into a violent altercation, in which the angry townspeople, in support of their mayor, unite and denounce the self-willed Stockmann as &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;. Stockmann is presented by Ibsen as a fiery, stubborn, brutally honest egoist who would &quot;rather ruin his community than see it thrive on lies and fraud&quot; -- an embattled individual who sees himself as a champion of truth in opposition to the stupidity of the herd of cattle. The last act is a highly tense illustration of the follies and indignities to which anyone can be subject for daring to oppose the social norm. Ibsen has Stockmann eventually succeed in discovering that &quot;the strongest man is mightiest alone&quot;, though this is a naively Romantic notion, the consolation of the defeated in the light of the colossal ignorance of one's fellow beings. Overall, an interesting dramatisation of an individual's case against public opinion."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"I saw the play in London at Royal National Theatre and bought the script. (By the way, the same RNT production, directed by Trevor Nunn with sets by John Napier -- the same director/design team for Les Miserables -- with Ian McKellen in the lead role is coming to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, July 14 to Sept 6, 1998. Hampton has created a new version not a literal translation of the late 19th-century classic play -- as Arthur Miller did some years ago. And it works perfectly as a great theatre piece should. The language feels modern and natural which makes the subject matter all the more vital -- particularly as our culture deals with the same environmental issues; and in many ways the same types of reactions from people in authority, including the engineering of mass hysteria and fear. The critic for London's News of the World said of the RNT production, &quot;a tale of corruption, greed and the responsibility of the press...as up to date as this morning's headlines.&quot; I agree. See the play, get the script."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Henrik Ibsen wrote this play immediately after his play Ghosts was greeted by mass outcries (see my review of Ghosts). Rather than defend himself against charges of immorality, he pointed out that the multitude are wrong.Dr. Stockmann, a stand-in for Ibsen's views, wants to do the right thing, the moral thing, to tell the truth to the people of his town, a truth that they do not want to hear. He is the medical advisor of the town's health baths, baths that brings wealth to the community. He discovers that the bath water is contaminated because the town officials, against his advice, set the pipes in a wrong place, and the water flowing through the area is causing bathers to become sick. The cost of repairing the pipes is enormous and it would take two years to fix them. The doctor is stopped from revealing the problem to his community by the Mayor, his older brother, who was interested in his health, but not in the health of others, who insisted that the doctor be silent because the community wants the money that the baths will bring, doesn't want to pay the large repair costs, and leaving the baths unused for two years would result in a large financial loss to the community.Ibsen dramatizes the situation by making Dr. Stockmann somewhat flawed. The doctor naively persues his quest without using persuasive techniques to win over the town.The town newspaper and the home owners are behind the doctor until the Mayor explains the enormous loss to them. Then, as with Ibsen who described moral problems in Ghosts, the entire town turns against Dr. Stockmann and vilifies him, calling him a lunatic and an enemy of the people. He tries to explain that he is telling the truth, but the town people refuse to see it. The town argues that they are the majority and they determine what is right. This is reminiscent of the Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas, who is not mentioned in the play, who insisted on holding the community and the church above the individual.Stockmann responds that in matters of right and wrong, the individual is superior to the will of the many. In a memorable line, he says, \\"A minority may be right; a majority is always wrong.\\""},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"One of Ibsen's main themes throughout his works is the conflict between the realist and the idealist. Once again in this play Ibsen sets his conflict up beautifully. His main character Dr. Stockmann is realistically created, and opposed ironically by his brother the mayor. The fun truly begins when we get to watch the two brothers fight-one on the side of the public good, the other on the side of personal morality. Throughout the entire book, you question what makes each character tick, and the reading was really an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"Still being many years since this book was written by Henrik Ibsen, the subject covered is very relevant. I loved reading it again after a couple of decades since previous time."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"We are planning to see a performance of this play in a few weeks and since we had read it many years ago, we needed to reacquaint ourselves with the content. Amazon delivered it to my mailbox in two days. Ibsen's play is a profound and intricate study of characters, relationships, the environment and the economy."},{"Title":"Enemy of the People (Cassette)","review":"It is very ambitious to make a review of a book from Ibsen or other authors. Never mind, for those folks who are not familiar with this story, it is a must to read it. It happened in the past in a Nordic country, but the story could happen (and it happened already) in any place.However, regardless of the story and other details, the key concept is about the ideas of: courage, trueness, friendship, family, conflict of interests, ethics and many other fundamental life's concepts. It is a short book, therefore many people can read it, without considering it as a \\"waste of time\\". I saw the movie couple of year ago, but reading the book will help you to stop and think about the situations.In a nutshell, it is highly recommded to read this classic book."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"Leaving Home is a collection of pieces about Lake Wobegon citizens who either do leave or dream of leaving. It has lots of the old favorites from &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (including &quot;Homecoming,&quot; the monologue that most people seem to remember), somewhat rewritten as short stories. Funny, sometimes poignant, these are humor pieces at their best, with a surprising depth of characterization and the wonderful, slightly bemused, slightly awed voice of a master story teller. Of all the Lake Wobegon collections, this one is probably the most representative, because it is the most balanced. Belly laughs and a tear or two, although as Keillor insists, his view of Lake Wobegon really is NOT that nostalgic, and usually it's free of sentimentality"},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"I found this book in the apartment I moved into in Japan and read it only when I had run out of my own books and was waiting for more to arrive from Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised by Keillor's wit and insight. This isn't a book about small town people - these are stories about people. Keillor touches on some pretty major topics here. He is a wonderful storyteller. I found the stories both funny and touching and a bit edgier than what I expected. A great read!"},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"Leaving Home is essentially a collection of transcripts of the popular News From Lake Wobegon segment that is the highlight of A Prairie Home Companion, Garrison Keillor's live weekly radio show. For new readers of Keillor, it's an excellent introduction into the colorfully ordinary world of Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, the fictional town that Keillor has made into a functional microcosm of the small-town heartland culture that too much of American society often views as inferior. For readers already exposed to Keillor, it's an extension of our acquaintanceship with the characters we've previously met in Lake Wobegon Days and on the radio show.I think Keillor is undervalued in the world of American literature. What he has done with the Lake Wobegon books and stories, and with his radio show, is create a fully realized fictional world populated with flesh and blood people. And he has done so in a way that is touching and funny; we may laugh at his characters when they do something foolish or ill-advised, but the perspective that Keillor provides us ensures that we do so from a position of sympathy instead of superiority. The people in his stories may be small-town, but they are not small-minded. In some of his stories, Keillor examines the strong opinions they may have in favor of social values that some may deride as intolerant, but his focus on the decent, moral people at the core of the culture reminds us that although we may have different attitudes and lifestyles, we are connected by the common thread of frail humanity.My one criticism isn't really a criticism at all: that it is always better, in my opinion, to hear Keillor read the material aloud than it is to read them on your own. His warm, rumbling bass voice is the perfect vessel through which to hear these stories. While he does not imbue the material with any undue drama, he is a master at fleshing out the subtle, gentle humor of his stories. Keillor has a huge amount of material available on audiotape, CD and digital media obtainable at places like audible.com, and it is those that I really recommend for those seeking the complete experience."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"Garrison Keillor is a master short story writer...unfortunately, publishers keep trying to turn him into a novelist. This is his BEST collection of stories. Wise, warm, and wonderful. A worthy successor to the string of small-town American writers."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"I found this book at my school's library in the free book section. I had no idea what it was about or who the other was, but only grabbed it because it had the nicest cover in comparison to the other books. I was pleasantly surprised that I found a nice collection stories for the 'price.'The stories all take place in Keillor's fictional, religious, small town in Minnesota, Lake Wobegon. The only things that I really know about Minnesota is that it's cold, the Twins play in the metrodome, and the state has a unique portrayal in Fargo (the movie). Leaving Home gave me a better picture of the state, and how strange and interesting the place and the people are.It's not a very deep book, but its a fun read. It's perfect for when you're really bored and just want to read something. Some of the stories are actually quite funny. Some are so-so, whilst the others are forgettable. After finishing Leaving Home, I had a nice feeling the rest of the day. It's corny, I know, but that's how it made me feel. Check it out when you get that chance."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"Another entertaining update on the comings and goings of the citizens and exiles (returning for the holidays) of Lake Wobegon. Keillor never fails to provide sly and gentle insights into small town life in mid-America, though even here in Canada we recognize those stoic Norweigian characters as some of our own."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"As I was browsing through the library one day last month, after reading some Latin short stories, I came upon this book. I was intrigued by the cover at first. So I sat down in MY SEAT in the library. Then I began flipping through the pages. Man, was I surprised. I thought, in the beginning that these stories were fiction, but when I finished it, and read the last lines, my god, it's all true. The stories, not all, but most of it, hit you somewhere. It really does. It makes you say, \\"Hey, I know this.. This is...(name here-me?).\\" There's not much continuity in the chapters, like from TRUCKSTOP to DALE. Anyway, it makes the book greater. Again and again, the book is fantastic. Well, if you don't believe me, read the book. Then you'll realize that there is one more thing constant in the world...

As ever with collections like this I'm probably more reflecting on the last few stories because I stretch my reading over several months. Maybe I've reached some sort of saturation point. There were some good moments, but rather than finding most of these stories whimsically touching I found them inconsequential. I didn't identify with any of the characters as much as I have in other books. I'm cautious about dismissing it - I wonder if in a different mood I would have liked it - but where I am now it didn't connect."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"I have loved PHC for years, but have just recently started reading GK's work.

How about hand signals for such as &quot;child removal&quot; - &quot;crossed arms and kicking motion?&quot; Or &quot;A Glass of Wendy&quot; --- &quot;if a horse got on the sauce himself, he might get mixed up, but usually they did hte job and if the sheriff came, all he found was a wagon and a horse with red eyes and bad breath.&quot;Classic, good stuff to be cherished and shared."},{"Title":"Leaving Home/a Collection of Lake Wobegon Stories","review":"Classic Garrison Keillor.

For instance, when making the Buttercream frosting, the book states that you should put a heatproof bowl in and inch of water in a skillet. The proper way to heat the egg mix is to put it in a heatproof bowl, then put the bowl in a large sauce pan or stock pot of simmering water. Do not over fill the pot, you only need to have maybe the bottom 1/3 of the bowl in the water,and then follow the instructions listed in the book. I did this technique in culinary school, so I knew what to do. Someone not familiar with the technique may run into problems. The other thing that I noticed that when you look at the recipe list for the Choc Buttercream, the recipe asks for 2/3 cup of water, but in the execution only 1/3 cup of water is used.However, having said all of that, I used the classic buttercream, the choc buttercream, the rich chocolate cake, and the fav buttercake. I was happy with the taste of all 4. Especially the choc cake. It was moist, and SMELLED so much of chocolate. I gave the cake away to my freind for her office Christmas party, but I had fun eating the leftover batter.....LOL.There is a huge amount of information on technique in here as well. I have not read it all yet, the way it is set up you can pick and choose what you will read when you need it. There is also useful sidebar information with each recipe.

Three years ago, before I started reviewing cookbooks, I would not have even given it credit for that. Now, however, I recognize at least eight of the thirteen principal authors (Flo Braker, Marion Cunningham, Carol Field, Fran Gage, David Lebovitz, Alice Medrich, Peter Reinhart, and Lindsey Shere) as world class experts in one or more fields of baking. This puts the book in the same class as one of my very favorite baking books, \`Baking With Julia', a Dori Greenspan written and edited collaboration of the great Julia Child and over 20 baking experts. But in many ways, this book may be even better than the Julia Child volume.Not only is this a collection of recipes, it is a true collective effort based on an informal gathering of West Coast bakers seeking to explore issues in baking. In this mode, the enterprise takes on the aspects of the \`Cooks Illustrated' magazine, where lots of different ways of doing the same thing are evaluated. One of the first and most interesting revelations was the fact that all these leading baking experts went home and made an angel food cake and when they all compared their results, no two came out the same, in spite of the fact that they were all using the very same recipe. The first lesson I take from this observation is that simply carefully following a good recipe does not guarantee success in baking. All sorts of epherema such as the ambient temperature and humidity are important to so many baking techniques.Now, if you happen to own books from each of these authors, this volume becomes a bit less valuable, as I am sure there will be a lot of overlap. Even so, I found some unique things in here, for example, a recipe for making use of my just purchased Madelaine molds other than making Madelaines.Like the Julia Child collaboration, this is sort of a \`tasting menu' kind of book, which exposes you to all the different types of baking at a very high level of proficiency, and you can see behind the scenes at how these bakers think about their recipes and ingredients.If you are new to baking, I highly recommend this volume and the \`Baking With Julia' volume.

It delves into such arcana as: the differences between genoise, sponge cake, chiffon cake, and angel food cake; the proper way to measure flour (in fact, different chapters use different methods, so read the recipes carefully and follow them to the letter; similar comments apply to which rolling pin or what kind of flour to use); and 4 different recipes for pie dough using either lard, cream cheese, shortening, or butter. The same applies to the chapter on tarts. It starts out with 5 recipes for crusts (pate brisee, pate sablee, pate sucree, tartlet dough, and quick puff pastry), and the subsequent recipes for tarts start with one of one of the crusts. The chapter on yeast breads is especially noteworthy.Each chapter is written by a different person, and functions as a self contained primer on a particular subject. Each subject is treated systematically and thoroughly. In fact, each chapter could be published on its own as reference work on its subject. One chapter often contains more information than a standard cookbook on baking. The chapters are: ingredients, tools, basic cakes, fancy cakes, pies, tarts, fruit desserts, cookies, muffins and quick breads, yeast breads, custards, and frostings.There are 2 important features in this book that are absent from most others about baking. First, all of the recipes are the result of extensive testing by the bakers (of which, incidentally, there are many more than just a baker's dozen or 13), and not just a &quot;traditional&quot; one someone habitually uses. Second, all of the recipes are solid, old-fashioned favorites (like: brownies, biscuits, doughnuts, banana bread, apple pandowdy, pecan pie, cornbread) that have been staples of the family table for decades; there are no trendy recipes here for weird baked goods that you will never make. On the down side, there are a couple of editing mistakes: p. 221 and 224 both refer to &quot;page 000&quot;.If you can bake cakes from boxed mixes and make cookies from the recipe on the back of the package of chocolate chips, then you are ready for this book. Even experienced bakers will learn much from the collective intelligence in this book. If there is only one cookbook about baking on your shelf, then this is the one to have."},{"Title":"The Baker's Dozen Cookbook : Become a Better Baker with 135 Foolproof Recipes and Tried-and-True Techniques","review":"Did you ever think you followed a recipe to the letter only to find that your souffle had fallen or the texture of your cookies were more Betty Rubble than Betty Crocker? Well, this book is all about preventing those little baking mishaps. As unromantic as it may sound, baking is as much science as it is art (maybe more). The writers of this book are keenly aware if this and are not at all protective of the type of information that is key to successful baking. For example, in the Sour Cream Poundcake recipe there's a footnote that explains to the reader how the baking soda in the recipe neutralizes the acid in the sour cream and produces carbon dioxide for leavening. Information like this helps prevent baking disasters (like the assumption that leavening agents are interchangable)by cluing the reader into the chemistry that is at play.For me, baking is a journey and on that journey I accept the risk that the road will be sprinkled with failures (some at my own hand and others at the hand of inaccurate recipes). If there were more books like this, I could cut the risk factor by half and \\"let them eat cake\\" a little more often."},{"Title":"The Baker's Dozen Cookbook : Become a Better Baker with 135 Foolproof Recipes and Tried-and-True Techniques","review":"I was looking for a book that gave me information on how foods react to each other and why. This book does that and more. I particularly enjoy the first section. It calls itself a glossary but should be renamed encyclopedia. Everything from what percentage of chocolate liquor makes bittersweet chocolate bittersweet to what situtations baking soda is prefered over powder and why. The preface sections of each chapter are also filled with a ton of information that I have never seen in any of my other books. The section on high altitude cooking is also probably the most in depth published. To top off the interesting information are recipes that so far have not failed. I have made several of the cakes and they have been delicious and beautiful. There are only two things that would make this book better: pictures and weight. Even if there was a very tiny picture of each of the recipes it would be nice to be able to see it. Early on in the book they talk about how measuring by weight is so much better but most of the recipes are not by weight. How hard would it have been to put both cups and weight in each recipe. This book combined with &quot;The Professional Pastry Chef&quot; by Bo Friberg gives a pretty thorough decription of what you need to know to bake."},{"Title":"The Baker's Dozen Cookbook : Become a Better Baker with 135 Foolproof Recipes and Tried-and-True Techniques","review":"I made the sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving and it really turned out well.

It's an excellent resource, offering tips and techniques not found in most cook books. After reading through this book, you could probably start developing your own recipes.The recipes in the book are very good -- being a combination of American- and European-style cookery -- and include explicit instructions, along with the &quot;why&quot; of the technique. I baked the best-ever angel food cake using the recipe in the book. It was flawless, and I'm tough to please when reviewing my own baked goods.The only downside is there are too few pictures of the finished goods. I would love to see a reprint with more 4-color photography.

I highly recommend it to any cook."},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"This is a down-to-earth book describing Mr. Porteous' journey into Christian fundamentalism; but more importantly his journey out of the clutches of fundamentalism. It is a refreshing look out how one can still provide a valuable service to society in spite of an indoctrination of superstition and intolerance. Unlike some books on journeys out of faith, Porteous effectively uses humor and experience to remind the reader of the humanity behind the tragedy that is fundamentalism."},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"I read the book in two sittings. It is interesting and easy to read. Porteous describes how he came to be a fundamentalist minister, what his ministry was like, and how he &quot;left the fold&quot;. To me, the most interesting (and frightening) parts of the book are where he describes the fake healings and &quot;exorcisms&quot; and his radio conversations with fundamentalists. Also frightening is the amount of hate shown him by the &quot;Godly&quot; religious right after he deconverts. Most interesting also are his conversations with fundamentalists in which the fundamentalists rely on slippery linguistic manipulations to try to discredit Porteous. The main weakness of the book is that it does not give enough detail about his &quot;deconversion.&quot; He doesn't tell enough about the process of losing his faith. It sounds like he just woke up one day and lost his faith. The end of the book details his current work with Walk Away and the Freedom Writer, and he does a good job of exposing the agenda of some of the more political (and unhinged) of the ultrafundamentalists."},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"Thank You Mr. Porteous for writing this book and, along with Austin Miles, exposing the downright cultic behavior found with a sizable portion of the Charismatic and Pentecostal movement. DO not pass this one by!"},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"After reading Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore I'm glad I never got involved in Christian fundamentalism. Skipp isn't preachy about it, he just tells his story like it happened. I can hardly wait to read his newest book, Acts of the Apostles, under his pseudonym Guy Manchester. Even though it's fiction, I'll bet it's based on the experience he relates in Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore. It's probably as funny, too."},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"Skipp Porteous has had quite a life and has lived to tell about it.

This is a helpful book for anyone who wonders why Christianity is not working in their life. After reading this book along with several companion pieces by Dan Barker, Austin Miles, Stephen Arterburn and others, I have come to realize that what Porteous describes here is unique to fundamentalism and its dogma. However, it does not address the other components of Christianity, such as neo-orthodoxy or postmodern Christianity. I don't regard that as a weakness of the book, because unfortunately, it seems that fundamentalism is the only sect of Christianity Mr. Porteous experienced and therefore, can write about. The only weakness in the book is that in his matter of fact manner, he didn't disclose much of the emotional aspect of his &quot;detox&quot; from the group. Still, the facts are enought to invoke great feelings in the readers. Much respect to Porteous for his departure from the spiritual and mental abuse of fundamentalism. My best to you, Skipp!"},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"I have read this book twice, and feel that the author offers a sincere, fact-based perspective on what fundamentalism does to individuals and families.

I'm reading all I can concerning Fundamentalism and Pentecostalism, both pro and con. I found this book, as well as Austin Miles' two books, informative and oddly enough even encouraging. Porteous writes of his time as a believer so well and with so much enthusiasm at times I almost forgot he would be leaving the fold by book's end. He provides great counsel to aspiring ministers and I will learn from both his mistakes and from his successes. I would have given five stars had the book simply ended with his decision to leave the faith and why. It was such compelling reading through that point, sad as it was to see this man of God forsake his calling and ministry. But instead of closing Porteous fills out the final third of his book with a disorganized mixed bag: his stint working as a narc, a rather mean-spirited transcript of a radio show and other chest-beating accounts from his quixotic war against Christianity. I'm not opposed to this material appearing in the book, but it should have been as appendices, not a part of the narrative. I'd recommend the book to fellow believers, especially those given to charismania excess. Porteous is right about the dangers of running with every new fad, be it slaying in the spirit or today's holy laughter or hundredfold return heresy. Truly regenerated believers will not have their faith rocked by the story of Porteous' apostasy, the less-than-shocking revelation that we do not possess the original autographs of the Scriptures, or the less-than-credible findings of the Jesus Seminar. What I'd be curious to read is the story of Richard and Renee Durfield, committed Christians who worked alongside Porteous for most of his years in ministry. As for Porteous, I have hope that he, like Austin Miles (see Richard Lee's review of Don't Call Me Brother), will allow the Lord once again to take up residence in his heart. We will welcome you back with love, Skipp!"},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"Just because Skipp Porteous had a bad experiance with the God based church doesnt mean that all God based church's are bad. I had a bad experiance with a Satanic cult and no one gives a hoot. Give it up and forgive God he's already forgiven you. Eternity is a long time do we want to spend it in Hell?"},{"Title":"Jesus Doesn't Live Here Anymore","review":"Mr. Porteous has misread and misquoted the Bible from beginning to end. There are no inconsistencies in the Bible. If the author had truly been a born again Christian, he could not have made the comments written in his book. Mr. Porteous needs to get his facts straight and get right with Jesus if, indeed, he ever knew him in the first place. I recommend the book for Christian apologists who wish to refute and rebut what the author has written. It will be good practice for them, although probably too easy. The book is blasphemous and should never be read by those not washed in the blood of Jesus Christ. Mr. Porteous is one of the false prophets spoken of in the Bible and he will someday find himself in eternal hell."},{"Title":"The Royal Hotel","review":"Dear ReaderWelcome to the \\"The Royal Hotel. \\" In this hotel, gangsters and their babes are likely to be found.

The fact that it's entwined with WWI makes it somewhat novel (forgive me).But the flatly drawn characters all but kill the story. There's little growth, little development -- for all their experiences, all the characters seem to remain the same as when they were first introduced in the novel. And what's worse, the lead character is almost saccarine sweet -- so much sentimentality!The writing itself is decent, but not good enough to overcome the poor characterization and the sentimentality.Great literature it is not."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"Once upon a time, there were five French Soldiers who had gone off to war, because that's the way of the world.\\" So begins Sebastien Japrisot's haunting novel which chronicles not only the horrors of war and the endurance of love, but the ways in which World War 1 forever changed the lives of those who were caught up in the conflict.I have already read this book several times. For some reason, I seem to find myself returning to it every few years. Japrisot's writing is so beautiful and flows so well in translation (the novel was originally written in French) that it makes me want to take language lessons so that I could enjoy his writing in his native language.The story concerns Mathilde Donnay, an intelligent and strong-willed protagonist who happens to be confined to a wheelchair because of an early childhood injury. Don't let this detail bother you, as it certainly doesn't bother Mathilde. She has far too many fish to fry to let a little thing like partial paralysis get in her way. As a young girl, Mathilde formed a lasting friendship with a boy named Manech, who became her fiancee after their childhood friendship developed into a strong and loving relationship. At the tender age of 19, Manech was sent off to the war, serving as an infantryman on the front of the French lines. Literally driven past the point of endurance by the horrors he has witnessed, Manech arranges for an accommodating soldier in German trench to shoot him in the hand. Manech is sentenced to death for this self-mutilation, along with four other soldiers. Their sentence is to be thrown into no-man's land, the space between the French and German trenches, with no weapons and their hands tied behind their backs. What happened to Manech and his fellow inmates becomes a mystery, one which Mathilde is not willing to let remain unsolved, and spends seven years trying to uncover. In pursuing this mystery she will uncover not only Manech's ultimate fate, but also learn the stories of those who witnessed it.This is such a beautiful novel, and Mathilde is such a likable character. Each time I read it I find myself furiously turning the pages, hoping for a resolution to lives that were so unfairly interrupted."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm one of those people who never watches the movie first. The book is simply the better experience, and it's lessened, typically, by having seen the film first.That truism didn't exactly hold for A Very Long Engagement. I actually saw the movie first (didn't know there was a novel at the time), and I loved it. I watched it twice and immediately recommended it to my friends. About a year later, then, I happened upon the book and picked up a free copy. I doubted that I'd ever read it, but one rainy day, I picked it up. Before that day was over I was finished.The movie does follow the novel very closely, but I was still swept away. The mystery is so complex, and yet tight and logical. Once you're grabbed by it, you must follow it through to the end. The characters, especially Mathilde and Manech (who we've gotten to know through memory), are so engaging.Mainly though, it's just so hopeful. I think that's what got me each time I've experienced the story, the romantic notion that no matter how absurd and confused and sorrowful and illogical this life can seem, perhaps truth and love at least have a fighting chance.I think everyone needs to be told that sort of story every once in a while. This one does it awfully well."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. I was thoroughly caught up in the mystery and in the search for the truth. Like other books highlighting consequences of war, I was saddened and revolted by the tragedies. I truly cared what happened to these men. I didn't like all of them - but the author makes you care about them by his description and dialogue. Even some of the extraneous and minor characters had a charm of their own and each brought you closer to the truth. I was maddened at times trying to figure out the ending. That's what makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay sets her sights on the past to unravel the mystery of her fiance's death in Japrisot's complex novel of love and human perception. Set in post World War I France, the story opens with a masterfully sardonic description of five soldiers, condemned to die for shooting themslves in the hand, being tumbled into the no-man's land between the French and German trenches.Their loved ones are informed of their death in combat. One, Mathilde, determines to know more and is assisted by a dying ex-soldier -- the man who led the condemned group to the Front.Mathilde, still unsatisfied, notes oddities and discrepancies in the meagre record she has compiled. She tracks down any possible witness, relentlessly pursues every lead. All evidence, however contradictory in other respects, points to the same end and even Mathilde finally seems resigned to learning no more than just how her lover died.With humor and an anecdotal style, Japrisot maintains a certain distance from his characters that makes the savagery of war all the more visceral. He leads the reader on with human mysteries -- there are as many versions of the soldiers' deaths as there are individual memories -- and with flashes of pathos and kindness. And the story's ending is as touching as it is surprising."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a fantastic story; a mystery, love story, and historical account. I won't recount the plot, since that's provided above. I just finished Corelli's Mandolin, which is similar but not nearly as flawless as this. Although translated from French, the language is beautiful and lyrical. You will be trying to figure out what exactly happened during the entire reading, and then at the end will want to go back to put the pieces together. Truly an aching, touching story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a wonderful little book, a best-seller and heart-wrenching tear-jerker in the best sense (and there is a good sense of those terms). A girl's fiance' is reported dead in World War One, but she has reason to doubt the report. She tracks down leads for years, with the sort of perseverance only such a motivation brings. In the process she encounters help and hindrance, lies and truth, wisdom and incompetence, enough so that those who detest suspense can value this book while pretending to ignore it.Only after more than half of the story has been told are we given a glimpse of our heroine's pre-war happiness. The scene could stand alone, but is unbearably beautiful when read in its place."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I picked up this novel in part due to the many glowing reviews here. In retrospect, I have to wonder if these people were lauding the book or the movie. The book is very tedious in many respects due to its format. I think that Japrisot based his writing partially upon Calvino's work, such as the novel 'If on a Winters Night a Traveler,' or 'Invisible Cities.' The chapters of Japrisot weave from here to there in time and perspective dealing with first hand accounts, letters, and conversations. I think that all of this was a little too clever for Japrisot and that after a while the cumbersome nature of all this forces a collapse of will and you as a reader will be overwhelmed by its overworked zeal. I brought up Calvino because where-as 'Winters Night' is magical in many ways, 'Engagement' comes across as sort of typical.You might disagree with my summation here. The story is pretty good, though I would not recommend it to anyone. I think that Japrisot's cleverness smothers a lot of what was enjoyable in regards to the plot. I would say that if you enjoyed this book, you are in for a nice treat if you have not read 'Winters Night...' by Calvino. You might also be interested in Murakami's 'Wind Up Bird Chronicle'."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It is a shame that I saw &quot;Amalie&quot; before reading this book. Though I loved the movie, I kept seeing that actress as the main character of this book. And though there are some similarities in personality, Mathilde exposes herself to our examination far more deeply than Amalie did.Many books have been written about missing fiances, missing lovers, war widows. This book takes those stories and binds them into a gripping mystery. This novel is NOT a tear-jerker and for that alone, it is wonderful. It is a novel about strength and love and a wish for what could have been. It is about who you would want to be if your lover was lost in the war. I will be buying this book for my mother and my best friends. It is something different. I loved it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I didn't expect to love this book. I'm not much of a history buff and hardly ever read mysteries, so I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. The love story is great and the images are wonderful. I can't say enough about it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"In 1917 five French soldiers are sentenced to death for desertion. Instead of being normally executed, they are taken to the French front to be shot dead by the Germans.Mathilde Donnay, the seventeen-year-old fiancee of one of the five, is told her lover died bravely in combat. But two years later she's contacted a dying officer who tells her otherwise. Some facts are missing from his story. There's a slim chance one or two of the men survived, and so, Mathilde undertakes a heroic search for the truth.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is the story of Mathilde's search, told in a collage of scenes, letters, and narrating voices of those who knew the five men. What emerges is a gripping, sometimes thrilling mystery as Mathilde uncovers one piece of a very complex puzzle after another. Along the way we get to know not only the man Mathilde loves but also the other four (a carpenter, a welder, a pimp and a farmer) and their loved ones.Mathilde is a wonderful heroine. A fall off a ladder at age three left her bound to a wheelchair, but she's completely free of self pity. She is above all stubborn, someone who will not give up no matter what. Many people try to tell her that her search is futile, but she persists with doggedness that is at times a little selfish, but also a measure of her loyalty and love for her fiance.Most of the characters in A VERY LONG ENGAGMENT are very likeable. While their circumstances are sometimes sad, and we see how the war has affected their lives, the book is also uplifting because so many of them go out of their way to help others.The first chapter is a bit slow, but after that, the book takes off like a roller coaster. Clue after clue falls into place, and Japrisot keeps the reader guessing. The setting, France 1919-1924, is beautifully and authentically rendered.I enjoyed A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT tremendously. It is a story about devotion and dedication, as well as a story about the tragedy of war, and the beauty of life."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot -- what a discovery! &quot;A Very Long Engagement&quot; is everything you could possibly want in a novel. It is divine and picturesque. It is unbelievably sad and beautiful, competantly evoking anger and pain in even the most jaded of readers. I found myself in tears and rapture countless times over. For the first time, I am hoping desperately for a second novel as I was completely tormented at having to come to the end of this one. An absolute must read for anyone looking for real literature in the existing sea of legal deception, post-mortum examination, and intellectual cannabalism."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"More than a year has gone by since Mathilde received word of her lover's death in the war, when in the summer of 1919 she is contacted by an ex-soldier dying in a hospital who tells her he knew Manech (her fiance) and that Manech's death was not what was officially reported. Instead of dying in combat as she had believed, Manech was part of a group charged with cowardice & to set an example for other soldiers was condemned to die by being tossed into \\"no man's land\\", the area between the French & German trenches to be killed by the Germans. Mathilde needs to know exactly what happened to Manech, has the money to pursue the truth & does so, and along the way it begins to appear possible that not all 5 men died that night, 1 or maybe even 2 may have survived, but if they did and were found they would now have prison terms to serve.The author has given us an intricate puzzle, Japrisot's style of writing is something new to me there is no one I can think of to compare him to. This is a first rate detective story for the intelligent reader, definitely not a \\"formula\\" mystery, also it is a war novel with grim descriptions of trench life. The prose is blunt, there are no wasted words in the main plot, yet along the way there are so many \\"asides\\", little anecdotes and fascinating glimpses into the private lives and motivations of ordinary people during the war, the book is never dull.Highly recommend this bestseller from France."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've read this book twice and am ordering another copy to give away. At once a literary mystery, a WWI history lesson, and a love story with a true heroine, A Very Long Engagement will keep you turning pages until the very end.

Don't plan to do anything else while you're reading this book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"After I finished this book, I went online and ordered all the books of Mr. Japrisot's from Amazon. Some of the reviews cautioned against expecting the same level of narrative in the other books, but who cares? I'd try anything by this author. The other books haven't arrived yet and meanwhile I am chewing over parts of this book, so wonderfully painful, uplifting and chock-full of truths about &quot;the ways of the world&quot;."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was one of the most beautiful and moving books I have ever read. I have avoided literature based around WWI and reading this book certainly raised my general knowledge of the conditions that existed for the soldiers.

It is particularly deft in its handling of the war scenes. It was the perfect balance between mystery, historic fact and clever story telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for a book discussion group about three years ago - I had a month to read it, but devoured it in a matter of three days! (I would have done in one sitting if I were not obliged to go to work.) This is a flawlessly written mystery that captures very eloquently the devastating horrors of war - poetically integrating ironic twists of fate with the tenacity of hope in the human heart. Japrisot has created an absolutely lovable three-dimensional heroine in Mathilde - who the reader can't help but follow across any vast expanse or obstacle - holding on to scarcely even a thread of hope - to find the true fate of her fianc&eacute; lost in the \\"no man's land\\" of WWI. This is a fine read - but be forewarned - you'll have a very hard time putting this one down!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is a marvelous book. It is a powerful indictment of the hideous way in which WWI was fought. The central event of the story provides us with a clear picture of the inhumane nature of that conflict. The writer weaves an engrossing tale of love, mystery and history. There is however, an air of unreality to the gentle and kind nature of most of the characters that Mathilde comes in contact with. These characters are in stark juxtaposition with the shadowy figures that caused the inhumane sentence to be carried out. The only fault I can find is that the characters could have been more complicated."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I discovered this book in the library several years ago, but was not able to read it at the time and lost track of it. A friend's book club read it last year, but I did not hear many comments. I ran across it in a used book shop recently and was re-interested because I had enjoyed &quot;Birdsong&quot; (by Sebastian Faulks), also a love/war story set in WWI France. &quot;Birdsong&quot; follows a young Englishman through a disappointed love affair with the wife of his French employer into the trenches and tunnels of a very ugly war. The detail is unsurpassed -- how could this be written by someone who had never experienced it? If you enjoyed Japrisot's novel, you should give &quot;Birdsong&quot; a read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Although I am not a big fan of war-related novels, this book kept me riveted by its brilliant plot and it's treatment of the realities of the First World War. As a piece of story-telling it is absolutely first-rate and entirely compelling. What stops me from giving it 5 stars is the one-dimensional characterization of Mathilde and her family, and the occasional simplistic descriptions that leaves little room for the reader's imagination. These are very minor complaints in a novel that I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"My bookclub hated this book, just hated it. This was a very good sign (they hated Frankenstein, too, one of my favorites!). I, as usual, hadn't even bought (let alone read) the book in time for our bookclub meeting, so when I received it as a gift last year, I moved it to the top of the ever-growing pile of fiction, New Yorker magazines, and miscellaneous other printed matter mounting up on my bedside table.This is a really powerful and evocative story. It pulled me in right away, in part due to the mysterious plot line, but also because of the curious structure of the book. It's unlike anything else I've read for a long time. Brings to mind &quot;The Stone Diaries&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News&quot; in that past and present are intermingled seamlessly, adding depth and dimension to an otherwise simple story.I can absolutely understand why the members of my (now ex-) bookgroup didn't like this book: it requires some close reading, some flipping around to remind yourself who's who, and it unfolds relatively slowly (but very vividly). But the descriptions of WWI France, the characters, and the appalling reality of open-trench warfare are plausably and deftly rendered. I learned a lot, and I cared a lot for the characters. I can't say that about many books I've read lately.Not everyone will like it. Only way to find out which side you're on is... throw it in the shopping basket! Strongly recommended"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Sebastien Japrisot is a world class author and this is his best work to date.Part mystery, part historical fiction, part war novel, part romance, A Very Long Engagement follows the exploits of one Mathilde Donnay as she tries to establish just what really happened to her fianc&eacute; on the front lines during a battle at Picardy in WW1.Mathilde is one of the truly unique protagonists to appear in many a year. Her determination and unyielding spirit are quite inspiring.This is a book that speaks to many things-honor, devotion, love, the chaos and cruelties of war, friendship, the triumph of the individual. It's the sort of novel that warms your soul while concomitantly breaking your heart. In the end, it stands as a remarkable spiritual work that will stay with you forever.Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Five desperate men shoot themselves in order to be relieved from the horrifying frontline at the Somme, in WWI. A court-martial decides to punish them by leaving them alone in no-man's land, to be killed in the crossfire. Then all hell breaks loose and they all die. Or not?One of these men's fianc&eacute;e, a young girl who can't walk since age 3, receives information that makes her suspect his boyfriend might have gotten away alive. So she embarks in a painful, long and often frustrating ordeal to find out the truth.Along the way, I got to really love Matti. She's kinda spoiled and obstinate, but she is a wonderful person, full of true love. Other characters are equally appealing, and the story of Manech and his infortunate companions at war is revealed bit by it, through confusing memories and even contradictory pieces of information.We discover a terrible but beautiful story through what Clausewitz called \\"the fog of war\\". And this story is about courage, nobility, cruelty, loyalty, friendship and, above all, true love.Absolutely recommended, it is a novel that will easily remain in your memory."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"War is not glorious. Especially if you're Manech, a 20-year old French soldier convicted by a military court, along with four others, of committing self-mutilation with the intent of escaping service in the front lines of World War I. The punishment is grotesque. Rather than death by a firing squad, the five are to be thrust, hands bound, over the wire fronting the most forward trench and into the No Man's Land between the French and German positions - there to die by whatever bullet, mortar shell, or bomb strikes them down. The subsequent deaths of all five are attested to. Letters are sent to surviving family members by the French authorities saying their boys \\"died in battle\\". This was in 1917.Mathilde was Manech's fianc&eacute;e when he marched off to battle. She's also confined to a wheelchair, unable to walk since she fell off a stepladder at age 3. In 1919, she's contacted by a dying survivor of the war, ex-Sergeant Esperanza, who'd been in charge of the provost detail assigned to escort the five condemned men to the front trench, as well as act as censor for the last letter each was permitted to write home. He tells Mathilde of their bizarre fate, and gives her copies of their last letters, transcribed by him personally. Using these copies and the veteran's story to provide clues, Mathilde embarks on a multi-year search for the truth behind Manech's death. Interviewing friends, family members, and lovers of Marech's four condemned companions, as well as other soldiers present in the trench, Mathilde needs to answer the question, \\"Is he truly dead?\\" She has doubts. The evidence is inconsistent.A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT is an odyssey of mystery, official cover-ups, lies, misperceptions, secrets, coincidence, tenuous clues, guilt, innocence, and honor. And, ultimately, love. Astute and sardonic Mathilde, perhaps because of her affliction, is a take-no-prisoners dynamo of perseverance. No obstacle is too great that it can't be overcome. In the end, she finds ... Truth.This novel by S&eacute;bastien Japrisot is an unusual and unusually intelligent detective story, as well as a look at an almost-forgotten time and place strewn with the wreckage - physical, emotional and psychological - of the War to End All Wars. You'll put it down feeling ... satisfied. I recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is one of the best WWI stories I have read, including Pat Barker's Resurrection trilogy. The rhythm of the opening section, with it's repeated Watch Out For The Wire holds you immediately. You want to know what is going to happen, not just to the prisoners, but to all of the men whose eyes stare out at them from the trenches. The writing is beautiful; the characters unforgettable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A quick, engrossing, thought-provoking read. A first-glance, the story sounds like a repackaging of Kubrick's 1957 film, Paths of Glory: the insanity of WWI military (in)justice, etc. We already know that bad things happen to soldiers who are branded as cowards by the French army. You wonder where Japriscot will take the story that could possibly be fresh. He succeeds by casting it as a mystery rather than a courtroom drama, and by forcing the reader to peel back memories of seemingly inconsequential details with each new piece of evidence. The writing is elegant and restrained, the pacing brisk and mesmerizing. Japriscot pulls off an intricate plot with ingenious narrative devices, without pounding us on the head with post-modernism for its own sake. It's part war novel, part romance, part mystery--sort of a French Snow Falling on Cedars. Very unlikely to disappoint."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a very engrossing book whose story is told from many viewpoints. I especially enjoyed the character of Mathilde and her enthusiasm and tenacity to find the &quot;truth&quot;. However, I found the translation quite stilted. Having read many translated books and thoroughly enjoying them, this title was quite a chore. I found some of the translated content to be almost elementary in nature. I only wish that I was fluent in French, as I know I would have enjoyed this title immensely. Don't let this stop you, however, from chosing this book, as the story is a good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This isn't a mystery in the widely-accepted sense of a mystery. But it is a story of putting together clues to discover the truth. I don't need to summarize the book again (there are plenty of good ones already submitted), but I wanted to add my five stars to the review page. By the way, I read this after I saw the film version (which I also recommend). It's worth reading even after seeing it performed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"All the other reviewers have said it all--this is a good book. I am adding my two cents because I am having such a hard time finding books of this quality to read. Something different, something well written (my interpretation of the translation was that it is Etchevery's style of writing--a little bit Hemingway), something that makes you think.I rely a lot on these reader reviews to help me find those types of books. I hope you find this review helpful."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"S&eacute;bastien Japrisot, an author, screenwriter and director was was born in Marseille in 1931. \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" was first published in France in 1991.The book opens on a cold night in January 1917, during the First World War. Five French soldiers are being marched to Bingo Cr&eacute;puscule, a frontline trench at the Somme. All five had been found guilty of self-mutilation, in an attempt to be invalided out of the war : as a result, they have been sentenced to death. Unarmed and wIth their hands bound, the five - known to their fellow soldiers as the Eskimo, Six-Sous, That Man, Common Law and the Cornflower - are thrown into no-man's land as night falls.While the sentence isn't exactly fair on any of the five men, it's the Cornflower's inclusion on the list that's hardest to take. Still only a teenager, he was shellshocked to the point of total amnesia - he had no real idea of who he was, let alone what was happening to him. The Cornflower's real name was Jean Etchervery, although he was known as Manech to his friends and family, and he grew up in Cap Breton near Biarritz. Manech had left a fiancee behind, Mathilde Donnay, and - just before he'd been sent over, he'd been allowed to write her a letter. Just over two and a half years later, Mathilde receives another letter - this time from a nun. A former soldier in her care is dying, and he wants to meet her. Daniel Esperanza had been at the Somme, and had met Manech in January 1917. What Esperanza has to tell her leads Mathilde to investigate what really happened that day - and all the little clues, all the slight inconsistencies gives her some, slight hope that Manech might still be alive.A very easily read, beautifully written book - totally recommended. (Jeunet's film version is excellent too, so long as you don't mind subttiles)."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is not a \\"casual\\" read. It demands careful attention, that and a pad of paper to keep all the characters and their various nicknames straight. Without this forethought the story could easily be construed as confusing and convoluted. It may not easy keeping all the details in order but once you do the result is immensely worthy of your time. Mathilde is a wonderful heroine, loyal, witty and relentless in her pursuit of the truth. Just the kind of gal you would want on your side. This gripping story of devotion and fearless determination coupled with the insanity and cruelty of war is a must read. 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was recommended by a co-worker and, boy, am I glad it was. The book is a bit slow getting going but I quickly found I didn't want to put it down. The cross-genre aspect (part romance, part mystery, part historical fiction) was amazingly well-done. I doubt that few authors could pull this off; Japrisot did so beautifully. The character development is also incredibly well done. Although you never meet many of the characters, by the time you're done reading the book, you feel like you knew each and every one intimately. I've recommended this book to a friend who teaches high school English as a study in Character development--she intends to incorporate this into her class next year! GREAT book!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I chose this book after hearing it reviewed on NPR. It touched so many feelings, the horror of war, the comedy of errors, the discipline of the military, the passion of young love, the depth of maternal love, the loyalty of friends, the determination to seek the truth. I found it hard to believe this book was authored by a man! Definitely on my list of books to bring along to a desert island."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"It's a beautiful story told through the soul of a passionate and persistent young heroine. Her lost fiance is named Cornflower, not because of his youth (as indicated in another review) but because of his clear blue eyes. This comes from the French word for cornflower, &quot;bleuet.&quot; These clear blue eyes and innocent soul frozen in boyhood are the quest that holds the story together. Some will find it hard to follow because of the jigsaw-like pieces that come from multiple voices, through letters and a few personal meetings. But it holds together and in the end, a believeable sense of peace descends... bringing an end to &quot;the Great War&quot; and a new life for those who survived. I read it in French and English, and it should be noted that the translation, as always, leaves a few things out. It also helps to have a sense of French geography (or a map) to appreciate the full range of the quest."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and keep scanning the bookstores to see if any of his other novels have been translated into English.

How does one capture years ofpining, childhood sweethearts, brutality of war, layersand layers of mystery? Read Japrisot and weep.

The wholeway through the I kept thinking &quot;well, either:A. he's dead, or B. he's not dead&quot;yet Mathilde faces an outcome that is not A, not B, noteven C or D but somewhere closer to X or Y.

So I approached the book with great anticipation. Sadly, after an interesting beginning, the book became quite tedious. Ultimately I finished it just so I could get it done with, not because I was enjoying it . Some prior reviewers have blamed the translation but the problem lies in the story itself. There is a very linear simple and obvious plot which is made overly complicated by a plethora of ancillary inessential characters and confusing twists and turns which are impossible to keep straight. In addition there is no character development - the characters are drawn once (very simply and always sentimentally) and never change, and are drawn with thick crayon at that. The depiction of WWI was well done, but other than that it is not a book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This book was chosen by my twelve-year-long book group. I would not have found Sebastian Japrisot otherwise. This isn't the kind of novel I normally search for, and although the translation made some sentences seem choppy, the story line is so vivid. I could feel the fright of crawling through the trenches with bullets buzzing over my head, of the agony of the smell of death, of the soldier's despair of seeing loved ones ever again. This was beautifully written, but I found I had to write down the character's names while reading, in order to remember who each one was. This was compelling to one who has never been in a war."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"\\"A Very Long Engagement, \\"(\\"Un long dimanche de fianailles,\\") (1994), by the best-selling French author Sebastien Japrisot, is a dark, dramatic, emotional and romantic mystery of a sort, set in France shortly after the end of World War I. The novel won the 1991 Prix Interallie. It concerns Mathilde Donnay, a wealthy, crippled young Frenchwoman who wants to know for sure what happened to Manech, her missing fisherman fianc&eacute;, during World War I. Manech appears to have died at the Somme River, after being found guilty of self-mutilation - to get sent home from the front--at a court-martial with 27 other soldiers. But statements made by witnesses, as to what happened at the trench Bingo Crepuscule that cold morning in January, 1917, conflict.There can be no doubt that the First World War, which was fought largely in the trenches dug by each side, was a terrible killer of men, as the Allies - French, British, and eventually American; and the Germans, struggled repeatedly over the same soil. In fact, historians and demographers say that the French lost so many men in the 19th century Napoleonic Wars that it has had a negative impact on the size of the French populace to this day, and then came World War I a century later. So there are millions fewer French than there otherwise might have been. The author makes his negative feelings on World War I, which I imagine were shared by many French, and British, crystal clear in this book.Japrisot has done a remarkable job in creating this novel. He gives us a very accurate, evocative portrait of the French nation at war, and shortly afterward. Excellent dialog, narrative and descriptive writing, and a complex, multi-strand mystery, of which he pulls a few strands out to give us a powerful ending I sure didn't see coming. His characters, even the minor ones, are vividly drawn. However, Manech, and four other men, a carpenter, a farmer, a pimp and a mechanic, are sent to Bingo Crepuscule to be thrown into no-man's land with arms bound, and killed by German bullets. And I must admit that, as vividly as Japrisot has drawn the men and their circumstances, and as likely as it is, in reality, that five sentenced men should face execution together, I had a difficult time following the five men, their women, and the others in their lives, particularly, I'm sorry to say, with all those French names. Duh! I have been known actually to chart characters, if I like a book enough, and the characters are confusing enough: I did that with the Chinese-named mothers and daughters in Amy Tan's enchanting THE JOY LUCK CLUB. But I didn't feel like doing so much work here. And I was able to get at least the book's riveting conclusion straight.The Marseille-born Japrisot, who was called France's Graham Greene, was well-known and loved in the French-speaking world, and little-known in the English-speaking world. He was an author, screen writer and director: a number of his books have been translated into English and other languages, and made into films. This one was made into a French film of the same name,A Very Long Engagement, starring Audrey Tautou (Amelie).The Sleeping Car Murderswas also made into a film of the same name, THE SLEEPING CAR MURDERS, and is pretty much an all-star production as French actors go, featuring Simone Signoret (Room at the Top), her husband Yves Montand (The Wages of Fear - Criterion Collection), and Signoret's daughter, Catherine Allegret , as well as Michel Piccoli, Claude Mann, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. It was directed by Costa-Gavras. I remember seeing this film and enjoying it. Unfortunately, however, my enjoyment of this book was lessened by my difficulty in following all those characters. But you may have an easier time of it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. It truly makes one realize what World War I must have been like. The combination of a bittersweet love story told in conjunction with the battle scenes is very compelling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was different than anything else I've ever read and I enjoyed exploring a new author and style. I was wondering about the last page though. Can someone please explain why the format of the last page is as is and why the dates are so recent. Up until that point I thought this was the final account of the incident in the trenches. What are the dates about? I'd appreciate it if anyone would like to answer. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Few books attempt to bring together the disparate genres of mystery, war, and romance. This one does and pulls it off wonderfully. This was my book of the year in 96 when I read it. I've since recommended it to several (female) friends and they've all loved it too."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've just finished Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement\\", and I loved it. The story is beautifully realized, and the characters very lifelike and human. I was a little disappointed at the publishers reviews as well as the blurb on the back of the book - I felt as though it gave away a bit too much of the story. Japrisot, however, leaves the reader in complete suspense until the end of the novel. There were parts where the story dragged a bit - about forty percent is told in the form of letters to the main character, and some of these letters should have been two or three pages shorter. I also had a bit of trouble keeping all of the minor characters straight. In the end I gave this book a five out of five stars for its originality and the strength of the characters."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Just finished reading \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" and boy-o-boy was it good! Five soldiers are sentenced to be killed for desertion. One (maybe) survives. But which one? Ah... therein lies the mystery.Beautifully translated, \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" succeeds on every level. It's super romantic, clever/funny, and a damn good mystery. The ending is entirely satisfying. The characters are multi-faceted and the story flows along smoothly.One of the best books I've read in a long, long while."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I hardly know how to describe this book. Saying &quot;I couldn't put it down&quot; is not sufficient. It is different, unlike any book I have read. The plot was intriguing and the writing exquisite. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Like your other reviewers,I loved this novel,so much so that Ihave reread it twice.Next,I began three of his other books. I have been sorely disappointed.The rest is pulp. How could the same author write such a sublime Engagement and such potboilers?"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"it is rare to find an author who could successfully and gracefully blend mystery, romance, poetry, and history into one glorious novel. buy this book! buy this book! and again, buy this book."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"As a translation, the text has that awkward charm that occurs when phrases are not quite equivalent. I tend to like that stilted flavor. The author's use of present tense verbs in describing the action was also interesting. The plot itself was quite simple. The opening descriptions of the five condemned men and the surreal horror of WWI was the best part of the book. The conclusion also grabbed the reader's attention as it offerd a resolution to the question of the plot. The middle of the book, however, dragged. How long can a person write letters, ask questions, and talk about a missing lover before getting tedious? I have mixed feelings about the whole impression made by the book and probably would have liked it better as a condensation."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Talk about inter-genre. S&eacute;bastien Japrisot's novel \\"A Very Long Engagement\\" hardly fits one single genre. The book is at first --and most of it a war drama--, but at some point --still early in the beginning-- the narrative is also a love story. As the pages move, the novel becomes a thriller. But, above all, it is a fable. Just check the first sentence, the classic \\"Once upon a time...\\" The result may generate mixed feelings among the readers, but not by chance.As the story goes, \\"once upon a time, there were five French soldiers, who had gone off to war because that's the way of the world\\". From the beginning we meet the five soldiers. Japrisot describes with details who these soldiers are, and where and why -- actually not much of the \`why', after all, this is the quest of the book. Then we're introduced to Mathilde, a young girl, whose fianc&eacute; was one of the five soldiers -- or so the thinks.Years later, she receives a letter from a dying man, claiming to have information on her boyfriend. This is the beginning of Mathilde's journey, which will take many years until its heartbreaking conclusion. Throughout her quest, she'll come across the most different kind of people, some will be helpful and others not. Because that's the way of the world.The non-linear narrative is enhanced by the many devices used by Japrisot. From digressions to flashbacks, and many letters, the readers discoveries events before Mathilde. However, one will be able to fully understand some pieces of information only later -- when the girl can place the piece on her giant war jigsaw.The gallery of supporting characters is as colorful and the main ones. Mathilde is a strange girl. Confined to a wheelchair since her childhood, she has created many different lives inside her mind. At some point, one wonders if this fianc&eacute; really exists. There are many small plots surrounding Mathilde's secondary lives -- but it will all converge in the end.The five soldiers also have a special place in the narrative. Alongside with their friends, wives, children, they become a portray of the human condition, affected by the WWI. Letters from both sides are the perfect device to give dimension of their dramas.As the narrative advances, it becomes stranger, until its surprising climax. With this novel Japrisot (1931-2003) proved to be a great storyteller, whose talent will be largely missed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was one of the most compelling books I ever read. It is hard and demanding, but worht it. The details you need to remember are legion (in fact, after 100 pages, I started over -- this time with a notebook and pen). But the plot is very well done, intricate and fascinating. The characters are equally compelling [I really enjoy books in which the lead characters are likable and complex]. The protrayal of war is eye opening (and I think the new movie version does an excellent - if gorey - job of doing that). The movie is also very good -- but focuses on images that movies do well. The book is its own reward and I as many would say is better than the movie (only because it can be more detailed and longer). OK, so I really enjoyed both.Buy it. I'm recommending it to everyone."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Part historical, part detective-mystery, this is quite a remarkable work which combines fiction and fact and evokes a whole gamut of emotions from pain, anxiety, curiousity to some precious moments of beauty. The title may form preconceptions, but this isn't Mills &amp; Boon romance, or even a love story in the accepted sense. The reality of the horrors of war, particularly trenchlife in the 1st World War are vividly brought to life--the story relolves around the grim sentence of 5 soldiers caught for desertion and thrown into No Mans Land between the French &amp; German Lines at the Front Line of the Somme; and Mathilde Donnay, a cripple from childhood who is afianced to one of those soldiers. Her courage and fortitude to discover what happened to her fiance isn't super hero(ine) stuff, but her character grabs you so much, that you, the reader, can't bear not to find out too. Linda Coverdale has done a superb translation, although this book was a best seller and prize winner in France there was no guarantee that much of the essence would be lost (as happens with so many translations fronm one language to another), but she has done full justice to the original work. She has captured it all in the well-written, even flowing, riveting and compulsive reading--nothing has been lost in the translation. You don't have to be a war-story buff to enjoy this poignant tale. I whole-heartedly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I'm amazed at how many people loved this book. I did not enjoy it at all and only finished it because it was a book club choice. I thought the writing was poor and confusing (maybe something was lost in the translation), the characters were dull, and the story was draggy and boring. This is the first book in a long time that I disliked so much."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A wonderful book. Read it! One of the two best books I have ever read about WWI. The other is &quot;Soldier of the Great War&quot; by Mark Helprin"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I was assigned to read this novel for my college humanities class. I was immediately drawn into the intense and mysterious love story. I loved the characters, especially the strong and intelligent Mathilde who goes on a quest to seek answers. It is worth the time to read and I recommend this excellent book to everyone and I rarely give my kudos. I also have to answer to the riddle on the last page. Hossegor 1989, and Noisy-sur-ecole 1991 is where the places and years when the author started and finished his novel, not the deaths of Manech and Mathilde as some have speculated."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Great read, came really fast. This is much better than the movie...must read this first before you see it. Thanks!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This was a good story although a lot of characters to keep up with. The author did a good job tying the characters together at the end. I wondered if he intentionally made the story line scattered and inconsistent as that is how communication was in that time period. I would recommend it if someone likes to read about history."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've read this book twice, and it has stayed with me in a way few books do. The juxtaposition of the horrors of war and the pure gleam of enduring love is beautiful and heartrending at the same time. The soldiers' emotions feel very relevant today - this novel explores the personal costs of war in a way few stories can - with elegance and grace to balance the gritty realities of warfare. I highly recommend this book - it might very well become a part of you as it has for me."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love the book. I couldn't wait to see the movie. I must admit the movie fell flat. Don't waste your time with movie, but definitely read the novel. It is set during and just after WWI. Wheelchair-bound Mathilde Donnay is told that her fianc&eacute; has died honorably during the war. She notices discrepancies in the official story and is convinced that her fianc&eacute; is still alive. This is a love story set in a historical setting, but what I loved about the novel was the mystery or I should say mysteries because there are several in this novel that Mathilde must solve. I really admired Mathilde's tenacity to find the truth about her fianc&eacute;. The twists and turns this story took while investigating her fianc&eacute;s whereabouts and the mysteries that are discovered and solved during this time really keep you guessing about what actually happened to her fianc&eacute; right up to the end of the novel. I read this novel in 2 days, something I haven't done in quite some time."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an excellent book. Its greatest strength is the main character Mathilde. She is a complex, three-dimensional character who is believable and interesting. At times maddening, you still can't help but like and admire her.The plot is a kind of mystery which does make for compelling reading. However, since it incorporates so many different stories, story lines, and characters it becomes needlessly complicated at times and, yes, might even strain your patience.Still, after reading this book I now want to see the movie to see how the director approached this ultra-complex story."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Wow! I just finished this book after reading it every spare minute for the last 2 days. I did not want to put it down. The beginning of this novel is probably the best introduction to a group of characters that I have ever read. Not only for its character development but for the rhythm of the language. A spectacular achievement considering this is translated from the original French.This is a love story and an intriguing mystery as well as an indictment of the carnage of WWI. And in the midst of the climax of the story, the author gives further detail to a minor character (Mathilde's mother cancelling the cheese course) that had me laughing out loud. How did he know that I needed a break in the tension?This is a well told story that had me enthralled from beginning to end, deepened my definition of love, taught me more about WWI (Pat Barker's trilogy is fabulous for this also, and just as fascinating) and caused me to appreciate again the privilege of reading great literature and all the benefits truly great books bring to life.A must read."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"A Very Long Engagement is a magical book, one which weaves a tale and catches you in its spell--it will haunt you long after you put it down. The novel begins as five condemned French soldiers walk to their doom during World War I. They have all shot themselves, trying to get out of fighting and as punishment, will be thrown into the no-man's-land between the French trenches and the German trenches. Their families know nothing of this and after they die, are told them men died honorably. A few years later, Mathilde, the fiance of one of the men discovers some of the truth about what happened and she becomes convinced that her fiance has did not die--or at least did not die as she was told. She tries, doggedly, to uncover the truth. Along the way, she discovers many atrocities of that war. The novel pulls you along to its rather unexpected, yet still deeply satisfying ending, pulls you so much you won't be able to put this one down. The power of love, the strength of friendship, the failure of memory--all these come into play in this outstanding novel. I highly recommend this novel to all devoted readers. It's a bit of a challenge, following all the little clues Matilde gets, putting the truth together and tossing out the lies, but it's worth it. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. Japrisot not only artfully held the suspense until the last possible moment, he gave me such wonderful characters to care about that I couldn't *help* but frantically turn the pages trying to find out Did Manech die or didn't he?? But it's not just a good mystery story. It's realistic historical fiction that gave me a vivid sense of the trenches and post-war life. It's a beautiful, painful romance story. It's a clever, astute rendering of how people help each other and lie to each other and care for each other and punish each other. All of this, brilliant at every facet, in one little book. It's a brilliantly *woven* story...like Mathilde, the heroine, you have to hold on tho the wire and don't let go until you get to the end as Japrisot winds you through his labyrinthine tale."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The plot, the characters, the story, these are all very good, and very compelling, but I can't help but be annoyed at the translation.If you speak French, you can see right through lines that have been poorly translated too literally, and areas where too much liberty has been taken to get a particular point. At least, I hope this is the fault of the translator and the original is not this poorly done. My experience of French literature has been such that I can't imagine muddled phrases and incomplete lines would receive the resounding praise in France as is advertised on the book jacket.Worst of all, I have found myself frequently reading the re-reading a sentence three or four times to discover in vain what the devil is going on.In a description of Angel and another soldier's pact to shot each other in the hand (p.14): &quot;At the last moment, because his entire being felt revulsion at the prospect of keeping his word, Angel had snatched his hand away from the mouth of the other man's gun and had closed his eyes. He'd pulled the trigger on his own gun, however. Now he was missing two joints from a ring finger and the tip of a middle finger, but the cootie-counting days of the other poor clod were over for good, as he'd taken Angel's blast full in the face, and the horses, desperate to escape this mess of human lunacy, had trampled the rest of him to a pulp.&quot;First off, it sounds as if Angel pulls his hand away totally, but you find that's not so. Then, it makes you go back and re-read the passage a few more times, wondering, &quot;Did Angel shoot this guy in the face? What am I missing?&quot; My only conclusion is that the translator could have used different words, such as &quot;full on in the hand.&quot; For all that, the translator could also have avoided the painful use of phrases such as &quot;cootie-counting days.&quot;Is the original this bad as well?I like a good story as much as the next person, but part of what makes it great is the telling."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I read this for my book club, and was surprised to find that so many women in my group could not get into this book! Some gave up after 5, 10 or even 50 pages. They were frustrated by what they saw as choppy translations and hard-to-remember French names. Those who did finish the book, like me, found it to be so rewarding! (Actually, I didn't have any difficulty getting into it from the get-go, but I do admit to making a cheat sheet to keep track of the characters' names and aliases.) The end is not cheesy, where many American writers and film makers would take this path. I did see it coming a bit, but it was still handled beautifully and with sincere emotion. I really liked how the author took a circular approach to this story, returning again and again to the same scene, each time with a new perspective or missing piece of the puzzle. Well worth the effort. I would definitely recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I confess that I feel just a bit stingy in offering only four stars to this book, because I cannot identify a single area in which it is lacking. Japrisot's story is both moving and entertaining, the characters are richly developed and easy to care about, and the events described seem completely credible.I guess I find myself comparing it to books like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is, of course, grossly unfair. For one thing, it could reasonably be argued that those books are among the best written in the twentieth century, and how fair is it to judge every new novel on its ability to measure up favorably to such a standard? Secondly, although ENGAGEMENT is about the First World War, it is more accurately read as mystery/love story.My favorite thing about this novel is the way in which Japrisot offers the reader an opportunity to form quick intitial judgements about many of the characters, and then slowly provides the reader a deeper understanding of these individuals and their motives as the book progresses. I found that, by the end of the book, I liked almost everyone involved in this story. Perhaps not a &quot;great&quot; book, but certainly a very good one - and a damned sight better than most of what has proven to be publishable/marketable over the last fifteen to twenty years."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I made the mistake of starting this book, misplacing it, finding it, and discovering I couldn't pick up where I'd left off and had to start at the beginning again. It's just not a book to read casually. You've got to concentrate and pay attention and read long chunks at a time.Dissatisfied with the official account of her lovers death in WWI, crippled artist Mathilde sets out to learn the truth. Here's the deal: five soldiers were condemned to death for self-mutilation. The manner of their execution was odd: they were forced into the no-man's-land between the French and German lines and left to fend for themselves. Everyone assumed they would all quickly die, but it seems at least one didn't . And there's confusion about his identity. And there's the fact that one of the buried men was wearing German boots, so what's that all about?A spellbinding and enchanting story, Japrisot's A Very Long Engagement is a little of everything: history, mystery, romance, intrigue, and all done in a splendidly literary style.This book was translated from the French, which may account for a small bit of the obscureness of the writing. But oh boy, is it worth sticking with it. If you're not smokin' anything, not drinkin' anything - if you're paying attention all the time, you're in for a superb reading experience."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I never would have guessed a book like this out of Japrisot after reading his 60s noir stuff -- I read it once when it first came out in English, read it too fast in the way that dogs and children are apt to gobble their food faster than the speed of tasteability, and then (as is the way with most good books) everyone I knew borrowed it and then leant it to their friends, and so on -- 2.5 years went by -- the book wound up in the hands of my friend Ted, one of the ten or twelve inhabitants of the planet who actually have the cojones to return a long-overdue book (I am NOT one of that rare dozen, by the way)mailed it back to me, and I read it twice, and it was even better than I remembered it, especially at Round 3, when I actually chilled out and read it at an excruciating turtlespace... To be able, at the cranky and over-post-post-contemporarized fin de siecle, to write such an overwhelmingly beautiful and downright odd love story without resorting to worn-lace nostalgia or otherwise bowing away from what presently squats before us as the toadlike specter of our world -- that's a feat worth more than ten million silly opinions. My own included."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and I wish it was seventy-five thousand million trillion pages longer. Japrisot's prose is elegant, the plot is riveting, and the protagonist is someone I wish I knew in real life. You will want to read it in one sitting; it's that good. I'm a voracious reader who generally reads 1-3 books each week, and I would rank this one as the best I've read in the last six months (and there have been some contenders, let me tell you.) The translation manages to let the elegance of the writing shine through. I can't say enough good things, so I'll just stop here!"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I love this book. I first got into the world of A Very Long Engagement through the movie, and I immediately decided to read the book. The book is very well written, holding its different subplots and and the main plot together nearly seamlessly.

Also recommended: BIRDSONG by Sebastian Faulks and EASTER ISLAND by Jennifer Vanderbes."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"What would you do, and how far would you go, to bring back the love of your life? That question is at the heart of Sebastien Japrisot's \\"A Very Long Engagement,\\" a quiet little story about love and war. While the story drags a little at times, the exquisite story of Matti and the love for a man whom she won't believe is dead.Wheelchair-bound Mathilde grew up with Manech, and as teenagers they fell in love and became engaged. But Manech is killed in action, leaving Matti to dwell on her imaginary adventures. But one day she is contacted by a dying veteran, Daniel Esperanza, who tells her a terrible story -- Manech was one of five men who shot themselves in the hand to avoid fighting. Because of that, they were condemned to death: sent to the front lines with their hands bound.But Matti doesn't accept it -- she believes that there is chance, even a small one, that Manech survived somehow. She has her friends assist her in searching through mounds of paperwork, and she herself writes to anyone who might be able to help her -- ex-officers, widows, and lovers. And slowly Matti begins to piece together what happened that day -- and why Manech might still be alive.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" is complex and a bit confusing, but it's also worth the effort. Japrisot takes a simple plot and gives it some extra twists, a few lessons about war and misery -- but at its heart, \\"Engagement\\" is just about love and determination. It's difficult not to be stirred by Matti's long quest to find her lover.Japrisot's complex paper trail is a bit hard to follow, and the novel tends to drag in the middle, which is mostly Matti reading and writing letters. Japrisot seems uncertain where to go at that point. But the novel is also a jigsaw puzzle -- the German boots, the color of a young man's eyes, a lost hand, and a packet of old letters are all pieces. And many scenes in it are exceptionally tender and beautifully written. Matti's flashbacks and fantasies are dreamy, and even the real world seems to be a bit hazy. The climactic scene is without a doubt the most beautiful, understated and yet deeply romantic.Japrisot created a wonderful character in Matti. Despite being stuck in a wheelchair, she doesn't let this hold her back; she lets her mind fly in all sorts of fantasies. Perhaps it's that childlike belief in the unbelievable that lets her hold on to the belief that Manech is alive. And though Manech only appears for a few pages over the whole book, he becomes as strong as presence as Matti is. Japrisot avoids the cliches of young lovers, while convincing readers that what Matti and Manech share is stronger than anything that comes between them.\\"A Very Long Engagement\\" (now a movie starring Audrey Tautou) is an exquisite love story, heartbreaking and uplifting at once. And it will leave readers with a question -- how long would you look for your one true love?"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I also loved this book and I couldn't put it down towards the end.The war descriptions were very moving,especially the part about the prisoners going into &quot;No-mans Land&quot;.This book will teach you a lot about World War 1-especially about the effects of it,not only on the soldiers,but on their families also."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"Winner of an Audie award for her presentation of The Time Traveler's Wife, Maggi-Meg Reed gives a haunting, memorable portrayal of narrator Mathilde Donnay on the Abridged version of A Very Long Engagement.Another equally gifted actress, Isabel Keating is impressive and affecting as she gives voice to the Unabridged Edition of this emotionally riveting story of a search for a lost love.France is the backdrop and the time is before and after World War I. Mathilde has been unable to walk since childhood. Although confined to a wheelchair she has gained some reputation as a painter, yet she's unable to recover from the loss of her fiance. Jean Etchevery was a soldier in the war and declared dead; it was a dishonorable death. He was accused and found guilty of deliberately mutilating himself so he would not have to go into battle. He and four others were taken among the trenches and left to die.Mathilde cannot accept this explanation and with the aid of a private defective and interviews with families of other soldiers she believes Jean is still alive. But, if that is the truth, many more questions arise.Listeners will not soon forget this story of the dreadful toll of war.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"This is an amazing story of love and hope. I found myself holding my breath turing the pages.

The army has decided to &quot;execute&quot; these men in a gruesome show, to discourage others from wounding themselves to get out of the war. In the dead of night, with hands tied behind their backs, the five are thrown out of the trench into no-man's land between the French and German troops and left to die as the fighting begins. Two years later, wheelchair bound, Mathilde Donnay, fiance of one of the doomed soldiers, receives a letter from a sergeant who was at the front and met her fiance that fateful night. After visiting him and hearing his story, she is convinced that at least one of the men survived and is still alive somewhere in France, hopefully her fiance. The very resourceful and tenacious Mathilde begins a relentless search to find out exactly what happened that night and after..... A Very Long Engagement is a magical, spellbinding novel that has it all...history, mystery, romance, intrigue and suspense...From the first page, you are pulled into the story and transported back in time to France during and after World War I. The original, interesting characters are beautifully drawn; the plot, intricate and compelling, full of twists, turns and surprises that will keep you off balance and turning pages to the end and the scenes, vivid and riveting. But the real strength of this book is Sebastien Japrisot's eloquent writing and great attention to detail. This is an amazing story told with insight, wisdom and sensitivity and a novel that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"The storyline in this book is great and the author certainly does a good job educating the reader in the psychological horrors of war. However, the story is often difficult to follow with lots of new names appearing throughout that are hard to keep track of. It is by no means a &quot;fast read&quot;, but if your willing to really concentrate and wade through it, its a pretty good one."},{"Title":"A Very Long Engagement","review":"I've been reviewing for over 5 years. In that time, there is only one book that I ever started that I did not finish, and I never reviewed that book because I barely got 20 pages into it (if that). Well, now that number is increasing to two.I won't give a summary as many, many others have given a really detailed summary that is far better than anything I could ever have done justice to. Instead, let me tell you why I stopped at page 113 and why I have no inclination to finish this book.The first twenty pages are spent introducing five soldiers--their names, their prison numbers, their family, their main characteristics. The next thirty or so pages are spent reintroducing those five soldiers and continuing a few moments ahead in their story. And finally, at page 60, we are introduced, in a large, very exposition-heavy 5 page section, our main character.I found the writing to be terribly confusing. I don't know if it was meant to be that way, or if that is a fault of translating from French, or maybe I am just plain stupid, but sentences sounded weird, the writing was dense, and I had to start skimming in order to make any progress in this book. The book is written in present tense, but that felt more unwieldy and clumsy than some YA books I've read. Sections switched points of view sometimes without a section break, leading from first-person to third-person in just a paragraph. And it seems an omniscient narrator is dictating this...except for a few places where I thought it was Mathilde.The characters are painfully dull. First of all, I could hardly keep them all straight. They were like a deck of only red cards, which the author flashed at me. I couldn't tell who was a diamond, who was a heart, if that person was a 3 of hearts or perhaps a 6 of diamonds. The characters were so flat, it would be a compliment to call them two-dimensional. About the only one I cared for was the soldier wrongfully accused of self-mutilation...and I have absolutely no idea what his name is or who he is beyond that he didn't self-mutilate and was wrongfully charged. Mathilde was a horrible character, in my opinion. She was stiff, unlikeable (calling random people \\"sh&& kicker\\" is NOT a way to endear a character to me), and oddly characterized. I don't mind having a woman proud of her body, but this passage just doesn't sound like any woman I know:\\"She has very lovely breasts. She's proud of them: they're heavy, well-rounded, and softer than silk. When she caresses her *CENSORED* she soon feels like making love. She makes love all by herself.\\"Male fantasy? Bad translation? A very, extremely confident woman that I've never encountered? I don't have a clue.Mathilde exchanges letters with various people. These people are startlingly open about their private lives, sometimes going on pages and pages (when they supposedly aren't big on writing) to elaborate on every last detail of that person's life to a complete stranger.The story is supposed to be about a mystery, but it really didn't kick into gear until the last 20 pages that I read. Even then, I have no drive to figure it out, because I can predict one of three outcomes: 1) Mathilde finds Manech and reunites (unlikely), 2) Mathilde finds Manech and doesn't reunite (most likely), and 3) Mathilde finds Manech dead (unlikely). It doesn't really matter what ending will be chosen. Lessons will be Learned; People will Change; Morals will be Passed on.And this is why I am giving up on this book. There is no way I can force myself to read another page, and with so many other better books out there, I am going to pass on this one.HOWEVER, just because I didn't like it, doesn't mean it's horrible. I rated it 2 stars because \\"I didn't like it\\"; I'm sure lots of people who love mysteries, historicals, and books about World War I will love this. To them, I say, go ahead and give this book a try. I hope you have a much more enjoyable read than I did.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Over the course of many years she begins to unravel the terrible event and all the people that this affected. The story is actually quite interesting and the ending is beautiful but the way it was composed was poor.I understand the author wanted to introduce numerous characters due to the fact that this was an investigation and many people would be involved. However, I had a hard time keep all the characters straight. The book is also composed of a lot of letter correspondence, half the time I didn't know wrote the letter or what relevance it. Most letters began with a story of the writers life when we really only wanted to know what exactly you know about the day in question or persons involved.

Her character is trite and predictable. Secondly, the many characters in this story only detract from the main plot line and only force the reader to endure more of this book.I carefully considered attributing some of the arduousness of reading this book to its translation (or poor translation).

Since this is the approach taken by most mutual fund managers, it is not surprising that more than 50% (often much more than 50%) do not beat their benchmarks. I also found it interesting how with sufficient breath and depth, engineered portfolios offer higher return and lower risk than the S&amp;P 500.It is easy to see how &quot;alpha transport&quot;, when properly used, can also help maximize returns while minimizing risk. However, I imagine there have been, more often than not, improper use of alpha transport which did just the opposite (minimize return and maximize risk). Obviously not included in the text is the &quot;proper usage&quot; or algorithms for &quot;disentangling equity return regularities&quot;. I imagine the authors keep such information close to their chest and constantly update them as old algorithms become part of the efficient market.The work provides a guide to modern methods of equity management, and for those interested in the state-of-the-art, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Equity Management: Quantitative Analysis for Stock Selection","review":"The Good: It is a collection of some of the great papers by the authors over the years that have appeared in Journal of Portfolio Mgt., Journal of Investing and the Financial Analysts Journal.

Most of the chapters have their origins in various finance journals, though the articles themselves are not very heavy on mathematics. Overall, the book was interesting, though somewhat repititious. In retrospect I'd suggest that those familiar with long-short portfolios and the various market anomolies should just read chapter 2 about &quot;Disentangling Equity Return Regularities&quot; since that is where Jacobs &amp; Levy's original work is outlined.Chapter 2 focuses on the use of regression analysis to &quot;disentangle&quot; various stock market anomalies. The authors claim that simple rules such as &quot;Buy low-P/E stocks&quot; are appealing, but oversimplify the true source of stock returns. For example, low P/E stocks tend to have higher rates of return, as do small-capitalization stocks. But if a small capitalization stocks also tend to have low P/E's, then how much of their return is due to the low-P/E effect by itself, and how much is due to the small-capitalization effect by itself? Jacobs &amp; Levy have done the analyses, and show which effects are genuine, and which effects are merely proxies for other effects. The effects that turn out to be the strongest when &quot;disentangled&quot; include low P/E, Earnings trend, Earnings Surprise, Residual Reversal, and Relative Strength.The introductory chapters in the book make some interesting points. They argue that the stock market is not random, but then again it is also not simple. Although simple rules are appealing to humans, they oversimplify the complexity of the market. To gain an edge, one must use sophisticated, objective, multi-factor statistical computer models that capture the complex interactions in the market. Of course the authors are saying this to advocate the techniques they use, but nevertheless, they have some good points.Finally, the second half of the book focuses on the construction of long-short portfolios, though there is not much fresh material here. They point out some of the logistical details of running a long-short portfolio, and give some examples. Also, they introduce the concept of &quot;alpha-transport.&quot; That is, one can construct a long-short market neutral portfolio, then by buying buy an index (using SP500 futures, for example) one &quot;transports&quot; the gains from the long-short portfolio onto the gains/losses of the index position. Thus, if the stock picking for the long-short portfolio is done correctly, the total portfolio will beat the index picked. To me, this seemed like an obvious technique; I'm surprised they decided to focus on it and give it a fancy name (&quot;alpha transport&quot;)Overall, I found the book interesting, though somewhat repetitious. I was familiar with much of what was covered, however I did find that Chapter 2 was worth reading, since I wasn't familiar with Jacobs &amp; Levy's work in detail."},{"Title":"Equity Management: Quantitative Analysis for Stock Selection","review":"This book is great for people who want an overview of the opportunities available in numerical evaluation of stocks. However to say that this is a book on quantitative techniques is probably not the mest description.

The stories that Mr. Lothridge tells are entertaining and great examples of the good and bad of railroading - however, I unfortuntately have to say that the book is filled with grammatical, spelling, and other errors. I seemed to find some type of error on every page, and it does take something away from the book.Mr. Lothridge's writing, while mostly detailed and precise, sometimes jumps all over the place, and makes a general assumption that the reader has a fairly good knowledge of railroads before picking up the book.The first chapter of the book describes the history of railroading in the United States, but doesn't go into enough details about the railroads that Mr. Lothridge worked for.Even with all of the editing problems, this is a book that I would recommend for the content."},{"Title":"A Conductor Tells...

What it will supply is a view of the meaning of the various contentious phrases of that document, by illustrating the controversies to which the Founding Fathers were replying.As history, this book is seriously flawed, but even its flaws are enlightening. Hallam's subject is the &quot;English Constitution.&quot; Of course, there is no written English Constitution; it is a tacit understanding of the proper limits and aims of power, and as such it has changed remarkably over the many centuries of British history. Hallam blandly assumes that the consensus of his own period is consensus that has always prevailed. If it seemed contentious in the past ---- the several tyrannies great and petty, the civil wars and glorious revolutions, and the sundry controversies between King and Parliament --- these were the result of royal or parliamentary usurpations of authority, never reflecting adversely on the Way Things Ought to Be, which just happened to be the way things were at the time he wrote.This view of things is so clich&eacute;'d that it is often labelled &quot;Whig history,&quot; the claim that the grand powers ultimately assumed by the House of Commons, in derogation of the Royal authority, really reflects an ancient and inherited order rather than a dramatic change from the former status quo. As history -per se-, it is open to serious doubt.The point is, though, that whether this history is -true- or not, people believed in it as patriotic myth, and acted as if they believed it. This is nowhere more apparent than in the pages of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The very notion of a Bill of Rights was borrowed from the events chronicled in this book. The various usurpations that Madison thought to guard against in his amendments were aimed, not only at British colonial rule, but also against the alleged abuses of power committed by the Stuart and Tudor monarchs. To read this book from 1827 is to get a rare and valuable glimpse into the political habits of mind of respectably liberal English-speaking people in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. This gives this work continuing value.A literary note: Prof. Henry Hallam, the author of this book, was the father of Arthur Hallam, Alfred, Lord Tennyson's friend, whose early death occasioned Tennyson's -In Memoriam-."},{"Title":"Grains for Better Health","review":"A complete guide to the nutritional benefits of whole grains.

To be portrayed in a \\"positive\\" light. To be made to look good to the rest of the world? How terribly insecure. While there have probably been \\"nicer\\" fat main characters than Anthony from this novel, there have rarely been more complex ones. See, people sometimes treat novels like they're supposed to be cheerleaders. One of the points that was made in a bunch of articles about Victor LaValle is that he used to be over three hundred pounds. So if he doesn't know what it's like to be a fatso, who does? Just because he makes it seem funny sometimes doesn't mean that he's being insulting. While I've never met Oprah (what on earth does that have to do with anything?) I can say that I've read a great novel about a complicated, wise and powerfully developed character. I notice that this person below, who was so offended by the portrayal of fat people, didn't really pipe up about the portrayal of the mentally ill. Perhaps he or she hasn't ever struggled with that problem and therefore feels free to laugh at them, but heaven forbid we laugh at her.

The action is non-stop but at a slow, measured pace that builds to a crescendo right near the end of the story. The writing is interesting and stylistic in a craftsman sort of way. Anthony, and the three generations of women in his immediate family are all a little crazy, some more than others, like most all difunctional families we share history with. Authentic Americana, The Ecsatic paints a zaney mosaic of life in Queens neighborhoods in the 1980s and 90s, with a glimpse into medical care and public perception about mental illness. Readers who enjoy colorful character development and like learning about how others live will enjoy this book. There are some crude, adult situations described in the book so reader beware."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"I feel I wasted my money on this book.

It took me a minute to get used to the swiss-cheese sentence structure that pervades the book, but once I did I picked up the flow. This book sounds great read aloud. I've recently read quite a few novels with unsympathetic main characters, and at first it seems that Anthony will be another, but even as his actions get more and more unreasonable, he grows on you. I like how Lavalle constructed this story with a small number of strange pieces (characters, events) and still made it interesting. Quick read, unique style, and some really good lines scattered in."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Victor Lavalle is an incredible writer, and I was eager to read his first novel after thoruoghly enjoying his collection of short stories, Slapboxing with Jesus. This book is absolutely brilliant! It takes an extraordinarily talented individual to so effectively blend comedy and tragedy.

The book is first person from the perspective of Anthony, not just his thoughts and observations, but his deepest thoughts, the ones that we don't usually share. In Anthony's case, he often shares those thoughts not only with the reader, but also with other characters due to his speaking his mind unintentionaly and due to Lavalle's wonderful writting talents, which make this fit without giving the reader pryor notice as to the fact that Anthony is speaking and not just thinking."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Victor D. LaValle is astounding. Before this great work, he wowed the world with his debut book of stories, Slapboxing with Jesus, and this is a definite requirement for your list if you've not yet picked it up.In The Ecstatic, LaValle delivers characters and imagery filled with a quirky blend of humor and depression, excitement and self-loathing. It's a wonderfully straightforward story of aspirations and hopes that he paints over a landscape of melancholy and disappointment. You can't leave this book not feeling compassion for the characters within.A must for your reading shelf."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"The ECSTATIC is very unlike any book that you have ever read. It is equal parts funny, sad, and [sorry]. The lead character appears to jump off the pages and talk directly to the reader. My favorite line is when he makes excuses for eating something that he had no business eating, and as if he knows the readers don't really believe him, he turns and says \\"Oh Shut Up\\". It was straight out of Little Richard's mouth, I loved it. The author truly stepped out of the box for this one and did a good job doing it. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"The power of this novel is in the way the main character is both terrible and sympathetic. It was funny that by the end I hated the guy and I loved him, but most of all I felt terrible for the state he was in. It made me think of my own life, my own family, when I've had people who looked like they were throwing everything away on purpose and only when you get a little older do you realize that sometimes it wasn't their fault. It wasn't anyone's fault. It just happened and now we all had to deal with it. That's what I thought of at the end of the book. I felt so sad, myself, for things I'd said to someone close to me because I was angry at them, but wasn't thinking about what they were going through. I don't mean to sound like the book was like a therapy session, but that the story was so real it really made think about true life, real human beings. I forgot, sometimes, that Anthony was just someone in the book. I forgot that the grandmother wasn't a real woman who's walking around right now, limping really badly (you'll know why when you finish the story). Plus the writing was so beautiful. I underlined ideas and images just to go back and look at them again."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Hardly ever am I left not knowing where to begin detailing my feelings about a book, but The Ecstatic has left me on a one way street, yet I'm still not sure which way to proceed. Victor LaValle introduces us to 318 pound Anthony James and the affects of schizophrenia on him and those in his family which consist of his mom, young sister, and grandmother, all of whom also suffer from the same illness. We are taken through the whirlwind of Anthony's mind as he gives us accounts of various activities from a road trip for his sister to participate in a pageant for virgins, to seeing his Mom (who no longer recognizes him) leave with an unknown Indian man, to watching an auditorium of screaming people and protesters, to trying to help his friend through a bout of botulism.The book continues in this fashion and as soon as you're drawn into Anthony's current escapade and what's happening to him and around him, LaValle takes a quick turn at the nearest intersection, so all you can do is regroup and get ready for Anthony's next journey. Odds are that Anthony will be the catalyst of something going terribly wrong, yet I'm not quite sure he understood his part or all the drama around him. He appears to be an innocent observer, even to himself, but it's obvious the part that he has in all the mayhem, more often than not, he's the cause. I wasn't quite sure whether I liked Anthony or simply felt sorry for him, but I did understand him somewhat as he did his best to stay ahead of his illness.The best way for me to describe this book would be to call it &quot;interesting and different.&quot; The writing style is witty and compelling, yet at times, it's also confusing; especially the dialogue portions of the book. Perhaps this is intentional as we share Anthony's descent from sanity, however I wasn't quite sure. It's a book in which you're forced to pay attention, to read slowly, and block out all outside interference. It would make a great book for discussion as well as one to give you a peek inside of the mind of a mentally unstable person.Reviewed by Tee C.

I can't even explain it it was so....uuuggghhhh!!!"},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"If ever I have felt a love/hate relationship with a book, The Ecstatic would be the book that deserves this honor. I'm still reeling from the pages and the life that main character, Anthony Jones, lives. Anthony is a 318-pound schizophrenic, who is plagued with the same affliction that affects his grandmother, mother and little sister. The story centers on the mental journey surrounding food addiction and the lack of treatment for the families' mental afflictions. On the one hand, I see why Anthony weighed as much as he did; on the other hand it was disgusting how his extreme low self-esteem affected him physically and mentally.The Ecstatic will definitely take the reader on a ride. Starting with the extraction of Anthony from his college apartment where he was living in mental collapse while attending Cornell University, the story finds Anthony living in the basement of the home his mother, grandmother and sister share. Faring no better in these circumstances, where his family has imposed severe eating restrictions on him, Anthony seeks friendship and counsel from one Ishkabibble, the neighborhood street banker...(read loan shark here). Everybody in the neighborhood has something owed Ishkabibble (I loved the name, say it 3 times fast) and he takes advantage of this and Anthony by loaning him money to write a book, and using him as his heavy. The home life fares no better when Anthony's little sister participates in a beauty pageant for vestal virgins and they quite literally lose their mother while on this trek to the south. How can I forget to discuss Anthony's friend who infuses himself with a case of botulism to induce rapid weight loss and tries to get Anthony to join in. Just who is schizophrenic in this instance?The Ecstatic takes a myriad of twists and turns that I found to be quite confusing. However, the dark humor in the book sent me into sidesplitting fits of laughter on several occasions. This isn't a book to pick up you're looking for comedic relief but it is a pleasant aside. If you are searching for an in depth exploration into a weakened mind, this book can take you there. The unique characterization of Anthony and the adventures his life follows really makes you wonder how many people are suffering as he. I found that I loved the comedy, hated the reality but understood the quandary both created to make The Ecstatic a well-written novel."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Picked this book up after hearing about it at school, there were two grad students talking about how the book was really special. I got it and read it in a weekend and then reread it the weekend after that. The first time through I was just laughing and laughing. It's pretty funny. Okay, it's hilarious. Then there'd be these moments where some big heartbreaking thing happens and you'd be so surprised because the whole time it felt like a comedy. I found that it was written in poetic language, but that it wasn't difficult to understand. Which is rare. It was literary book that didn't make me want to throw up from all the pretentions. How many times can I say that I enjoyed it? A thousand times wouldn't be enough. Truly spectacular."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"The Ecstatic is one of those novels that should not be read by anyone outside of the intended audience and I believe in this instance that audience is comprised of english majors, aspiring writers, professional book reviewers, and others like me who function under the delusion they are much more erudite than the evidence would otherwise suggest. While I have reservations regarding comparisons of authors and texts, the primary character of this story, Anthony James, is reminiscent of other literary creations such as Winston Foshay from Paul Beatty's Tuff, Ignatius Reilly of Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, and even Salinger's Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye.Anthony is an imposing characterization in every sense. As we learn early on, he has inherited the family's singular legacy - mental illness- and the story takes the reader along on the tragic-comic journey to the affliction's inevitable victory over that which most of us would view as normalized existence. By mere size (substantially north of 300 pounds), Anthony has the capacity to intimidate, but often in his self-conscious, introspectively critical manner, he is oblivious to that fact. He is brilliant yet only tangentially functional in any environment, living in the basement of the home owned by his 93 year old grandmother and also inhabited by his equally instable mother and Nabisase, his constantly seeking and searching 13 year old sister.Along the way, a m&eacute;lange of inarguably dysfunctional, most often darkly humorous people are introduced however not surprisingly, only superficially expanded in a story narrated by a twenty-three year old, increasingly non-plussed by the reactions of others but equally as ill-prepared to personally take any steps to extricate himself from the widening abyss. And it does not take long to realize that if he is destined to recover, his assistance will not come from his immediate family, each of whom is clearly too consumed with their personal battles, literal and figurative, to offer any more assistance than the initial act of spiriting him away from reclusiveness in Ithaca, N.Y. would demand.As demonstrated inSlapboxing with Jesus, Victor Lavalle's perceptive view of society and culture is on display here. Through utilization of simile, allegorical imagery and in many cases, unencumbered declaratives, he brings a searing beam to a wide range of subjects including poverty, education, societal obsession, marginalization, multiculturalism, familial dynamics and most prominently, the concept of sanity.The Ecstatic is a wonderful read for anyone seeking intelligent writing with enticing phrasing in a linear story filled with sub-text. Conversely, if your tastes gravitate towards a feel good tale where resolution is never in doubt, there are plenty of other works out there for sampling."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Victor Lavalle's The Ecstatic left me feeling ambivalent. I found the novel to be well written, original, and crafty; but at times I also felt lost and confused. Perhaps the latter is intentional since the story is narrated by Anthony Jones, an obese schizophrenic, who lives with his equally schizophrenic relatives. Anthony is rapidly deteriorating and although he seems relatively in control at the beginning of the novel, it is quite clear that he has lost all of his mental faculties at the end.The book is divided into three sections. In \\"The Whale\\" segment, Lavelle opens with Anthony's younger sister, mother, and grandmother rescuing him from Cornell University. He has not attended classes in a couple of years, is living in squalor, and has supported himself with menial jobs. He returns home to live in the basement and reacquaint himself with the old neighborhood. It is in this section that we learn about Anthony's atrocious eating habits, his mother's mental disorder, and his family's relationship with the neighbors. He tries to reinsert himself into society by losing weight, dating, and getting a job. Sadly, he is exploited by his employers and neighborhood thugs, fails at weight loss, and is jilted by his love interest. In the \\"Miss Innocence\\" segment, a family road trip to the sister's beauty pageant goes awry, largely due to Anthony's worsening condition. They meet a few questionable characters along the way that seem equally insane as the Jones clan. The last segment, \\"The Hounds\\" is Anthony's final descent into dementia where he becomes a danger to himself and others. He is literally trapped physically in his neighborhood by the patrolling dogs and mentally in his weakened mind.At most, The Ecstatic is entertaining. As mentioned earlier, Lavalle lost me on a few twists and turns, but I continued reading to see how it would end. I think the pacing of the story was solid, but character development was somewhat lacking. Anthony's character was the most developed and that is putting it mildly; the other characters were lightly sketched and void of any real definition. There were plenty of dark comedic episodes sprinkled throughout that caused me to laugh aloud, but more importantly, I felt pity for the central character as he surrendered to his illness. I would not recommend this novel to everyone, only those who are curious and courageous enough to venture down a dark and disheartening literary side street.PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"I'm honestly not sure how I felt about this book. They're some hilariously cunning moments, but overall the book was pretty weird and a little confusing. I finished it because, frankly, I started it. It definitely wasn't a page turner or a book I lost sleep over. Overall, I think that the writer's style just couldn't hold my interest, others that read it obviously thought it was good...but, I beg to differ!"},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"I'm writing because I'm just concerned, straight up, with some of the reviews this novel has been given by people who meant well but, if I'm being honest, simply can't give other people a fair minded picture of this spectacular novel. First of all, IT'S NOT CONFUSING!!!!!!!! I can't say that enough. The problem is that if you've only been used to eating candy your whole life you're not going to know how to take a steak. Some of the people who've posted before me have been talking about how the novel loses them at times, but if you're used to reading smart fiction, even slightly literary, then you can breeze through this book. In fact, at times you'll have to slow down because you're enjoying the poetry of the language so much that you forget to take notice of the story. Are we ever going to just come out and say you should have to take an IQ test in order to read certain books? Probably not, but maybe we should. I mean, I don't think great literature means that it's got to be confusing, but I get mad when I see good, decent folks trying to pretend that just because there's not a straightforward romance going on the book is Finnegan's Wake! Of course, I realize that now I've made nothing but an in joke, but what saddens me the most is that there are people for whom that reference was over their heads. My god, the state of American readers is dismal. Okay, I shouldn't turn this review into nothing but a big complaining session so let me tell you that I haven't read a book this ambitious and profound in ten years. Imagine a novel that tries to be funny and heartbreaking at the same time, sometimes in the same line. I put this book down feeling like I'd discovered my eyes after years of being blind. It just made me so happy to see that this painful and touching novel was actually published."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"Ledric says to Anthony before going into the house to aid Nabisase. Similar to the plot of Little Miss Sunshine a family whose members have varying addictions, values, and aptitude take a road trip to a beauty pageant and discover their stark conflicts of interest. Instead of the predominately white cast of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris\`s film, Lavelle illustrates the shades and complexions of blackness that exist in America. Anthony (the narrator), an overweight, ambitious yet self deprecating Cornell drop out is forced to come home to his Queens, New York breeding ground. He is initially discouraged by his family, whom think he is crazy, and is later interrupted by greater societal forces personified through characters like Ishkabible, Uncle Arms, Ledric, Candan, and his love interest Lorraine. Similar to the character in the movie Little Miss Sunshine, who had attempted suicide, after being fired from the University where he had a student love interest. Anthony is dragged along to a Miss Innocence pageant in one of the original confederate states, Virginia. And like Dwayne, played by Steve Carell, Anthony is brought along, to secure he is not a harm to himself, or to anyone else.What I enjoy most about this book is that its characters are familiar, personal, and culturally relevant. The plot, for instance, can be easily summed up in the events of Little Miss Sunshine. However the characters speaks to a black cultural catalog that I found absent in Olive's, Abigail Breslin, quest to look like Miss California. Anthony, reminds me of Notorious B.I.G. in his younger years, and there is in fact that direct relation in the book. Many claim that Christopher Wallace was an exemplary student, and that his wit was unparalleled. One can not deny certainly his ability to conjure poetry, music, expression in grammatically sound diction as easily as some people eat, both of which he was a master. But I often wonder, what would have become of him if he hadn't been \`slinging rock' cause he didn't have a \`wicked jump shot'. He may have stayed big, being smart, and in New York. attending one it's our nations ivy league schools, Cornell. He could very easily be the narrator of Lavelle's story.Nabisase, Anthony's younger sister, reminds me of the little girl from Spike Lee's Crooklyn, Troy, played by Zelda Harris. Nabisase wants to be Miss Innocence, and Miss Queens all at the same time, and winning isn't always pretty. Soon she finds out that to get ahead sometimes means to get in front of.Then there is a great character foil between Uncle Arms and Ishkabible, both into real-estate, and both accused of ripping off black people. Both characters are charicatures of their real selves, and act accordingly to progress to in a white man's world. There is an ebonic laden, broken English spoken, slave narrative on p. 123 from Uncle Arms that sounds all the similar to me as does The Atlantic Exposition of 1895 delivered by Booker T. Washington. In an attempt to avoid falling short of moral equivalence, I believe both men give similar reasons for their tactics but not their beliefs. Booker T. Washington would claim that as speaking to blacks that we had to \\"cast down [our] buckets where [we] are\\" going on to say to whites \\"While doing this, you can be sure in the future, as in the past, that you and your families will be surrounded by the most patient, faithful, law-abiding, and unresentful people that the world has seen.\\" Uncle Arms would claim on p. 144. - People can't imagine a black a black aristocrat. They've invested too much into a past filled with only one narrative. Whites and blacks would believe I was a devil more easily. So I appear as the raggedy, noble cotton pluck. Ishkabible unlike Uncle Arms, plays it cool, 24-7, when he isn't getting chased down by his customers at least. Strolling in a New York Swag, Ishkabible shouts to his people that their dreams will one day come true while deliberately sighing in a whisper that it will come at a cost. Both Uncle Arms and Ishkabible, are students of Booker T. Washington. However what seems even more dynamic than historical relevance is character dynamics.His juxtaposition with Uncle Arms resembles a north/south contrast that I can only compare to the Old Settler/ New Settler contrast of Black Chicagoans in the 1920s. Ishkabible and Uncle Arms, for me, call upon black historical stereotypes that beg to be further investigated. They also resemble the characters of Bernie Mac in both Ice Cube's Friday and Jeff Pollack's Booty Call. The pastor by day pimp by night character has a long history in our black culture and it is refreshing to see these characters portrayed in both modern literature and film. Not because I like these characteristics but rather that I enjoy the fact that these elements of society have entered our public discourse from which we can criticize, evaluate, condone, and whatever else springs to the imagination.The closest thing to what Mos Def calls, the Black Jack Johnson, the ultimate protagonist, is Anthony, who no matter what the odds or obstacles, and they are all surrounding, meets them with a large yet timid blow. In my opinion it is now wonder why Mos chooses this to be inspiration and the title of his new Album, Ecstatic, because it showcases a black hip hop culture, embedded in character allusions, and urban locales that can be found in what we need to be reading more into, a book.GET ECSTATIC!"},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"The first thing that struck me about &quot;The Ecstatic&quot; is that the writing is really of very high quality. Lavalle is a master of character description, and brings the eccentric characters in this story vividly to life. I suppose the backbone of the plot is that our hero is on a journey of self-discovery, and in the process finds himself in some hilarious and sometimes dangerous situations. I don't know to what extent this novel is actually autobiographical, but it makes me wonder. Overall, a very entertaining and somewhat surreal read. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"This book hit me so hard, but I couldn't put it down. What is it about families that keeps creating great literature. They just contain this energy. Victor LaValle tapped into that and put it on the page. What I liked was that sometimes I was laughing along, thinking this was just a big book of jokes and then, BIF! BAM! BOOM! he'd have a scene that broke my heart. Then he'd go right back to the funny stuff. Wow. I never really thought you could do that without losing the momentum. I missed the people in it right after I closed the book. It's just a book for anyone who cares at all about seeing real human beings in fiction."},{"Title":"The Ecstatic: A Novel","review":"This was a very interesting novel. The style, transition, characters, dialogue, realism and humor make this a stand out read. I was initially compelled to read this novel based on the synopsis, but from page one I was hooked!The author was able to reveal the antics of life for a very dysfunctional family and let us ride the insanity with the main character, Anthony. Anthony is the 300+ pound paranoid schizophrenic. We journey with Anthony and his family as they try to live life, but are compounded with obstacles such as insanity.The story has a myriad of characters who kinda come into Anthony's life for several reasons, but they add to the dark humor that is consistently displayed throughout the novel. The author's play with humor and realism of insanity was compelling and scary at the same time.This book is dark. That is the one word that for me relates this story. As the story continues, the darkness continues which makes the humor almost horrifying.The author's use of the English language is beautiful. His style is very different, but quite refreshing. The characters are well-developed and thorough characters. The story is a mirage of several incidents that take place in Anthony's life and this is a literal perception of how one is mentally ill, but can do nothing to stop the insanity. It is like a roller coaster ride of the insane.I do wish for a different ending, but because of the subject matter no other ending would probably work. This is one novel everyone should pick up and read if for nothing more than a change and read something that is brilliantly written."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"In My New York Diary, Julie Doucet writes about her life after high school, including art school and her time in New York City. This slim volume details boring classes, bad boyfriends, her personal battle with seizures, a miscarriage, and more. Doucet does a good job with the English language, especially considering she is a native French speaker from Canada. Although the writing is honest and deals with many painful issues, it is very much one-sided (this is a diary, after all). I found myself wishing that Doucet had fleshed out the stories more instead of simply detailing her own points of view, like how possessive and psycho her boyfriend becomes over time. These plot lines are interesting enough to draw you through the book (no pun intended), but you end up feeling that there is much more here. This writing style is the mark of a young writer, perhaps.A note about the artwork in this graphic novel. Doucet is a fine artist, but each and every frame and page are so incredibly jam-packed with clutter - bottles, cans, forks, records, dirty dishes, etc. etc. etc. - that I began to get claustrophobic just looking at it all. It made me wonder if the author is a serious hoarder bound for reality television fame, or if she just draws that way. Instead of giving the reader more information, the cluttered style actually distracts from the story. I wonder if the author tried to use her cluttered drawing style to make up for a thin and lopsided story.If you are a fan of autobiographical graphic novels, especially by women artists, you might want to take a look at My New York Diary and support this increasingly interesting genera.I have one small complaint. Although my volume just took a few hours to read, the binding came loose and the cover fell off. I am not sure if this is a widespread problem with Drawn & Quarterly books, but it is something you should be aware of if you collect graphic novels."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"Julie Doucet really has her pen on the pulse of experiences, particularly hers. This volume focuses on her adventures while living in the heart of New York City, and indeed makes for entertainment. The wonderful illustrations only compliment the story line, and makes the reader want to gobble up the book."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"I can't believe they are selling this so cheap.This is one of my single favorite graphic novels of all time. I put it up there with Maus, David Boring, or even Dark Knight Returns for personal favorite. I just love Julie's honesty and her artwork is mind blowing. My young artist life wasn't exactly like this but its so honest you relate to it with your own troubles and lost friends, lovers, funtimes, badtimes, disasters...I also loved the Film/Comic sequal, My New Newyork Diary. Check that out too, but start with the orginal."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"English does not appear to be the first language of the author--there was a lot of awkward language and typos, frankly -- and that was very distracting. Also, though I sympathized with some of the situations the character got herself in, I did not actually like her as a character -- she appeared spoiled, sheltered, and made really terrible mistakes in her life that I expected her to learn from by the end of the book. Since this is a diary, I assume the events are laid out how just as they happened, but it made for a wandering story that did not have a nice, buttoned up ending (or even a resolution). She also seems to have a disdain for New York that I did not appreciate."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"So you're a confused young man and trying to figure out exactly what women want. Well, Mme Doucet won't help you out there. But she will show you what women HATE in men with brutal honesty. And the guys are utter jerks and crybabies.I probably was like one of the characters in this book and knew someone like Julie when I was younger. I seem to recall sort of being like her roommate, the one always dreading World War III. Why are us guys so obtuse? Probably for phallogocentric reasons. We get wrapped up in upright behavior and lose out on all the fun we could have by being bent. We're also selfish sometimes in the wrong way. (Women do like selfish men, just not stupidly selfish men.)It would be nice if Julie could follow this one up with a story of a successful relationship with some guy. Because we care for her and want her to succeed."},{"Title":"My New York Diary","review":"This book (in fact, everything I have ever read by Doucet) is purely one note. A dire, angry attack on the stereotypes she has formed about men (not to mention those she applies to the cliches she claims to have been involved with), this particular story goes on to prove more of the opposite-sided although far-more-eloquent bigotry of Dave Sim in his anti-woman rants in Cerebus than anything the idea of misogyny could hope to presume. Julie Doucet proves herself to have a purely emotional agenda that lacks even the basic notion of rationality and proves just how stupid single-minded and self-righteous intellectuals are capable of being.Good for the laughs at taking things the wrong way and other forms of profound misunderstanding of human motivations. Absolute trash on the gutter point spectrum of the industry."},{"Title":"Time Warped: First-century Time Stewardship For 21st-century Living (Living Stewardship Series)","review":"Most time management books tell you how to get more done with your time. Steve Ganger's book takes a different approach and helps you discern via tough questions if what you think you need to do is truly important. The book is spiritual in its view - decidedly Christian - but the application is universal to all, \\"Do you really need to do what you intend to do? Is the task congruent with your core values.\\" Ganger writes in a reader-friendly format and book is formatted both as a personal (introspective) workbook and as a group discussion manual."},{"Title":"When the Sleeper Wakes: A Critical Text of the 1899 New York and London First Edition, With an Introduction and Appendices (The Annotated H. G. Wells, 5)","review":"The story is very engrossing, coming to life before you. We follow the protagonist with great interest as he is projected far into the future (through a coma), a future uncanningly like our own. The reader will be able to identify with much of the 20th and 21st century reality around them, but with strange twists. Flight (unknown in Well's day) is commonplace, but planes with moving wings. It is a future predicated around the sleeper, a dystopia gone awry, ruled in the sleeper's name in order to oppress the masses in a socialist nightmare. Wells further convincingly demonstrates \\"the principle of violent mimicry\\" (see Walter Wink, Engaging the Powers)- we become that which we hate. As throughout history, when the oppressed or powerless obtain freedom and power, they become like their oppressors.However, unless you're a scholar, I wouldn't recommend this edition. Although greatly annotated by Stover, the annotations detract from the text. Wells makes numerous references that are more understandable if one is British or lived in the 1800's, and when a footnote is next to one of these references, one naturally looks down below to better understand the context. But Stover repeatedly gives away key aspects of the storyline and the ending, thereby detracting from the reading of the text.In addition, some of the footnotes are incorrect. For instance, when at one point the protagonist, Graham, is referenced as \\"one man who must die for the nation\\", Stover comments this is an obvious attempt to compare Graham to Jesus in a fictitious quote from the gospel. But, says Stover, this quote is nowhere in the four synoptic Gospels. The problem is that there are only three synoptic Gospels- synoptic referring to the first three Gospels- and the quote if found in the non-synoptic Gospel of John- 11.50."},{"Title":"When the Sleeper Wakes: A Critical Text of the 1899 New York and London First Edition, With an Introduction and Appendices (The Annotated H.

I have kept it with me since I was a teen. Paid 75 cents for it."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"I loved the reviews here - especially that of Mr Rhyan. He says exactly what I would say, including the admission of crying. I read Toby Tyler in 1957 at age ten. My mother gave it to me then, explaining her mother had given it to her when she was ten - and she thought I would enjoy it too. I did. Immensely. It started my love of books, the physical objects and their miraculous ability to transport and transform us. I gave it to my daughter at her age ten - she loved it too, crying at the same part Rhyan and I did.Like other reviewers here, I had long looked forward to giving it to my grandson. He was ten in 2003, but a not-very-strong reader who had many more entertainment options than I had at his age, including many newer and wonderfully well-written books for children. Looking Toby Tyler over at that time, the language (which was no trouble for a ten year-old in 1957 or 1977) suddenly seemed a wee bit archaic. I thought he might have just enough trouble with it to prevent him from \\"getting into\\" the story and really enjoying it, as four generations of our family had. I hated to be the one who \\"broke the chain\\" but decided I needed to face the fact - Toby's text is now well over 100 years old and our language has changed a bit, even in the 50+ years since many reviewers here (like Rhyan and me) read it. Sadly, as another reviewer noted, its appeal to ten year-olds may have expired. Not wanting it to be a bad experience, I hesitated.Now my grandson is about to run away from home himself - to college.Well, I am loath to substitute video/audio for reading - but I see a new \\"radio program\\" format has been issued on CD - and is for sale here. Unabridged, so they claim. I am tempted to give him my mother's copy of the book (which she, and I, and his mother, all read at age ten) as a family heirloom - but also today's CD version.He has a long drive to his first year of college. He won't be sitting on a circus wagon next to kindly Old Ben. But maybe, as an audio book, with a boy newly alone on an empty Arizona highway, Toby and Mr Stubbs will work their magic on him too.I hope so.John BlackWashington, DC"},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I remember it vividly.It is perfect for good readers from age seven to ten."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"The monkey dies!!!! Sob........A great story......my mother took it away from me because I was so upset. it was an old story when I read it and I don't remember having any trouble with the language."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"Originally published in 1881, this children's classic is now so outdated that it seems likely that there is no readership for it except the few scholars interested in the history of juvenile fiction. Toby Tyler is a small town orphan boy, bored and feeling abused on his Uncle Daniel's farm. When an un-named circus comes to town, Toby happily joins as a \\"candy butcher,\\" i.e., one who sells refreshments to show patrons within the tent. Although Toby is only about 12, no one questions his running away or joining the circus. He is roundly beaten by his employers, and few question their right to that. Adults simply accept the fact that Toby has a right to leave home and that the circus has the right to hire his services without question. It is hard for a modern reader to get past this.The circus itself is a vague world, a nameless \\"mud show\\" that travels by horse and wagon at night from small town to small town. There were no 3-ring circuses in 1881, traveling by air-conditioned train, a la Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey or Cole Brothers. The novel's atmosphere is never quite real, never gritty enough, never quite exhausting. The characters tend to be all good or all bad, with little known of their backgrounds, details that would make them real humans. Toby himself is just too--well--too nice, too innocent. He is Shirley Temple as a boy on the good ship Lolipop.Certainly the circus (and the sea and the old west) was a magnet for a great many boys of the era. But like so much of the literature of the bygone era, the reality of the setting is never fully explored."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"My main disagreement with the above review is that it is obviously written by an adult for adults. I do not believe most young children read a book for the reasons he complains about. I have not read this book in over 50 years but I still remember it well. I can remember lying in bed at night reading this book and dreaming that I was right there along side Toby and sharing his adventure. I will not give away any of the plot but I can also remember a scene where my little boy tears just flowed(in am age where little boys were not supposed to cry). I loved the book then and am now buying it for my grandson!!"},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"Toby Tyler was first published in 'Harper's Young People' as a serial in 1877, and then as a book in 1881. It was an immediate classic and favorite among young boys and girls who dreamed of running off with the circus. It was very popular and sold so well that a few years later Mark Twain wrote his own story of a run-away conscious-stricken orphan who joins the circus: 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1884). The central theme of the novel is doing what you know is right versus doing what comes naturally and following your instincts, as shown by the character Mr. Stubbs the monkey. Although written to be a \\"wholesome\\" children's novel of what happens to bad boys, most remember it for the romantic story of running off with the circus. Indeed, by the end Toby has become so successful in the circus, his reason for returning home stretches credibility (probably to the secret delight of younger readers who knew what they would have done in Toby's shoes: stayed with the circus!). The novel was influential for at least 3 generations, a young Carl Sandburg thought it his favorite novel and William S. Burroughs mentions it in his memoirs. Disney paid it homage in a 1960 movie adaption. Since then it has become increasingly obscure, but it's close similarities with Huckleberry Finn should give it a wider audience as a comparison novel. The original included 30 pen and ink drawings by W. A. Rogers (1854-1931) which are essential."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"I've been reading a lot of overlooked classics, and this is one of my new favorites. Toby is self-reliant, honest, alert and adventurous and his adventures and escapades should capture the attention of even jaded modern kids. No magic or fantasy or sci-fi, it's more of a turn of the century road trip into a kinder and gentler but still sort-of scary America. This is where \\"running away to join the circus\\" came from, and it still resonates. (By the way, while it's now over 135 years old, it is not \\"old-fashioned\\" and remains perfectly and comfortably readable.)"},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"Loved this version of the classic book. So far, as far as dramatized productions, I think the only one was the 1960's Disney movie. This one is a bit darker and true to the book. The sound effects were great - especially a fun montage of striking the tent and packing things up. The slow caravan-type music as the Circus wagons are traveling on a dark road in the middle of the night really paints an image in your mind that only radio can deliver. The actual circus \\"performances\\" that appear in the show sound like they were recorded under a big top somewhere; the echo on the music, the distant whip cracks and high pitched whistles all bring the atmosphere of the circus life. Toby gets beaten by Mr. Lord several times, and while on the pages of a book this may be easier to take, in sound it is heart-wrenching and could be frightening to the very young. When the production ended, I realized how wonderful a story this classic still remains. I am a long time fan of Colonial, and this show did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With a Circus","review":"I purchased this for my nephews (ages 6 - 10) after taking them to the local circus.

As a third-generation Floridian growing up on the Hillsborough River, I instinctively came by an appreciation of both the mystique of the water and the way fishing linked me to it. As a mostly-vegetarian who still succumbs to seafood, I feel some sense of guilt and sadness for the realities of the commercial fishing industry. This is a poignant and amusing little book, and a clarion call to those who don't give much thought to where their salmon filet came from. Robert Hughes is an inspired writer; this book demonstrates how his holistic take on cultural history translates into wonderful insights in seemingly disparate fields. This is a book I'll re-read every summer!"},{"Title":"A JERK ON ONE END","review":"I bought this for my 19 year old son who has a passion for fishing.

Highly recommended for the fisherman and anyone else in your family."},{"Title":"A JERK ON ONE END","review":"Robert Hughes might rightly self-nominate as a mediocre fisherman. This has never applied to his writing. Herein is brace of reflections, which,perhaps surprisingly, seams with his sensitive, morally driven, art-criticism. The art of trout fishing was taught him by his father whose injunction to play fair and catch and feed your and yourself only, informs Hughes's abhorrence of the ravaging of world fish stocks in the final chapter. Fishing with his father taught him the craft of handling time, to subvert impatience and its fast track from desire to satisfaction. You move at fish tempo. On the trout trail you learn to observe detail in nature; the near abstract perfection of streams and so on. And then the reward of savoring their deep pinkish flesh - delicious and sacramental from its diet of crayfish. He pauses on the evolution of fishing literature, attitudes to it, the fashions for different breeds, the Christian church's symbolic embrace of its image, the snobbery of the C18th English gentry during the transforming period of the Industrial Revolution and the commensurate rise of fishing as a sport. Hughes saves his lathering best for the greed of commercial fishing and our immunity to the destruction of our oceans, primed as we are, at school with images of Nature as a land-based zoo of the warm-blooded, air breathers. He rails against the teaching of his Christian school masters, the Genesis account of God setting man in dominion over the earth and its creatures - a destructive myth. Moderation and temperance are Hughes's rejoinders. This slim volume is no less important than his insights about the visual arts.

She's surprised to find Pig sitting beneath a tree woefully examining a bandaged knee. Pig's the church organist, you see, and now can't get to the wedding.Fortunately Brindle Cow is very kind hearted. She invites Pig to ride to the church on her back. It's not too long before they spy Pomeroy the turtle. He's the florist. Unfortunately a very slow florist who fears there'll be no flowers for the wedding at the rate he's going.You guessed it - Brindle Cow invites Pomeroy to join Pig on her back. Before long a stranded duck, rabbit, and chipmunk join the pair riding to the church.Thanks to the goodness of the Brindle Cow all arrived in plenty of time for the nuptials.

This one is twards the sas forces. Contrary to the US forces which emphasises a lot of upper body strenght you see here the total approach. SAS troopers need to marsh endlessly. (read about their gruelling selection course). This books tells how to get fit, using circuit training, weight programms (not used for the beach boys who just wants to look pumped up, but this program is just to be prepared for the rigours of combat). More is told to train for endurance by running, swimming, cycling and of course the famous endurance marches. At the end a total programme is given for the beginner, intermediate and the advanced. This great book is finished with telling you more about nutrition (I said nutrition NOT pills for those beach bubbles) and mental approaches. I really recommend this book together with Andrew Wheales fighting fit (which gives sas, paratrooper and royal commando programmes) and Steward Smith's the complete guide to navy seal fitness.With those 3 books you cannot go wrong and be the fittest and mental (because of this training) toughest person.So buy these 3 and be FIT and combat ready."},{"Title":"SAS Personal Trainer","review":"This book was the first military fitness program that I followed. The results were amazing, in 8 weeks I went from 245lbs down to 205lbs and never looked back. I am now addicted to military fitness programs (books) and swear by them. This book is one of the best and so are the SAS. The program is well rounded with running, swimming, and weight training/calisthenics. There is even a section on self defense which is very handy. The professional program is a killer and I would suggest tackling the less intense programs first. If getting physically fit is your goal then you will have a hard time finding a better book!

The weightlifting workouts: beginner, intermediate and advanced, shake things up with whole body workouts. I appreciate this approach for overall fitness, something different than the typical separate daily bodybuilding chest-shoulders-triceps, back-biceps, and legs workouts. No, this makes you work all them the same day for overall fitness, and if done correctly, will leave you sweating. Don't worry, plenty of other exercises and activities to keep you busy in between weightlifting days. I feel the book is ahead of it's time.

Again these are very atmospheric original lithographic illustrations that go some way to helping us experience the period- however as an artist and modeller, colour is very important and I find it quite frustrating to try and second guess colours by the varying tones on a particular monochrome photograph.The text is well researched and very accurate but I was a little disappointed in the lack of illustration or reference to the many non issue items of civilian dress that most US cavalry in the 1870's wore on campaign in the west (Please see 'Little Bighorn 1876' Peter Panzeri (Osprey Military). And perhaps some information with regard to Pennons and Guidons would have added another dimension to the book.However it must be said that the valuable information the book does contain is well laid out and the text is easy on the eye and a good read.Therefore in conclusion, I feel that overall 'Sound the Charge' will prove to be an asset to anybody interested in the US Cavalry of the period and a valuable source of reference to add to anyones library."},{"Title":"Sound the Charge: The U.S. Cavalry in the American West, 1866-1916 (G.I.

But if no photos are available, then something may be omitted. All of these books are vertical studies covering a period of years.

If that is what you want to learn about, you should read David Simon's book, &quot;An Embedded Software Primer&quot;. However, this book does an excellent job of covering the PROCESS of designing embedded systems, from microprocessor selection to system debugging, and discusses the many engineering tradeoffs that need to be made in the design of real-world systems.As a useful trilogy, I would recommend:1) David Simon's book for learning how to write embedded software.2) Jack Ganssle's &quot;The Art of Designing Embedded Systems&quot; for tips, tricks, and strategies on being a good embedded software designer.3) This book, for understanding the engineering decisions that need to be made in the design of an embedded system, and for learning about the debugging tools and techniques available as well."},{"Title":"Embedded Systems Design","review":"\\"Embedded System design\\" moves the reader with an academic understanding of embedded microprocessor systems to a position of practical understanding of the technology. This is the kind of experience gained by an engineer working in the field over many years. Dr. Berger is clearly writing from knowledge acquired first hand; and he conveys this efficiently and enjoyably. The book presents the essential information needed to enable an inexperienced engineered, or student, to quickly become a productive member of an embedded engineering team.The book goes beyond what some might consider junior engineering activates. It deals with many of the more challenging tasks; such as hardware-software tradeoffs and tool-processor compatibilities. Much of this material is unfortunately not included in engineering training courses. I would say that the material presented has been well selected and is essential knowledge for an engineer developing embedded system software.The book is ideal for software developers already familiar with developing code for PC or Unix-workstation execution, but wishing to know how to retarget code for execution on an embedded processor based system. This requires a more complex development, and in particular debug, environment. Additionally, managers new to the embedded product development phases will learn the pitfalls to be avoided. There are many decisions to be made in leading a successful embedded project. This book will help you make the right ones and accelerate acquisition of your project management skills.There are a number of significant pressures effecting current embedded projects: The drive for shorter product development times; The use of higher performance processors; Increased software complexity and interoperability; The desire to restrain project tool and man-power costs. The book does a good job at covering these issues. The traditional or established methodologies are covered as well as the latest trends and likely future directions.The book is ordered much like a real embedded project. First there is the selection process. This includes the processor itself. But this cannot occur in isolation of the software development tool chain; and other critical components, such as a real-time operating system. The balancing of these sometimes-conflicting requirements is very important and present with the clarity of a veteran campaigner. The book moves on to deal with hardware-software portioning - not something the typical PC software developer has to resolve. Similarly, the construction of the embedded run-time environment is explained. This is followed by an explanation of development tool operation; In particular, the all-too-often challenge of embedded software debug - This topic is particularly well explained. Specialised software topics, such as interrupt processing and low-level hardware manipulation are, as you would expect, covered. Finally, there is a section on testing, and an exploration of future trends.In summary the book contains the right material, it is presented in an easy to absorb manor and is practically oriented. I highly recommended it to embedded engineering students, or engineers and managers facing the challenges of an embedded processor development project."},{"Title":"Embedded Systems Design","review":"With the release of &quot;Embedded Systems Design: An Introduction to Processes, Tools, and Techniques&quot; Arnold S. Berger has made an invaluable contribution to the field of embedded system design.Despite the use of most of the world's microprocessor production in embedded systems, the field of embedded system design has been poorly served by the academic community until now. In 20+ years of embedded system design engineering management I have been challenged to hire freshly minted engineers (IROCs)with even the most rudimentary understanding of the principles of embedded system design. It is simply not taught in most engineering schools, forcing manufacturers of electronic systems to expend countless resources in training engineers in these disciplines. I believe that Dr. Berger's book turns the tide.Berger draws upon many years of experience with major corporations in which he spearheaded numerous embedded system design initiatives as well as the creation of design methodologies and development tools. This book is clearly written and provides the student with a straight-forward, practical approach to--as the title promises--the processes, tools and techniques required by the embedded systems development engineer.It is refreshing to, at long last, see a book that addresses the critical issues of embedded system design with such insight and expertise.

It continues into some intermediate information that should be fundamental knowledge for all embedded systems designers and developers. With advances in development tools and massive increases system complexity, these basics are often overlooked because developers become more cubby-holed into specific, well-defined roles on a project. They can lose sight of the fact that they are designing/coding an embedded system, with all the differences from desktops or larger systems that have more extensive and faster system resources. Understanding these fundamentals will help cast their work in a more appropriate perspective.Many vital and expected topics are included, such as memory mapping, architecture, coding the hardware, design tools, etc. Berger includes other topics such as the \\"From the Trenches\\" vignettes based on his own experiences, that give concrete examples to illustrate several concepts.A good discussion is the concept of hardware/software partitioning, an early architecture decision that affects the entire development program down the line. This is often overlooked - once the design team has decided to implement a function in hardware, for example, it may often be impossible to upgrade the functionality. Sometimes bugs in hardware may be compensated for in FPGAs and in software, but this is not an ideal contingency plan.Berger spends significant time on debugging and testing, two critical aspects of the development cycle whose effective approach is usually the difference between an on-time delivery and a lower quality product.A definite read!Lisa SimoneIf I Only Changed the Software, Why is the Phone on Fire?: Embedded Debugging Methods Revealed: Technical Mysteries for Engineers"},{"Title":"Embedded Systems Design","review":"This book provides introduction to many important aspects of embedded systems design.

Clips of the interview may be watched on youtube and elsewhere. They are not exactly fair and biased, to say the least.

Cranor does an impressive job at dissecting and disentangling the perplexing relationship between scientific risk assessment analysis as it pertains to Tort law, regulatory agencies and their epistemic and philosophical considerations. Theories of distribution and variants of Rawls's concept of Utilitarianism provide an atypical way of conceptualizing ethical justifications for the regulation of carcinogens and other toxic substances. The universal consideration taken by Cranor is the relationship between scientific assessment of toxic substances and public-healthcare policy efficiency. Of particular value, the last four appendices discuss the theoretic and scientific cancer potency estimates in the California Department of Health Sciences (CDHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Models of risk act as a function of Alpha and Beta values, statutes authorizing the regulation of carcinogens, and derivation of TD50 (tumorigenic dose) potency values. Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law will be best suited for those who are interested in the toxic Tort litigation and familiar with moderate to advanced statistic models of risk assessment and public-healthcare policy. Clanor puts together a cohesive evaluation of the synergetic relationship between toxic substances, policy and scientific method."},{"Title":"Artorius Rex Discovered (Arthurian History)","review":"Sixty years ago an unprecedented onslaught was launched against the most detailed and best preserved history in Western Europe. The attack on South East Wales history was made by G J Williams from North Wales who alleged that a few dark age poems were not of the pre-1367 era, but were instead forgeries written around 1800. This allegation was made over the BBC state-controlled radio and no challenge was allowed. Like a computer virus this then spread to further absurd allegations which gradually encompassed the entire corpus of South East Wales ancient history. Everything was now alleged to be tainted and forged. The result was that academia ran for cover and totally avoided the entire subject.This book &quot;Artorius Rex Discovered&quot; is the first attempt to resurrect this wrongly murdered and quite innocent dark age history. The fact is that this incredibly detailed history stands up to examination in hundreds of ways whenever tested. If the forgery allegation were true, then we are invited to believe that over a period of 1000 years several hundred scholars, bards, monks and even one King who wrote a history, all combined together from all over Wales to produce a totally interlocking fabricated history, complete with ancient ruined castles, forts, manors, battlesites, graveyards, named grave mounds, churches, ancient inscribed stones, skeletons in stone coffins, and even a vast 2000-year old ancient ironworks!Hundreds of complex interlocking genealogies - all of which fit together with the records in the ancient poetry, cathedral charters, the histories, the triads, and the inscriptions on over 200 inscribed stones - lay such a solid foundation that there can be no question of forgery.The authors of this book enter where others feared to go. They took the ancient histories, read them, and went along the trails which the histories directed. Time and time again what is alleged to be a forgery turns out to be truthful, authentic and factual.Thrown out with the rest of this abandoned history, are the Kings of Wales. These include King Arthur II, the son of King Meurig, who was in turn the son of King Tewdrig, all of whom have traceable graves. Several hundred other Kings, Princes and noblemen have traceable graves. Some 200 of them left inscribed stones. Arthur II leaving four inscribed stones, Tewdrig one, and Teithfallt the father of Tewdrig one, and so on.It seems to have been forgotten that all 167 ancient Bruts of England firmly state that King Arthur was crowned as King of Glamorgan, South East Wales. Mallory placed Camelot in South East Wales, and Y Seint Greal of AD 1106, the much longer source manuscript used by Mallory, also placed Camelot in South East Wales. Stained glass windows exhibit pictures of the dynasty in Llandaff Cathedral, and also full feature illustrations of King Arthur II and his grandfather King Tewdrig. All this was taught in the local schools until 1924.Readers may be astonished that there could be a &quot;black hole&quot; on the historical map of British history. The evidence, however, is so varied and massively overwhemling that the case being made is indisputable. To illustrate this, G J Williams alleged that the Coelbren alphabet of South East Wales was forged around AD 1800. Strangely, Julius Caesar described the alphabet in his De Bello Galico in 54 BC. Ammianus Marcellinus also described this alphabet. Even better, when Mohammed Ali discovered in 1946 the entire 128 books in 14 leather satchels of a Gnostic Christian library buried at Nag Hamadi in Egypt before AD 400, the book of Massanes contains a description of the same alphabet. Welsh poets writing pre AD 1367, 1425, 1450, 1470, 1580, and so on, all speak of the same alphabet - allegedly forged in 1800! Several ancient stones dating from circa 600-1200 carry letters of the alphabet. A manuscript in the Bodleian Library in Oxford of circa AD 1520 contains the alphabet.This book simply sets out the history, the sites, the stones, the places to go. Every single site named in this book can be visited, every stone can be seen and touched, and every manuscript is available to be read....................."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"I am a physics teacher with a degree in physics and I think this is one of the best physics texts I have ever seen. I have used it for quite a few years now, with excellent results. Hewitt packs a lot of information into the book, but teachers and students are not expected to get through it all. The extra material gives the book great applications for a wide variety of audiences, but the responsibility is on the teacher to use it in a way that is not confusing to students. This is the case with any of the standard physics texts (Halliday Resnick, Giancoli).Anyone who discounts this book because it has more words and cartoons than equations and math problems in it has no idea what understanding physics can be. Physics has too long been abused as an applied math course, and this book is a welcome remedy for this. For a general audience, this book provides an excellent overview of the fundamental concepts that make our world run. For science-bound students, it provides an excellent conceptual foundation for a more rigorous calculus-based course where deeper understanding of the connection between math and nature can be explored.On major fault of the book, as one reviewer pointed out, is that Hewitt includes some problems that he does not give readers the math skills to solve. If a teacher assigns these problems, it is necessary that the students have access to the supplementary material written for the text that explains this math. But as a conceptual physics text for a conceptual physics course, Hewitt's book is unparalleled."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"For anyone wanting an easy approach to physics and actually understand it, needs this book. Our school sort-of uses this book once and a while, but I read and re-read every chapter to clearly understand what my teacher is talking about.Every paragraph there are little conceptual questions you answer in you mind-- then the answer is at the bottom of the page. You can read the answer to see if you understand what the book is talking about.Paul G. Hewitt was an artist before he was a physics teacher. All of the diagrams and pictures are in cartoon-ish style, which makes it much easier and fun(!) to read. There are even some cartoons in the book.I agree there is not much math behind it, but this books makes you actually learn physics concepts, not memorize formulas just for the test.This is the best textbook I have ever read and the only way I could understand what my physics teacher is talking about."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"As a High School physics teacher I appreciate a text that will convey the ideas of Physics without requiring a profound understanding of Math. If you need a more advanced course -- take an AP course using an advanced book, like Giancoli's. However, if all you want is a basic understanding of the concepts of physics, this is the book for you. One important point -- a thorough understanding of this book will answer every question on the FCI (a test used by some college professors to determine their students understanding of forces in physics)."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"I used Conceptual Physics by Paul G. Hewitt along with a more technical university-level introductory physics book that had a lot of equations but not much conceptual explanation. I should admit that I was not very fond of physics until I started to read this book. It explained physical concepts in a simple language that was easy to understand. Although it did not cover some of the more complicated physical concept, it did cover enough material so that I could understand most of the physics equations in my other more technical physics book much better. Conceptual Physics was even exciting to read and I usually looked forward to doing so. After finishing this book, because I understood physical concepts much better, I started to read other popular physics books. Conceptual Physics is not intended to be used in a course that requires solving physics problems based on understanding equation. So it should not be used as such unless it is accompanied by another book containing equations. But if you would like to learn conceptual physics without equation, it has a tremendous value."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"This book aided me exponentially!

Sadly, Conceptual Physics is the book to buck that trend.Conceptual Physics is, hands down, the worst physics textbook currently in use. I have a physics degree from a fancy university and now run a private tutoring company, and every time a student comes to me with this book I die a little bit inside. Asking students to understand physics without mathematics is like putting them in a maze and then blindfolding them (and then laughing at their futile attempts to get from point A to point B). It's absolutely true that people can get so caught up in math that they lose sight of the ideas behind the equations, but simply getting rid of equations is just throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Mathematics is the language of physics, and it's flat out not possible to understand physics without equations. Equations give you the ability to discover answers independently, and to reach new and interesting conclusions. In the real world, physics is the art of translating observations into equations, working through the math, and then reaching new conclusions based on your new equations. Physics is often deeply counter-intuitive, which is (in my opinion) the real joy of studying it. But that means that to understand it conceptually, you need to look at the world through a different (mathematical) lens. I find that it's only after students have wrestled with equations that they can start to really internalize the ideas those equations represent - and ultimately to reevaluate their perception of the world.I have yet to meet a student who has enjoyed using this textbook. Without equations, students are just memorizing facts. They can't ask \\"why\\" because they don't have the tools to answer their questions. Equations give you solid ground from which to build a new understanding of the world; Conceptual Physics gives you no anchor. I often feel that students using this book are sinking into quicksand, and have nowhere to turn - nothing to hold on to that they know is definitely true. Sometimes a student will ask me a question to which I don't know the answer, and I'll almost invariably use equations to reach my conclusion. When they want to know how I reached said conclusion, how I knew what to do, I can't give them a good answer because they can't follow my math. I can try to draw general conclusions for them based on my equations, but they can never learn to draw those conclusions for themselves.It's clear that the author tried very hard, and I very much applaud the effort that went into creating the textbook. The friendly pictures make me feel guilty for writing such a negative review. That having been said, friendly pictures are not a substitute for actually learning physics."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"I bought this book for my high school daughter so I can't really rate it.

I did not find any SIGNIFICANT differences, maybe some different pictures and such.REVIEW:This book is a great introduction to physics. It is as it claims, conceptual. This book appeals to concepts that we have about the world we experience on a regular basis, and explains physics using those common experiences. Being that this book is conceptual it does not go into the depths of mathmatics that physics can involve. This does not mean that there is no math in the book, because there is, but the math is simple.The author's way of explaining things does not have the \\"I need to sound intelectual\\" type of sentences that you would expect in a textbook. If you have read most any other textbook you should be familiar with what these types of sentences are. They're the ones that use big words to explain a simple concept that could be stated in simpler terms and understood easier. This textbook will not leave you staring into space wondering what the sentence you just read is supposed to mean.There are two things I do not like about the book I have, which the newer editions may have fixed, one is that the questions at the end of the chapters do not have awnsers in the back of the book. But the good thing is there are some questions asked through-out the chapters that have the awnsers clearly explained in the footnotes of the page.The other problem which may confuse some people is how the two different formulas for ACCELERATION can be rearranged to make the formulas for IMPULSE and the CHANGE IN MOMENTUM. Below is an explanation, if you do not understand it write it down and ask a math teacher to explain it.USE THE BELOW INFORMATION ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE TEXTBOOK IF NEEDEDF=forcem=massv=velocityt=timea=accleration^= delta (delta is just a fancy way of saying change in)Impules is: F x tChange in Momentum is: ^m x vAccleration can be:a=F/m or it can be a=^v/tSince both F/m and ^v/t are equal to \\"a\\" (acceleration) they can also be equal to each other, which would be:F ^v- = -m tNow to change this into impulse and momentum you just cross multiply (imagine a giant X in place of the = symbol, the two legs end at the letters that will be multiplied by each other). This is called the MEANS AND EXTREMES property of equality. The result will be:F x t = ^v x m or in other words impulse = momentum.To see how this works for yourself simply replace the four letters with any non-zero number.As a summary of this book, it offers a good summary of physics (mechanics, heat, sound, electricity and magnetism, light... etc).

I chose physics to fulfill my university math requirement in order to broaden my very basic scientific knowledge, as I had never taken a physics course. However, what I found in this book (which constituted the bulk of my instruction) was a conglomeration of random examples with little cohesion, annoying illustrations that were distracting rather than helpful, badly organized chapters that left me wandering through the pages wondering what had happened, and an index that doesn't include standard items such as \\"static friction\\" or \\"watt\\". Perhaps most frustrating was the appalling lack of mathematical equations that the student is somehow supposed to magically know by the end of the chapter, when they are necessary to solve the problems. Please, if you are a physics instructor, spare your students the agony of trying to grasp an understanding of your subject through this book."},{"Title":"Conceptual Physics Package Edition","review":"This book is highly unorganized, important concepts are all over the chapters.

It discusses the difference of ideas between the Boomers and the Natives of Alaska. It also gives an avid account of the oil situation up in Alaska and the trans-Alaska pipeline which was a wasteful egineering project. The parts about the effect all the decisions has had on the wildlife and habitat of Alaska were expectantly interesting.

He provides superb insight into why the hierarchies and bureacracies of the world are so inefficient and are becoming increasingly so, why successful people are often unhappy in their jobs and why the most talented people often proceed through their careers without material reward. Peter's observations are funny, but alarmingly true. An excellent resource for the armchair sociologist - highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"It's interesting yet perplexing, that when I studied Public Administration (yawn), we studied German economist and sociologist Max Weber, but never once, did our courses include the work of Laurence Peter. They should have.The \\"Peter Principle\\" was written in 1969, but you'll realize immediately it's still very accurate and useful today. Many anecdotes and case studies may remind you of yourself, someone, or some people you've worked with. There are illustrations, diagrams, charts, graphs, and the ever-present Bell Curve. There are too many good things in this book to list. It's also a quick and easy-read.The author's background is very relevant to the credibility of this book, which in my opinion, is a true classic. Laurence J. Peter received an Ed.D from Washington State University and had extensive experience as a teacher, counselor, school psychologist, prison instructor, consultant, and university professor. (I don't know much about the other author, Raymond Hull.) Here a a couple of concepts from the many things in the \\"Peter Principle.\\"Push & Pull:Two different ways to \\"move up.\\" No reason to go into detail, but a person pushing upward usually will not get the result of a person who's \\"pulled up from above.\\" My favorite quote in the \\"Peter Principle\\" is on the \\"Push & Promotion\\" chapter on page 63:\\"Never stand when you can sit; never walk when can ride; never Push when you can Pull.\\"Judging the competence of an employee:Outsiders usually don't judge your performance. In general, your superior does. So if you have a:Competent superior:If a superior is competent they evaluate his/her subordinate by the usefulness of work. Performance. Output.Incompetent superior:If a superior is incompetent they will often judge the subordinate by \\"behavior that supports the rules, rituals, and forms of the status quo. Promptness, neatness, courtesy to superiors....\\" This is evaluating input, not output.Creative Incompetence:Most of us have witnessed and perhaps experienced a happy and talented person doing well at what they do in the workplace. Because of his/her optimum performance they're offered a promotion. A raise, yes. But also more stress, more time consumed, more responsibilities, and often new duties and skill-sets needed at the new position.Some employees understand that in their particular circumstances the negatives outweigh the positives of a promotion. When realize they are next in line, or close to getting that promotion they don't want, they have (at least 2) options:One, carefully refuse the promotion, while vocalizing that he/she is still committed and dedicated to the company, etc. This is called \\"Peter's Parry,\\" and is not recommended by the author for most (but not all) employees.The second option for the employee to avoid advancement, is not by refusing promotion but by intentionally doing minor and forgivable mistakes that will cause him/her to never be offered a promotion, but retain the current position. This is ---> Creative Incompetence. The author offers some techniques in the sub-section of this chapter for successfully executing Creative Incompetence. Peter states it's important that one conceal the fact that they want to avoid a promotion.Again this book is almost 40 years old. Some of the individual (worker) values and the corporate climate has changed since then. But in private, public, and non-profit organizations, we see many of Peter's situations today. Too many.HEALTH & HAPPINESS AT ZERO PQ:When someone reaches his/her level of incompetence (called Peter's Plateau) the Zero PQ - Zero Promotion Quotient - 0% chance of a promotion exists. Understanding when one reaches the point of Zero PQ is very important. Many employees don't recognize when they hit it, and sometimes when an employee hits the ceiling he/she thinks it's incompetence, inferier skills, or lack of production, when it might actually be politics. They think they are not working \\"hard enough,\\" or good enough. This person pushes harder by working longer, skipping breaks, and going the extra mile. These are the symptoms of ---> Final Placement Syndrome.Have you ever witnessed or even experienced Zero PQ at work?In organizations (i.e., hierarchies) people get promoted as long as they continue to be competent. Eventually they are promoted to a position in which their skills are not adequately applicable for their new position. Therefore other employees at the same level or below carry out the tasks, because these \\"other employees\\" have not hit their level of their incompetence, yet.The Chapters are worthy of listing because they do highlight the points and topics in the book:1. The Peter Principle2. The Principle in Action3. Apparent Exceptions4. Pull & Promotion5. Push & Promotion6. Followers & Leaders7. Hierarchically & Politics8. Hints & Foreshadowings9.

This is a practical book with many anecdotes we've seen in real life. The \\"Peter Principle\\" can help corporate hierarchical rejectionists and corporate minions alike. A great glossary and chapter index is in the back of this classic."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"This book's subject has been described as &quot;satirical sociology&quot;. It's a rather short book that consists of made-up stories about administrative and business hierarchies. Some (if not all) of them are based on true events. Mr. Peter has given his characters funny names and the stories make you laugh frequently, but actually the message of the book is very serious. Mr. Peter demonstrates that endless climbing higher and higher is bound to lead your life into a dead end.The book's fun to read and, in my opinion, delivers really valuable knowledge. It helps you to stand hold to the pressure from the environment that is telling you that when you are not successful with something, you just need to keep trying harder and investing more. Mr. Peter helps you realise why this won't work.I have heard that some US government institutions are actually applying Mr. Peter's discoveries in their organization.If you liked &quot;Parkinson's Law&quot;, you'll enjoy this book as well. (And vice versa.)"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"With this simple phrase on p.15 of my edition of The Peter Principle he explained nearly every problem the human species has faced as we have entered increasingly complex organizations in the development of our civilization,In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence given enough time and enough levels in the hierarchyAnd the more I've thought about it, internalized it, experienced corporate hierarchy... the more I've realized that it explains everything.A housing bubble caused by artificially low inflation rates? Some blame Greenspan but the reality is that he was just serving above his level of competence. It makes sense. America's colony in Iraq flubbed? Some blame Bush or his subordinates but the reality was that they were serving above their level of competence. We all do from time to time. We all think we are the exception.As acquaintances enter the work force and through my own witness to the mindset of the low level employee, everyone seems to be focused primarily on ascending to the higher levels. Why? I think it is what we do as a species. It is our fate. I don't mean to dissuade blame from individuals, removing responsibility from personal action. I only intened to explain that we shouldn't expect success, we should expect blindingly stupid failure and then be pleasantly surprised when things aren't flubbed up. That's not being cynical or \\"realist\\". It is just recognizing human nature. Incompetence knows no boundaries of time or place.The Peter Principle when published in 1969 raised a storm because many did not want to accept that they existed at their level of incompetence. Business people didn't take it seriously because it was written tounge-in-cheek with full blown laugh out loud moments. Far different from the bland, dry language they were used to while obtaining their MBAs. I thoroughly enjoyed the book because it is an opportune time for me to examine if I have already achieved my level of incompetence.While the explanations of the Principle could easily be redundant... (the plot is summarized at the beginning as Dr. Peter states the principle) this book isn't redundant, like a Dilbert cartoon with some acute wisdom. Dr. Peter describes, through various case studies and examples, that every perceived exception to the Principle isn't really an exception at all. Complex hierarchies will see its members achieve the ominous final placement. Someday I too can reach this level.I can get stressed out while making poor decisions. I too can wear the badge of administrative \\"success\\": the ulcer.This might all seem a bit pessimistic. A little defeatist. But not at all. The solution is to focus our species on moving forward instead of upwards. We see our cohorts in groups struggling for status on a, \\"treadmill to oblivion.\\" But Dr. Peter clearly states that we can rescue ourselves by seeing where this unmindful escalation is leading us. If we focus on the quality of our situation we can achieve previously ignored success without obtaining a literal or figurative promotion.By applying this principle to our everyday experience, we witness many byproducts. For example, the applied Peter Principle approximates that employees in a hierarchy, \\"do not truly object to incompetence, they merely gossip about incompetence to mask their envy of employees who have pull.\\" ... with pull being the ability to develop a relationship with someone above you in the hierarchy who can pull you up with them. How poignant. We decry good \`ol boy networks but rarely focus on the one thing that could break them up, changing our focus from output to input. I can put in a 40-50 hour work week but would I be more productive if I worked 30-35 hours? We may never know because a full-time job insists that I work 40-50 crushing and life imbalancing hours. Society has focused on input in this situation. Can we think of a better solution to this situation? I'll apply Peter's Bridge to this question: if you can't think of a better solution you have already reached your level of incompetence.Although the observations made in the Peter Principle are obviously applicable to corporate environments, Laurence Peter made some other candid observations of society in these pages. Such as, exposing our modern caste system on p.64 and p.83 of the 2009 edition:...we have a class system, it is based not on birth but on the prestige of the university one has attended. The graduate of an obscure college does not have the same opportunity for promotion... but as college degrees become the prerequisite for more jobs, soon everyone will have access to his or her level of incompetence....with incompetent handling, the test system is only a disguised form of random placement. The purpose of testing is to place the employee as soon as possible in a job which will utilize the highest competence level on his profile. Obviously, any promotion will be to an area of less competence.Brilliant stuff that has played out over the last 30+ years just as Dr. Peter predicted."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"The Peter principle is a small book about hierarchies and how people act within the hierarchy. The peter principle itself states that \\"in a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence\\".In the beginning, the book explains the law and it's difficult to actually determine the authors seriousness. The points he makes seem valid, at least according my person experiences. However, the way it's written and the some paragraphs clearly suggest a not that serious undertone.The further you read it the book, the more hilarious it becomes! In chapter 8 the author goes on to prove that Freud had actually reached his level of incompetence. Chapter 12 describes indicators for finding out if you've reached your level of incompetence, all having insane names. In chapter 15 he almost overdoes it when explaining that humans are hard on their way of reaching their level of incompence in the animal hierarchy...The book is extremly funny and well worth reading. I'd recommend that while reading, now and then put it aside and think about the things Peter has to say. It's hilarious and ... has some truth in it?"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"The author hit the nail on the head when he discovered this principle! After years of pondering whether it's just me or if there really is such a thing as companies with huge percentages of incompetent managers, I finally feel relieved to know that I was not 'just imagining' things. The book made me take a hard look at myself and question whether I had reached my own level of incompetence, and based on the case studies in the book I started analyzing what WOULD make me reach my level. One thing I would have like to read more about is how those of us who have not yet reached their level of incompetence, can better manage the struggle with those who have reached their level and make our work days miserable."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"This book is a satirical look at our highly achieving society. Work hard and you end up being incompetant. The authors make up a number of names for conditions and symptoms to attempt to say the choices you have in life are incompetancy or enjoyment through diversions. I started off reading it as a &quot;real&quot; social psychological work with testimonials and cases. By the end, the absurd diagnoses, which all of us show to some degree, made me realize that I believe the authors are just trying to say don't take your career too seriously."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"If you have ever reflected (whether in detached bemusement or disgust) on the sheer incompetence which seems to pervade your world, from your place of employment, to the businesses from which you purchase your everyday goods and services, to the financial and political spheres, you will very likely enjoy this book. Even if you know its basic premise, this little tome is worth a read. Though the work was first published more than forty years ago, hardly any part of it is dated. Quite to the contrary, the arrival of the latest edition in 2009 could not have been more timely. Indeed, some of its insights, for example the power of information technology to magnify the effects of incompetence, astonish, now more than ever, by their prescience. My favorite chapter explains the tendency of our political system to propel to the top politicians with minimal governing skills. You will probably find some agreement with Prof. Peter's observations on this point, whatever your political stripes. Finally, while its nomenclature and \\"case studies\\" are over the top, the book is, in my view, very funny, much as it is meant to be.

Not just in the workplace but in everyday life. The book details that everyone has a certain competence level at which they might excel but at some point their abilities will not provide what is needed without something additional. Ex; why does a successful high school football coach fail as a college coach. Ex; why does a successful salesman fail as a sales manager. This book can not only prevent you from attaining your level of incompetence but it can provide you with insight on how not to promote someone into their level of incompetence.I read the negative reviews and completely disagree with them. The book does not promote the power of negative thinking, it promotes the power of thinking. It teaches one to understand one's strengths and weaknesses and use that knowledge to determine if one is qualified to move to the next level or whether more learning and/or more skills are required. I would rather be a successful salesperson than a failed sales manager but if I know that I would fail as a sales manager, I can stay where I am at or determine and study what it would take for me to be a successful sales manager.If the \\"Peter Principle\\" were not so valid, why are there not millions of examples available to support it. Simply look around at individual failures of people that were previously successful. And look at those who continued to become successful. The difference will be that those that continued, knew what would be required (personally and corporately) to achieve success at each next level. If you do not understand what is required then you will fail. If you do not have the necessary skills and do not or cannot obtain them, then you will fail. To me that this the overriding tenet of this book.This book provides an outstanding look into the failings of individuals and companies and how to prevent it. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"The darkly humurous Peter Principal itself is easy to understand and witness in life.

So even granting that the readers with the motivation and intelligence to read social treatise are more motivated and intelligent, or at least more curious than average, what the data tells me is that the most favorable reviews are most likely from people on the cusp of the median, and that those that found it only amusing or maybe a harmless waste of time are the truly exceptional individuals.The authors have accomplished a great deal in making a social treatise a good read for so many - for myself I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it but scanned the first printing standing in the University Co-op Bookstore when I was eighteen.

Such cases of management incompetence exist, of course, but in reality, things are just more complicated than that. The book does not even remotely consider the possibilty of people learning or advancing mentally - up to the point that even schoolchildren failing a grade are characterized as having reached their level of incompetence. The same gross oversimplification can be found throughout the entire book. It is an endless repetition of obviously fictitious examples of incompetence that serve to illustrate the dubious principles that it promotes. While the book never stops claiming its own scientificness, it provides little more than &quot;argument by repetition&quot;.The book culminates in praising the &quot;power of negative thinking&quot; and describing clever ways to avoid getting promoted.

It has been said that it takes no more than to read the first chapter of any book to determine whether or not the author likes people, meaning that the author is truly interested in telling a story, sharing facts regarding an issue or teaching a new-found knowledge to the reader. Peter on the other hand, begins assuming that people are inherently failures, and it is only a matter of time and effort before they become that. Peter's self-fulfilling prophesy, eeerrr, theory, is no better demonstrated than in his own book, the Peter Principle. It was the transition to his highest level of incompetence.I would not recommend this book to anyone who believes in leadership, success, the trail and tribulations on the road to success and the richness and diversity of people and the endurance of the human spirit.Napoleon Hill wrote in his book: Think and Grow Rich and I will paraphrase: The difference between those who are truly successful and those who are not is this, there are those who fail, fail and fail, then give up; they are the unsuccessful in life. Then there are those who fail, fail and fail, then get up; they are the truly successful. Unfortunately, Peter didn't realize the importance of encouraging people to succeed, instead he chose only to present the scenario that if you've done well, stop at that, you couldn't possibly get any better?!I suggest to the Amazon.com readers to save their time and money from this book."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"I had heard about the Peter principle many years ago, and thought it was an easy thing to understand, you are born with a given set of talents and you would rise in the ladder based on your performance according to those talents and skills until they will be not sufficient to keep you growing.I enjoyed reading the book and was surprised with its humor and simplicity, yet the wisdom contained is lots. I have had a very successful career and had experienced myself the effect of growing and moving into higher positions without thoughtful analysis of what the consecuences of new jobs will be.The analysis of Hierarchies is interesting and was the first attempt to think of what happened to individuals who had grown to their level of incompetence. I made a research of later writings from researchers who studied the validity of the principle. \\"In a Hierarchy , every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence\\" - in a study made in the 1970's in the UK, reasearchers found that executives which had grown to their level of incompetency, were exposed to a variable component of a new job, without giving the executive any training for the new position, this creates a greater challenge for the executive and this tension and anxiety becomes the fire starter for odd behaviour and mistakes of judgement. If we take for example the great Steve Jobs' case when he was fired from Apple in the 1980's, many people thought he was done, and his companies were silently moving in strategic directions, while the press critiqued and ridiculed his efforts and made people believe he was in a crash course. We all know what happened afterwards, he rose again to greater heights and was capable to lead Apple to what it is today. His abiliy to learn from mistakes is what distinguised him from people who have already arrived to their level of incompetence, we all know examples which really confirm all the findings in the principle.

Having worked for government and private organizations, I found the book to be very accurate; Dr. Peter certainly understands how people are shuffled around in an organization. Some folks move up the ranks until they reach a position they cannot handle and in some instances, once the big shots understand that the person is over their head, they are often transferred \\"laterally\\" to other positions where they can do no harm. These lateral transfers often leave them with a title, but no real authority. This makes it look like management did not make a mistake and the employee who received the lateral transfer is happy because he has not been fired or reduced in rank but he still looks like he is doing well in the organization.Organizational structures are facinating in how they work.

My first time was while still in the military and it explained to me, a great deal of the things I saw go wrong. It left an impression upon me that lasted throughout my career and which still helps me today. It explained clearly why I was so frustrated with the way things had begun to deteriorate so badly once I was into the second half of my career. And it helped me to make certain career choices that I still believe to day were the most beneficial decision I could have made at the time, and I was glad I had that knowledge to consider.Dr. Laurence and his associates hit the nail right on the head in describing the failing principles, due to the Peter Principle of our Political system, our Judicial System, and much more. On the whole we do promote to incompetence and it is our number one failing.From the military point of view there are quite a few additional contributing factors, all Peter Principle related, which resulted in a decline in the American Military. Which include the radical feminist movement, promoting for gender rather than merit, the radical quota promotions, promoting by race, rather than merit, and our leader's failure to stand firm for core values.The up or out policy is the epitome of the Peter Principle, as is the guaranteed promotion policy, and the reenlistment bonus program which has been a great failure. Of course this book applies to all walks of life and even applies to our Present White House occupant and many of our congressional members. And will apply to many of those running for political office today.The Peter Principle is a must read for the student of our American social, political and judicial decline and what horror is in store for us in the twenty first century if we do not recognize the beast and kill it before it becomes unstoppable, which it may already be.

First published in 1969, this satirical book explains incompetence in all human organizations with one very simple adage: \\"People always rise to the level of their own incompetence, and then stagnate there, preventing all useful work from being done.\\"To back up their theory, the authors demonstrate time and again how the skills that lead to promotion actually have nothing to do with the skills necessary for successfully accomplishing the job. For example, a great machinist may get promoted for being good with manual and spatial tasks. Seeing his ease and skill in his initial functions, he is quickly promoted to shop foreman. The reality, however, is that the skills required to be a good foreman (organizational, social and so on) are nothing like the abilities needed to cope effectively with work as a machinist. Not only does our company, then, risk losing a good machinist, it also risks gaining a poor foreman.And on and on - Peter and Hull spare no expense in illustrating the principle of promotion beyond ones level of competence.And then their book gets really funny. There are two chapters near the end of the book, enumerating the medical- and psychological symptoms of what the authors term \\"Final Placement\\" at the level of ones own incompetence - a level at which one is doomed to live out the rest of ones career, given that promotion is not longer possible when one blatantly doesn't have the skills to be successful at ones present placement.Hull and Peter enumerate spurious and hilarious syndromes such as \\"Phonophilia\\" (the desire for many different telephones in a vain attempt to remain constantly connected to ones inferiors) and Papyrophilia (the belief that vaste accumulations of paper will somehow protect one from work-related errors).These chapters I recommend reading quietly when one is home alone - if you risk reading them in a public space, prepare for questioning looks.

The bell curve proves two things:1) One half of the people you meet--that is every other person you meet--is below average.2) Only 1/4 of the people you meet are really smart--those of the upper quartile--and in a democracy they will always be out voted.Our hope is in that upper 25%, yet they will always be in a minority, with the lesser 75% of us misunderstanding them, or dragging them down.Now you see how this book makes sense!Keep in mind that a theory is only as good as it's data. Luckily, we can verify the Peter Principle rather easily. Just look around your workplace, and look at what goes on. You will see the Peter Principle in al it's glory.A painfully true book!"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"A brilliant commentary on our civilization. The premise is that human nature is inherently hierarchial - pecking orders are necessarily developed, even in the absence of any clear impetus or demand for such. Hierarchies necssarily breed incompetence, frustration, failure, and doom ... unless coping methods are discovered to deal with these inevitable results.Substantial behaviorial evidence is marshalled up by the authors Peter (the concept) Hull (the book) to defend their claims, and they do with welcome concinnity and power. They unabashedly defend the idea that a great deal more can be learned by studying exteriority as opposed to interiority and use an interesting analysis of Freud to explain this approach. The idea is acceptable, but has not been universally accepted. In fact, there are many who despise the shallow nature of behavioral science and its contents.A number of the reviewers have again confused scepticism with cynicism. Peter and Hull are quite cynical about those who would seek to transcend the current state of affairs. They are in no way sceptical of their findings, their arguments, and even their possible limitations.Also excluded are those who do not exactly seek one-upmanship, at least consciously, but a better world. The ideals of the egalitarians are dismissed even without so much as Nietzschian adieus.On balance, this book is important, full of \\"worldly wisdom\\", admirably svelte, and should be read by all."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"The idea of the Peter Principle is that \\"In a Hierarchy Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence.\\" When people tend to do their job well, they are eligible for promotion and that cycle continues until they are promoted into a role for which they are incompetent to perform the duties. At that point they have reached their \\"final placement.\\" They are no longer eligible for further promotions because they have reached their level of incompetence.According to Dr. Peter, \\"work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.\\" The many employees who may never realize they have reached their final placement utilize a number of the techniques to stay happily \\"busy\\" without producing anything:1. Perpetual Preparation - confirming the need for the action, studying alternative methods, obtaining expert advise, having the mentality of \\"first things first.\\"2. Side Issue Specialization - \\"Look after the molehills and the mountains will look after themselves.\\"3. Image Replaces Performance - \\"an ounce of image is like a pound of performance.\\"4. Utter Irrelevance - participating in various committees, boards and other meetings and rarely being in their own office performing a job.5. Ephemeral Administrology - serving many temporary appointments, as a substitution.6. Convergent Specialization - becoming extremely specialized in something of little significance.We all know people who engage the above techniques to get through their work day without really doing their job, right? Perhaps ignorance is bliss.I honestly couldn't put this book down. It was just so funny. The fact that it was written in 1969 added another level of humor as Dr. Peter briefly discussed computers and the incompetence of housewives. For example: \\"'Woman's work is never done' is a sad commentary on the high proportion of women who reach their level of incompetence as housewives.\\"The Peter Principle is light and entertaining, but is also very relevant. I would recommend this book for anyone in a position of management."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"This book is great for several reasons.a. Content- the idea that a worker eventually hits a point of incompetence. This can happen to any of us. This book can help you realize that & hopefully prevent you from falling into this age old trap & weakness of man.b. Writing style- Mr. Peters provides the meat of the book, the raw knowledge. Mr. Hull is a witty playwright that spruces up the dialogue & keeps the story rolling. Providing a very fast read. Without Mr. Hull, this book wouldn't be great. You will read this much faster than you normally read a book.c. Illustrations- everybody likes pictures. This has illustrations in the style of the old Punch mag from the turn of the 19th century. Good stuff.Read it for yourself or great as a gift. Another rare thing about this book is that if you are a pollyannic person or a cynic, you will find it informative & enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"Lots of people said how great this book is, how it's relevant to every area in life. I first read the book over 20 years ago. While starting out as a manager, people noticed that even \\"mediocre\\" workers under me were treated like others. In electronic design, work has to be done correctly and checked to assure absolute specification correct design. It's a kind of job like many where not only accuracy is crucial but team work is what makes a product work. While the basic idea of being promoted beyond your ability makes logical sense, this is not what I was seeing. People with some training in a certain area could keep on \\"going up the ladder\\" and take more responsibility or do different type of work. My sense is that \\"The Peter Principle\\" is a first step in managing careers and people's work. Once you see someone fail at a certain task or area of work, then comes correction. I guess today we are more aware of what Peter has said.A different issue I saw and I still see every day, is the \\"hire me I got an MBA\\" (or an MS in Electrical Engineering, or Finance, etc.) or \\"hire me I have done all the elements of the job in my previous life\\". This is The Peter Principle without history in the same company or department. It's incompetence at the first step of the ladder. This seems to be a much bigger problem as you hire high level executives. I have seen this in CEOs and just today I have seen it in a senior exec at a new start-up. Amazing stuff... Peter did see and explain lots of interesting behavior in the corporate working world. Read it once, than read it a few more times...

Excellent."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"The whole time I'm reading this, I'm thinking, &#34;Jesus, this was written in the 60's and it's more truer than ever today.&#34; In every organization I've worked in, I've seen the Peter Principle in action. It's depressing and inevitable. It's likely the main downfall of modern business and I would love to work for a company that embraces the principle as a practice to avoid by restructuring the hierarchy.While the book is fantastic in explaining the different components and manifestations of the PP, it lacks detail in how to manipulate it. I found that section lacking clarity. I have read a few books on bettering oneself and it seems like there's 2 components: recognizing the problem and fixing the problem. This book leans heavily on recognizing the problem and graces the doorstep of fixing the problem. I suppose it's up to me to figure that out in my organization.I still gave this book 5 stars despite that criticism. It's a classic for business reading and a must-have for anyone looking to climb the corporate ladder based on merit.

The early story of the auto mechanic that was promoted to service manager, but continued to tinker with engines rather than run a tight shop says a lot.

Of course, many people in authority dictate rather than listen, mandating to underlings rather than supporting them, with the same typical results.

Peter and Raymond Hull, William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., New York, 1969, 179 pages in paperback. The Peter Principle: In a Hierarchy Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence. The author provides an insightful analysis of why so many positions in so many organizations seem to be populated by employees who exhibit signs of incompetence. A most disturbing concept since we all tend to all rise to our own level of incompetence. This concept is likely to be ignored by most senior managers and consultants since to admit it is to admit that we may also be at our own level incompetence. Ignorance is bliss? The end result is that non-growing companies are more likely to have incompetent employees at many levels of the organizational structure whereas growing companies add new positions and employees so fast that the inevitable results of the Peter Principle may be forestalled as long as growth continues. &quot;Employees&quot;, as the author points out, &quot;do not want to be incompetent&quot;, but when management offers promotions that put the employees into their level of incompetence, the employees have no way of knowing that ahead of time. After all, if the offer is made it is because management &quot;knows&quot; the employee can do the job competently. Many managers are at their level of incompetence thus they make these poor selections."},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS 1946 PUBLICATION IN THE LATE '50S-I HAVE PASSED THIS ON TO OTHERS./THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE READ IT PROBABLY NEV ER READ IT.GUESS WHO?"},{"Title":"The Peter Principle","review":"Anyone who works in a corporate environment or even a small business can appreciate this book and the principle.

Since Amazon.com's listing doesn't have a photo, let me describe it. The cover quilt features a sampler of 12 different heart motifs. The designs are different enough to make this sampler quilt constantly interesting to sew but the heart motif and the fabric selection unify the quilt much more than many samplers I've seen.Featured in the sampler are the Checkerboard Heart, pieced from small squares; the Log Cabin Heart, with a small heart applique added to this traditional design; Crazy at Heart, a planned crazy patch; Heart Turnaround, which has a simple Amish feel; and Star of My Heart, an Ohio Star variation with hearts. Creating this sampler will require the quilter to practice skills in intricate piecing, learn to make Prairie Points (little trianges that stick out from the quilt surface), work with curved seams on (appropriately) Curved Heart, and do a fair amount of applique.In addition to the sampler quilt, \\"Celebration of Hearts\\" contains scores of other projects, each based on one of the blocks featured in the sampler: a variety of throw pillows, stuffed animals, an apron, slippers, a sewing bag, etc. Don't be deterred by the '80s looking colors of the cover quilt. As the quilts depicted inside prove, hearts are a timeless motif that can be incorporated into many looks. Among the ideas depicted in the book are ways to change the look of the sampler blocks for a southwestern theme, Christmas colors, an Amish look, and many Victorian florals.One weakness of \\"Celebration of Hearst\\" is that it didn't have a lot of basic tips for a beginning quilter. Since this was the first quilt book I ever bought (fortunately not quite the first quilt I made), I was a bit at a loss to figure out the mechanics of putting my quilt together. I found that making my borders turn out the right length, based on the measurements provided and how I cut them, was frustrating. I've since discovered that many more recent quilt books suggest cutting them extra long--something these authors didn't mention.Overall, however, a \\"Celebration of Hearts\\" was an absolute delight to make. (Okay, everything EXCEPT piecing the Ohio Star block was an absolute delight.) I absolutely loved the embellishments that they suggested, including the wandering ribbons and hodge-podge sprinkling of buttons that adorn several of the blocks. Since I was making the sampler from leftover fabric from my bridesmaids' and flower girls' dresses--and was divorced by the time I got around to actually making the quilt--I added one last embellishment that wasn't in the book: I tied my wedding ring to the final block, and was happy to be done with it."},{"Title":"Resident Evil Code: Veronica X Official Strategy Guide","review":"Overall, this is a great guide for the price.

Even worse very often the authors are simply not knowledgeable enough on the subjects, especially Marines. When I started reading this book, I realized it was different. In this brilliant work I actually got the feeling that the author had somehow been able to go back into time and interview the Marines in the lines, and take notes while the shots were being fired. The pages are well written with outstanding sidebars on the oft-overlooked characters in Marine history that helped us become what we did in the 20th century.

You can tell that certain characters are made up, such as the British lieutenant who is a prisoner aboard U-859 on her long voyage to the Far East. Yet even this clearly fictional character contributes, providing a sounding board for the English-speaking German sailors, who otherwise would never dare say some of the things they need to say. And the German sailors, even with their names changed, are very real. You won't be too far into the story before you figure out which of them would go on to write this book.According to the back cover the author, Arthur Baudzus, was aboard the real U-859 during this voyage. The scene in the after torpedo room, when the U-boat has been torpedoed and is laying in two pieces on the bottom of the Malakka Straits, is all the more authentic in that it obviously speaks of what happened to the author. Here is a man who has experienced something that killed thousands of his fellow U-boat sailors, yet somehow managed to live to tell of it. And though fact and fiction mingle in this novel, there is plenty here to interest the U-boat history buff."},{"Title":"U-859","review":"Arthur Baudzus served as an electrician on board U-859 during WW2 and was one of only 20 survivors when that vessel was sunk.

Nevertheless, I did find this book to be a good read. I only wish he had used a fictional number for his fictional U-Boat.

We knew that a German U-BOAT Squadron was operaring in the Dutch East India waters, but was unaware, at the time, why it was there. Baudzus description of depth charging, was as real as it couuld be, and life on a U-BOAT was certainly different than ours. For an example, American Boats were manned by men and who volunteered for the Sub Service in fact it was quite an honor to be in the Submarine Service. While German U-BOATS were manned by men who were drafted into the their service, exception being the Officers. I was 17 when I volunteered for the Navy and volunteered for Subs as soon as I finished electricians school at Iowa State and was on a boat before I was 18.

Let's get on with the plot.\\" All I got out of the lecture were the many ways ice and frozen blood could be used to kill someone who is supposedly alone in a sealed room.Plus if you ask me, the murders in this book were cheats done with smoke (actually snow) and mirrors, and a clock that only the lumbering Dr. Fell had the brains to notice was incorrectly set. However, I don't read this author for his intricate murder set-ups. I read his books for their wonderfully ominous atmosphere. Here Carr does not disappoint. In \\"The Three Coffins,\\" three brothers, jailed in Transylvania for bank robbery fake their deaths during an outbreak of the plague and are buried alive. The one with the shovel in his coffin digs his way to freedom, then leaves his brothers in their graves and runs off alone with the hidden bank loot.Let's just say that the two brothers who are left behind play important roles in the murder and counter-murder many years later in London.

The woman exactly resembles his wife. And as it happens, the editor's uncle recently died under mysterious circumstances, with an oddly knotted piece of string next to his pillow."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Let's not mince words: this novel is unreservedly horrible. Iread this for a writing class, of all things--otherwise I neverwould've finished it, believe me. It started out bad, and so as I read on, I could only hope that it would get better. Amazingly, it actually got WORSE, culminating in an almost surreal ending. What DID anger me was the dearth of characters I could care about. Tita was weak and indecisive, but at least I didn't actually HATE her--no indeed, I reserve that hatred for Pedro, who is indeed one of the most unappealing characters I've ever encountered. He's weak, he's a bully, and to top it off, he's a rapist. He might have been an effective character, but for the fact that we were evidently meant to consider him a &quot;good guy&quot;. I really resented the fact that Esquivel actually expected us to like this loser, but evidently many people did, scarily enough. Still, unappealing characters and a goofy plot aren't all this book has against it. One of the most obvious problems is the little bits and pieces of recipes, which Esquivel integrates into the story with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. It is, I suppose, possible that a skilled writer could have made this work, but Esquivel, frankly, didn't even come close. And then there are the parts that are just plain stupid: Gertrudis &quot;has rhythm&quot; because she's actually half-black (smirk). &quot;The prostitute managed to gasp out a clue to identifying him. The traitor had a red mole shaped like a spider between his legs.&quot; HAHAHAHAHA! Right...he must have had a pretty damn long name, if gasping out &quot;red mole...spider-shaped...between legs&quot; was quicker than just saying it.

I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical. It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else. There's no poetry to the writing.Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.

It is very intelligent and fruitful with passion.This novel was Narriated by the 3rd generation of the stories characters. the story involves a girl who was told that she was destained to live without love. A man confideds in her his love and trys to brake free the tradition that has gone on for generatons. This story goes on to find many hidden secects within the family.At frist I thought it was hard to follow. That was only on the first few pages but as you go through the book you get a greater understanding. It was a interesting book to read. I never read a book if it is over 100 pages but this book intised me to keep on reading.The Author was great in describing the setting of this novel. It was easy to tell that it was in 1910 and then my mind helped set the scence. The author convays the setting so well that when I went to watch the movie, the movis setting and my minds setting were nearly the same.Some of the characters were likable, some were lovable and some were killable. As the story revolves around a girl and her rowing up there are many different characters. All were different in their own ways.This novel was very worth reading. This novel made me appreciate the finer things in life, the things we take for granted.It is just one of those novel you can't put down , you have to read it in one day because you always want to know what is going to happen."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book shouldn't have even been printed!

It shows women with no self respect, lust, and encourages men to cheat on their wives."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"My distaste for the magical realism genre certainly colors my view of Esquivel's novel. Still, there are glaring weaknesses that also contribute to my lukewarm 3-star rating. The allegory and symbolism are so forced and awkwardly integrated that I started out rolling my eyes and ended up having to force myself not to skip entire paragraphs. In addition, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped. For example, the love Tita feels for Pedro becomes revolting to the reader; how could she continue to love such a horrible, cowardly cad? Finally, the transitions are so untended that, toward the end, the chronology becomes incredibly confusing, leading up to an ending I can only describe as tacked-on and cute-sy. On the other hand, for those who like reading location-specific novels while traveling, the novel makes for a pleasant, quick and mindless read on the beach in Mexico. That's exactly what I purchased it for, so it served its purpose."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"The story that I am reviewing is called 'Water for Chocolate.' It is about a little girl who grows up with an uncle who loves to cook. Tita, the main character likes making things out in shapes of animals. The main problem in the story is she wanted to get married, but if she did and her husband left her who would take care of her when she got old? She was thinking of it because if she didn't have children who would help her later. Instead Tita's older sister marries the man. Tita's mom wanted her to marry the guy. Since she didn't she had to bake the wedding cake. While she bakes the cake she is full of tears. I enjoyed this story because it's sad and makes you think about what is right and wrong. I think you should read this story because it is very good."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This review may contain spoilers.In the beginning of this story, our dear little Tita and Pedro have fallen in love. Her mother denies Pedro's marriage proposal and, instead, gives him the hand of Tita's elder sister. Pedro reassures Tita that he still loves her, and that's why he married her sister. Later on, Tita has the chance for true love when the doctor nurses her back to health after a tragic blow to her psyche, but instead rushes to Pedro's arms when the good doctor's back is turned. When nothing else is standing in their way, Pedro and Tita still choose not to marry, taunting the doctor for over a decade, showing the reader that they are nothing but lustful thrill-seekers. Their conclusion was, in my eyes, completely justified.FURTHERMORE, I always use MILK with my chocolate.

Dr. Brown is the man who falls in love with tita and hes also they're doctor. He's very caring and has a son who also loves tita as a mother he never had. THe problem presented in this books is that they cannot marry eachother becuase mama elena has this family tradition that the youngest daughter cannot marry becuase she has to take care of her mother until the day she dies. What ends up happeneing is that in order to get close to tita, pedro decides to marry her sister rosaura to get close to tita.

I would recommend this book to anybody who loves to read about forbidden love, family traditions, and a lot of romance affairs. THis is about a life century tradition that used to happen in mexico.

The story takes place in Mexico at Mama Elena's ranch where a youngest daughter must honor the family tradition of not marrying, and to remain devoted to the care of her mother until she dies. The daughter, known as Tita aims on rebellion and breaking the family tradition to marry the love of her life. The novel comes with the installation of monthly delicious family recipes enough to satisfy the mind and taste with the charm of old Mexico combined with the tradition enough to reignite the interest for Mexico's incredible heritage as well as the downfalls of life being housebound, yearning to break free of the bonds that comes with the price of being the youngest daughter of the household. A must read to ensure delight for your love of culinary and romance."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquivel's novel \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" was a very good romance novel. I don't read books very often but this one seem to catch my attention, I originally picked it becasue it had the word \\"Chocolate\\" in the title but then I read it and it was much more than just a title, I actually got into it. Mama Elena keeps a tight leash on Tita, her daughter, especially when she falls in love with Pedro, the man she was denied to marry by Mama Elena. Tita is basically forbidden to ever love by her mother for she has to take care of her mother until her death, but thru trials and tribulations Tita eventually finds her way to love. Tita finds her true love, and teaches a lesson to never give up hope, no matter what. I believe this book was one of the best I've ever read and if your a die hard romantic like I am, you'll fall for this book. Especially if you like food too, but keep in mind that each recipe told, has it's way of being more then just a recipe in this novel, they mean more then that."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"It is hard to believe that any book could be better then the masterpiece movie by the same name (which I saw before reading the book); however, it is clear that the movie had to build on a powerful text in order to reach its strength, and reading this book written by Laura Esquivel grants you with an experience better then, or at least similar to watching the movie.This is a magical book in monthly installments, each part is written along the guidelines of a recipe which has a significant meaning to the context. The writer goes along the stages of the recipe while describing to us the emotions and happenings that go on in the all female De La Garza family controlled by the strong and powerful Mama Elena, the cruel mother, and especially in the mind of Tita, the truly tragic heroine.This is the story of Tita and Pedro, the young lovers who were destined to a life of suffering by the old tradition which condemns the youngest daughter to stay at home and take care of her mother until her death. Mama Elena was not going to give up on this tradition and denied Pedro's wish to marry Tita so that Tita can serve her until her death. Wanting to be next to Tita, Pedro marries Rosaura, Tita's big sister whom he does not love. Tita is one of the greatest heroines there is, in her devotion to Pedro, her suffering and especially in the way she cooks. Raised in the kitchen since her early days, Tita invests all her love and feelings into her food preparation and the food in turn affects every person that eats it with an overflow of emotions .This is a passionate and sensual story which is a blend of reality and mystical forces. The dead people have their way of influencing the living, whispering directions in their ears or coming to condemn their actions. The story, like the film, is enraging with the hopeless pitiless destiny that is forced on Tita and on the other hand is tender and sweet with the smells, flavors and colors an with the ways Tita finds to show her love. Tita finds the powers within to build a life for herself, even if this life is to be disclosed from everyone else. The writing is flowing and poetic and all the half-mystical half-real descriptions are presented as mere facts, as I believe they are accepted in the places Laura Esquivel writes about. One of the most lovely, most sensual stories there is."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I really enjoy books about cultures other than my own, and I especially appreciate the mystical aspects of Latin-centered books.

When her mother realizes that Tita shows affection towards Pedro, Tita's one true love, the mother marries him off to Tita's older sister. This creates a very difficult situation for the rest of Tita's life.Tita is also the head cook of the household. Through her cooking, which is vibrant and glowing with emotion, she spills her feelings of longing, frustration, rebellion, and love. Good, bad, loving, or sad Tita's feelings are so powerful that it affected everyone who smelled, touched, and tasted her wonderful food.This makes for an interesting and fascinating story which is written in an incredibly unique, simple style. Like Water for Chocolate made me respect the different types of love in one's life. Even with all of the difficult events in her life, Tita found her true love. I admired her because she always had and showed love for other people which sometimes kept her from making decisions that were in her best interest.

I loved it, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Apparently each chapter first appeared separately in a magazine, which maybe had its focus on the recipes. But in a book format, the author's talent truly stands out in how every part of each chapter is weaved together throughout the whole book to produce a true literary model in creative expression. The writing is average since the English is a translated work, but it's a shocking and compelling story. Definitely worth a look for those interested in different literary styles."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book describes an unforbiden love with exiting details through recipes.

Then out of nowhere she died. That is pretty funny. The guy must have been to much for her if she died while they were having sex. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"I could not put it down. The emotions that I experienced while reading this novel were superb! I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book is fun, but its most interesting features are not totally original. The idea of mixing recipies with a story has been exposed before (i.e. in a spy story by Simmel about caviar and champagne). Also, the unexpected effects of some foods prepared on a certain way on some people reminds me of the effect that scent has on &quot;The Parfum&quot;. In my view, the story and the storytelling is a bit too close to a soap-opera, but I must admit that the result is entertaining."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Laura Esquivel creates a novel full of sex, love, family values, and lies. Laura incorporates delicious recipes into a seductive romance. Tita, the main character, is born into a Mexican family.

You need to find the perfect ingredients to fill the recipe with the most sensual elements. It takes lovemaking to new heights."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"This book was recommended by all teachers who read it in our school, being a very slow reader -English is my second laguage- it took me 12 hours to finish. Though the book tell the story in monthly installments, starts on Jan and ends in Dec. It tells the story of a 22 years of suffuring a desperate love. Tita, a very simple girl or a very sticked to traditions family, goes on cooking and adds her feelings within the ingrediens, in which affects the people who eat her cocking afterwards!!! I think the best part is when eldest daughter got on fire affected by the cocking.. couldn't be better.. Though Laura Esquivel gets carried away on many occaisions, like when Tita started to cry and wet the 2 story house with her tears, when the chickens cause a herocain that takes Tita off her feet, when the heet of Gurtruides body steems up all the water in the tank!! and the fire works or Tita and Pedro when they make love.. and the fire.. I guess this is what makes the story special and unique.. I hated pedro sooooo much, I wished if had died when the fire cought him when he was all drunk and singing.. Tita preference to experienced love to a sentimental one is very anderstandable to me, sorry I got her dead instead of pragnent, made her a mistress instead of a mother.. guess nobody gets everything ever.. Great, Great, wonderful, most enjoyable, book. makes you experience all kind of feelings.. Read it.."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like Water For Chocolate was the most romatic novel I have ever read, depicted out of a real traditional situation. It was very sad to see the youngest daughter's heart broken by her mother who swapped sisters for marriage because the youngest was to care for her mother till death. In vengence of the tradition, one of the most interesting recipe's that the youngest daughter made was the wedding cake for her older sisters wedding. This cake made everyone who ate it cry at the wedding. The oldest daughter and the youngest daughters love's marriage never really lasted. In the end, the youngest daughter was taking a steaming hot bath in their out house when her love came to pick her up. They both rode off into the sunset on a horse while making love. It was very buetiful"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate: a novel in monthly installments, withrecipes, romances, and home remedies","review":"Like water for chocolate is a book full of recipes that arebased on traditional Mexican recipes and has not been testedby the publisher. This novel is not only about the recipes,preparation, or ingredients that make it an enjoyable bookto read. It is also about love, sadness, a family who experiences romance, the disappointments of being together, and keeping the special recipes alive from generation to generation. This book is not like any other book I have read. Water for chocolate is full of surprises. The story lags and there is always something happening by the next month. I recommend this novel to everyone who's interested.This book will make you smile and cry. It's a book to remember and to share with a friend."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function j(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",O,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const M=u(q,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-a36960fe"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/44.md","filePath":"quotes/44.md"}'),C={name:"quotes/44.md"},N=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{R as __pageData,N as default};
