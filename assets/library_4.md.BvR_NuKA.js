It has a lot of pictures, that the Sewing for Dummies lacks! But it is up to you. I do own this books, but I use it very little, if at all."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I used to sew a lot when my children were little. At some point I was \\"done\\" with sewing and I gave away my machine saying,\\" I'm never sewing again!\\" But recently the sewing urge (and the practicality of it) hit me again and I've bought a new fairly basic machine. I was intimidated, at first by all of the new \\"bells and whistles\\". This book is a perfect tool to give me the confidence to try out all the new stuff the machine can do. Without this book, I think I'd stick to a straight stitch or some very basic zig zag stitches. Now with the help of the simple step by step instructions in the book, I am game to try out all kinds of new frontiers...like sewing knit fabrics and hemstitching by machine. This book is the perfect companion to match my limited knowledge and skill level for sewing and help me try many of the variable things my new sewing machine can do."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"reading this book! Luckily I was not looking for clear-cut instructions on hemming, seaming, and pattern design, because I found the author's instructions to be very difficult to understand due to the absence of pictures and diagrams. I would suggest purchasing other books for project ideas and coherent instructions. &quot;Sewing for Dummies,&quot; however, helped me to become more confident about actually going near my new sewing machine because of the author's use of plain English and the absence of &quot;advanced technical sewing jargon.&quot; Although disappointed about the confusing hands-on instructions, I was happy that I chose this to be my very first sewing book because the author really does make the basics easy to understand!"},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"The book has helped me greatly already.

If I am working on a project and i want a reference to a sewing procedure, it right there available to me. The instructions are written in a way that I and anyone can understand. The illustrations are wonderful as well. The illustrations help you understand things clearly. I have several sewing books and this one is by far my favorite! This is a invaluable tool for anyone learning to sew! I love the tips and tricks it teaches you! I highly recommend this book. It is the ONLY sewing book you will need!"},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I am a bit disappointed with this book. As a true beginner sewer, it does not cover off on my needs.

Try a different title if you're after a beginner text."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I bought this book after deciding to re-introduce myself to sewing, after having taken one introductory high school fashion class about 10 years ago. I remembered basic things like the importance of pre-shrinking fabric, and slip stitching, but a lot of things I needed to bush up on. I bought Sewing for Dummies, and I've referred to it ever since. Overall, it's a really good book, and I definitely recommend it for people who have had a bit of familiarity with sewing before, and need to brush up. I do think the book could have more detailed imaging, and go into more description about the techniques. Some things, I did find myself referring to the internet for images and examples. I do think this book is defintely worth purchasing though, especially for the price."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"Yes the dummy series are good for some of their books (Computer for dummies, or whatever) but they do not know everything.

When I want to learn a new programming language, that's the first place I always start. But perhaps the editors of the series feel more comfortable programming than sewing because this book isn't nearly enough. A true dummy to arts, crafts, and sewing, I needed many more diagrams, more information on fabric, more on what all the info. means at the end of a bolt of fabric, more definitions. Just more! The style is the same dummies friendliness, but I'll have to take some very basic classes on what I had hoped Sewing for Dummies would offer. After that, it might be a great book."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I give this book 3 stars, which means \\"okay,\\" because that's exactly how I feel about it. It's a decent reference for some sewing terms and basic techniques--not great, but it will give you the general idea.The biggest thing that I do not like about it (aside from the annoying \\"for Dummies\\" trappings: puns/plays on words, a self-conscious \\"accessible\\" style, and frequent attempts at humor) is the really abysmal editing. It's actually unclear which edition the author is writing when, at the beginning of the book, she mentions that she does not cover sergers much but gives more serger-specific advice in the second edition--because this IS the second edition, and there is precious little serger-related instruction to be had. I was confused. In a later section, she promises to show three techniques for gathering ... and goes on to describe TWO. Then, mere paragraphs after that obvious editing oversight, I looked forward to learning what a pin tuck and shell tuck were, only to be disappointed when she only covered the plain tuck despite an introductory paragraph promising information on all three types. I actually checked to see that I wasn't missing pages!Additionally I found some of the instructions very difficult to follow. The illustrations it does have are pretty helpful as sewing illustrations go, but there is more than one place where more illustrations are necessary, in my opinion.In all ... if I knew of a better reference book I would have bought that one. I am about to go check Amazon for a better-reviewed book! Also I would like one with slightly more up-to-date learning projects; maybe it's just me but a vest made out of placemats just doesn't appeal. The window treatment techniques are also pretty dated--I was somewhat surprised to see a publication date of 2004 since all the photos seemed so mid-nineties.I don't like this book much but perhaps its direct style (if scattered and only passably organized information) could help some. It's not a big deal either way; I mean I am sorry I spent $20 on it but I will probably turn to it in the future just because I have it."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I got this book hoping that it would help me learn the basics of sewing. I've gotten &#34;For Dummies&#34; books in the past and have had great success with them; however, this particular one is confusing, non-discriptive, and the pictures are vague. I would not reccomend this book to anyone. This book gives a brief overview of various topics, but never explains anything...the patterns that you use to sew with are more helpful. I just use YouTube now to figure out how to sew what I need to do."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"Great book to help you learn the terminology associated with sewing. Found it helpful when I went fabric/ supply shopping and knew what the stuff I needed was called and what it's purpose was. Lots of good info but a little dated when it came to some of the projects.

While it has a lot of information, I was specifically looking for a book on how to alter/\\"fit\\" clothing that is too big or small. I have very little sewing experience, so from a sewing basics standpoint, this book is a good choice, as it will give you a little (I stress the word little) information on many different sewing topics.I felt the book could've had better illustrations and the author's duplicate instructions for those using a serger were a little annoying. I mean if you are reading a Sewing for Dummies book, what are the chances you are using a serger?!I would suggest if you have a certain aspect of sewing you are wanting to learn about, try to find a book that is specific to that subject."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"This book has a lot fo information but it's so hard to read.

I have hardly used this one at all.I regret buying it, it's too much text very few exciting projects, and honestly, pretty boring.The other book explains things as thoroughly but in a much more fun way."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I was far from impressed with this book, so I'm somewhat baffled by it's high rating.The concept of the Dummies Collection Empire is unparallelled genius, and generally very helpful for finding the basic information one needs when introduced to something new. That said, perhaps they've over-shot the mark with this one.I'm a seamstress- self-taught, and I run my own business selling my clothing. I typically use a technique called draping, but rarely use patterns. I picked this book up for a friend that I'm teaching to sew, thinking it would be a good reference book on sewing machine basics for her when I wasn't there, as well as to give her a more fundamental understanding of patterns (and adjusting them) than I could.When I chose the book, I chose it specifically among many, b/c it was called \\"Sewing\\"- as opposed to say, \\"fashion\\" or \\"dressmaking\\", assuming this would be the appropriate choice for her entry-level needs.There is little information in this book about sewing machines- a short, poorly written chapter with almost zero information on the general parts and processes of the sewing machine. The remainder of the book is dedicated to actually sewing something- a couple boring projects, and a slim section on the basic stitches used in sewing.They do go over the tools of the trade, but not in depth, and othertimes, on things that most people could figure out how to use on their own. An entire detailed page on the self-threading needle is overkill. I'm pretty sure most novices could master it's use without a diagram, but \\"Dummies\\" seems to have taken us for, well, dummies.If you've never sewn before, and you've never even seen the inside of a sewing aisle, then perhaps you'll find this book useful. If you have a modicum of intelligence, and are looking to advance your technique, or find the meat of the thing, you'll be disappointed, as this book is barely more than the bones of it.There is nothing contained within that you wouldn't find in a good, solid sewing book for beginners- the latter of which would prove a far better buy, since it will most likely have more detailed information, better starter projects, and at the minimum, a well done chapter or two on the sewing machine's parts, maintenance, and techniques. Knowing how the machine works, how to care for it, and how to troubleshoot when using it are the most essential tools of the trade, and they will go a long way in curbing frustration and making beginner mistakes. To not have this in the book is a serious oversight.Additionally, Dummies might have done themselves a favor had they titled this book \\"sewing crafts for dummies\\", as \\"Sewing\\" implies technique, not projects."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"For a beginner like myself I found this to be very helpful.

It's very easy to understand andit has wonderful sewing tips."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"I have recently begun teaching myself to sew. I taught myself knitting over the last several years and always keep the Knitting for Dummies book by my side as a reference for anything I don't know. So when I decided to learn to sew I bought myself a simple machine and this book. I've been sewing for a couple of weeks now and have read probably 3/4th of this book and I'm disappointed with it. I don't think the instructions are very clear for a newbie and many of the topics are covered way too briefly. On my first pattern, for example, it instructed me to \\"narrow hem,\\" a common sewing task. Looking in the index of this book there is no entry for narrow hem. I knew I had read something in the book about using a narrow hem foot in order to make a narrow hem, but when I looked for detailed instructions for how to do that, I found nothing. I had to resort to a google search to find clear directions for doing a narrow hem both with and without a special foot.I also find many of the directions unclear and there are not enough illustrations or the illustrations are not clear enough for me to understand what I'm supposed to do. And I think I'm better than average at understanding written instructions since I managed to teach myself to do quite complex knitting from mostly written instructions.The projects in this book are ok, but most of them are not my style. They have a country craft feel to them that is too old for me. I prefer hip, youthful, DIY style projects. I did find her instructions for a basic pillow cover useful, but again, I wished the instructions were more clear in a couple places. As for making a vest out of placemats, I think I'll skip that one.I found the manual that came with my machine more useful in actually getting me started sewing. This book has helped some, but from now on I'm going to rely on the internet for instructions. And I'll probably be buying a different book with more appealing starter projects."},{"Title":"Sewing for Dummies","review":"This book still provides the basics, some terminology and such...but the patterns that are \\"included\\" are outdated by about 20 years.

At least that's my experience in learning to sew from books and buying a bunch. This book though is better than most and for that I'd recommend it. I learnt to sew a seam properly with this book. I found the projects enlosed awful though and I'm not tempted to make any of them, not the greetings card with buttons sewn on, nor the waistcoat made of napkins for example. But, the basic information enclosed is useful although all you need to know isn't here.

The author successfully traces the decline of Biblical thinking in American political, social, and economic life in terms of theological changes that are easily traceable: Puritans with Calvinist theology, then Deism bringing forth the Declaration of Independence, a partial reversion to Calvinism in the writing of the Constitution, and the deep anti-Christian onslaughts of Transcendentalism, Social Darwinism, and the Social Gospel.Further, he shows also that the liberal changes in theology after the Puritans have pushed us in the direction of \\"democracy\\" and away from the constitutional republicanism of the U.S. Constitution. Also, he weaves in how the emphasis on democracy and reforms of all kind (carrying the role of the government far beyond that envisaged by the writers of the Constitution) tends in the direction of totalitarianism. Big government must control more and more aspects of life.He is especially strong in his section on Dewey's instrumentalism.This book will be important reading for any Christian who wants to know how we moved from the Biblical understanding of liberty for the people who live responsibly under a sovereign God, to the idea of a sovereignty by the people in support of essentially humanistic goals.His treatment is measured and careful. He doesn't portray liberals as always wrong and orthodox Christians as always correct. He repeatedly notes that some notables who were theologically liberal where politically and economically liberal, and vice-versa. The book is not a polemic, but it makes clear that there are certain lines drawn in theology and public policy, there are clearly discernible trends over time, and people who are evangelicals will find themselves on one side of that line with the National Council of Churches on the other side.Also, I would recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians who consider themselves to be liberal. Many today are naive, and do not realize how much they have bought into the socialist and communist idea of collectivity and the building of the Kingdom of God on earth through social action.Thank you Prof. Singer."},{"Title":"A Theological Interpretation of American History","review":"This book deals with the subject of American history from a Biblical perspective. It is superb in the simple framework that anyone can understand. Absolutely recommended to anyone who is interested in the truth of our nation's history."},{"Title":"A Theological Interpretation of American History","review":"This is the kind of book that is critical reading for any Christian who seeks to understand American history. Singer examines the critical religious and philosophical movements in American history, how they shaped their times, and whether or not they were true to biblical principles.He begins with Puritanism, and argues that it was critical to the success of the nation's founding. It established critical theological and political systems that the Constitution later took as a model. Later Puritanism, under the guise of Edwardian theology, no less, set Puritanism adrift and ultimately lead to the ascendancy of Deism.In Deism, Singer finds the source of the Revolutionary temper and the ungodly justification for rebellion against England. The Declaration of Independence was anti-Christian document, despite some Christians signing it. Deism went into a brief decline in the instability of the post-war, pre-Constitution era.The Constitution itself, was a much more conservative, and more influenced by Puritanism than the Declaration, yet it was not what it could have been. But it established a Federal Republic, which led to the early success of the nation. But not all was well. Deism had been firmly established in the churches and colleges. Dissatisfaction with the mechanistic god of Deism led to the more personal, but pantheistic god of Transcendentalism.The Transcendentalist movement, fundamentally optimistic, due to unbiblical eschatology, began the wave of reform movements including abolitionism. As many Southern theologians understood, abolitionism was more than an anti-slavery movement. It was an atheistic philosophical movement bent on undermining Christianity and destroying the liberty granted in the Constitution.The triumph of abolitionists in the Civil War led to a great centralizing of Federal power, an accelerated industrial revolution due to war production. This then brought about the rapid decline of the Transcendentalist movement and the ascendancy of Social Darwinism. The shared optimism of both movements led to the remarkable influence of the Darwinists--particularly in the churches. The liberalization of Christian theology brought about a liberalization in government leading to increases in Federal power and further reform movements based on unbiblical theology.The liberal theology led to the Social Gospel--the Kingdom of Christ on earth through the work of men, not God. Again, unbiblical theology. The Progressives worked in and through the Social Gospel establishing a thoroughly democratic government, particularly through the New Deal. The rise of Democracy enthroned humanism over and against God. The decline of America is now rapid and almost without any hope of slowing down, let alone stopping.This remarkable narrative ties together the movements in American history, and evaluates them in light of biblical principle. Singer is clearly a Calvinist, and in Calvinism, sees true and right theology. He is very critical of Arminianism and in it, he sees the liberalization and the compromises necessary to concede to liberal theology. Those who believe in American Exceptionalism will find instead, a history of quick ascent and an equally rapid decline in the biblical standards found in the political system.

National park service] Fauna of the national parks of the United States. Fauna series no. 5)","review":"The title of Murie's book is far too restrictive to represent the full range of its contents. While the longest single chapter of the book is, indeed, devoted to the habits and ranges of wolves, including their interrelationships with other species inhabiting the huge national park surrounding Mt. McKinley (or Denali, as it is more popularly known in Alaska), other chapters deal with many other animals native to the region. Among those studied rather intensively are Dall sheep, caribou, moose and fox. Two rather brief chapters give sketches of grizzly bear and golden eagle as well. A more inclusive title for this study might have been \\"The Fauna of Mount McKinley.\\"First published in 1944, this book is a record of observations made by an astute naturalist bent upon discovering how the animals live, what they eat, where they range, when they give birth, and, most importantly, how they feed upon one another to maintain a healthy and natural population balance. Not a few myths about prey and predator are dispelled by Murie's objective observations, which include examining the contents of scats and stomachs.Murie does not preach environmentalism, but a careful reading of this book should leave the reader with new insights into the natural world and may make him or her just a little more hesitant to intrude destructively into what is actually a highly complex interrelationship among many species inhabiting the few wild spaces left to them. Murie's approach to his study is highly objective and non-judgmental, however, and another reader could probably come away with insights different from mine. Still, I can scarcely conceive of any reader's coming away from this book with no new insight of some sort!If one is particularly intrigued by the great grizzly bear, I recommend that he also read Murie's work entitled \\"The Grizzlies of Mount McKinley,\\" for it goes into far more detail than does the single chapter on grizzlies in this book. Before investing the purchase price and the reading time in either book, do understand that these are not \\"story books\\" and that they are in no way sentimental or emotive approaches to their subjects. They are highly descriptive, scantily illustrated with old black and white photos from the early 1940's, and, at times, recite fairly dry statistical observations. Overall, however, they are well worth the investment by anyone who has an interest in the wild creatures that still inhabit the less-traveled areas of North America."},{"Title":"The wolves of Mount McKinley, ([United States.

The truth is that despite its shortcomings, communism was and is a superior system for meeting human needs and working toward liberty and justice for all.

I have read many other books about ADHD, and this is one of my favorite for many reasons. First of all, it was written by someone who has ADHD. It is really hard for people who don't have ADHD to understand what people with ADHD really have to go through mentally, emotionally, and physically. I laughed, cried, and found tremendous relief while reading this book. I wasn't even aware of how painful it was to live with ADHD until I read this book. Until now, I always thought that everything was my fault and that I somehow caused everybody around me to be so unhappy and disappointed. I tried to please everyone so much but the more I tried, the more I pushed people away. I knew something was wrong with me but never could put a finger to what it is. Thanks to my naturally optimistic nature, I never allowed myself to be diagnosed with depression, bipolar, etc...I've read so many books on depression and could never identify with any of them, except for the inability to concentrate part of depression.If you are diagnosed with ADHD, please read as much about it as you can. I could identify so much with this book, but maybe another might be better for you. Don't get discouraged. Please seek help by finding a doctor who knows how to treat ADHD. ADHD is a serious problem when left untreated. It doesn't have to be a psychiatrist if you can't afford one.

The concepts of both nature and nurture are seemlessly interwoven to provide an excellent perspective on causality as well as direction for treatment.Having a past personal interest in child psychology lent me familiarity to many of the concepts the author brought forth in his book. If his ideas seem 'cooked up' you are mistaken. The author is quoting cornerstone teachings of well known developmental psychologists.One must realize that research into ADHD is still evolving. Whether or not causality can be determined in each specific case, it does not detract from the author's direction in treatment (whether through family therapy, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy). More specifically, ADHD may in fact arise in 'functional families' but the requirement for ongoing support/'unconditional positive regard' remains pivotal.But one should realize this is not a 'How to Book' nor a brief synopsis. With all that aside...... an eloquent book which made me laugh, cry and take heart."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I was diagnosed with ADD relatively late--age 50.

Hallowell, on the other hand, packed his book with the latest science, which was incredibly helpful to my understanding of my special brain, how to live with it and manage it."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Another book claiming that ADHD is caused by environmental factors? Sure. And ADHD can be cured in a few weeks with the latest snake-oil treatment.Those of us who have been around that loop a few times will be forgiven for being suspicious of a book that once again seems to argue against the given wisdom that ADHD is fundamentally a neurobiological disorder, with a large genetic component.But Mat&eacute;'s book does not fall simply into either side of the nature/nurture dichotomy. It does allow that there is a genetically determined \\"sensitivity\\" inherent in ADHD. It also insists that there are environmental factors which play a large role in how ADHD eventually plays out in the individual. The value of the book is in how it elaborates the intricate interplay of \\"nature\\" and \\"nurture\\" factors.To choose just one instance of this argument, Mat&eacute; describes a familiar feature of ADHD, which he calls \\"counterwill.\\" It is sometimes predictable that if you ask an ADHD person to do something, they will be vexingly compelled to do the opposite. Their will seems to run the other way from whatever direction they are being pointed. This is the basis of the overlap of ADHD with \\"oppositional-defiant disorder.\\"It appears to us that an ADHD person is being \\"too willful.\\" But in fact, it reflects an absence of a well integrated self and \\"will\\" as well as an environmental experience of being overrun by someone else's will.The elaboration of that argument is more complex, but it assumes that qualities of the experience of having an ADHD biology can lead to predictable developmental consequences if certain environmental factors are present. In the case of counterwill, if the ADHD child's attention errors are consistently met by controlling behavior from an adult, the ADHD child will learn to counteract the overriding of their fragile will by being \\"strong-willed\\" in the opposite direction.The child's goal is not the specific willful behavior that results, but it is rather the assertion of an independent will. The child may not even know what they want until they are asked to do one particular thing. Then it is completely clear to them that they want to do the opposite. This increases the ADHD child's feeling of autonomy, (even though it is in reality the most slavish reactivity to other people). Counterwill is desperately required, in order to not feel the complete dissolution of their own will.So this has a clear environmental component, even as it also stems in part from the difficulty that the ADHD child has in constituting their own sense of self-direction and self-control. Presumably, if raised in ideal conditions, ADHD children would not develop counterwill . Hence, counterwill is not a part of the \\"biology\\" of ADHD. However, given the predictable negative and controlling reactions of imperfect adults to the frustrations of \\"cat-herding\\" an ADHD child, counterwill is likely to develop in the ADHD child with some frequency. The overwhelmed adult, by increasingly controlling the behavior of the ADHD child, unintentionally creates the oppositional behavior that makes their task so much more difficult. Biology interacts with a predictable environment to reach an unhappy but common result.More broadly, the theme that runs underneath the greater part of the book is that stress amongst parents (or primary caregivers) is fundamental to the development of ADHD. This stress leaves the parents unable to sufficiently pay attention to the emotional needs of the child, which in turn leads to a disturbed attachment process that Mat&eacute; sees as characteristic of ADHD children. Mat&eacute; asserts that the genetic predisposition to ADHD is based on an oversensitivity to these stresses in the parents. Only the combination of stressed, emotionally unavailable parents and the genetic oversensitivity will lead to ADHD.Mat&eacute; does not argue, as some others might, that ADHD causes the parenting problems in the first place. He claims that the parenting problems exacerbate the ADHD issues that the child comes to physiologically. But it would make sense to extend his argument that environment and genetics interact continuously. Those of us who have been there know: not only do parents affect the ADHD child, but the ADHD child profoundly influences the parent.Personally, I feel that the \\"nurture\\" case is overstated in Mat&eacute;'s book, even though the general thrust makes sense. The overemphasis on attachment issues in ADHD neglects that many other independent disorders include disturbances in attachment. Attachment issues are probably not the defining characteristic of ADHD.I also think that Mat&eacute; underplays the significance of medications in treatment. Even though he acknowledges the sometimes dramatic improvements that medication can make, he tends to see the disorder primarily as psychological. Hence psychological treatments take precedence over biological ones. The therapeutic effect of \\"unconditional positive regard\\" is considered \\"first line\\" treatment, with medication as an adjunct. In my experience, the medication can have such a profound effect, that it makes little sense to not try this first. Of course I also agree that the psychological consequences of ADHD need to be addressed for substantial improvement to occur.Of course, the main danger of describing ADHD psychologically is that it is interpreted as a problem that should be surmounted purely psychologically. There are people who will blame themselves forever for just \\"not trying hard enough\\" rather than face a real physiological difficulty that they can treat physiologically.Mat&eacute; does not put it together entirely psychologically, but I remain nervous about that risk. I do not think that anyone is served well if we categorically fall back to blaming parents and schools for not adapting to ADHD children better. We have had to work hard to get past the \\"psychologizing\\" of ADHD as the product of a \\"too fast culture\\" or relaxed parenting standards and so on. The task is not to throw out the insights of a physiological explanation, but to expand it by looking at the interplay of the given, genetic nature and the environmental nurture where it plays out."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"In true ADD fashion, after being diagnosed I bought 3 books on ADD and checked out 4 more at the library. I loved this book through chapter 5. The section on the origins of ADD was presented as fact with lots of examples from the author's history. I haven't read this particular theory anywhere else, and I found it somewhat annoying. The theory is that ADD is caused by mothers who were depressed or anxious during pregnancy, or in infancy because (through postpartum depression or the mother's ADD) she couldn't properly bond with her child. As \\"proof\\" he cites the fact that adopted children have ADD in much higher numbers than the general population. What if adopted children have a higher likelihood of having ADD because their mothers have it? A woman with ADD might be more likely to give up their children due to feeling overwhelmed. The \\"help\\" section wasn't helpful. It basically recommended that you be understanding with your ADD children. I AM understanding since I have it myself, but that doesn't make it any easier to get them off to school in the morning.

This book is my absolute favorite. Why? Probably because Dr. Mate has been so courageous in his honesty regarding his personal experience. I saw myself in so many of his descriptions of himself and his patients. If you are a person with A.D.D., you have hurt others with your inattentiveness, your carelessness, your impulsivity resulting in many idiotic decisions. You most likely never had any intentions of hurting anyone 99% of the time but nevertheless you did. And you have probably, deep down inside, always felt like there is just something wrong with you, you're just a &quot;bad person&quot; even though you really don't know how to keep yourself from doing these things over &amp; over. This book will not only help you to see that, yes, in a way, there is something &quot;wrong with you&quot; but you are most likely not a &quot;bad person&quot; and you are probably much more harsh with yourself than you would ever be with someone else. But it doesn't stop there. It gives you a way to maybe not &quot;grow out of&quot; A.D.D. but, definitely, to grow beyond wherever it is that you're stuck right now. If you are a family member or friend of someone with A.D.D., you will grow in your understanding &amp; compassion for this person no matter how much they have exasperated &amp; angered you in the past. Believe me, I know because not only do I have it myself but two of my four children have been diagnosed (so far) and I suspect that various other family members do, too.

Even under the best of social circumstances, the lack of consistent maternal love and affection plays a strong and direct impact on an infant child's brain. It makes me wonder what will happen to all of those children whose mothers in modern America are distracted by their careers, or almost anything else, but the very present relationship to their babies. What of the young mothers walking down the street listening to their iPhones, or talking on their cell phones while pushing a stroller down the street? I wonder what affect that will have?Dr. Mate describes the neurophysiological, chemical changes that take place in the infant brain whenever there is stress in the environment, or there is a safe and nurturing environment. During the first nine months of a child's life, these hormone messengers are critical for the development of an important region of the brain and lay the groundwork for future developmental changes necessary for a human baby to feel happy and secure, or abandoned and confused.

If you're ADD yourself, it is kind of seductive and makes you want to keep reading, and you feel as if some really good information is soon to follow. However, somewhere between 40 to 50 percent of the way through it starts to get pretty &quot;out there&quot; and repetitive in it's &quot;out thereitiveness&quot;.In a nutshell the author is trying to say that since the baby did not get as much attention as it needed (due to its predisposed sensitivity) from it's parents, it did not have time to develop it's prefontal cortex. But does the author really believe himself here? OK, it's a theory that sounds good to a naive individual...but is this doctor really convicted of what he is saying?If a child was never taught to walk by their parents, they would eventually figure it out. There is no &quot;One-foot in front of the other-deficit disorder&quot;. But there are people who are physically handicapped at birth. Trust me, my parents were fully there for me in every conceivable way during my childhood. But I still have ADD and do best when it is treated as a biological disorder.I think the authors theory is about as sound as this one: &quot;The socialistic medical system in Canada has flooded doctor offices with everyone that cuts their finger or has a bad case of the runs. Outside of a really good eye-surgeon in Windsor, this system has cranked out the quackiest of theories by their practitioners.&quot;But we know that theory has no basis. Neither does much of this authors ADD theory."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I am surprised at the other reviews of this book.

Try to understand your child, and make his development as a human being the most important thing...it's extraordinarily hard and forces you to grow up as a parent and think of your child first. Common sense that is not so common. And it is NOT a quick solution. It was something my parents figured out a long time ago; when some of my friends wanted to run away because of mistreatment as teenagers, we always knew we had it too good.

In the Footprints of Infancy Chapter, I had an epiphany regarding my own life and the lives of my children. As a school psychologist who works with teachers, I have learned how to better meet the needs of children with ADD in the classroom, and how to explain the power of a teacher to those who work with these children.

Many of my family members, as well as myself, have ADD. I have also researched all related subjects from neurology to chemistry to genetics. I must say this is the best book I've read on the subject. Instead of vaguely listing traits and behavioral/rienforcement &quot;corrections&quot;, he delves deep into our emotions, deep into our past, and finds the keys to the behaviors. You will find the journey fascinating. He discovers the tie of inborn sensitivity to ADD, which was where my extensive research was leading me, also. He separates the negative issues from the positive ones in ADD for the purpose of reassuring us that to let go of the negative doesn't squash or choke the many positive aspects of a person with ADD. This book will help you forgive a loved one with ADD for being confusing and hurtful at times, and it will help you forgive yourself if you have ADD, with reality, not theory. This book is no fluff.

The book goes beyond the stereotype of the hyperactive child or dysfunctional underachieving adult to give a more accurate view of the many ways ADD can manifest in adults and children.

I simply could not put the book down after I started reading it. The author goes beyond where most would stop in admitting their own experiences. Combined with numerous tales of ADD patients, this book provides very helpful views on the condition, family, and relationships.

Following is a list I have put together from my reading so far, and these are books that I would HIGHLY recommend. I would like to say up front that the DSM-IV is full of very normal behaviors that for some reason have become magnified or exaggerated in an individual to the point of causing a negative impact in their daily lives. Take OCD for example, it is quite normal and even preferable (from a safety perspective) to check and be sure that one has turned off all the burners on the stove after cooking, or to be sure the back door is locked before going to bed. But to continue checking time and again would be problematic and can lead to problems in an individual's life. Something is diagnosed as a disorder when it moves from being a \\"normal\\" activity to being something that causes dysfunction in daily living. So, one may read the DSM-IV and see themselves reflected in many of the disorders. The question is always: is this behavior negatively impacting my life? If so then that is when it crosses the line of normal and needs to be treated.ADHD (attention deficit disorder)* Book = \\"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It\\" - Gabor Mateo This is not just a great book for folks with ADHD, but for everyone - as many of the lessons here translate to all of us. This is an extremely excellent book on ADHD and living in general.OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder)* Book = \\"Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\" - Ian Osborno Excellent book on OCD - this book will help individuals with OCD as well as those who know someone with the disorder - to understand what is happening in the mind of a person with this disorder. This book will also help OCD folks realize that they are not alone and that many of the rituals or compulsions are shared by other folks with OCD.Depersonalization Disorder - essentially feeling like you are not really there* Book = \\"Feeling Unreal: Depersonalization Disorder and the Loss of the Self\\" - Daphne Simeon and Jeffrey Abugelo Excellent book which will help folks understand this disorder. This is for me a very interesting disorder, I think this is one disorder where the connection between our ego consciousness and perhaps what we are at a much deeper level is challenged. Normally we are locked into full belief in our reality - we believe we are very much a part of it and that we \\"are\\" the body in which we reside. This disorder forces us to question if we are the body we think we are. It would appear that whatever piece of our mind is keeping us in full belief is breaking down a bit, leaving us a bit outside of the \\"normal\\" feeling of being the body. Folks with this disorder can actually worry that they do not have control of their body and that this body may do something they do not want it to do. Driving a car for example can be quite traumatic if you think your body may be acting without your input.Bipolar disorder - the book I am recommending is focused on Bipolar II disorder - essentially swinging from manic (very happy and carefree) to severe depression. This book was actually required reading during the Masters program* Book = \\"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and Madness\\" by Kay Redfield Jamisono Excellent book written by a psychologist who suffers from this disorder. This book helps to understand the importance of medication for this disorder, as well as the path of destruction that can easily be paved during carefree, manic episodes.Depression; I believe there are two sources for depression: one source is our own minds, we think ourselves into the depression - at least in this case we know where it is coming from and we should be able to step behind our thoughts and help ourselves move in a better direction. The other source seemingly comes from nowhere; one minute we are okay and the next we are thrown into the depths* Book = \\"Transforming Depression: Healing the Soul Through Creativity\\"- David H. Rosen\\"o I would recommend reading this at least through chapter 4, going further than that delves into some deep Jungian psychology which will not likely appeal to everyone. I certainly enjoy Jungian psychology and believe that Jung's work will become more and more important and critical to our understanding as we move forward in this field of psychology. Jung's psychology is really on the borderland between spirit/soul and the science of psychology and it is Jung's work that brought me into this field. However it is quite complex/deep/different and may lose some readers. For a very good intro to Jung's work, I would recommend \\"The Essential Jung\\" by Anthony Storr, but this is not light reading as is composed of excerpts from Jung's collected works.* Book = \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" - Viktor Franklo I would recommend this book for two primary reasons: one is it pushes very strongly the message that meaning is essential in our lives - as shown through Victor Frankl's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps. Frankl comments on how he observed the individuals who gave up the fight and died, and the individuals who persevered - and most importantly what it was that he believes made the difference. The other reason I recommend this book is that it helps the individuals whose thoughts may have led them to depression to realize that things could be worse. Of course there are devastations we may face that can truly be to us, just as bad as a Nazi concentration camps, but for the most part, we often push ourselves into depression for reasons that are somewhat superficial compared to other realities.That is all for now, but I am still reading"},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"WHEN WILL YOUR BOOKS BE AVAILABLE IN AUDIBLE.COM.

I appreciate the quick service! The content IN the book is AMAZING and So helpful, I have recommended it to many people and have found it to be very revealing in my own life."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Mate is an interesting writer and his medical and science training together with his willingness to be candid about himself and his family background are much appreciated.He also presents some prescriptive answers that I think are correct. Empathy for children is essential in forming healthy attachment when they are utterly dependent like in infancy, and even through childhood all the way to adulthood at age 22 or 23, when the brain completes its basic growth and when most children develop economic autonomy and become more fully differentiated from their parents psychologically. Our political economy's continued resistance to setting boundaries for parenting, especially in the first couple, pre-verbal years of a child's life, is causing a lot of problems.The elephant in the room that I think he misses is that he calls this a problem of \\"mothering.\\" I think it is a problem of attachment to BOTH parents and good quality empathizing/mentoring/nurturing by both of them. Under our traditional patriarchal models of the man earning and acquiring status in the public economy while the mother is home, we have lost the paternal attachment to children in many respects, especially in the industrial age as the man does his work away from home rather than farming where he tends to be around the family more. The fact that paternity could not be proven also led to a great deal of control of women (if the man controls the woman economically, through religion involving male deities, by requiring that his family name be passed on and the mother's family name dropped, or even physically, he may think (erroneously, of course) he can be more certain the children born to her are his); as a result, women in general in the Western world have not had access to full political and economic autonomy until the last 20-50 years. Now, however, paternity can be proven - and disproven - genetically which has also helped loosen this oppression of women and release men from anxieties as well.And, indeed in contemporary families where both parents work and both parents do childcare & parenting, the children do have less ADD (See Michael Kimmel's report in \\"The Shriver Report: A Woman's Nation\\" and Joshua Coleman's book \\"The Lazy Husband,\\" pp 3-4). Lloyd de Mause in \\"Psychohistory: The Origins of War,\\" especially the chapter \\"Why Males Are More Violent\\" also discusses how this change in family structure to egalitarianism between the parents and children bonding more securely with fathers - and fathers connecting empathetically with children - has reduced violent behavior in young men who grow up in these families. Dan Kindlon's \\"Alpha Girls\\" discusses the benefits to girls who have had healthy emotional connections to fathers and how these girls now see themselves as equal to boys and how their psychology is healthier with fewer emotional problems, fewer eating disorders, less (I think actually none at all in the group Kindlon studied) teen pregnancy, economic and political strength, no anxiety about working and earning money, concepts of \\"self-in-connection\\" that will allow them to be phenomenal parents, etc.I saw Dr. Mate interviewed on Democracy Now and was very disappointed when he was discussing his \\"mother\\" theory and the commentator astutely said \\"what about fathers?,\\" to which Mate answered, \\"The father's role, of course, is to support the mother.\\" It was difficult to tell what he meant by this but he seemed to miss the issue and to be thinking of the father only as economic provider rather than as someone who earns money for his family (along with the mother) but also has a joint responsibility with her for half the personal care of his children and for the emotional connection with his children and nurturing them. His ambiguity around this (it may be more than ambiguity and instead be a deliberate avoidance of discussing in public male empathy for children?) risks reinforcing the very patriarchal family system that is contributing to ADD and other emotional health problems.For people, especially men, who grew up in patriarchal homes, I recommend Terry Real's \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It.\\" He talks about how this phenomenon, plus being socialized into stereotypes of \\"masculinity,\\" can leave a boy with depression and other emotional problems.John Badalement has a book called \\"The Modern Dad's Dilemma\\" where he calls this lacuna of the father's emotional life \\"the elephant in the room\\" in child development. I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"The \\"medical\\" and \\"pharmaceutical\\" approaches that dominate the discussion of many psychological issues, including ADHD, can't hold a candle to the clarity and depth of Mate's analysis. Being a doctor himself, he self-administered the drugs typically prescribed for ADHD, (with which he was diagnosed as an adult), only to find it made him a more efficient workaholic. The insights he had as he wrestled with the deeper issues involved in the management of his own ADHD and those of others, make this book the BEST I've across on the subject. While admitting that drugs can certainly be helpful, he makes a compelling case for becoming more mindful of one's behaviors in getting a handle on ADHD. Furthermore, the book is so well written that it makes for highly entertaining reading, providing a more comprehensive understanding of ADHD as a social and cultural phenomenon rather than a medical or genetic problem.Can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"As a mother searching for resources and help for my ADD son, I found this book incredibly helpful.

For me as an adult with only recently diagnosed ADD, it is of more therapeutic value than a good 17 years of psychotherapy have been.Baukje (aka Bonnie)"},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I just finished reading Dr. Mate's ideas on what causes ADD and what can be done about it. First, I'll say something good about the book. It has one of the best descriptions I've ever read on what it feels like to be ADD. His self-descriptions of how ADD affects him read very much like my own. The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of Dr. Mate's very adept description of what it's really like to have ADD.Now for the flip-side. While Dr. Mate' does give some credence to the genetics of ADD, he pretty much leaves the implications of this behind as he goes into a long description of failed or inadequate parental attachments being the primary reason for ADD symptomatology (as if the parents of ADD kids didn't feel guilty enough about passing on a genetic inheritance they most likely didn't know they had). Even if this was not the doctor's intent, it is so pervasive in this book that one cannot help but feel that if a child or an adult exhibits ADD symptoms, that there is &quot;someone&quot; to blame, not just for the genetic inheritance but for bad parenting.I cannot subscribe to Dr. Mate's theory; I had a good upbringing from two very caring parents. What I lacked, however (and this is one very glaring omission from Dr. Mate's book) was peer support. If a child's peers reject him/her consistently, it will make it much more difficult for that child to feel good about themselves in the long run. Low self-esteem seems to be a hallmark of ADD in both kids and adults, and I have a very hard time believing that it is caused solely by failed or inadequate parenting. Most school-age kids aren't around their parents all day; much of their day is spent dealing with peers. How can Dr. Mate' fail to overlook the influence that peers have on the development of a child's mind? In some cases, they have even more influence than parents.This can be easily seen in everyday events; even kids from &quot;good&quot; families can end up in trouble because of dysfunctional peer interaction and negative peer influence. Why Dr. Mate' says absolutely nothing about this possibly being a factor in the exacerbation of ADD problems is not clear to me.Another thing that bothered me about the book is his appeal to authority without citing the studies he's using to support his theories. Does Dr. Mate' believe his readers to be incapable of checking citations to the studies he's referring to, assuming they have indeed been published in peer-reviewed publications?I think that ADD is too complex a condition for anyone to say, &quot;this is the cause of it, and not that&quot;. I believe that many factors play into the causes of ADD, the first one being genetics and the second major factor, as I see it, is how Western culture and societal standards do not readily or easily accomodate a person with ADD symptomatology. I suspect that if a society were to learn to embrace and encourage those who exihibit ADD traits- and there are many good traits, indeed- we would see ADD cease to become a pathology and a problem.As long as our schools continue to encourage rote memorization and regurgitation of facts to the exclusion of imbueing our kids with real thinking skills, we'll continue to have kids dropping through the cracks, not able to reach their full learning potential. Dr. Mate' does not have much to say about the fact that our educational system in North America is woefully inadequate to deal with the problems that ADD kids often have and this is a really unforgiveable omission, in my opinion. Let's just see how much self-esteem any kid has if they go through their school career, knowing they are smart, but not being able to show it in ways that our schools reward.I would recommend skipping this book, as there are so many other books on ADD that are far more helpful in their focus on what you can do to make yours, or your ADD child's, life more manageable."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I am so glad to have read this book. Quite honestly, I can relate to a lot of the struggles that Dr. Mate' describes as being prevalent in people with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). I was often considered sensitive, socially withdrawn, and at times very \\"far away.\\" I was hard to reach in kindergarten and my teacher didn't have a name for it, then. Now, it all makes sense.What makes this book so great is that it is accessible enough for all sorts of readers - it is not just limited to therapists or scientists. The author uses examples and scenarios from real life, from case studies and also anecdotal reflections from his own experience, as someone living with ADD. The beauty of what he says is that it is not an automatic prescriptive manual illuminating the joys of Ritalin. He presents the drug as an option to provide those dealing with their symptoms a route of navigation through the fog of their struggles with concentration, social awkwardness, misunderstandings and alienation. Mate' does not claim that this is the \\"magic bullet,\\" nor do people who suffer with ADD necessarily have an E Ticket Ride out of the trauma and PTSD that may have been initial triggers for their condition. He writes that ADD is comparable to joint inflammation in arthritis sufferers. What a great analogy. I sense that when people struggle with scattered thoughts and the inability to focus equally irritating and (at times) very painful indeed.What a great book to be reading, alongside my textbooks for lifespan counseling and theory!"},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"This book is amazing... more than that, it brings hope and understanding to who I am.Dr. Mate is brilliant at explaining the causes of ADD and the symptoms or how it manifests in people's lives.

Since I'm a voracious reader, and since I've been doing this for twenty years, I sometimes feel there isn't much left for a layman to learn, or at least nothing much that could be called new. But Dr. Mate's book is wonderfully helpful on two fronts: first, it is a \\"why-you-or-your -child-are-like-this\\" book, and second, it is a \\"and-here-is-what-you-can-do-to-allieviate-the-condition\\"book. Not cure it, mind you, just make the cards you drew a little easier to play.On the first front, the neurobiology of ADD, Dr. Mate makes his point conclusively: this disorder arises first in the infant, in how he or she is wired-or not-and it occurs in the make-up of the hypersensitive baby, highly aware and from the very beginning suffering at the smallest slings and arrows life offers. Resilient children roll with the punches; ADD kids are flattened by them and get back up more slowly. Momma used to call this type \\"high-strung\\" and, boy, was she ever right. Dr. Mate even points out a study done on the vagus nerve of five-month old babies that turns out to be highly predictive of which of them will later, at fourteen months, prove to be \\"more reactive to maternal separation.\\" In other words, ADD could as well serve as an acronym for Attachment Deficit Disorder. People who are hypersensitive have a disordered attachment to their caretakers that is pre-verbal and pervasive. One had better learn to deal with the fact that the fault is mainly synpatical, not social. My family doctor told me that my then-nine-year-old son suffered from severe separation anxiety because he hadn't been in pre-school or away from his parents enough. Fortunately, a more knowledgeable child psychiatrist said it was inborn so we could relax and quit blaming ourselves. Whew....That doesn't mean that experiencing this hypersensitivity isn't damaging, even with a more-than-good-enough mother. Or that nurturing a hypersensitive child is easy. It is much more tiring and trying to deal with the ADD child than it is with his or her more resilient sibling.The ADD child triggers anxiety in even the most competent parent. So, it is on the second front, the practical things to do, that this book is most helpful, even hopeful. I return to it again and again (that is, when I haven't mislaid it in one of my more driven ADD moments) to remind myself what to do and what not to do to help myself and my similarly-wired son. For instance, the section on the counter-will-an idea I'd not heard before-made me understand why I am more often than not so suspicious of authority figures. I used to think it was very adolescent of me, and now Dr. Mate tells me it is, and that this is a component of ADD. It was from this notion of a counter-will that I began my search on ways to strengthen the will itself, so as to disengage this adversarial part of me, the counter-will, that aspect of us that doesn't trust. It has been an interesting and fruitful search and I am grateful to Dr. Mate for giving me new ways to think about this way of being in the world.By the time the ADD child arrives at school, the disconnectedness is ingrained. We are attuned to every slight, intended or not. Other kids find ADDers just as trying as the grown-ups do-it takes a lot of energy to interact with a \`wild child' who hogs the teacher's attention or a distracted one whose hypersensitivity presents the perfect opportunity to torture for fun and profit. I've yet to find an ADD adult who liked the social aspects of school, or didn't have horror stories about cruel peers and teachers...The most important chapters for me have been the ones on medication and on self-parenting. The first, medication, gives the limits of pharmocological help for this disorder. It is very clear about what medicine can and cannot do and the importance of finding a knowledgeable physician. The second, self-parenting, seems like a Mobius strip until Dr. Mate takes apart the results of life-time conditioning and explains the qualities one needs-compassion for self and others, curiosity rather than blame or judgment-in order to embark on a course of change. Whether one has to structure things by herself, or has the good fortune to find competent professional help, Dr. Mate's book is of inestimable help on that journey.In fact, every time my ADD tendencies pop up and I lose my copy of Scattered, I buy another. And now that my stepson has been diagnosed with ADD, I have an extra copy or two to give his suffering parents, though I would not be without this book.Scattered is definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I must say that my opinion regarding Dr. Mate's &quot;Scattered&quot; is... well... &quot;Scattered!&quot; On the one hand, it contains some of the most eloquently poetic descriptions of A.D.D. I've ever seen (some of which come directly from Dr. Mate's patients). One need look no further than the chapter headings to see how beautifully the ambiguity of poetry describes the A.D.D.experience- headings like &quot;So Much Soup and Garbage Can,&quot; &quot;Forgetting to Remember the Future,&quot; &quot;A Surrealistic Choreography,&quot; &quot;Severed Thoughts and Flibbertigibbets,&quot; and &quot;My Marshmallow Caught Fire.&quot; In fact, on page 43, Dr. Mate offers one of the most poignant metaphors for A.D.D. I've read, in his description of the trees on the shores of Vancouver Island. Passages like this one make &quot;Scattered&quot; a worthwhile book to own, and I've recommended it highly to several people on that basis alone. But while &quot;Scattered&quot; delivers in grand style on the promise of the first part of its title (i.e. &quot;How A.D.D. Originates&quot;), it fails to deliver consistently on the promise of its second (i.e. &quot;What You Can Do About It&quot;). This unrealized expectation is established by the last sentence of the very same page referenced above (p.43), which reads: &quot;Fortunately, as we will see when we come to the chapters on the healing process in ADD, neurological and psychological maturation can take place at any time during the life cycle, even in late adulthood.&quot; As well-established as the author's intentions are for the remainder of the book, what unfortunately follows is heavily and disproportionately weighted more towards offering specific advice to parents of A.D.D. children than towards offering practical solutions for the A.D.D. adult. In my opinion, Dr. Mate's message would have been far better-served by either: 1. Presenting the material in a more cohesive and balanced fashion or, 2. Presenting the material through two different books, each geared towards a separate audience.It's not that the information itself is uninteresting or irrelevant, but that Dr. Mate so radically changes the focus of the discussion from addressing the needs of adults in general (Chapters 1 - 15) to exclusively addressing the needs of parents of A.D.D. children in particular (Chapters 16 - 24). The experience is not unlike someone at a party (who happens to have kids) speaking to you directly and then suddenly, without warning, turning their complete attention towards starting up a fresh conversation with someone else about mutual issues involving their children. This of course leaves you standing alone with a drink in your hand, anxiously waiting for the tray of finger sandwiches to make another round, while you wait for your former conversation partner to return and resume the discussion with you.When the author does finally broaden his scope to once again include a general adult audience (Chapter 25), he does so not by fulfilling the promise of &quot;What You Can Do About It&quot; for the A.D.D. adult (as he had in the previous section for parents), but by returning yet again to descriptions regarding the origins and nature of A.D.D., thus moving the focus back onto the first portion of the title. In fact, the &quot;What You Can Do About it&quot; section for Adult A.D.D. that eventually appears is limited to a mere 23 pages (in a book containing a total of 323)! I find particularly significant that while part V is entitled &quot;The ADD Child and Healing,&quot; (indicating practical solutions for parents to healing the A.D.D. child), part VI is simply entitled &quot;The ADD Adult.&quot;Adding to the level of frustration, these long-anticipated (though brief) 23 pages of practical solutions for the A.D.D. adult are joltingly interrupted by a very short chapter describing the relationship between the A.D.D. brain and addictions, once again describing the origins of the condition rather than offering solutions to it. Again, it is not the information itself (which is all certainly valuable), but the sometimes exclusionary way in which the information is presented, that I find to be most frustrating.If you are looking for poignant and poetic descriptions of the A.D.D. experience, then I highly recommend &quot;Scattered.&quot; However, if you want a more balanced presentation of a variety of theories regarding the origins of A.D.D., as well as practical solutions geared towards the A.D.D. adult in particular, then I recommend &quot;Out of the Fog,&quot; by Kevin Murphy and Suzanne Levert as a better choice.Dr. Mate is an extremely articulate writer, and his book is a worthy addition to any library of A.D.D. material. But from the standpoint of practical solutions, &quot;Scattered&quot; loses focus mid-way through, in that it attempts to address the needs of far-too-wide of an audience, thereby not only diluting the impact of its message, but also excluding a significant portion of readers in the process."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"I applaud Gabor Mate for the remarkable contribution he has made to the literature on Attention Deficit Disorder in his book Scattered. Due to both personal and professional interest, I have read and recommended many books and articles on this topic. I find that Scattered has become the first book I recommend to colleagues, clients and anyone interested in learning about, or ruling out ADD. Feedback is consistent with my own reaction--this is a comprehensive and insightful book--an easy, informative, valuable, read for professional and lay people. The role of biology/nature is described so well that the non-scientific reader gains a new level of understanding. When it comes to the role of nurture/environment--Mate truly shines-- capturing the experience of ADD with an insiders wisdom and a refreshing openess, bringing the reader understanding, comfort, hope and pathways to healing. The material on parenting (ADD and the child) is excellent---could be part of a parenting handbook. His writing on change and growth and his understanding of what causes adults to struggle have value across the board --whatever the issues are. One does not have to have, or work with ADD to enjoy and benefit from Scattered."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Mate offers a very fresh, insightful interpretation of ADD as a cognitive vulnerability that may or may not manifest itself, or manifest itself in varying degrees depending on one's environment. In this sense, the book takes a ecological approach to the problem; ADD, according to the author, is not biological determinism and it's not cultural construct and it's not some conspiracy to keep certain children in their place and it's not a pharmaceutical ploy for more business. Anyone who has taken prescribed Ritalin knows it's about the cheapest prescription drug on the market (and has been around nearly the longest). The author simply points out that according to current and provisional informed research (and research can only be provisional unless we can stop time), the idea that symptoms of ADD are a result of many forces--chemical, environmental, cultural, and developmental--just makes sense. Since Mate's analysis is moderately complex in comparison to most analyses in most popular ADD books, it may turn off those who want a quick pat explanation to the \\"disorder.\\" The author is a doctor with ADD; so his analysis is both research oriented and phenomenological. He is also smart enough not to use the word \\"prove\\" in his book because he knows he isn't proving anything: he is simply making his own best inferences based on current knowledge. He makes sense; and he adds to the current literature on the subject. If you have been diagnosed with ADD, you will nod your head in agreement through much of the book. The author also has a gift for writing, having been a former English teacher. Thus, his language is on a level of sophistication which does justice to the subject, and lends his observations authority. This is far different from the \\"cookbook\\" breezy style of so many other authors who address the subject."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Dr. Mate, who has ADD himself and who is the father of three children with ADD, provides information about brain development and theorizes that ADD results from problems in bonding that effect brain development. He discusses addiction as related to ADD and the lack of bonding. He provides a method of treatment that addresses the underlying dynamic rather than dealing more superficially. As someone with ADD myself, experience in working with autistic and learning disabled children, and a strong interest in curative emotional relationships, I have found this book incredibly insightful and useful. It is strongly recommended to professionals as well as clients and families. It is written with respect and compassion and refrains from blaming parents for their children's difficulties."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"The ADHD world seems to have split into several definable camps -- the neo-Darwinist doomsayers like Barkley who say flat-out that ADD is &quot;of no value whatsoever&quot; and is purely a sickness; the deniers like Breggin and Rush Limbaugh who think it's a conspiracy by doctors or liberals; the geneticists like Comings who suggest ADDers shouldn't breed to keep from contaminating our gene-pool; and those like Lucy Jo Pallidino who consider it a &quot;context disorder,&quot; a collection of traits that may be useful in some times and places but is generally not a good match for the way our schools are currently set up (I consider myself in this category).Now comes Gabor Mate, an insightful, no-nonsense, and thoroughly compassionate physician who provides an overview of all these perspectives and comes to the marvelously humane conclusion that ADD/ADHD is neither nature (genetics) nor nurture (parenting/environment) but, rather, the result of the collision of a predisposing nature with an ADD-hostile life situation, family, school, or job. How refreshing!Gabor Mate has made a valuable contribution to the ADD/ADHD world, and this book not only offers thoughts on what it is and where it came from, but also is chock full of useful, real-world solutions for the problems people with ADD confront in a world increasingly run by bureaucrats and farmers.Highly recommended!--Thom Hartmann"},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Reading this book was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Another reason is formed by Mat&eacute;'s clear explanations on how to treat myself in order to make room for personal growth and development. In short: a jewel."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Five years ago, I picked up this book and, mesmerized, read it in one sitting. With content so rich and insightful, I felt perhaps I should stop and absorb each chapter before continuing. Yet Mate's elegant writing was too captivating and flowing to put down.Today, it is the book in my extensive ADHD library that I turn to when I need reminding of some core concepts, such as \\"counterwill,\\" Mate's term for oppositional defiance. So many other books about ADHD float on the surface or focus on medical treatment options. While I would be the last person to minimize the importance of medication -- I've seen in too many people medication's dramatic effects and their immense gratitude -- there is so much more to understanding ADHD.For example, here is an excerpt on Counterwill:\\"Children with attention deficit disorder are often characterized as stubborn, oppositional, cheeky, insolent, spoiled. \\"Wilful\\" is a description almost universally applied to them.... ADD children can hardly be said to have a will at all, if by that is meant a capacity which enables a person to know what he wants and to hold to that goal regardless of setbacks, difficulties, or distracting impulses....\\"...Counterwill is an automatic resistance put up by a human being with an incompletely developed sense of self, a reflexive and unthinking going against the will of the other. It is a natural but immature resistance arising from the fear of being controlled. Counterwill arises in anyone who has not yet developed a mature and conscious will of their own. Although it can remain active throughout life, normally it makes its most dramatic appearance during the toddler phase, and again in adolescence. In many people, and in the vast majority of children with ADD, it becomes entrenched as an ever-present force and may remain powerfully active well into adulthood. It immensely complicates personal relationships, school performance, and job or career success.\\"[...]Passages such as that completely unlocked the door to understanding for me. When it comes to ADHD, I've learned, what's \\"obvious\\" on the surface seldom holds water under close scrutiny. Despite having read dozens of books and articles on ADHD, I've not seen this perception on counterwill expressed and yet, from my observation, it is bedrock truth. And, it is only one of the profound concepts Dr. Mate exlains.Otherwise, I find certain assumptions on Dr. Mate's part highly disturbing. As for the nature/nurture issue, for example, we know so little about genetic expression. Last time I looked, at least 7 genes, in various combinations and subsets, are thought contributory to ADHD. Perhaps it will be 10-20 years or more before we understand this highly heritable condition. I do know many mothers of children with ADHD who say that, even in utero, the child was clearly hyperactive. Some cases are less clear-cut. There are no hard and fast answers here. And it would be turning back the clock a century to revert to \\"blaming the mother.\\"That said, recent genetic studies reinforce Dr. Mate's theories in part, showing that the presence of a \\"behavior\\"-related gene does not guarantee its expression. For example, the recently discovered \\"shyness\\" gene seems to express in children who have it only under stressful conditions. (You can read more about this in a Jan 2006 Wall Street Journal's \\"Science Journal\\" column.) The idea is not to make parents feel guilty, as some have suggested, but to expand our knowledge and help future generations of children as much as possible. For instance, the epigenetic factors are good reason to encourage parents of children with ADHD to undergo screening for ADHD themselves. Studies have shown the often deleterious effect of living with a parent's untreated ADHD.To summarize: This is an elegant, interesting read. But I would be more skeptical of Mate's outdated \\"blank slate\\" perspective. The fact is, none of us is born with a perfect body, and the body includes the brain, the most complex and highly vulnerable organ. To assume that we are born perfect, and it is life experience that causes ADHD and other brain issues....that's in the 19th Century, as far as I'm concerned. And that attitude holds people back, preventing them from benefiting from 21st Century strategies.Gina Pera, authorIs It You, Me, or Adult A.D.D.?

Dr. Mate introduces us to an eye- opening concept that the cause of ADD is that children (he explains that it's due to what is called a lack of attunement between parent and child) are often not registering and processing the love of even the most caring parents. The author does a masterful job of explaining why this is so. Suddenly, one appreciates just how much knowledge and awareness must go in to the complex job of parenting. Dr. Mate truly has a gift for sharing this information in a way that will mesmerize readers of this inspiring book. After reading Scattered, many will no doubt come to the realization that they, or someone they love, may suffer from ADD or Adult ADD. I owe Dr. Mate a debt of gratitude for clarifying why so many people are experiencing such hurt and pain. Needless to say, I recommend this book as being crucially important for anyone who has reached a point of desperation in terms of understanding the cause of their emotional problems.

Most books written by clinicians are hard to read and lack the deep understanding of the topic necessary to fully explain it in any meaningful context. Gabor Mate explains ADD from the inside out, and from first hand experience. I see now how and why I developed ADD and how so many of my recurring issues sprang from this condition. It was helpful to have someone compassionately connect dots that I did not know were linked. Being spanked as a baby, having my mother die a painful death when I was a child, not being allowed to express emotions all contributed to a dissociative condition that led to an Attention Deficit Disorder. I enjoyed his explanations that turned this diagnosis on its head, such as the \\"attention deficit\\" isn't about the person not having the ability to pay attention but that not enough focused positive attention was given to the person as a child or baby. He explains in medical terms but in terms I could recall and understand what this lack of attention does to the developing brain. It's compassionate but medically based and truly helpful.I also enjoyed his practical suggestions for helping your child with ADD, or for helping the ADD adult. I stumbled upon a way to help myself using these methods, such as sound nutrition, exercise, quiet contemplation and reconnection with nature and I very much enjoyed reading explanations as to why they worked.This book is a great guide for recovery."},{"Title":"Scattered: How Attention Deficit Disorder Originates And What You Can Do About It","review":"Scattered Minds by Dr. Gabor MareThis boo k contain more original insight into the forces at work in developing mental capacity thatn anything is the field.

I fondly remember checking it out of the school library over and over again, and being so disappointed when another kid had it out ahead of me. I was thoroughly captivated reading about Georges Melies, Lon Chaney and James Whale. I eagerly ate up the information on Willis O'Brien and stop motion photography. While I'd already seen many of the films discussed in the book, I ached to see THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, NOSFERATU and METROPOLIS. The photos transfixed me as I savored each one, burning them in my memory. My early skills as an artist were honed as I made drawing upon drawing from the black and white still images of Dracula, Frankenstein, the Wolfman and King Kong. It was a major source of inspiration.I hadn't seen TERRORS OF THE SCREEN in well over 30 years when I started reminiscing about it and wondered if I'd ever be able to track down a copy. I figured Amazon might have it and lo and behold they did! Now that I have it in my hands once again it's just like being reunited with an old friend. The book is exactly as I remembered it to be, and at 122 pages it's still one of the best overviews on cinema horror I've ever come across. Manchel writes in an expert, concise manner that informs, entertains and still manages to be insightful about our curious fascination with horror movies.Occasionally, the author makes a comment I disagree with. Regarding the 1931 DRACULA, he writes: \\"These are the period's and the film's indefensible artistic flaws.\\" Manchel also makes a glaring error in discussing 1954's CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON by stating that Ray Harryhausen's \\"technical virtuosity was evident in a number of superb touches\\", when Harryhausen wasn't even involved with the film! Despite these few instances, my sentimentality ultimately wins out and I still give the book 5 stars (gush).In the years since TERRORS OF THE SCREEN, I've gone on to read more in depth studies like CLASSICS OF THE HORROR FILM, by William K. Everson and A PICTORIAL HISTORY OF HORROR MOVIES, by Denis Gifford. These excellent sources along with FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine further broadened my knowledge of and appreciation for the films and their makers, as well as their social and cultural relevance. But I was already primed for it because of TERRORS OF THE SCREEN. I understand that it affected other film buffs of my generation in much the same way. Once we discovered it as youngsters we never forgot it. After all these years I'm happy to finally own a copy and don't have to wait for \\"that other kid\\" to return it to the library."},{"Title":"Terrors of the screen","review":"This is a relatively brief (122 page) book about terror films from the early silent days of the German expressionists through the 1960s. Frank Manchel gives us an excellent discussion of those early days with personalities like George Melies in France, the work of the Thanhouser Studios, Paul Wegener and UFA. He covers such notable films as \\"Golem\\", \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\", \\"Nosferatu\\", and \\"Metropolis\\" and provides lots of interesting background information that is not generally known.He provides profiles of actors like Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, and Bela Lagosi and covers the great classics of the 30s and the directors like James Whale, producers like Irving Thalberg, and technicians like Willis O'Brien.Mancel's coverage of the early period through the 40s is excellent, but he begins to lose focus as he covers the 50s, and becomes even more diffuse in the 60s. Perhaps the problem is that he is writing in the late 60s, and it may be too soon to really see how the later decades are developing.For my tastes the book has too few photographs, but at 122 pages, how many photographs can you have and still be true to the topic.The book is well written and the early material is excellent."},{"Title":"Beads to Buckskins, Vol. 3","review":"Kudos to Peggy Sue!

Space Opera was invented by E.E.Smith, and for years was the standard by which the genre was judged. Yes, the stuff now seems hackneyed, so what? Doc invented it, and we should respect that . He was writing when computers were unheard of, and the atomic bomb was just a possibility, later a terrifying reality. So give credit where credit is due. Every modern writer, from Heinline to David Weber does."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"Readers who have been following this series all along might note that whenever Smith is unable to properly describe something, instead of coming up with new ways to describe it, he falls back on the trick of just saying that it is impossible to describe and the regular mind cannot conceive of the visual scope of what is happening on the page. For some reason, and don't ask me why, this becomes part of the charm of the series. In a world where we're given more and more special effects, with armies of computers doing their best everyday to make every possible image come to life, it's kind of nice for someone to go \\"Here, I'm not going to help you. Use your imagination.\\"So, with that, here we are. The end. The culmination. With the previous book almost having taken us as far as the series could go, this one goes and brings it the rest of the way home. The first book detailed the conflict between the Arisians and the Eddorians, with humanity caught in the middle and the Lensmen designed as the people who would eventually allow civilization to be saved. Here we find the people who are behind the dread menace of Boskone and the ultimate destiny for the galaxy and the universe at large. Heady stuff, indeed.As the title helpfully explains, this adventure does not involve hero Kimball Kinnison so much as his kids, all five of them. Each one is advanced in their own way and with some training from the Arisians, they'll turn out to be just what the galaxy needs to take down the evildoers who have been plaguing us nonstop for five adventures now.Amazingly, the kids aren't annoying. While they are precocious, that's clear from the start and they don't have the sassy, know-it-all quality that a lot of smart SF kids have. They're confident and seem to know what they're doing but also have a good amount of doubts and actually seem to act like a family, which gives the story a nice generational feel. With dad still effective and mom no slouch herself, our heroes aren't so much sidelined as doing their best as the new generation takes over. They learn as they go and watching that process is just as much fun as seeing Kim go through it several books ago.Indeed, the novel makes sure to give him time as well, and one of the amazing things about this novel is that it doesn't seem crowded even though the cast is literally packed. You've got the five kids and their parents, plus the other Second Stage Lensmen, all characters in their own right (the bloke from Rigel, Worsel and Nadreck, who will come up with an exact mathematical equation on how to murder you) and while everyone should be jockeying for space, Smith manages to keep up the frenetic pace and yet give everyone some space to breathe. Kim even has time to don new identities and write a terrible science-fiction story.It's the climax that makes this all work. As the finale of a six book series spanning galaxies and decades (more than that, if you consider when the conflict between Arisia and Eddore started), it needs to be epic and Smith does not disappoint, dragging out every trick that served him well in the previous stories and upping the ante considerably, so that while the outcome is never in doubt, when the triumph does come, it feels utterly earned. Considering that the whole Eddore/Arisia thing wasn't even part of the original concept (by the time the series was in full swing it was but parts of \\"Triplanetary\\" were written to sort of retroactively incorporate the idea) he manages to bring it all to a satisfying conclusion, taking the fight to Eddore itself (as it eventually had to be) and achieving the feat of turning five characters who we've only known for three hundred pages into old friends, so that when they enter into their final evolution, it feels like an ending, or at least as far as we can travel with the story. More will happen, we just won't need to see it. The time belongs to others, and we can retire with Kinnison and Clarissa, content that peace and goodwill have been preserved.It's not for nothing that this series has been voted one of the greatest space operas of all time. In terms of sheer scope and characters it remains one of the most fun experiences that one can have, with careening planets and stalwart clever heroes and base evil that can sink to the darkest depths (or at least as far as the 1940s could conceive), a battle that feels like a struggle for the survival of civilization itself. Is it old-fashioned and a tad hokey in parts? Sure, but what wouldn't feel that way from this point in time. The final determination is if the story holds up and in that sense it can stand alongside any modern day space epic, in terms of sheer verve and pluck and invention. There's a definite arc and when you're finished, an even more definite sense that a journey has been completed. The epilogue leaves room for more adventures but we don't need a sequel. Out of breath and with senses overwhelmed, we can stop here and rest, finally."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"The Children of the Lens are the culmination of the Arisian breeding program, and are to be their weapons in the final assault on Eddore.Kimball Kinnison and Clarissa MacDougall have had four children. Born with the abilities Kim possesses, these kids will become the 'third stage' with an ability to join their minds in an all-powerful gestalt.They are talented enough that they can shadow the Second Stage Lensmen without them knowing, and help them out. Each of the four has a favorite among the Second Stage Lensmen, even if they won't admit it.This book has a different feel, in that it is a tiny bit focused on family, and the mental war part of it means the insane space battles are a much smaller part of the whole thing.The end is the final battle between the Arisians and the Eddorians, with the third-stage Kinnison gestalt as an important part of the assault.Afterwards, what the Arisians tells the Children comes as a bit of a surprise."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"I fell this book was rushed. after devoting three books to the devolpment of one 2nd stage lensman, e.e. smith devolpes 5 in just one volume. too many loose ends. gray lensman was the best of the series"},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"This is the best of the Lensman series and I have read it so many times for pure enjoyment and imagination that I can almost recite it from memory.

A great read for all"},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"Having started the six book series with Triplanetary and ending here, I thought the series started to trail off after Galactic Patrol. Triplanetary has been heavily criticized as giving away too much of the series and of the pro- and antagonists too soon. However when the Eddorians are finally confronted here I didn't feel as much as a build up to their powers as Triplanetary instilled. In Triplanetary you really felt that the Eddorians were almost omnipotent beings and the task before the Arisians in seeding planets, including Earth, preparing for the eventual confrontation to save Civilization. Galactic Patrol really carried on the beginning of the series with Kimball Kinnison, but I thought the quality dwindled starting with Gray Lensman and the dated 50's slang really picked up then. It's not just because it's written in the 50's, I've recently read several works by Alfred Bester, Arthur C. Clarke, and others written in the 50's and they have no where near this level of 50's slang.Another thing I started to find unappealing is Smith's heavy regard for the \`wide girth' of Kinnison and of his space-ax swinging cohorts. In reality, strong ambition comes often from those that have not been so physically gifted in life and so have to fight their entire lives against people's initial reactions to their appearance. Lois McMaster Bujold's Mountains of Mourning of a diminutive protagonist's personal battle against his grandfather's attitude, and possible disgust, of his physical stature comes to mind. So it is with irony that I can picture some skinny kid sitting outside in the 50's reading this book and \`barrel-shaped chests\\" as the big neighbor kids come up to him and say \`hey poindexter, whatcha reading...' or something.However, the originality, and impact this series had upon science fiction cannot be understated and is why I am giving it a respectable four stars. Several reviewers have mentioned that they can see scenes from Star Wars lifted from this series. What I see even more so is what Star Trek lifted from this series. Even down to small details such as a ship having to lower shields in order to fire a weapon against an enemy. And many other movies, tv shows, and books influenced comes to mind including Alien, The 5th Element, Heinlein, certainly the original Star Trek as well as the Next Generation and DeepSpace 9, Wing Commander and others.255 Pages, Publ 1954."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"This book introduces the five children (Kit Kinnison and his sisters) who will lead the final battle against the evil Eddorians. As always, E.E. Smith's dialog is dated, (when was the last time you did a flit?) but that only adds to the charm of the story. It seems in his time, there were only men and girls, and everyone smoked cigarettes.This story is the slam-bang conclusion of the series in which ever greater powers of good and evil are called into action. My only criticism is that in this book Kimball Kinnison's time is past, and he remains on center stage too long. Once the most powerful man in Civilization, even he is no match for an Eddorian. In the previous two books, his adventures were the deeds of a superhuman second-stage Lensman. But now he seems almost irrelevant, as his far more powerful kids have to protect him. The attitude is, well, we'd better keep an eye on Dad - he's too feeble-minded to know we're actually fighting Eddore.A priceless scene occurs when Clarissa Kinnison introduces one of her daughters to the evil matriarch of Lyrane II. The villainess thinks as she attacks, &quot;Ah, the daughter is younger and less experienced. She will be easy prey.&quot; Oops!The last fifty pages are worth rereading over and over, as the combined forces of good slug it out with the last bastion of evil in the galaxy. It is the climax of six novels, and it does not disappoint. Enjoy the slang and the hokey dialog, as most modern writers don't have the jets to swing this load."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"Here it is. Accept no substitutes. _Children of the Lens_ (_Astounding_, 1947-48; 1954) is the final volumn in E.E. Smith's Lensman sequence. It brings the conflict between the heroic Space Patrol members and the cold and villainous Boskonians to a dramatic conclusion, with the entire galaxy at stake. And I'll be damned if there isn't a bit of humor along the way.Early in the novel, there is a chapter entitled \\"Kinnison Writes a Space Opera\\". Kimball Kinnison poses as a popular writer named Sybly White for a period of time and writes a novel to stay in character. Here is a sampling of his work:Qadgop the Mercotan slithered flatly around the afterbulge of the tranship. One claw dug into the meters-thick armor of pure neutronium, then another. Its terrible xmexlike snout locked on. Its zymolosely polydactile tongue crunched out, crashed down, rasped across. _Slurp! Slurp!_ At each abrasive stroke the groove in the tranship's plating deepened and Qaggop leered more fiercely. Fools! Did they think that the airlessness of absolute space, the heatlessness of absolute zero, the yieldlessness of absolute neutronium could stop QADGOP THE MERCOTAN? (39)Wilson Tucker coined the term \\"space opera\\" in 1941 to describe a type of hackneyed and cliched science fiction. When Doc Smith began writing the Lensman sequence in the late 1930s, the term was unknown. Less than ten years later, Smith was able to guy his own traditions and style of writing using Tucker's term.But in spite of this self-parody, we properly think of Smith as the Big Daddy of classical space opera, which developed between roughly 1925 and 1950. Aside from Smith, the four big practitioners of classical space opera were John W. Campbell, Jr., Edmond Hamilton, Jack Williamson, and Ray Cummings. There were others who practiced it on a now-and-again basis: Manly Wade Wellman, Clifford D. Simak, Murray Leinster, and Frank Belknap Long. These writers did not describe the conventions of space opera; they invented them.Practitioners of grand, or classical, space opera frequently took their writing seriously. Doc Smith certainly did. He was not concerned with making a quick sale, collecting a check, and moving on to the next story. He wanted to write science fiction that would last for a long period of time. He wrote slowly and revised frequently. His science fiction was for the most part \\"played straight\\" or told with a poker face. We do Smith a disservice if we think of him as a hack.Gary Westfahl (1994) notes that for a time, in the 1930s, E.E. Smith was considered the model of what a science fiction writer should be. By the late 1940s, however, there were a great many writers in the field who were writing science fiction that was more sophisticated, profound, and literate than Smith's best. Westfahl notes that at this time, readers were more aware of the juvenile, action-oriented nature of his novels. (_Children_ received only a lukewarm reception when it was serialized in _Astounding_.) By the 1950s, Smith was perceived by many to be a back number who was unable to write modern fare.But we seem to have strayed from the story. Who are the children of the lens? On one level, they are the five children of Kimball and Clarissa Kinnison (characters modeled after Smith's own children), who have even more powers than their parents. On another level, the children are the various races of the galaxy that have been guided by the Mentor towards maturity. This is all part of Smith's hierarchical universe in which knowledge and power increase, and it is passable fun. But it becomes a little too easy to escape from cliffhanging predicaments when you have super powers or when you can be rescued by one of the kids. _Galactic Patrol_ (1950) was a bit more fun for me.We are told that the novel that Kinnison writes \\"was later acclaimed as one of Sybly White's best\\" (39). After his death in 1965, it seems as if Smith's works are being continuously reprinted-- to considerable popular acclaim. Perhaps he had the last laugh after all."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"I first read this series in the 1970's, and repurchased them in the 1980's. The Science Fiction Book Club just released the whole series in a two volume set. However you can get a hold of these, get them. They are a great read. John W.

The initial work in this sequence isTriplanetary.In the previous volume, Gharlane attacked Kim and found an equal match. The Boskonians fought desperately against the GP grand fleet. Kim and Chris finally took time to be married.In this novel, Kimball Kinnison is a descendant of Rod Kinnison. Kim is an Unattached Second Stage Lensman. Now he is Galactic Coordinator for Civilization.Clarrissa MacDougall is a descendant of Vergil Samms. She had been a Galactic Patrol nurse and is still the Red Lensman. Chris is also Kim's wife and mother of his children.Christopher K. Kinnison is the only son of Kim and Chris. Kit and his younger sisters have grown up with Second Stage Lensmen and have developed very powerful minds.Kathryn and Karen Kinnison are the elder twin daughters of Kim and Chris. Kat is a few minutes older than Kay. Kat is the nominal leader of the girls, but only because they let her.Camilla and Constance Kinnison are the younger twin daughters of Kim and Chris. Con is a few minutes younger than Cam and both are a year younger than their elder sisters.Worsel is a second stage Lensman from Velantia. He looks like a dragon with too many arms and teeth.Tregonsee is a second stage Lensman from Rigel IV. He looks like a leather oil drum with tentacles.Nadreck is a second stage Lensman from Palain VII. He extends into the fourth dimension and seemingly changes shape.In this story, twenty-odd years later, Kim is thinking. He has had his shields up for two solid weeks. Chris finally confronts him about it.Strange things have been happening all over Civilization, inexplicable things with no apparent reason. Kim has sent lensmen to investigate, but none have been successful. Even the Second Stage Lensmen have failed to uncover the basic problem.For many reasons, Kim has decided to send out Kit to investigate the situation. At first Chris is shocked, but she understands Lensman's load. She accepts the risk to her son and volunteers to help him.Chris believes the room to be shielded even from the girls, but her daughters are hearing everything. Like their brother, they are all Third Stage and can generate their own Lens as needed. So they decide to help Kit by assisting the four Second Stage Lensmen.The young ladies argue briefly over who will go with whom, but Kat presents an indisputable argument. Con has always admired and respected Worsel and so will tag along with him. Cam has a similar attachment to Tregonsee and will follow him in his investigations. Kay feels the same about Nadreck and will shadow him. So Kat is left as her father's helper.The family is going back to Tellus for the graduation of Kit from Wentworth Hall. He graduates as first in his class. Afterward, Kit reports to his father's office, where he receives his grays. Kim briefly explains the situation and gives Kit a tape with all the details.Then Kim tells him that the Second Stage Lensmen are resigning their current jobs and joining the search. After a short, but joyous, party with the girls, both gray lensmen take off in black speedsters.This tale takes the Second Stage Lensmen -- and their young shadows -- into the machinations of Boskone. Each uses their own style of inquiry and they share information among themselves. Kit has a moment of sibling rivalry, but Mentor straightens him out.This is the last volume in the series.Masters of the Vortexis set in the same universe.

However, we do get a little bit different look at what a lensman is.Once more, please note that the customs, attitudes, and language come from a time when radio and printed newspapers were our mass media. They will seem dated. Please ignore that. Focus on the story. This is the last installment of what may have been the best space opera of the time.We are introduced to Kimball Kinnison's children. They are better lens-people than their parents. We, also, are introduced to the notion that the job that seemed finished really needs more work. Here, battles and gore no longer have the main role. The battle may be intense, but it is somewhat more subtle. Just when we think we are at an obvious ending, Smith throws a curve-ball. The plot twist will churn your tummy. Then, well, you will see.I enjoyed this book. I think you will, too."},{"Title":"Children of the lens (The Lensman series)","review":"Well, they're always pretty triumphant, it's kind of a habit with them, but even more so this time. The previous volume ended with the Kinnisons, Kim and Clarissa, finally finding their wedded bliss. Fast-forward twenty years, to see Kinnison Jr. graduating from the academy with highest honors. His four sisters would probably have been right behind him (the proper place for a woman in this chivalrous world), except that the academy appeared to have met its quota for female applicants: zero. No matter, they're home-schooled by the finest minds in two galaxies, on top of a genetic heritage refined over endless millenia, so they have no reason to be sheepish about lack of the sheepskin.So, they're off. As has been true throughout this series, escalation is the word of the day. Bad guys are badder, weapons more fearsome, and good guys (the five kids, mostly) more brilliantly powerful than ever. And, in a remarkable closing passage, Clarissa (the only female Lensman ever) drives an incredibly womanly search for Her Man, lost through treachery among endless universes.It's big, bold, and utterly implausible. The 1950s origin of this series lay decades closer to Buster Crabbe'sBuck Rogersthan to the current day, and it shows in every way. The spaceship-and-slipstick technology echoes its social values: primitive by today's standards, but a cheerful reminder of the era before irony.

It certainly had some nice insights, but I felt like they were thrown together in no particular order. The \\"try this\\" suggestions are especially annoying and usually nothing I would actually try. Example: when someone asks you \\"how's your love life\\" say \\"love surrounds me, life is full\\". I find this kind of advice rather empty- they generally tell you what to do or say without asking you to explore or learn about yourself. (E.g. take yourself to the symphony, make a collage, tell yourself \\"i'm going to make it on my own\\" etc). Also, a lot of it is written with the assumption that your experience is similar to the author's, for example a number of sections are about being a single parent.I will admit though that part of my problem with this book is that I am not really interested in celebrating being single or accepting it as a long-term state. For me, getting used to being single is something I've already done a lot of, my hope for the book was to understand more about why I'm single and how to accept it, but of course with the hope that being a happy fulfilled single makes me more likely to find a good relationship, and not get my heart broken so easily by failed dating experiences... but this is backwards logic! I hoped from the reviews that this book would do more to address the complex issues associated with being single, including how to change it if that's not what you ultimately want, but it doesn't really go there, it's much more about accepting being single when you have no control over it (which definitley happens, through death, divorce, etc, that's just not my situation).On the recommendation of a friend, I ordered \\"keeping the love you find\\" by Harville Hendrix and so far it is speaking to me much more than \\"single\\" did, because it is really focused on finding love, written for singles- so many relationship self-help books are aimed at couples, I didn't know where to look as a single person, which is how I ended up ordering \\"single\\", but like I said, it wasn't really the book I was hoping for. So if you're looking for an abundance of friendly advice and anecdotes in no particular order that may or may not pertain to you, this would be an enjoyable book for you, but if you're more interested in a book about how to change the patterns that keep you single when you don't want to be, \\"keeping the love you find\\" is probably closer to what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I had an open mind about this book.

For instance, she tells the story of how she was dreading to go to the theater alone on a Saturday night after her husband had passed away. She describes that she felt miserable, and like everyone was probably looking at her and feeling sorry, pity for or even disdain from her. Instead of explaining how she mustered the courage to stand, alone, in line for a ticket, she's abysmally mortified by how daunting the situation is, and instead of buying herself a popcorn and a soda, she buys herself 2 popcorns and 2 sodas, thereby \\"tricking\\" the popcorn lady and solving the situation (at least so it seems, since the author then concludes that \\"it's not so bad to go to the theater alone\\"). Is this the kind of advice that will get you signing up to singleness? So every time I encounter an awkward situation I need to go out of my means to assure the environment there's nothing wrong with me?I know this was a bit long but that really stuck out to me and I felt like the author wasn't really being sincere with her advice. I mean, if she can't be truly happy being single, and it's all a sham, why would I take her word for how ostensibly great it is?The book is also a bit cheesy and sophomoric in its \\"tips\\". One of her regulars in every chapter is \\"spread your arms to the heavens and shout \\"YES!\\"\\". Seriously?Maybe I'm just not the one to particularly respond to this kind of literature.

The book starts out very well, but it just goes downhill from there."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I was looking for the perfect book as a gift to my sister, when Judy Ford's book, \\"Single\\" caught my eye.In the past I have attended one of Judy Ford's workshops, and I have also read several of her other books, all which have been positive experiences. As I read through the comments and scanned the chapters, I knew instantly this was it.When I got home I intended to wrap it up, but I opened it again and soon realized that I was caught up in reading the book myself.I love this book!The author's approach to the condition of being single is refreshing, and she keeps it honest. It defines why it is so important to cast aside the tired and outdated stereotype of what being single means. There is something for everyone here, and this book recognizes that we are all individuals who approach the world differently. Judy Ford's book encourages singles to embrace the person they are, living life to the fullest.I especially like the way this book provides specific exercises that help realize self confidence and personal awareness. This is all done in a warm humorous manner that makes this book useful, informative and fun to read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I do not know what I expectd when I bought this book, but what I got was much more than I thought it would be. This is not an easy book for me to read, but it is illuminating. I have been divorced for three years and while reading this book, I realized that without intending to I have put my life on hold. I've been waiting for the right someone to come along so that I can start enjoying my life again. This is not a good way to live. This book has gently shocked me into facing the reality that right now I am single. I have felt sad and ashamed about my situation, but after reading the author's story, I felt proud of her and of all single men and women who refuse to settle for less and have figured out how to be satisifed, fulfilled,and independent. I want to be one of those too. The author's funny and wise words have inspired me. The tips at the end of the each section are genius."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I feel very lucky to have discovered this gem. Most books on the subject either treat the single life as though it is one big, never-ending, carefree party OR they treat being single as though it is a terrible sickness needing to be cured giving advice only about how to find a mate as opposed to talking about how to be satisfied in life regardless of your relationship status. What Judy Ford does so brilliantly in this book is help comfort that lonely feeling that resides within all of us. Becuase the truth is that even within the most fulfilling relationships, all of us have moments when we feel terribly alone, longing for something more. Judy Ford helps to make sense of that feeling, to be comfortable with it instead of fear it.This is not your typical self-help book. Single is miraculously funny and deep at the same time. Parts will make you laugh out loud! It is valuable read for anyone who wants to create a truly fulfilling life for herself (or for himself too, of course!)."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I recently ended a eight year relationship and was feeling lost as to how to build a life as a single again. This book not only gave me some practical ideas to get me started, but more than that, it infused me with excitement.

I have never felt \\"bad\\" about being single and enjoy my freedom to pursue life, love, and happiness all on my own. I agree wholeheartedly with Judy Ford's proclamation that the \\"best revenge is a good life.\\" It always bugged me that \\"Sex and the City\\" had to pair all four girls up at the end of the series. Maybe if the had read \\"Single\\" they would have honored single women everywhere instead!"},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"Whether you are single or not I think this is an amazing book to read. It teaches you to love single life by learning to love yourself. I have always had problems with self confidence and I always blamed it on others. This book taught me not only that I don't need another person to make my life full, but that I will always have me, so I should love me.At first I thought it was silly. It was just stories of other people situations and then steps for you to take that week. But without even realizing it, it changed my perspective completely."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I was given this book title as a suggested read for every girl.

I recommend the book, but a little more time and care should have been taken with developing the ideas and giving the chapters better structure. Reading this book is akin to sitting with a chatterbox who is talking \\"at you\\" rather than \\"to you\\" -- it's a book which doesn't draw breath itself, let alone let you catch yours."},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"I am not a single.

I don't believe and I don't feel that a man can make me feel happy if I cannot make myself happy. I ordered this book right before I met him, but I just started to read it now because I felt bored lately. This book helped me overcome a lot of fears I had and I am still having. I mean it is so important for you to overcome those fears that hold your back and that stop you from becoming the best you can. After dealing with your emotions well, everything will become so easy!!!!"},{"Title":"Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled and Independent","review":"Judy Ford reminds us that being single doesn't mean you are a loser, that it's not a fatal condition, that loneliness isn't tragic or bad, and that going to dinner alone means you are hungry not that you're a reject. Dozens of platitudes form the essence of this book. Platitudes aren't bad things. Perhaps on a bad night when your bed is big and lonely, they will help you get through the night."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I teach a preschool class with 3-5 year olds. After reading \\"Leaf Man\\" we went on a nature walk and looked for \\"Leaf Man\\" and gathered leaves together.

The kids thoroughly enjoyed \\"Leaf Man\\" and ask me to read it often."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"One of Lois Ehlert's best. I bought it for my mother-in-law who is a gardener and general nature-lover. But I use it to teach about leaves and using your imagination in my preschool art classes.

Lovely leaf pictures that tell a story. This is a second book just in case the first one gets lost."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I look for this book every fall. I teach 1st grade and this book is always a favorite read aloud. Now I have my own!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"So creative and well-done visually plus simple story. Kids can create their own Leaf Man pictures in the fall after reading."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This book is beautiful! It is one of the nicest children's books I've seen. The colors are magnificent and just like real leaves. The story invites children to see Leaf Man, and other characters, in the same way they look for shapes in clouds. There is appeal to older children who are early readers and who want to learn to identify leaves and trees.My four year-old granddaughter loves this book and we've read it and read it. You will have to allow lots of time for gathering leaves and taking long walks searching for them, but what better way to spend time together. Highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"The visual composition is wonderful. The issue is that the text is not very good at all. So many possibilities and so few of them realized.

It was perfect for the fall season and the teachers were able to incorporate into their studies."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Seems like it would be a nice fall book. As a general rule we like this authors books (eating the alphabet was our favorite) as she does have wonderful artwork. As other reviewers had stated, using the book then finding your own \\"leaf man\\" in the yard would be a lot of fun. On its own, this book was a little challenging for our toddler. The pictures shown are a little more advanced and require concentration to find the birds, trees and other things the leaf man saw as he blew by. By next fall we will probably give this book a try again.... from the library!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Leaf Man by Lois Ehlert is a beautiful book. It's illustrations are colorful and true-to-life. This makes an excellent choice for art teachers, classroom teachers teaching science and fall units. This makes a wonderful addition to our school library."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I bought this book to use in my classroom. I love this book , it has fun pictures in it. After reading this book to my class I have them create leaf animals of their own. Would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I teach a special education class of PK - 4 grade students. This book was a wonderful tool to connect the season with reading. We went on a leaf walk and collected leaves and then we made leaf people. These pictures were proudly displayed in our hallway. The illustrations are great and the story is wonderful. It reminds me of when I was much younger and my sister and I would look at clouds to see what shapes and figures we saw."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"The book was as described. Great condition and was shipped super fast! Great seller!!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This is a WONDERFUL book! We read it to our class of 3-year-old preschoolers, and they were absolutely captivated. They were so quiet and engaged that they forgot to ask when we were leaving to go on our field trip.As an added plus, we had one little girl who liked it so much that she had her mom go to the library to check it out to read at home. The child then sat down to re-create the pictures on each page using leaves she picked up in her yard. You know it is a good book if it encourages that degree of creativity and industry in a 3-year-old!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Like Leaf Man I was blown away, but not by the wind, by this beautiful book. It's a pleassure to read, children love to find the animals quickly getting the hang of seeing them in the leaf shapes. Engineering-wise this book is a marvel with hills and mountains made by the cut edges of the pages. The author is so inventive and I liked her note at the end."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Sparse but evocative text provides the perfect complement to the gorgeous leaf pictures. Truly a delight for the eyes."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Great Fall book. Illustrations are beautiful, typical of Lois Ehlert books!Kids love the different creatures formed by leaves in this book. It's a wonderful book to use as a literary base for writing and fall art projects."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"My two little readers absolutely delight in this book. They love the language; they enjoy following the leaf man on his autumn journey; and they very much love to read it aloud to any adult who will sit with them for 10 minutes."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This book is getting good reviews for good reason. Lois Ehlert uses images of actual autumn leaves to tell a simple story. And yet, it's not that simple. In each colorful double-page spread, the leaves are arranged in order to form figures: a man, barnyard animals, farm crops, etc., whatever supports the text. As we advance through the story, we realize something different about the book. The top edges of the pages aren't cut straight; they swoop to become horizon lines that change with each page turn, simulating the colorful rolling hills of autumn. What a wonderful surprise! Who would have thought of that technique? It's perfect for the story. The leaves are close at hand, and yet your eye catches the distant landscape, just as it might in real life.What I like most about this book is that it is educational in a subtle way. It doesn't scream, \\"Here are leaf projects for you to try!\\" It merely tells a story using leaves, and lets the readers become inspired to gather up and create leaf creatures of their own. In other words, teaching and leading by example. On the end-sheet of the front and back covers, sample leaves are each identified by tree name -- again, with subtlety. If you want to know the names of the trees they came from, fine, there they are. If you are too young (or too old!) to care, then the words do not intrude on your view of the leaves or the enjoyment of the book. I can see that reading this book to a group of observant youngsters would take quite a while. There's so much to see, and you might not catch it all the first time through. \\"Leaf Man\\" requires multiple readings.This is a beautiful, educational picture book that will appeal to all ages. It should be mandatory for nature center libraries and elementary school libraries."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Wow, lots of people apparently like this book, but I can only judge by the reactions of my children to the book, and they didn't really like it that much. Certainly not as much as some of Ms. Ehlert's other works like \\"Snowballs\\" and \\"Growing Vegetable Soup\\".I think the principal reason they didn't go bonkers over \\"Leaf Man\\" is that there really wasn't much of story. Leaf Man (or Leaf Guy as we call him) blew around a lot, but it wasn't as if he had any opinion about the process or that there was any drama.Three Stars. The artwork was good and, as always, very creative-- the source of much discussion and our own art project-- but when you get down to it, Leaf Man just blew around. Worth checking out at the library."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"My husband bought this for our two-year old, and we love reading it together with her. The text is simple, as it traces the journey of Leaf Man...the leaves used are magnificent in their colors...some bold, some subdued, but all unique and beautiful. I have since done some basic art projects with my daughter using this book as inspiration. We collect leaves wherever we go and hope to create a little book of our own!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I borrowed this book from my local public library to read to my 2.5 year old granddaughter. She was so taken by the story we were out looking for \\"leaf man\\" as soon as I finished the story. We found Leaf Man, the ducks, fish and butterflies. We also found Pumpkin man, Horsey and goosey. In short, this story brought out the creative juices in my granddaughter and we had fun patrolling the local area for leaves, nuts, berries and other goodies dropped from our neighborhood trees. We glued them down on card stock and gave them away as gifts.Get this book, get on your scarves, jackets and boots. Take your grand kids or your kids and get outside. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"My five year old and I really enjoy this book. My son enjoys looking for the pictures the leaves make and I enjoy the fact that the author collected these beautiful leaves, made images out of them and wrote a story around them! Colorful, imaginative, fun to read."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I checked out this book at my school library yesterday. It was a really beautiful book! Even though I'm eleven years old, I loved it. The illustrations are cleverly created from real photocopies of leaves, and some of the pictures look so real that from far away, they simply look like photos. There are just enough words for perhaps a 4-5 year old to read.The story tells of the travels of Leaf Man, blowing over fields and animals and trees.I really think that the pictures are the main part of the book.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"I was totally impressed by the illustrations of this book and the use of real, fall leaves to create the pictures. Like Jack in JACK, THE STORY OF A LEAF, the story of Leaf Man tells of the adventure of leaves being blown about in autumn. The art work makes this especially beguiling and inspires you to head outside to look for leaves to create your own creatures and scenes."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Leaf Man had great illustrations in it. Each page was covered with colorful leaves all over the place. Throughout the story, Ehlert mentions different animals, and on the page is that animal made out of leaves. If reading this to a young child, they would love seeing how the leaves form into animals. The story is very cute as well. I think this would be best for pre-k."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Shows what leaves come from what trees in the beginning and end of the book, clever animal shapes made with leaves & differently shaped tops of pages adds another dimension. Very fun, pretty & educational!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"Ms. Ehlerts childrens books are beautifully written and illustrated; Leaf Man is no exception. The textbis simple yet engaging, and the artwork of leaf collages is beautifully executed. I bought this book after seeing it on an art teachers blog as a resource for a project, and ran to get the book myself. Ms. Ehlerts books never fail to delight."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This is one of those books that is absolutely made for the parent or teacher to read with the child, talk and listen. Each photograph is an absolute work of art. Not only do you get to expose the child to some wonderful art work, but also this book is an ideal set up for a nature study. It actually gives the adult, who hopefully has done their own homework, to interact with the child and add thier (adult and child) own thoughts. The story is not much, but this is one of those works where the story, if more detailed, would just get in the way. I liked the concept of this work. This is a good one to work with the child in the fall. After reading and discussing the book, a walk in the woods, yard, park or what ever, can bring out quite a lot of insight from the child...they can relate. Recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated using photography of real leaves. It is an excellent addition to any teacher's autumn lessons. I have personally used this book in the classroom with young children, and they adore it!"},{"Title":"Leaf Man","review":"This book is gorgeous. Very simple. Good for 2-3 year old."},{"Title":"The feast day,","review":"We read this book to go with our Medieval history reading of the period. This is a nice book about Joan's childhood. The afterward contains some of the details of poor Joan's adult life. This would be good reading for a 4th or 5th grader. I thought it was not challenging enough for my 6th grader, but it was still a nice story. You will get the beginning glimmers of how Joan might have first realized or learned she was chosen for God's mission."},{"Title":"King Kong Journal","review":"OK.....I write this with my dunce cap cemented firmly to my head. I'd ordered this thinking it was some kind of \\"Journal\\", as in a documentation journal OF THE MOVIE KIND detailing the film, considering it *IS* listed as the KING KONG JOURNAL, in the book section. Well, dear folks, it *is* a journal with King Kong's picture on the cover and the rest of the pages are for your own thoughts & words etc etc. Get it? I didn't. That plane flew right past my head.If you're looking for a movie book, I recommend SPAWN OF SKULL ISLAND, since this ain't what it seems. If you want a cool, rather small, blank journal for your own observations, this might work. And though I'm a little disappointed, I'm going to use this as a take-along sketch diary since the lines are a faint white over cream colored pages. It's really not bad if you are looking for a journal. I just wish it were a little more clearly stated as such and not jumbled in with the real books, which accounts for the weird rating I'd given."},{"Title":"King Kong Journal","review":"This is the journal that got me hooked on quality. Wine-colored cover with small 'Turner Movie Classics: King Kong' poster reproduction. Endpapers are pale navy blue, with a band of tiny diamonds. Pages are creamy, with white lines. Holds up beautifully to any kind of quality pen. Library guards will mistake it for a library book, and other people in coffeehouses will drool with envy.As an art history student, I found it useful both for notes and sketches (the lines are very discrete), and have filled three so far."},{"Title":"Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering (7th Edition)","review":"This was the book that got me started in Chemical Engineering. Nowadays, I solve a problem every few years and need a refresher. The first chapter starts out with details on units and basic concepts. The next chapter evolves into more and more complicated material balances. The following chapters discuss concepts such as adiabatic flame temperature, Clausius-Clapeyron's equation (vapor pressure relates to heat of vaporization), average heat capacity and enthalpy of flue gases, psychrometry (water-air only), etc.. In the final section, the complexity of combined heat and material balances is addressed.In all, this is an excellent book for an introduction to Chemical Engineering or, as I use it now, as a great reference. I've had to retire my first copy and am using a new version. One bit of advice: get good copies of large and small psychrometry charts: 10-110 F dry bulb (small chart); 10-260+ (large chart).Put these in an envelope in the flap of the book for quick access.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"Title":"Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering (7th Edition)","review":"This book is an excellent reference on Chemical Engineering Principles and Calculations for any engineer or practitioner working in the process industries.

As a result I have been involved with Chemical Engineering issues in a day to day basic.I have found this book to be an ideal self-study guide. In this Edition the authors have included several categories of problems sets to assist in self-study. Self-assessment tests with answers (in Appendix A) follow each section, and thought and discussion problems follow the self-assessment tests.If a non Chemical Engineer can learn Chemical Engineering Principles from this book, I guarantee that any Chemical Engineering student or practitioner will find this readable textbook very useful."},{"Title":"Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering (7th Edition)","review":"This book is a classic .

This book will do a pretty good job of doing that from his early days up until 1993."},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"Not only is it a collection of Shakespeare's best tragedies,it is a library of information about each of the four tragediespresented here.

This book is great for the college student who needsit for a class as well as the working adult who wants a greatstory to read. I highly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"HamletThis play, of course, is perhaps the best known in all of English literature. Taking it's inspiration from lesser plays and tales of the same name, Shakespeare crafted the characters, dialogue and plot into a timeless tale of betrayal, the quest for justice, and ultimately a hollow victory. This play, in short, is a downer.I will speak daggers to her, but use none.Of course, it really thrilled the audiences, who, lacking the primetime violence of today, enjoyed seeing the blood, the gore, the violence, the swordplay. Those with a more subtle bent were very satisfied with the wonderful dialogues, full of double and self-reflexive meanings. So many of the monologues have become common parlance in our language.A hit, a very palpable hit.The 'on one foot' synopsis: Hamlet, prince of Denmark, is suspicious that his step-father killed his father and usurped the throne and his mother's bedchamber; he plots to get revenge; in the meantime his love-interest Ophelia dies; in a duel to the death at the end the mother dies, the step-father dies, the duel contender dies, and Hamlet dies. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.The rest is silence.OthelloRude I am in speech,And little blessed with the soft phrase of peaceSurely Shakespeare was not speaking of himself here. Even his poorly-spoken characters cannot help to have an elegance and subtlety all their own. Othello is another tragedy, this one driven by jealousy. The exact cause of the jealousy can vary; Iago can be jealous of Othello, of his love for Desdemona, of Desdemona herself, or several other possibilities. The emphasis often lies in the performance, and Shakespeare's play is written broadly enough to allow for any of these to be correct interpretations.But men are men; the best sometimes forget.Othello satisfied the need for violence, for passion, and for intrigue. 'On one foot', Iago, servant and friend of Othello, who also hates Othello, plants the seeds of suspicion that Desdemona has been unfaithful, leading Othello down a treacherous path that leads in his ultimate murder of Desdemona.Take note, take note, O world!To be direct and honest is not safe.During one performance in the American Old West, an audience member became so entranced and enraged with the actor's portrayal of Iago that he took out his pistol and shot him. The tombstone of the actor reads 'Here lies the greatest actor'.LearThe prince of darkness is a gentleman.This most difficult of Shakespeare plays, both for performing and for studying, is one of the true masterpieces of English (or any) literature, and yet is underperformed and underappreciated due to the power of its complexity and of its tragedy. Indeed, often the tragedy at the end has been softened by having Cordelia survive victorious. Beware these kinds of performances--they not Shakespeare's intent, however much we wish.Lear begins with folly, and ends in tragedy, while treachery and evil seems to creep like a vine choking off first this person, then that. The fool is the only wise one; the insane are the only protected, and the nobles increasingly lose nobility of intent and action as the events progress. Gloucester and Lear are both deceived by wicked children turned against their better offspring; all ends in tragedy for most of the lot.Lear addresses sibling rivalries, parent/child relationships, poverty and insanity, and any number of other readily accessible issues, but all interwoven so tightly that they cannot be unravelled easily, yet all the while the world for the characters are unravelling thread by thread before our very eyes. Lear points out the folly of human planning and agency. Lear was banned from performance, actually, during 1788-1820 when George III was considered insane, and the connexion between stage and royalty would be too blurred for official comfort.Howl, howl, howl, howl! O! you are men of stones!MacbethThe witches, the blood-stained hands, the play whose name must not be mentioned in a theatre lest bad luck befall the actor or production. Macbeth is all of these, and more. Loosely based upon a real historical character, the tragedy here is one of ambition.Fair is foul, and foul is fair:Hover through the fog and filthy airDid Macbeth really see the ghost of Banquo at the banquet, or was it indigestion because of the haggis? Macbeth can be played with or without a conscience, which makes for differing character development, but both options are available in Shakespeare's flexible playwriting.Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knellThat summons thee to heaven or to hellMacbeth is driven by his ambition, but also by the ambition of his wife, Lady Macbeth, as treacherous a villain in many respects as any male character in Shakespeare. Macbeth has an overgrown sense of invincibility, convinced by prophecies that his course will be successful, and ordinarily it is (until it all goes awry); it is a successful struggle to the throne, but never secure, and in the end, all is lost.Macbeth may be the bloodiest of Shakespeare's plays, a thrill for Elizabethan audiences, and a wonder to behold as the scenes get ever more desperate and darker.This editionThere are so many editions of Shakespeare available, and many have merits. This particular volume of the four major tragic plays provides commentary by David Bevington which is insightful and accessible; it also gives photographs of performances and stagings by the New York Shakespeare Festivals, modernised spelling and concordance listings of major passages. Not short by any means (nearly 1000 pages), this will nonetheless give a good study to the plays, with visual aids, and supportive material, all in one volume."},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"An integral part to any Shakespeare work is the presence of footnotes! This book has a glossary, but it does not do any good because there is not sign in the actual text itself that one can look up specific words in the glossary. While the plays themselves are very enjoyable, do not purchase this edition unless you feel very confident about your ability to read Shakespearean language."},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"To have the four great tragedies together raises the question of what the essence, the real heart of Shakespearean tragedy is.In Aristotle's definition of Greek tragedy the overweening pride of the hero(hubris) and tragic fault( hamartia ) lead to his eventual destruction. The audience watching this is in the course of this purged of pity and fear.In Shakespearean tragedy there is as in Aristotle a hero who is larger than the ordinary man. The hero too has a great flaw and comes to a destructive end. But the doubt and hesitancy of dreaming Hamlet, the great ambition for kingship of Macbeth, the blind filial love of Lear seem more emotionally complex than that of the Greek heroes. And the language in which the story of their respective downfalls is told is too more rich, complex, and ambivalent than that of the clearer Greek earlier model.And this in such a way that the Shakespearean tragic heroes each seem to be in themselves a kind of supreme human essence, a manifestation of character at its greatest level of intensity.Shakespeare's greatest heroes are individuals who become in some sense the ' type' of themselves, and live in our minds as models of humanity in its extreme essence.'Greatness is all'"},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"this is an excellent 'cheap' edition of the great tragedies. besides being edited by david bevington, considered one of the foremost shakespeare scholars, the bantam edition also includes introductory essays for each play AND the source material that shakespeare used - ie, the actual short stories or plays that the bard drew on to the write his plays. wonderful stuff and a great way to get into shakespeare."},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"NB.

The four tragedies collected in this massive Penguin Classics edition all seem to have been written during the first five or six years of the new century, and in the order they are arranged here. Shakespearean authorities also tell me that all four plays are definitely among Shakespeare's finest creations. So it seems like an excellent place to start a serious exploration of the Bard of Avon. But first be aware that:I cannot give a better advice to Shakespeare newcomers than to beware of learning plot details of plays they haven't read yet. I am not going to make ludicrous claims that this is the best Shakespeare can offer you, but he is certainly a better dramatist than is generally recognized. By this I mean his ability to supply dramatically effective stories that keep you on the edge until the end. The sublime beauty and the profound philosophical depth of the poetry are all very well, but they are not enough to make theatre. Shakespeare knew that very well indeed. It's often been said that today he would be writing screenplays. It is true, of course, and it is neither as startling nor as perceptive as it might seem at first glance. Do you think Wagner would be writing for the concert hall today? Not a chance: he would be writing for the screen. It pays better, too!Such time-travel jokes are pretty pointless but they do serve one fine purpose. They remind us that no great writer ever wrote without wanting to be read, or staged and acted in the dramatist's case. It is a tremendous historical irony, and a very sad comment on our age, that Shakespeare's plays, so highly regarded today, were not even considered worth printing at the time of their writing.What I have to say about \\"Othello\\" I have said ithere. Several notes about the differences between the two editions and about three movie versions will suffice here.The editorial work of Kenneth Muir is far more extensive than that of G. B. Harrison. Both his notes and his introduction are, with few exceptions, informative, illuminating and stimulating. The differences between the two texts are minor. They mostly deal with spelling, Mr Muir's being the more modernized version, though occasionally there may be slight differences in the words themselves (chiefly in the oaths) or the regularity of the lines. In Mr Muir's edition there is one scene more than in Mr Harrison's: II.2. has been split into II.2. and II.3., but the texts are virtually identical. Comparative reading is interesting but the play is pretty much the same in both cases.The only really serious difference between both editions is the punctuation. In this respect, the texts are vastly different indeed. This is a matter that everybody should decide for his- or herself, reading aloud favourite passages from both versions. Mr Harrison claims that his text is closer than usual to what was spoken in Shakespeare's own theatre and that may well be true. For my part, however, Mr Muir's punctuation allows for better rhythm and more expressive delivery; it's easier on the eye, too.Actually, there are some intriguing differences in the notes as well - and here Mr Muir is not always notably superior. Apt example is one of the most controversial stage directions in the play: Cassio's kissing Emilia (on the lips) in II.2. The stage direction itself occurs only in Mr Muir's edition, while Mr Harrison mentions it in his notes. In both cases, in the very next line, Iago makes it clear that the kiss was on the lips and that he, apparently, is amused by the occasion. Mr Muir tells us only that such kissing was common courtesy at the time, but Mr Harrison suggests that this is a sign of familiarity and signifies that Cassio considers himself of a higher social rank than Iago.What I have to say about the other three tragedies, I have it here:Macbeth,King Lear,Hamlet.Note on the edition.The plays and the editorial apparatus are exact reprints of the four separate volumes in the New Penguin Shakespeare. There is, however, one very important difference. The text has been reset and the notes by the editors appear, not in the end of the book, but on the same pages as do the passages they discuss. This is extremely helpful. To be sure, it doesn't look very pretty to have almost every page half occupied by footnotes in minuscule font, but it's a great deal better than flipping through hundreds of pages every few lines.I cannot imagine why Penguin don't reprint these reset versions in their \\"New Shakespeare\\" series which in fact consists of the texts and notes from the old \\"New Penguin Shakespeare\\". The only new things in these editions are the introductions and the hideous covers, neither of which is any improvement over the old ones.The introductions in this volume are surprisingly superb, and I really don't see how they can be improved. All four of them are pretty substantial pieces, some thirty to forty pages long on the average, and they discuss the plays from every point of view: historical background, sources, plots, characterisation, language, imagery, etc. Needless to say, the discussions are neither comprehensive nor exhaustive: Shakespeare wouldn't be where he is if one could tell everything about some of his finest plays in mere thirty pages. But the essays are very well written, lucidly and insightfully, and can be read both as introductions and as afterwords; indeed, all four of these pieces do reward re-reading, and it's always a pleasure to agree or disagree with the editors.The psychological dimensions of the characterisation are especially well captured, perceptively yet without any outrageous meddling with amateur psychology. The historical backgrounds are also fascinating. They are rather revealing about Shakespeare's dramatic genius, as well as about his poetic one. He borrowed a lot from all and sundry, yet he elaborated on that material in a thoroughly individual manner. After all, it is not the material that really matters. It is the pattern.I must say, however, that G. K. Hunter is something of an exception. He is the only one of the editors who occasionally slips into pretentious and not altogether lucid prose. He makes a number of interesting points about both Macbeth and King Lear, but at times I find it hard to follow him.The notes are, on the whole, equally fine. They can, of course, sound rather dogmatic sometimes, but they are nonetheless invaluable for that. And one, presumptuous as this may seem, doesn't have to agree with everything. For example, Mr Muir's interpretation of \\"Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago\\" as referring to the difference in their respective social positions seems rather superficial to me; I should think Iago means the profound difference in their natures. Never mind. The notes are absolutely essential for everybody with as little experience of Shakespeare as I. They clarify lots of issues: obscure words and meanings, allusions and metaphors, cross references with other scenes or even other plays, textual variants between the First Folio and early quartos, etc.The Account of the Text sections consist of an introductory essay and any number of collation lists. The former examines all known editions, how they differ from one another, and what problems is the modern editor faced with. The latter gives the more interesting deviations of the present text from earlier editions. As usual with Penguin (cf David Womersley's editorial work on Gibbon's Decline and Fall), the scholarship is scrupulous, meticulous and exhaustive almost to the point of pedantry. It is not stretching a point too much to suggest that every comma is accounted for. Then again, Shakespeare deserves such a treatment, and I am grateful to the Penguin editors for their magisterial work.The book is massive and not especially handy, but the text, except for the footnotes of course, is printed in an eye-friendly manner - normal font size, not too closely printed, comfortable line spacing - that makes for an easy and pleasant read."},{"Title":"Four Tragedies","review":"The book contains four of the most well-known shakesperean plays, Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth.

It's so unrealistic that you have a hard time suspending disbelief and getting into the Seaside world. In addition, the romance is not focused on enough - too many pages about how awful the Queenies and the Meanies are, and not enough about the relationship between our two heroes. Yeah, we know they're a bunch of a**holes! Enough already! Also, there's not enough sex! The previous Romentics novels were much better - perhaps they didn't have the aspirations to high drama that Surf and Turf has, but they were more satisfying reads. More realistic, focusing more on the difficulties of getting the two heroes together, and keeping them that way.I go into these novels expecting an interesting journey through the hearts and minds of two likeable characters. Scott and Scott, you've said repeatedly that you want your novels to be consistent, so readers always know what to expect when they pick one up. This novel fails in that respect, going WAY beyond the limits of what I would expect from this genre. Very silly and not true to life at all. Scott and Scott, you've fallen short in your mission to provide satisfying, predictable romance for gay men (and the straight women who adore them). Please, please, don't let this most recent of your novels set the trend for the future. Go back to your romantic roots. I've loved all of the previous Romentics novels (with the exception of Nothing Personal, which was too political for me). Please continue providing the passionate, sexy, interesting, relationship-focused work that's thrilled us in the past.Also, all the Romentics books, including this one, have WAY too many grammatical, spelling and punctuation errors. Don't you guys have *one* friend who's good at that stuff? Send it to me before you publish it, if you want - I'll take care of it! These things just detract from the flow. You're peacefully reading along, immersed in the story, when BAM! a stupid mistake jumps out at you and makes you remember you're not really in the world of the book. I'm glad that the phenomenon of self-publishing exists, but there are drawbacks."},{"Title":"Surf 'N' Turf: A Romentics Novel (Romentics Novels)","review":"Two stars. This book was a deep disappointment for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the first four of the Romentics novels; the fifth was OK. This one was not even OK. The two main characters (lovers) were not objectionable, though I'd have liked to have seen more development of them and their romance. Several of the supporting characters were interesting, though several of the more colorful ones could have been LESS important in the story. The main problem, however, was that the whole premise of the book, a rivalry between a gang of queeny drag-queens and a biker gang of S/M afficienados who, between them, harassed and bullied the two lovers was simply SILLY! Not campy, just silly. These two authors have some real talent, as they've already shown, but this is not one of their better efforts. I hope their future efforts come back to earth and focus on the things they do best: developing a serious romantic relationship between two sexy dudes. I beg them to avoid trying to be campy or funny in future works."},{"Title":"Surf 'N' Turf: A Romentics Novel (Romentics Novels)","review":"Every once in a while, I run into a story that is just plain fun and that truly makes my day, and that is what I have found in Scott & Scott's novel Surf \`n' Turf. I picked this story up and got so caught up in the humor and drama of the situation that the two main characters find themselves in that I could hardly put it down. And I think I had a silly grin on my face the entire time I read it. This is a combination of a gay West Side Story without the singing and dancing and Romeo and Juliet without the tragic and bloody finale. It is well written, a little outrageous and utterly entertaining.The authors have created two sets of antagonists who are larger than life and so colorful as to be almost blinding. The Queenies glitter like exotic birds, but these birds hiss and strike with all the innocence and good intention of a cobra. The Meanies, with their unseasonal leather and their overblown attempts to look and act as mean as possible, don't project quite the amount of venom that their rivals do, but they are just as instrumental in creating misery for the two heroes. These are characters that you love to hate, and their over-the-top antics frequently left me shaking my head and laughing.Robert and Blakely contrast completely with these two gangs. They are just two guys - two normal, nice guys - who are trying to escape for a little while. Next to the Queenies and the Meanies, they look like bewildered innocents dropped unexpectedly into a twisted Wonderland. One can't help but sympathize with them even while chucking at their strange situation.Surf \`n' Turf is overtly humorous, but the story also takes a step back and looks at the entire Seaside scene from a scientific and anthropological angle. We may laugh at the comic nature of these rival gangs, but they also exhibit the potential dangers of anonymity and the mob mentality. The men in these two gangs may just be play-acting thugs, but at what point does a game of make-believe get out of control and step over into reality?I'm not sure when I've had as much fun as I had while reading Surf \`n' Turf. Scott & Scott have given us a gem in this story. I was sorry to leave the little community of Seaside and its residents behind when it was over, because the time I spent with them was pure delightful escapism.

To this extent, it marks a welcome intervention into the polarized current debate on the topic of tenure. The authors' (Amacher and Meiners) original insight is that tenure is not the problem, but rather the scapegoat for other defects in the incentive structure of a large bureaucratized system of higher education. The early chapters on the history of tenure are very informative; I for one did not know that its original purpose was less to safeguard academic freedom than to get rid of nonperforming junior faculty.Both authors have a background in the University of Texas system, so their focus is much more on the problems of large, highly bureaucratized systems than on private colleges and universities. Thus, the lessons of the book apply selectively. This book will be more useful to someone wishing to understand a large university system, with multiple campuses and subject to the oversight of Regents and ultimately a legislature, than to the reader interested in private schools. Finally, the authors want public universities to behave more like private ones, with vouchers that let students exercise their control as \\"consumers.\\"This makes an interesting argument -- and after years in higher education I am also of the view that the incentive structure works against change and improvement. But this argument is not as \\"objective\\" as it pretends to be. Their bias against the shared governance procedures that characterize most institutions of higher learning is so extreme as to be a bit laughable. Any faculty, according to this analysis, who shoulder committee responsibilities are likely to be \\"below-average-quality faculty. . . . Competent faculty, who of course have the best job opportunities, have little desire to spend afternoons trapped in conference rooms with blowhards....\\"Okay, maybe there is some truth there, but there are other sides to such issues. The authors don't fully explore the ways in which universities are not the same as businesses. Yes, some business practices may help to reform higher education, but it will take more than the 95 pages of this slim book to come to grips with the asymmetries that must be acknowledged and understood to make such practices work in an academic environment.The chief gap in this analysis lies in the failure seriously to question the model of student as \\"consumer\\" or \\"client\\" and college as \\"merchant\\" or \\"vendor.\\" Not only are colleges not \\"for profit\\" organizations; they also will not succeed simply by pleasing or catering to their students. That impulse is part of what has led to grade inflation and other abuses, which Amacher and Meiners mention but do not fully analyze. Also, academic programs should not be undertaken and terminated simply in response to market forces, as the authors imply. Part of the duty of higher education is to PRESERVE and EXTEND knowledge -- and I'd put a lot more emphasis on the \\"preserve\\" part than this book does. Consider what would happen to the Classics Department of any major university if the curriculum were formed simply on a market model (in response to what students want to take), and you will begin to see some of the problem. Are we willing to give up Virgil, Seneca, or Aristophanes forever because one generation of students (or even two or three) fails to find them beguiling?One more brief note: The appendix that lists all the legal appeals brought by fired faculty against their schools (1990-2003) makes for fascinating reading, though it's unclear what it means. Sure enough, there are fewer of such suits than one might imagine, and they almost always go against the plaintiff. I don't know, however, that these facts suggest that tenure is beside the point, as it's impossible to know what kind of legal landscape would exist in the absence of a tenure system.In sum, a worthwhile book -- and a quick read -- but not the answer it pretends to be."},{"Title":"Faulty Towers: Tenure and the Structure of Higher Education","review":"I will try to keep this review short in light of some longer reviews on here. To me, this book has something of a bipolar nature to it. I bought the book to learn a little bit more about the history of tenure. This is a very short book, but it does indeed have some interesting information on the history and perceptions of tenure, especially in the US. In this sense, the authors present some useful and thought-provoking ideas when trying to get a grasp on what tenure does and should mean. Unfortunately, it seems as though there is an underlying anti-government, pro-voucher, pro-privatization current to the book that pops up every now and then and diverts attention away from a solid discussion of tenure towards what seems to be a more politically-motivated discussion on how to make education more efficient. While this does make the book thought-provoking in some ways, ultimately, the characterization of large state universities as being more decrepit and prone to stagnation that smaller private schools makes the whole argument seem suspect. Overall, I would recommend this book with the caveat that the reader should beware of some libertarian-leaning aspects to the argument."},{"Title":"The Saint Steps In","review":"This is one of the mid-era Saint novels. I like the 1930's ones better, so I only give this 4 stars.At the beginning of this book, the Saint already knows Hamilton, the U.S. is already in WWII, and Simon has to solve a mystery surrounding an inventor and his lovely daughter.It's a good page-turner. No Patricia, no Hoppy Uniatz, Simon is on his own to save a beautiful damsel and solve a mystery nobody but Simon could solve.I would love it if other readers of the delightful Leslie Charteris could include copyright dates in their reviews! It would help me finish out my collection and remember which ones are my favorites to read for the 3rd or 4th time!"},{"Title":"The Saint Steps In","review":"Perhaps the dreariest of the full-length Saint novels.Of the wartime stories, Charteris said (perfectly reasonably) that 1) to be at all credible, the Saint's contribution to the war effort had to be minuscule, and 2) he didn't want the Saint doing things more heroic than many ordinary people were doing every day in real life.Certainly it would be farcical to have (for instance) Simon breaking into the Berghof and punching Hitler on the nose. Even so, it seems bizarre that a skilled pilot who can pass for German (as he does inGetaway) should be spending his time trying to get attention for a formula for artificial rubber, as he does here*.Charteris's writing never falls below a certain minimum level of competence, and the villains don't quite descend to the \\"Ve haff vays of making you talk\\" level, but this is just plain dull.P.S. For a list of &mdash; and discussion of &mdash; all Charteris's Saint books, see my So You'd Like To...

Stewart is well-known for his clear writing and this book is an excellent example."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Mathematics","review":"Stewart and Tall have written some excellent mathematical texts, and this book is one of them. It deals with the basics of mathematics and treats them in a clear but thorough way. Although it is probably not essential, it is a good accompaniment to anybody starting a mathematics degree.They take the approach that one should already be familiar with an idea (via examples) before seeing its definition. This works well, although sometimes the effect is that the pace is slow and the exposition is drawn out."},{"Title":"The Foundations of Mathematics","review":"This book is a perfect introduction to the subject; the language is clear, direct and the content is self-explanatory. A great suport for beginners."},{"Title":"Emerging Tribe: Gay Culture in","review":"I'm fascinated by New Zealand. It often feels worlds away, as opposed to half a world away. Still, the author's main result is to show that NZ's gay community has fractures just like any others. He quotes leaders and everyday gays who ask: Will images of gay men be seen as too sexual to the straight mainstream? Do AIDS benefits truly help those in need? Why are advertisers reluctant to advertise in our magazines? Etc. The author states that gay sex was a crime until the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Then, it seems like the nation has become resolutely gay-friendly. This differs so vastly from the United States where gay rights struggles have been long, difficult, and most crucially, not finished.I love that the cover of the book shows both Polynesian and Caucasian men. However, this book is disproportionately representative as whites, in a country that presents itself as biracial. I thought much more could have been said about gay Maoris. In fact, straight Maoris were brought up more than their gay peers. The title \\"Emergent Tribe\\" hints that gays are a tight group like Maoris. The author quotes straight whites as saying, \\"We wish we had cliques too.\\" Yes, gay communities can seem tight-knit like communities of color. However, I am confident that gay people of color would have a critique of facile equations and assumptions that all community members get along. This book is heavily deficient based on its scant Maori coverage.As a corollary, the \\"gay\\" in the title of this book truly does signify \\"gay male.\\" When discussing gay and lesbian access to the media, the arts, politics, etc., the author never suggests that lesbians have a different or lesser stake than gay men. A book that looks at masculinity at the same time that it approaches homosexuality is fine, so long as it is conscious of it. This author is not. The lesbian erasure may frustrate many readers and turn off other potential readers. Still, it also opens a door for a lesbian-specific book on New Zealand to be written."},{"Title":"Sagebrush","review":"Limited edition book: 60 originally printed, 50 originally for saleSigned by both author (Natalie Sudman) and artist (Terri Warpinski)A visual and literary homage to the Great Basin Desert, the book encompasses writing of Sudman and an original mixed media artwork by Warpinski.Size 27.5cm x 22.5cmPrinted letterpress using polymer plates for the type.

You can easily devote a full day to making just one of these joints. On the other hand, some of these joints will add tremendous beauty to your work. It should be noted that the majority of these joints are useful for timber framing and not very useful in furniture and cabinet making.The photos are usually excellent or very good. But some of the line drawings can be a bit lacking.Because this book is out of print, it is expensive (>$50). One alternative is \\"The Complete Japanese Joinery\\".

It answered many questions about Revelation in an intelligent, concise form. They all give it thumbs up."},{"Title":"Answers for Chicken Little: A No-Nonsense Look at the Book of Revelation","review":"If you want a book that takes a false, unfounded and preconceived view of Bible Prophecy, ignores all other prophetical Scriptures and leaves you truly less informed after you read it, then this book is for you. Too bad there aren't zero stars because that is what this book deserves.To give this book a subtitle of \\"A No-Nonsense Look at the Book of Revelation\\" is little more than a poor attempt to mask the lack of scholarship of someone who thinks Caesar Nero was the Antichrist.This is abundantly clear when the author himself makes a complete and stunningly glaring ERROR in the chapter titled \\"Our Six or Seven Yards of Time\\". Keep a calculator handy if this becomes hard to follow. The author claims that approximately 6000 years of time, from Adam and Eve until today, can be represented as two football fields laid end-to-end; i.e., 600 feet with each foot representing 10 years. OK, no problem there, the math is just fine.As everyone knows, a football field is 300 feet or 100 yards long. Fans always want tickets on the 50-yard line so they have an equal chance of watching the action of both teams. Therefore, two football fields would be 200 yards, or the aforementioned 600 feet.Knowing that God has given each human about 70 years (the author intends to reference 60 or 70 years that people live; some longer of course) he suggests making the most of our time. Again, nothing wrong with that at all.However, 6000 years in 200 yards is 30 years per yard, or 10 years per foot as we noted before. The chapter should be titled: \\"Our Six or Seven FEET of Time\\" or \\"Our Two or Two-and-one-third Yards of Time\\". Six or Seven Yards would have people living to the ripe old age of 180 or 210 years. The failure of the author to even recognize his own gross error here shows how haphazard his approach to Bible Prophecy is in this book.No mention of the things to occur in Israel (and the world) in the future, the fact that the Antichrist and False Prophet are yet future (doesn't fit for post-millennialists or in the case of this author, preterists), etc. all in clear and direct avoidance of the many Scriptures God has given us. Oddly enough, the author allows for a Second Coming of Christ, but glosses over the events of Revelation prior to that Day. This author believes that the Second Coming might occur while he's out tooling around in his classic red Mustang (cool car but sorry pal, the Scripture says quite different in reference to the actual Second Coming). Try reading Revelation 19 and Zechariah 14 without the rose-colored glasses.If you want a truly decent book on Bible Prophecy and are willing to accept the truth of the Bible, then skip this worthless book and purchase Dave Hunt's \\"When Will Jesus Come?\\" book and the video \\"Israel, Islam and Armageddon\\". You will also find many fine teachings of Dr. Ed Hindson at TheKingIsComing.Com with videos and books that give an honest and balanced view of the Scriptures; not one like this that tries to push an invalid preconceived notion that would leave the reader woefully uninformed and misguided on such an important topic.Now, you can choose to heed the Words of Jesus Christ Himself in the Word of God, the Bible, which He spoke nearly 2,000 years ago. Read what He said and let that be your guide. Yes, Christians are to occupy until He comes but He had other things to say.Here are some significant verses: Matthew 24:36-44.

A short book, it is well written, with some archaic language. I suspect Herrick was a painter, his imagery is so vivid. The subject reflects the utopian tendancies in late 19th century New England. But that does not explain why I reread it every year. The story is about a doctor who heals men with broken spirits in his &quot;Inn&quot; in Albany.The first half is about the Inn and it's Master. The simple telling of the story is moving. I can feel the bracing cold water of the morning swim, smell the fresh mown hay, hear the excited chatter of the table talk, see the glow of the pipes in the night down in the garden. It has some of the feeling of &quot;Lost Horizons&quot;, but more real. The Inn is a haven from the cruel world outside, but here the shelter seekers invariably return to the fight. Each time I read it, I yearn to meet the Master and join the &quot;Brethren&quot;, if only for a season.The last half unfolds a different story, not simply a Utopian dream but a psychic conflict between two strong men. (In the psychological, not supernatural sense.) There is no profanity, sex, or violence. The tension is subtle, with an unexpected twist at the end.This second part of the story illuminates the oft overlooked fact that sharpness of wit and tongue are not (or should not be) the true measure of a man. Yet there is no heavy-handed moral here. The characters are three-dimensional and compelling (for such a short tome).Though it is not a &quot;religious&quot; book, I always come away from it feeling spiritually refreshed and morally stabilized. I recommend it whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"The Master of the Inn","review":"I also have an old copy of this, and I also re-read it regularly and enjoy it every time. I'd recommend this to anybody who's willing to sit down and read it without distractions for a couple of hours. It will refresh your spirit.By the way, I just turned up a notice in Time magazine from 1927 about an \\"inn\\" run by a doctor named John George Gehring in the Androscoggin Valley near Bethel, Maine. From the description, it's exactly the place that Herrick was writing about, and in fact, the article ends, \\"Dr. Gehring and his 'inn' are the prototype and scene of Novelist Robert Herrick's The Master of the Inn, written during Writer Herrick's convalescence at Bethel.\\"Herrick's own introduction says the Inn is entirely fictional. Maybe he was just trying to keep Dr. Gehring from being inundated with patients. -- Charles Ott"},{"Title":"The Master of the Inn","review":"Written by Robert Herrick (the American novelist, not the British poet), this book describes a retreat to which men visit to recover from the harshness of life.

When I purchased this book I had little clue as to the synopsis however I was pleasantly surprised with this little gem. This is the second book by Herrick I've read and it has inspired me to read more of his novels.

This is Alejandra's other side, although as you turn the pages her psychological and money problems start marring the happiness she had achieved as a promising poet. Bordelois' comments are always helpful and enlightening.

First off, the positives. (...) You get six complete TOEIC practice tests and a fair number of practice exercises for each of the seven sections. All of these exercises somewhat approximate an actual ETS TOEIC test. In addition, the author gives explanatory answers to the practice tests and exercises. However, this is where the positives of Barron&#8217;s book end. On the negative side, the author&#8217;s analysis of the construction of the TOEIC is very confusing. For example, his presentation of the material in the listening comprehension sections is less than helpful. It attempts to mix all four sections together which, in my opinion, doesn&#8217;t work well. Peterson&#8217;s TOEIC Success presents this listening material in a much clearer manner. In addition, the author&#8217;s analysis of Parts 5 and 6 (grammar) of the reading section leaves much to be desired. Simply put, the grammar points reviewed in the Barron&#8217;s book are not an exact reflection of the grammar you will find an actual TOEIC test. I do feel that the author&#8217;s analysis of Part 7, the reading comprehension section, is the stronger than his analysis of Parts 1-6. For Part 7, he provides a useful &#8220;question type chart&#8221; and realistic TOEIC-style reading passages. However, even here, there are problems: The reading passages are on the short side and there is an overabundance of chart-type passages. Overall, Barron&#8217;s How to Prepare for the TOEIC Test is not terrible, but mostly confusing and unenlightening.

Falck shows how language arises out of our nature as embodied creatures who discover our limits and powers in the context of our physical environment; what's more, the physical world itself arises in correlation to this emergent consciousness. Far from being absolute and independent of human consciousness, the physical world is in a real sense created and maintained by imagination (it's not a new idea---Coleridge and the Romantics figured it out 200 years ago). If this whole business sounds crazy, read Falck's book (and Owen Barfield's *Poetic Diction*); what sounds crazy to 20th century common sense will prove inevitable in the light of a little reasoning and reflection. Don't be put off by all the references to Kant and Wittgenstein; just read the thing straight through for the argument and the pieces will fall into place even if you don't know anything about the history of philosophy."},{"Title":"Myth, Truth and Literature: Towards a True Post-Modernism","review":"Actually, Falck's critique of postmodernism is only the first chapter. The rest of the book is a detailed, opinionated, and pointed discussion of the rest of philosophical history (Kant, Herder, Goethe, Schiller, Schelling, Hegel, Coleridge) and its impact on literary theory, epistemology, and even ontology. It is not an easy book, but it is immensely rewarding. The appendix \\"Romanticism and Poetics\\" is especially well-done."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"This book was a real find...All the details leading up to the the initiation of this &quot;forgotten&quot; conflict are covered in clear, lucid ways that let the reader know what was happening to drive the country to war, but, conversely, it doesn't get bogged down in un-necessary detail. For such a short book, Hickey does a remarkable job with covering the political, military and (most welcome to me) social climates of the early 19th century. We learn all about the early U.S. economy and how important it was to have the good trade relationship with England and France that we initially had and how the subsequent naval conflicts with these countries affected that commerce. The other issues that led to the initiation of war, that were so complex, are covered clearly and concisely (no easy task...other books on this subject delve into much unnecessary detail that only cloud the issue leading to much confusion). All the important strategy (on the English and Native Indian side as well as the U.S. side)and battles are woven into a well balanced account. Additionally, the maps that are provided only add to that understanding. The stunning events of Fort McHenry, the burning of the White House and Andrew Jackson's battle of New Orleans are given their proper due along with lesser known conflicts along both Lakes Erie and Ontario. Finally, the political maneuvering on the part of the U.S. delegation at Ghent get a &quot;to-the-point&quot; summary that clearly lets the reader know what all the issues were that ended the war. Hickey is not bashful about stating that this war was, at best, a draw and that the U.S. &quot;won&quot; by not losing and that the diplomats at Ghent were ultimately responsible. Overall, I'm sure that the long version of this book went into much more detail on the battles and diplomacy, but, for a summary, you won't find many accounts better."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"Although the War of 1812 has not exactly been forgotten, it is hardly well-remembered. No one calls himself a \\"War of 1812 Buff\\" and there are few if any reenactors. In part, as Hickey explains in this well organized, clearly written account, this is because the war was both indecisive and probably easily avoidable. In concise chapters, Hickey fills in the diplomatic and political background to the war, including the political divisions between the Republicans and the Federalists--and among the various factions of the Republicans; the military campaigns in the Northwest, Niagara, East, and Southwest, the naval encounters, the British attacks on Washington and Baltimore, and the triumph of Jackson at New Orleans;the \\"inner war,\\" especially the isolation of the Federalists and New England; and the Peace of Ghent and its ironic aftermath, as the Federalists were in large measure scorned even while their beliefs in the need for greater maritime security and internal taxation were vindicated. Along the way, Hickey highlights the frequent problems of supply, finance and morale (such as militiamen not wanting to cross the Canadian border in the middle of a campaign), the accomplishments of rising stars such as Winfield Scott, Oliver H. Perry, William Henry Harrison,and of course Francis Scott Key; the ineptitude of some American leaders (political and military); and the roles of various Indian tribes in the conflict. Although told more from the American point of view, the book also notes the political aspects of the war from the point of view of English leadership.Although I've studied plenty of history, I've never read much about the War of 1812, and this book filled the gap in a short time. The writing is vigorous and sprinkled with humor, some of it appropriately ironic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"This is a remarkably informative book that is essential reading for anyone interested in early 19th century U. S. history. Prof. Hickey has condensed his longer book by the same title into this little gem. He lucidly describes how the U.S. undertook a war against Britain with unclear national objectives, poor to no military planning, and partisan, divisive political actions in Congress. Moreover, President Madison wasn't up to the task of leading the nation during wartime. During the war's course, the British burned the public buildings in Washington, D.C. and strangled U.S. maritime enterprises, although U.S. successes in the Battle of New Orleans and naval battles on the Great Lakes helped establish the U.S. as a military force to be reckoned with.Prof. Hickey has written a well researched book that has current day relevance, even though the War of 1812 isn't exactly a hot topic. As Hickey relates, going to war without clear objectives and preparation is a recipe for very tough times."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"While Hickey has an excellent command of the facts, his conclusions are born of political spin - selectively engaged facts to build a narrative that is more self-satisfaction than scholarly analysis.His thesis, that the war was manufactured for political positioning and had little consequence because the British had no real plans for North America is wrong on both counts.Casus Belli?Hickey dismisses the provocations of preying on the merchant marine and impressing the sailors by making reference to the low cost of insurance. He dismisses the obvious, the merchant marine was the lifeblood of the young nation and the engine of prosperity. He ignores the personal - 6000 sailors impressed into British service. I try to imagine the sentiment of the nation during that era with so many of it's families impacted by that brutal British policy and the fate of the political party that supported the Jay Treaty. The Federalists were perceived as elitists who were more worried about their landed financial interests and less about the fate of the common man and the sovereignty of the nation. From that perception came the elitist label and the end of their party.In the Coming of War, Hickey all but calls the Republicans isolationists. In Conclusions, he accuses the Republicans of needless war mongering for political advantage. What he misses in between is a country who's sovereignty was under assault on multiple fronts. That Americans were not looking for a fight is obvious from the decade-long effort to stay out of the mess created by European elitists fighting endless wars. That some of the Federalists policies were in many respects better is obvious, but their demise is easy to understand.Getting this country to fight at all was a miracle brought about only after great effort and miscalculations on the part of Great Britain.Great Britain judged Americans wrongly: They didn't see a cohesive nation after they witnessed the easy flipping of coastal towns and assumed all Americans were so weakly bonded together. This was not the Second Revolutionary War or the Unnecessary War, it was the finishing battles of the first.Hickey calls the result of the war a failure of Republican policies. The real point is that the beginning of the war was a repudiation of the financially-centered policies of the Federalists. These policies, while convenient to a weak nation seeking economic growth, sacrificed national sovereignty - a position that can not be tolerated forever. That the all-powerful Federalists could disappear so early in the nations history is simple repudiation enough. That Hickey ignores the obvious for tortured logic is lazy scholarship. One can not help feel that he wrote many of these conclusions in allegiance to modern American politics."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"I knew very little about the War of 1812, so bought this book to get a short introduction.

America invaded Canada! The popularity of the President suffered and the Secretary of War was forced to resign. The economy of the United States was nearly bankrupted and shipping was ruined. The army was made up of unwilling state militia who were not trained or disciplined. Author Hickey covers this history well. Familiarity with this history could serve as a warning about the current engagement in Iraq. At the very least it is pertinent information for today's Americans."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"I found the writing to be clear and lively. Most important, the facts are reliable and presented in a orderly manner."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"The War of 1812: A Short History by Donald R. Hickey is a 109-page account of Mr. Madison's War, an obscure war waged for our nation's maritime rights. His brisk account of the war covers all three years of the war - not just the overland campaigns, but also the important victories at sea attained by America. This book is a wonderful account of the war: battles are ordered logically, so the reader can not only appreciate the heroics of people such as Oliver Hazard Perry, Thomas McDonough, and Steven Decatur - but can also understand the campaigns, which help in remembering the details.The book includes maps to help the reader follow the battles, and the mapmaker had the bright idea of identifying all the battle sites mentioned in the text! This concept is so elementary that one wonders why so many books fail to do it. If an author is going to mention actions at Fort Strother, Fort Mims, Burnt Corn, Tallushatchee, Talledega, Emcukfau, Enotachopco, and Horseshoe Bend, the least he can do is have a map that identifies all of these locations, such as Hickey did in his map of the Southern Theatre.American invaded Canada several times during the War of 1812: from Detroit, from the Buffalo / Niagara region, and rather unsuccessfully from Plattsburgh. Some books treat these forays as symptoms of manifest destiny, but Hickey makes a compelling case, in few words, that the invasions were considered the easiest way to strike at Britain, the Mistress of the Seas. His dissection of the causes of the war is straightforward and conceptually easy to follow. He addresses other causes for the war, such as a second war for independence, territorial aspirations, and Indian removal. Particularly interesting, and logical, is his treatment of trade, which was lurking behind the tension between England and America.Perhaps the author could have added an extra page reciting the history of British impression of American sailors. When England dropped the Orders in Council shortly after American declared war on England, the impression of sailors was the only remaining maritime issue between the two nations. Hickey could have made his argument that maritime issues were the main issues of the war stronger had he outlined the 150 years of abuse that England had inflicted on American sailors. See the bookSeeds of Discontent: The Deep Roots of the American Revolution, 1650-1750by J. Revell Carr for one source of more on this topic.Hickey included a quote from an English newspaper, where the reader needs to make the connection that Jonathan is another name for the United States. As I had just readDrawn & Quartered: The History of American Political Cartoons, I knew that Brother Jonathan was a political cartoon representing the United States. Political cartoonists began using Uncle Sam, instead of Brother Jonathan, during the Civil War era. Hickey should have stated the assumption that Jonathan is the United States.An equivalent book, with respect to the American Revolution, is theconcise historyby Gordon Wood. These books take the reader beyond a two-page introduction to the war that you'll find in an almanac, without immersing you in the details of who forgot to block which canal in the bayous of New Orleans. Many thanks to my friend Alan, who lent me this book and thus allowed me to read this terrific recap of the war of 1812."},{"Title":"The War of 1812: A SHORT HISTORY","review":"MY GRANDSON NEEDED TO MAKE A REPORT ON THIS BOOK SO WE BOTH READ IT AND FOUND IT WAS VERY GOOD."},{"Title":"Stalemate","review":"The review by Karen Breda is pretty comprehensive, I dont know how much there is to add, but this short novel really impressed me. I've read a lot of books about the Holocaust, both fiction and nonfiction, and this story, told as a simple parable, is one of the most powerful. There is the story set in the Vilna ghetto and the Biblical parallel of Abraham and Isaac. The author names the father and son Abraham and Isaac. This is a book that is not to be read literally for plot, although the author apparently survived the Vilna ghetto. Atrocities committed by the Nazis are more hinted at than described, which to me makes the story more effective. I also think the author was showing people as they should act, rather than as they may actually have acted. With each chapter he raises a moral dilemma. If you are looking for a realistic story about Vilna during the Second World War, I'd say try Anya by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer. That is not the intent of this book, but it is thought provoking, comparing life to a game of chess."},{"Title":"Stalemate","review":"I was concerned that I wouldn't like this book, since I don't know the first thing about chess.

Allman's &quot;Miami: City of the Future,&quot; and Didion's book. Yeah, yeah, at the time, Miami was hot hot hot, Crockett and Tubbs were in the middle of their run, but...Iran-Contragate was also playing itself out, and Miami was an epicenter of Reagan-era, better-dead-than-Red, Contra War intrigue. Didion captures the period beautifully in suitably ominous, conspiratorial tones. She introduces us to a cast of chilling characters--no, wait: she means for us to UNDERSTAND her characters as the driven, chilling, formidable products of &quot;el exilio&quot; and &quot;la lucha&quot;--and leaves no doubt that these are serious men, men who &quot;get things done,&quot; men capable of, well, anything.And my bone? Didion is a wonderful writer who cannot, however, resist long, convoluted, patience-trying Germanic sentences, frontloaded with the universe, embellishing adjective after adjective, wending their way down the page, forestalling all gratification, clarity, or meaning, until finally hitting us between the eyes with the final word-punchline, which invariably leads our eyes to course back up the page in an effort to reconstruct, to rediscover &quot;just where were we going with this.&quot; Small price to pay for so delicious a book."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"The story of the Cuban exiles in Miami deserves to be told with drama and passion because that is what it has been. In this page-turner, Joan Didion captures the rejection and racism that the Cuban exiles first encountered in Miami when they emigrated from Cuba after Castro assumed power. She shows how some of the Cubans became successful businesspersons, political powerbrokers, shapers of local culture, renowned humanitarians and philanthropists, expert propagandists, able diplomats, drug runners, muggers, and internationally renowned terrorists.We see the close relationship the Cuban exiles formed with the USA government, especially its clandestine agencies. We learn that in the 1960s Miami essentially became a CIA recruiting and operational-staging center. Didion tells us that the CIA had as much as 120,000 \\"regular agents\\" (full and part-time) stationed in south Florida. It had a flotilla of small boats (often used for terrorist raids on Cuba), making it the third largest navy in the western hemisphere at the time. It owned airline companies in the Miami area and holding companies that lent itself loans for covert operations. \\"There were [also] hundreds of pieces of Miami real estate, residential bungalows maintained as safe houses, waterfront properties maintained as safe harbors\\" as well as \\"fifty five other front businesses\\" and \\"CIA boat shops,\\" \\"guns shops,\\" real-estate, travel and detective agencies (pp. 90-91).Yet the relationship between the Cuban Americans and the USA has been a troubled one. Although the Cuban Americans find themselves dependent on the USA for maintaining their struggle against Castro, they also don't trust the government, blaming it for their loss at the Bay of Pigs and for adopting policies soft on Castro. Likewise, the USA finds some Cuban Americans helpful in its secret foreign adventures (Chile, Nicaragua, Angola, etc.) as well as a nuisance when these terrorist elements assassinate foreign diplomats, blow up airplanes and banks, and murder USA citizens.Particularly poignant is Didion's description of the Cuban Americans' personal and often internecine struggle over understanding themselves as immigrants or exiles. These struggles have resulted in broken friendships, shunning, public ridicule, financial loss, bodily harm and death.The book only covers Miami until 1987. I wish Didion would update the book, although it might be dangerous for her to do so.This is a great read and well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"I read this book so many years ago, but I just now realized I had never shared my opnions about it. I had lived in Miami for about eight years, and I think I was in my 5th year or so when I finally heard about &quot;Miami&quot; by Joan Didion. It was only after I had finally moved to the Beach that I happened upon it, at Kafka's. At any rate, it is an excellent book. I think about it every time I hear on the news about the bumbling CIA or news of Castro makes the NYTimes. Incidentally, 1987 also saw the publication of &quot;The Corpse Had a Familiar Face,&quot; by Edna Buchanan, another equally excellent non-fiction book about this city. I also highly recommend &quot;A Book of Common Prayer&quot; by Ms. Didion."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"Being a Cuban-American means growing up with politics as a big part of life. Being a Cuban-American in Miami means having a strong sense of Cuban identity based on &quot;la lucha&quot;, or the struggle against the tyranny enveloping the island nation 90 miles away. Joan Didion provides a vivid account of the tumultuous and controversial world of Miami exile politics, as well as the often explosive issues of racial and ethnic conflict, where hispanic meets white, meets black, in this multi-ethnic, multi-racial kaleidoscope that is Miami."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"As a 23 year resident in Miami (from NYC) I was astonished at Didion's eloquent articulation of what I haven't been able to describe but have pondered over these many years--the cultural and cognitive disconnect between native Americans and disgruntled Cuban exiles. They talk about LA, but Miami really is Never-Never Land with impossibly obdurant and involuntary immigrants who have no clue or stake in the American values of reasoned discourse, free speech, and fair play and no desire to abandon the cultural attributes that have allowed them to suffer under one form of tyranny or another for a long long time. This books explains what they are thinking--the Cubans--and why they behave the way they do. Well-researched, accurate, and beautifully crafted prose."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"Joan Didion's Miami is a hard hitting look at the political, social, and economic scene of the title city. Written mostly about incidents and events which took place in the 1980s, it is difficult to tell how much of this book is still relevant. Regardless, Didion takes on a complex topic, handling the heady mixture of people and groups of exilic Cubans in Miami.Care should be taken when reading this book. Because Didion uses a narrative voice very close to the people and organizations she is examining, it often appears that she is making derogatory or even racist remarks. But she is merely taking the tone of the person, giving their voice some play in the narrative. She keeps, more or less, her journalistic distance.All in all, this is a dense book that is not for everyone. Unless you are a die-hard Didion fan, or have a vested interest in the scene in Miami (over twenty years ago) its concerns may be too remote."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"I am one of those who absolutely love Didion's style. Her long meandering sentences, laden with subordinate clauses that wind down a long trail of adjectives and phrasings, remind me of Hunter Thompson on Sherry instead of meth, until reaching a conclusion that is at once obvious and profound. Ah, where was I?Oh yes, I was captured by Didion's \\"The Year of Magical Thinking\\" after losing a loved one, and found her book to be the only one that came close to capturing the sorrow and ennui of that period of my life. I love her ideosyncratic style, and it served \\"Miami\\" well. She serves up the threats unveiled and the danger open and unguarded as she talks political assassination and murder in the same breath as Cuban literature and culture. This book captures the mundane face of the patriot in exile who will stop at nothing to regain his homeland, even when that homeland no longer effectively exists. Miami has truly become America's Casablanca, and she looks it in the eye without flinching. A political and social study that is more timely than many current tomes."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"I was surprised I have not read it earlier,not The usual Anti-Exile/ProCastro slanted work such as Bardach's so-called ' \\"Confidential\\" work and other so-called \\"Experts\\" even though there is one quoted in this book Marifeli Stable-Perez From Acieto who in Exile circles is at best An Apologist for the regime and a Spy at Worst,yet her and other ProCastroites especially NonCubans write \\"History\\" about the island, The book is okay,written eloquently and even handed yet there is some subtle jabs here and there,perhaps a condescending tone if you will.And the author of course gives her jabs at Reagan(This book is 1987 and has not been Outdated)but she is equal in taking to task The so-called Kennedy Historians and shattering their Camelot myth with the \\"Disposal\\" problem and The Biggest Betrayal ever,there is also some interesting people interviewed for the book: one of Former President Carlos Prios Socarras Daugthers is in there who sadly is a Democrat and her then Husband Duran(ProDialogo Apologist) as well Dialogo/apologetic Bernado Benes. Sprinkle in the 1980 Riots(perhaps some sympathy for victim hood) some words such as the proletariat(always careful when you see such words they hint at the leanings)and Throwing lavish parties as if throwing a party should be a sin makes the book at times confusing,what is the approach and what was the author's conclusion? it seems more about Exiles yet titled Miami? perhaps an updated and better explanation would be in due order,Most of the Cubans Arriving now(I can say this I am Cuban) are not very productive more apologetic towards the regime downright appeasers and have made Miami Worst than even 1987 could have been,throw in the jungle elements arriving from third world countries and well you can imagine the Cuban Miami is now Worst,the intolerants who left should see it now(Anglo intolerance is pointed out as well as ignorance or apathy of the cause,yet the author should know the word A Mariel does not make sense but Marielito or If female Marielita,short on research.)A book that is worth a read,however brief and at times flawed nonetheless telling of the times and the Passion and the lack of passion for those who rather Appease than Fight."},{"Title":"Miami","review":"Didion produces a masterful detailing of Miami history through Cuban immigration and their rise to power in the city.

Whereas the Gucci Gulch focused on Reagan's 1986 tax policy overhaul success, The System follows President Clinton's efforts to revamp healthcare in America. What makes The System more representative of the political process than Gucci Gulch is that healthcare reform failed. Because of Clinton management inexperience, and Gingrich \\"coagulation\\" and scare tactics, healthcare reform never happened. That may be for the better. Clinton's plan left little to be desired, though it was not the \\"socialized medicine\\" that the right claimed it was. Still, that does not mean it was a worthy plan. The real problem, however, that scoring political success for both sides trumped the search for wise policy. Most everyone at the outset agreed that there was something wrong with healthcare, but change failed to occur. And no one is absolved of blame by Johnson and Broder: the President, First Lady, the wider Administration, Congress, the press, interest groups, and the public all allowed this to happen. Again, that doesn't mean that Clinton's plan should have been adopted, but something could have been done to better deal with the many healthcare problems plaguing the nation.Regardless, The System is a must-read for anyone who wants to see American politics as it really exists."},{"Title":"The System : The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point","review":"The System provides a detailed and thorough &quot;casestudy&quot; of the American political process.

They believe the Hillary Clinton health care plan should have been enacted and present their study from this point of view. Their slant is annoying. However, it ultimately does not detract too much from a very able telling of the conceptualization, selling, manuevering and strategy employed by both sides over the struggle to socialize medicine in the United States.Although never pretty or highminded as we are taught in civics class, the book shows a democratic (small &quot;d&quot;) system at work. Both sides had true believers who were guided by philosophy and were trying to do what was &quot;right.&quot; Both sides had craven opportunists driven by darker more mercurial instincts. The American Congress worked to examine the issue and resolve the dispute as the framers had intended: by providing a forum for parties on both sides of the debate to hash out their perspectives and come to a resolution (one must always keep in mind that an equally legitimate action of any legislative body is to say no to proposals that are unwise or do not have sufficient political support.)This book will educate the average citizen and fascinate the political junkie."},{"Title":"The System : The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point","review":"could offer the following assessment as a critique, that Hillary Clinton was too committed to universal care to be considered unbiased. These MSM practitioners fall into the trap of all such: they think that sin resides equally on all sides. If, as they show, Republicans, industry lobbyists, even the Christian Coalition, and ignorant citizens, are arrayed against a project blaming the brave at the Alamo is stupid. The fact that President Obama is now facing similar problems after trying to avoid all the Clinton's so-called errors shows that this is not a fight that is remotely fair. And the press, including the Johnson's and especially the Broder's are in large measure to blame because they adopt a \\"he said, she said\\" everyone's a sinner stance that gives the opponents, once again, an unfair advantage.

I read along with interest because the story that unfolded read like some sort of sordid drama, like something you might see on prime time television. It had suspense, intrigue, and some of the most stunning ups and downs. And all this from a book that attempts to comprehensively explain the hopeful beginnings and hopeless endings of the Clintons' (both Bill and more specifically Hillary) attempts to implement universal health care in the United States. Think back, if you will, to the campaign promises Bill Clinton made in his first campaign. He vowed to fight for universal health care. Many Americans like this idea, but when it comes right down to it, most Americans do not trust the government to provide their health care and also feel that government intervention in private health care makes the system... socialist. Bill wanted to change this, and when he was elected, he appointed his wife, Hillary, to chair a committee to research and implement this new universal health care system. However, this was his first mistake. The American people at that time were very suspicious and skeptical of Mrs. Clinton, feeling that she did not embody what a First Lady should be. They also felt that she had demonstrated no real qualifications for this appointment. The writers of this book document the controversies and problems brilliantly. I felt confident about the facts... until I was happily reading along (the book, despite its daunting length, reads through smoothly and quickly) and found a most glaring and heinous error. The writers were discussing the positions of Fred Grandy, who, after leaving television, went on to represent his home state of Iowa in Congress. We all know Fred Grandy as Gopher on the tv show Love Boat. But this book said that he had been a star on the show Gilligan's Island! I started to exercise real doubt and skepticism about a book that managed to get through all stages of editing with such an easily spotted error on its pages. Whatever the case, if you want to know how the plan was formed and how it was unraveled quite easily not just by opposition Republicans but also by Hillary herself, you should indeed read this. Hillary and her policy wonk friend Ira Magaziner had many opportunities to compromise on some of the points in their health care plan which would have made it an easier sell to Republicans. In fact many Republicans offered to work with Hillary and Magaziner, but the stubborn duo insisted on having the plan intact... and ended up getting nothing. As did the American people."},{"Title":"The System : The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point","review":"If you read this book in the wrong frame of mind, you won't like it.

It's advocacy.The key is found in the intro, where the authors define \\"The System\\" that rules USAmerica -- which includes the Presidency, the Congress, the media ... AHH! The fact that they think the media is part of the govt., just not elected, is itself worth the price of this volume.Taken in this vein, it is quite good. We must have a national health system like a European country's , because ... well, because they feel embarrassed that we aren't like Europe. That the U.S. was settled, predominantly, by people who WANTED NOT TO LIVE IN EUROPE is unimportant to Johnson and Broder, who know better than to take the this self-govt. nonsense seriously.What is serious is that the USAmerican public rejects 'socialized medicine.' So instead Clinton wrapped it up in his mess of a bill, and then tried to scare us into panic over our health care, saying the system would collapse if we didn't give control of it to the govt. Not true, and Johnson &amp; Broder know it, but hey, can't let truth stand in the way of ruling.Frequently THE SYSTEM is unintentionally funny, too, as when the authors take a break from reporting the \`horse race' political aspects of the story to criticize the media for concentrating on the \`horse race' instead of the policy substance, after which they trash the only attempt ever made to discuss the policy substance (Elizabeth McCaughey's famous piece in The New Republic) and go back to reporting the horse race. You sort of wonder if they read their own manuscript.But have some sympathy. They do mention the policy substance from time to time -- our rulers think we spend far too much money on foolish things like attempting to save the lives of premature infants. Those resources should go to more important things, like health care for \\"homeless, drug abusing gay and bisexual men of color.\\" I mean, would you want to defend THAT openly?It's also very useful in assessing the nature of liberal bias in the press. The last chapter of the hardcover first edition, on sale in 1996, told us about good Pres. Clinton's attempts to \`save' the federal budget before runaway health care spending wrecked it, and evil House Speaker Newt Gingrich's attempts to \`cut health care spending,' when in both cases they were trying to do the same thing -- cut the rate at which spending on health care would increase in the future. That's one way you bias coverage -- describing things in such a way as to create the desired reaction, which in this case was to get us to run out and vote Democratic.The last chapter of this paperback edition mentions the Kassenbaum-Kennedy bill, passed by Congress and signed by Clinton. All mention of it was carefully left out of the first edition. That's another way of biasing coverage -- leave out the \`unimportant' stuff that might confuse the citizenry.And if you practice your critical thinking skills as you read, you will learn a lot about the chaotic way Clinton ran his administration, how the Democrats lost control of the House after twenty straight wins, why the bill was so complex, and other fascinating stuff.What you won't learn how the Clinton health plan would have worked, of course. Obviously, they were afraid of your reaction if you found out. That is probably the most important information in the book."},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","review":"Floyd Schneider brings a different approach to evangelism, one that anyone can use- ask them to read the Bible with you! No more telling others what the Bible says, but having them read the truth for themselves. All the students in my Personal Evangelism class read the book, and now many of the students are involved in a Bible study with people they met in town. I've read the book, and it's right on. I recommend this to anyone who wants a real and practical way to evangelize."},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","review":"I have read many books on evangelism and by far &quot;Evangelism for the faint-hearted&quot; is the best I've read so far. Many books share principles but Mr.Schneider goes further by providing practical help on how to address the most popular objections out there. I read the book on a Thursday and the next day I found two people that I will be having a evangelistic study with. This is a must read for all Christians."},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","review":"Floyd Schneider is a veteran missionary and Bible teacher who in Evangelism For The Fainthearted, presents a real-life, practical approach to sharing the Good News. He shows the reader how to become involved with non-Christian friends, turn conversations to spiritual things, and talk about salvation in a comfortable, natural, effective way. Evangelism For The Fainthearted is the ideal &quot;how to&quot; introduction on sharing the gospel with family, friends, neighbors, colleagues and anyone else we encounter as we proceed through the days of our lives."},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","review":"This book is a marvelous read. Mr. Schneider captures the faint hearts of his readers beautifully and manages to throw stimulating cold water on them with his arguments against being weak-willed when it comes to sharing the gospel. The reader learns from his clear and potent examples of how to answer questions from those who either doubt the authenticity of the Bible or who deny it outright. In brilliant case after case he leads us through his own cogent and articulate -yet simple- conversations with those who were very tough cases. I was spellbound by his ability to cut to the chase and to offer clear analagies as he sought to bring others to the saving grace of knowing Who Christ is. I highly recommend this book to all Christians, but even moreso to doubters who cannot or will not ordinarily sit still for talk about God. This is easy to get into for anyone. This is a remarkable man and a remarkable book."},{"Title":"Evangelism for the Faint Hearted","review":"In our efforts to share the gospel with those we meet, Schneider recommends that our primary goal should be to read the Bible together and allow Scripture to speak. He advocates using the gospel of John as the starting place.This has great merit on many levels:- It allows God to work through Scripture- We do not need to know every answer to every question- This creates an ongoing Bible study where Jesus and his work (the gospel) can be seen in a full way.Schneider does more than focus on his core premise, however. He surrounds his premise with sound and helpful advice on how we can better enter into the lives of those around us.Evangelism is often defined in the context of a short encounter. While we should always be able to share the gospel, I think the short encounter is overrated. Schneider's approach is well suited for engaging those we connect with regularly. It not only gives the gospel, it gives the gospel in context.Waldean Wall[...]"},{"Title":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War","review":"There exist very few books on the Yom Kippur War. 'No Victory No vanquished' is a useless account written just after the war. 'The war of Atonement' by Herzog is informative. 'Yom Kippur War' by the london insight team is slightly biased against Israel but very informative. 'Two O'clock war' by Boyne is totally americanized and does not have a good grasp on Israel. This read by General 'Bren' Adan is the most professorial of the books and one of the most dry but also most informative in regards to the SOuthern front.Adan found himself and his unit facing the brunt of the arab attack along the canal in the first days of the fighting. he lost 1/3 or more of his tanks in a wasted counterattack during the second day of the conflict. But although wounded his unit went on to cross the canal and take vengeance upon the Egyptians. This authoritative account is critical of the role of Sharon and commends 'Dado' for his original counterattack plan that was subsequently changed by Gonen.An interesting account of Israeli arms in a time of crises. the new book by Blum 'Eve of Destruction' is a much easier read but does not contain the detail of this dry account of the war by one of its cheif participants."},{"Title":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War","review":"I have read many books about the 1973 Yom Kippur War (Sometimes called the October War, the War for atonement, the Tishreen War, the Ramadan war, and even a few other names), but Avraham (Bren) Adan's \\"On the Banks of the Suez\\" is without a doubt the most professionally written and open-minded account of the fighting on the Egyptian front of the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Several outstanding books exist for the fighting on the Golan at the Syrian front and I highly recommend the books by Avigdor Kahalani and Raful Eitan. For a general overview of the war including both fronts, I recommend Chaim Herzog's \\"The War for Atonement.\\" However, \\"On the Banks of the Suez\\" has no equal for explaining the action on the Egyptian front.Some of the many reasons that make this a great book are:1. PROFESSIONAL MILITARY WRITING: A military professional wrote this book for other military professionals. Many authors have a tendency to remove military language and viewpoints to simplify the text for popular review. Bren Adan resisted doing that although he did write the book in as lucid and clear a method as is possible without \\"dumbing down\\" the work.2. IMPARTIAL CRITICISM: The book, while written by an Israeli general, is impartial. He doesn't hesitate to critique the fighting by either the Egyptians or the Israelis. In fact, he criticizes the Israeli actions much more so than those of the Egyptians combatants. There, of course, are some of his personal opinions and some discussions of the political factors, but Adan avoids overly moralizing history and instead presents it for the reader's review.3. LITTLE TO NO INTELLIGENCE \\"BLUR\\": One of the shortcomings of many books written about the 1973 Yom Kippur war in the first five to ten years after the war is the editing that IDF spokespeople did to the information released about the war. For security's sake, they often change unit names and other critical date making it difficult to track whom was where and when. Adan, being intimately aware of such restrictions, was able to write this book without having his writing made confusing.4. EXCITING ACCOUNTS OF THE ACTION: Adan holds no punches describing the action and successes of the fighters on both sides. I particularly enjoyed his accounts of the tough fighting by Egyptians commandos in the beginning of the war. The Israeli tankers, on the other hand, were tenacious dedicated fighters as well.5. INSIGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF NONCOMBAT FACTORS: Adan describes very well what's is going on in the background of the war: the superpower struggle, ineffective UN mediation, political factors in both the Egyptian and Israeli government, as well as the effect of the civilians behind the lines.I highly recommend this incredibly well written book to anyone interested in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. I particularly recommend it to military professionals.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War","review":"General Adan's book is the best-written work on war that I have ever read. It is clear and concise, and General Adan tries to organize the swirling complexities of modern warfare--in which he was a major participant--into an understandable chronology of events. He also gives his honest appraisal of his superiors, colleagues and subordinates. Like all soldiers who have experienced battle, he is saddened by the loss of lives, especially those of people he knew and respected. War is not a game; it is a grim business, in which military people either kill the enemy or are killed by them. General Adan discusses these tragic details and occasionally adds personal notes and insights.Another aspect of this book that I admire is that General Adan does not present a jingoistic portrait of his countrymen as all being altruistic heroes, while the enemy is presented as being stupid, inhuman trolls. Instead, General Adan presents the motivations and apparent strategies of both sides very objectively. He offers insightful opinions about why various strategies and tactics worked, while others did not succeed as well as might have been expected. And, he discusses the political involvements of each side's allies, which many of us tend to overlook. A surprise to me was that he wound up being part of Israel's delegation to the peace conference after the war! General Adan certainly is one of Israel's greatest generals and statesmen!His book is a must-read for anyone interested in the types of warfare fought in the Suez-Canal area of the Near East. It is replete with detailed information about initial strategies and the daily implementations of these strategies, how units maneuvered and fought, and what the results were.Until we can beat our swords into plowshares, this book should grace every historian's shelf."},{"Title":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War","review":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur WarSuperb book written by a professionalism soldier.

No BS.Must read for anybody interested in the subject."},{"Title":"On the Banks of the Suez: An Israeli General's Personal Account of the Yom Kippur War","review":"In my opinion, General Adan devoted too much space in his book to commenting on his fellow officers. His statements about General Gonen (Gorodisch) give the appearance of an attempt to settle a personal score rather than give a clear, factual historical account. Adan's animus towards Gonen comes through his writing. He even states that Gonen tried to blame him for some of the failures on the Israeli side, which gives reason to suspect whatever Adan has to say about Gonen."},{"Title":"The Man Who Lost His Head","review":"I can't believe this great book is out of print! Robert McLoskey's pictures are hilarious, and at the same time nostalgic. Waking up one morning to discover that his head is missing, our poor man tries various substitutes. As he visits the county fair, his friends and neighbors hardly seem to notice that he has substituted a pumpkin or a turnip for his missing head. The story's ending is safe and predictable as he finally wakes up in bed with his own head properly in place. For the sake of the current generation, I hope publishers will rediscover this lost classic"},{"Title":"The Man Who Lost His Head","review":"This book tells the story of a terrible dream that a man had- -that he woke up one day and couldn&#65533;t find his head. In the story, the man wakes up without his head and remembers that he had visited the fair the day before to sell a pig. Perhaps he left his head at the fair. So he returns to the fair in search of his head. In order to avoid stares, he tries out a few prosthetic devices, including a carved jack-o-lantern and a carved parsnip before he settles on a wooden head. He has a great time during his return visit to the fair, but doesn&#65533;t find his head until a ragged little boy claims he might be able to help and gives him a heck of wallop in his wooden face that finally wakes him up.Older children (especially boys, since all the characters are male) may enjoy the tale quite a bit, with its black-and-white cartoon-like illustrations that are full of detail. However, parts of the story may be much too scary for younger kids, from the premise of the story itself through playing with the hungry lion, and the final punch.

That isn't surprising if you think about it. Very few of us are who we were years ago.But this story is still strange to me even after the years have passed. Looking over the pages I feel that same sense of ambivalence I had the first time - it is a story that veers between scary and hilarious. It's also very deep - there are a lot of things in it that I didn't catch as a child. Seeing those words with those pictures I remember is an eerie sensation. It still makes a good read - but I doubt you would find it in a modern elementary school library.The story is \\"The Man Who Lost His Head.\\" The author is Claire Hutchet Bishop; the illustrator is Robert McCloskey. The basic story is that a man wakes up one morning and discovers that his head is missing. He tries looking for it inside his house. When that doesn't work, he ventures outside. Not wanting to appear unusual, he tries a variety of substitute heads - none of which work. A classic moment is when the townsfolk are pointing him out saying, \\"That man has lost his head!\\" The narrative plays with the concept of literalism. \\"Losing your head\\" to us means doing something stupid or going into a panic. But this person has actually lost his head - and he goes into a panic as well. The narrative ends with a twist ending that fits right in with the strange atmosphere of the whole book - and, no, I'm not going to tell you what it is.But the narrative is not the only thing strange about the book. The illustrations are very striking and contribute further to the books unusual flavor. These illustrations are from a different generation of graphic artists - they strongly resemble the by-gone comic strips from the 1940s - 1950s. The images are both detailed and disturbing - McCloskey does an excellent job of rendering Bishop's words into pictures.The story was written in 1940 (it was out of print for nearly 40 years afterward). The pictures mirror the world as it existed then - part of which made the book such strange reading in the first place (it was already outdated when I read it as a child). One thing I did not pick up on is that the people in the pictures are not perfect. There are messy houses, patched up clothing, pockets hanging out. At the time I read the book the only pictures you saw were those out of the McGuffy readers (aka: Dick and Jane) - pictures showing people in spotless clothing, sterile houses, perfect hair. I had never seen pictures like that before - or read a story like it.Even after all these years, this is still an excellent read. And it has the distinction of being something that everyone in the family will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Man Who Lost His Head","review":"i became an artist because of this bookmccloskeys graphic pen and ink work in the man who lost his head is so much better than his shaded graphite/brush looking illustrations-like those in burt dow or make way for ducklingsthis is a simple story filled with gems-details in the background like the animals and people that populate his storiesblueberries for sal is another example of his stark high contrast stylethe man who lost his head is a great childrens book that doesnt receive the recognition its duei recommend it for anyoneplus it promotes gourds"},{"Title":"The Man Who Lost His Head","review":"If you are a Robert McCloskey fan this book will not disappoint you.

The film simplifies the book and tidies the plot up with chains of events that are more on the improbable side, but are exciting and riveting. The novel, on the other hand, presents a more realistic version of these fictional events, but is less exciting. Much of the novel deals with Megan's thoughts and feelings and the change that happens to her in the film is much less pronounced here. Her interactions with General Yen are quite powerful and the highlights of the book are the moments that she spends with him, including one beautiful scene where the pair visit a Chinese temple. The feelings of incipient love are wonderfully described and for a male reader are especially interesting because they give some clue to how women fall in love.There were some very touching moments and the end of the book does show in a very sudden way that Megan cared for General Yen, although the ending is very different from the film. The film version was very romantic and ties in with the title of the film perfectly. The book ending is much more realistic, and almost as teary as the film.The main problem with the novel is that too much space is devoted to Megan's days and thoughts in Shanghai, and her time with General Yen seems a bit undeveloped and rushed, but perhaps that was the point, that sometimes things like these happen to us in our lives and they quickly fly by without us being able to get a handle on them. Overall, it is a good book and worth reading."},{"Title":"Apparitions and thought-transference: An examination of the evidence for telepathy (The contemporary science series)","review":"Frank Podmore was the skeptic member of the Society Of Psychical Research in the late 19th century.

That means, an original copy had been photocopied to produce this version. Is this a bad thing? Well, yes and no.On one hand, it's not because it brings you a chance to read an out of print, hard to find book. If you do find an original copy, it might cost a fortune.On the other hand, sometimes these copies have not copied well. I have bought other Nabu/ Nevidio and they have been fantastic and crisp, but this particular copy, with the castle on the hill cover, is not one of the better copies.

So, listening to to the book is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series, with its hints of Jane Austin, is superb. But if you want to listen to them I warn you to stay away from any of the versions read by Simon Vance. His are tedious, monotonous readings, in which he is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it. Rather, he gives us wooden characters that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required.

Wine Dark Sea is the 16thbook in the Aubrey/Marturin series and as usual, the writingis as rhythmic and sensual as the sea itself. O'Brian does hisusual great job of spiking the plot with layers of meaning andtwists and turns. He is also at his best in emphasizing the'novel' part of his historical-novel niche.If this is your first experience of the series though, you mightfind the characters and motivations a bit hard to follow, especiallysince so much groundwork was laid in Truelove. Some diehardfans may be disappointed by transport of so much of the actionfrom the sea to the mountains.Still any O'Brian is better than no O'Brian at all and this is one ofthe best books in the series.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The andbang BANG: A Novel ISBN 9781601640005"},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"The joy of Patrick O'Brian's books is the accuracy of his language among the characters as they speak (&quot;Give you joy!&quot;) and the accuracy of the depictions of naval events. This includes accuracy of naval terminology. I have listened to all of these books as Books-On-Tape and often find myself replaying sections to hear the language spoke again. This approach may assist persons like High Cotton &quot;could not get into these books&quot;. One of the greatest things about these books is their unparalleled historical accuracy. When you hear a naval battle described, you can be assured it happened just as described. How does the author place a fictional character and fictional ship into real events? Cleverly! Such as by having the hero captured by the enemy and observe the battle from the deck of the enemy's vessel. Or by having the hero's vessel arrive a few minutes behind the actual combatants and not actually taking a role in the action, but seeing and describing it. In one of the books, Capt. Aubrey was called on the carpet at the Admiralty Offices in London for his provisioning of his ship. Indignantly, he recites from memory what &quot;vittels&quot; and other supplies he provisioned his last voyage with. In fact, the author, Patrick O'Brien, was given access to real Admiralty records. What his character Aubrey was reciting was from an actual invoice of provisions for a naval warship during the Napoleanic War. Very interesting stuff if you like history and if you like ships at sea. Highly recommended, especially if you hear the novels read (spoken) rather than reading them. Star Trek fans will love these books!"},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"This is the second Aubrey/Maturin book that I have read. I did not enjoy the first one. I figured, however, that I had to give the series another try because Patrick O'Brian has so many fans. I fared no better with this one.I just cannot get into these books. O'Brian's repeated use of archaic nautical words and phrases is more than distracting. It is overwhelming and it buries the stories. I would suggest staying clear of this stuff unless you are well-versed in 18th century naval termonology."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"From the opening chapter of \\"The Wine-Dark Sea,\\" the 16th book in Patrick O'Brian's hallowed Master & Commander series, the reader knows that something special is going on. Aubrey and Maturin sail their privateer, the Surprise, into waters made lethal by an erupting volcano that has just emerged from the sea, spewing lava and death. No other writer could so effortlessly blend natural beauty and naval drama (for an enemy American ship is close by).\\"WDS\\" is a rollicking novel, even if it is one of the shorter books in the series. There is plenty of naval action, both as the Surprise matches broadsides with enemy ships as well as fighting through the icebergs of Cape Horn. Maturin is also charged with a daring political mission as he attempts to finance a coup in Peru - an enterprise that sends him fleeing over the Andes and minus a few toes.And then there are the characters. And what characters! O'Brian seems to work overtime to get almost every beloved minor character shoe-horned into this book, and nobody minds.This is definitely a book that should be read in its proper order - you will miss too much back story if you dive in right here, although if you do you will surely love the action and gorgeous travel-writing O'Brian brings to bear.Grab Master & Commander and start sailing!"},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Unlike Patrick Tull who has performed the readings on the previous fifteen books, Richard Brown is the reader on this CD production. But Brown is no Tull. His voice is dull and repetitive, and it has little differentiation between any of the characters.

Whereas there is some great spirited writing in the book you wouldn't know it from listening to the CD, he could just as well be reading from the phone book.BTW the story is great as usual and deserves a four star rating.

The Suprise, heading east after resolving a diplomatic crisis in Hawai'i, heads east to South America to drop off Dr. Maturin whose role as intelligence officer will (hopefully) play a role in the independence movements of the Spanish colonies there.As this summary indicates, _The Wine Dark Sea_ is one episode in a larger narrative (not only in the immeadiate journey of the Suprise, but in terms of the broader events of ship and crew that begins withMaster and Commander (Vol. Book 1) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels). I discourage you from picking this book up on its own - rather, begin at the beginning: you are in for a rare treat. As a part of the larger voyage of the previous three books, _The Wine Dark Sea_ is merely episodic. On its own, there is very little plot, hence the four stars. I rate it this high, however, on the strength of O'Brian's writing, which continues to astonish and impress. The relationships between captain, doctor and crew have long since been well-established, and there is very little more to add to an already deep and wide understanding of between these characters. It is O'Brian's vivid description of life at sea, in storm and calm that makes this book such a joy to read. The poilitical intrigue involving Maturin, while good, wasn't as strong or as intense as in earlier novels (The Surgeon's Mate (Vol. Book 7) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels), andTreason's Harbourmost readily come to mind) - but the detailed description of South America as Maturin works ashore was magnificent, more than making up for shortcomings as a thriller.I am deeply indebted to those Amazon reviewers (you know who you are - thank you) who directed me to O'Brian's world. If you haven't begun the Aubrey / Maturin series, you are in for a rare treat. My only caveat being that it is best to begin with book one, lest details, depth of character, and clearer understandng of the broader plot be missed by jumping in the middle."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Patrick O'Brian continues to impress with his ability. It is unfortunate that he passed away before completing the Aubrey story."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Very impressed with this book. I really enjoyed when they went to Peru. This is my 3rd of his books and really enjoyed this."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Wine-Dark Sea is the sixteenth in Patrick O'Brian's wonderful 20-part nautical series. It is also the final in a four-part mini-series, as volumes thirteen through sixteen are an ongoing circumnavigation of the world. In this installment, Aubrey and Maturin and the HMS Surprise finish their adventures in the Pacific, land in Peru and then round the Cape into the Atlantic on their way home to England. For fans of the naval wars, there are some good 'ol rip-roaring chase and battle scenes. The Maturin crowd will find their hero high in the Andes examining wildlife and carrying on his intelligence activities. A wonderful worthy addition to O'Brian's series."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"I picked up a Patrick O'Brian novel looking forward to a voyage with the British Navy, only to find myself out to sea.O'Brian's series of 21 Aubrey/Maturin novels, detailing the adventures of two friends in His Majesty's service during the Age of Napoleon, are among the most widely respected in literature. Getting into the series here, with Book 16, was not an optimal approach, but it was the only book of his I had at hand. To me, a good novel should stand or fall somewhat on its own. That was where \\"The Wine-Dark Sea\\" failed.Part of the problem is that I found myself joining Captain Jack Aubrey and his physician friend, Stephen Maturin, in the middle of an adventure, with a crew of people O'Brian took pains introducing long ago. Mention is made of battles recently fought, a mysterious woman rescued, and intrigues ongoing, all of which seems part of a bubbling stew just beyond our ken (published in 1993, \\"Wine-Dark Sea\\" comes near the end of a run of seven novels in eight years).But even if I had read this in order, I doubt I would have enjoyed \\"Wine-Dark Sea\\" much. It's a highly episodic novel with a slow narrative and no real central plot. Aubrey and Maturin are now aboard Aubrey's privateer \\"Surprise,\\" catching unfortunate whalers and merchantmen while Aubrey plans to unsettle French ambitions in South America. But O'Brian is less interested in all of this than laying out various nautical details in mind-numbing detail.His love of the recondite overtook his interest in story, and sent me to the computer to look up more than a hundred terms. A few escaped me even then, but I did enjoy the result when I Googled \\"dumb-chalder\\" and saw one of the results: \\"I've read all 21 of them thrice and I still don't know what cross-catharpins, Bentinck shrouds, or a dumb-chalder is.\\" So I'm not the only person who struggles with O'Brian.Battle scenes are over in half a page while O'Brian chews over the state of repair of the yards and masts of the \\"Surprise.\\" Worse follows when Maturin makes landfall in Peru, for what starts out a potentially exciting espionage story but turns into an 19th-century episode of Wild Kingdom, with O'Brian glomming onto various items of flora and fauna which Maturin collects for dissection. I guess James Bond started out as a bird enthusiast, too.O'Brian does create a sense of total immersion in his world for the reader. You do get the hang of the pitch-perfect period lingo, to the point that when it was observed at one point that \\"spotted dog\\" was on the ship's menu, I knew at once they were eating shark and not Fido. I do enjoy the idea of the books, and the byplay between the captain and physician gets better after they get split up for a while and have something new to say to each other. (The rest of the crew doesn't stand out; several clearly being characters you are supposed to know from the prior books.)The novel ends as it begins, with Aubrey and Maturin still at sea, somewhat at a loss but happy to be alive. If you like these guys already, you may find \\"Wine-Dark Sea\\" a cheerful way of extending their company. But as a stand-alone novel, it doesn't stand up. I guess I should have begun at the beginning, but a good novel would have done a better job entertaining me even though I hadn't."},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework.

I chose The Wine-Dark Sea and am I glad I did. O'Brian is truly a master! The Wine-Dark Sea opens with Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin in pursuit of an American privateer sailing the South Sea. The British, already engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, have made the mistake of also blundering into war with a young upstart, the United States. Maturin, in the Wine-Dark Sea, desires to relieve the pressure on the British government by inciting the revolutionaries of South America, more specifically, Peru. O'Brian, a master storyteller, also has a sharp eye for detail. His descriptions of the landscape, the sea, life on board the midgit man-of-war and even the Andes are no doubt the best in all of literature. The spine-tingling barbarity and bloody battle scenes are so real, they'll make you glad you're only reading a book (although the writing is so good you may forget that at times)! I really can't praise O'Brian highly enough. He is both artist and perfect craftsman and beside him, most authors rapidly pale. If you love the sea, if you love adventure, if you just love a good book, you absolutely can't go wrong with The Wine-Dark Sea or any of O'Brian's other novels. All of them are just perfect. END"},{"Title":"The Wine-Dark Sea","review":"Another incomparable tale by that master of sea stories, the late Patrick O'Brian. Part of the Aubrey/Maturin series, this one follows the book \\"The Truelove,\\" which led His Majesty's Hired Vessel \\"Surprise\\" to the Hawaiian (Sandwich) Islands to protect British whaling interests there, which were threatened by a pioneer of communism, Monsieur Dutourd, who was endeavoring to set up his own idealistic society there at the expense of British interests.As this book starts, Dutourd's ship, the \\"Franklin,\\" is being pursued by Aubrey in the \\"Surprise,\\" on a strange, wine-colored sea in unusual weather. Soon the reason for the strange sea and weather becomes evident as an erupting volcano causes damage to both ships. The story revolves around British intelligence agent Dr. Maturin's attempt to influence political events in Peru, several battles at sea with the concomitant taking of prizes, battle with a pirate, deaths and injuries in battle, and the nearly deadly struggle of Dr. Maturin's medical assistant, the Rev. Martin, with his conscience.No one knew nautical lore and the square-rigged vessels of the Napoleonic era (ca. 1800) as well as Patrick O'Brian. Many of his sea battles are taken directly from the annals of the British Admiralty, and his dialogue is replete with period expressions that lend even greater authenticity to his tales.I recommend that a newcomer to this series start with \\"Master and Commander,\\" the first book of the series.

No, if you had read O'Brian before you would have either decided not to read more or as so many have before you, would have read the series, devouring one book after another in the order they were intended to be read.

It's hard to believe, too, that after so many volumes, with at least one circumnavigation and any number of roundings of Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, we find Britain still embroiled in what we in the States refer to as the War of 1812. And what a journey this book narrates, from the witnessing of a new volcanic island and capture of a most irregular privateer in the mid-Pacific, to anxious flight through the Andes by mule and llama, to yet another encounter with ice-islands in the south Atlantic. Although the plotting seems thin at times and lacking in useful details, the narration is as adroit as ever, especially in the author's patented style of understatement.

This book, a particularly fine example of O'Brian's craft, is part of his Aubrey/Maturin series of sea-faring novels. Sailor Jack Aubrey, while a typically crusty man of the blue briny, is also a well-read and witty contrast and companion to Doctor Stephen Maturin, an erudite physician with a huge love of the sea. Together, the two have had many adventures, but in The Wine-Dark Sea, they face some of their greatest challenges ever with remarkable spirit and aplomb. The story here is great entertainment with lots of page-turning action, but the lush writing is simply seductive and so easy to become lost and quite \\"at sea\\" within. While these are often consider \\"men's books,\\" I strongly suspect that many women would be attracted to the strong plots, grand characterization, and fine writing; there is never the least hint of the crude or the coarse in these highly literate, but so readable novels.

Some day (probably after he has left us) Patrick will achieve massive critical acclaim, the media rushing to heap credit on itself for having &quot;discovered&quot; a great writer.

Considered the first treatise on forensics, it is an interesting read, both for its technical merits and for its historical value. As a historian who has a cursory interest in forensic anthropology, it doubly caught my eye.Initally the book outlines the responsibilities of the official,proceedures for medical examination and specific advice on questioning suspects, interviewing familiy members and reminding investigators of the consequences of making false accusations. This is followed by a detailed primer on how to begin an investigation of suspicious death, beginning with examining the disposition of the body, examining orifices, ways of determining whether the corpse was moved and clues to possible causes of death.Forensically, the richest part of the text was its section titled \\"Difficult Cases\\", which expained how an official could find facts when the cause of death appears to be something else (for example, when strangulation was masked as suicide by hanging, or an intentional drowning was made to look like an accident.) A pharmacopaeia is also provided to make obscure injuries appear. A detailed description of determining time of death by the rate of decomposition is disucssed as well.Certainly forensic science has advanced by leaps and bounds since the first publication of _The Washing Away of Wrongs_, yet I was struck by how the foundations of good forensic work has not changed, from the method of determining self-inflicted wounds and suicide (determined by the directionality of incisions or the disposition of the body), to the recommendation that tiny details be not overlooked (for example looking underneath fingernails or in various orifices for clues of foul-play.)An Asian maxim says, \\"China is the ocean that salts all rivers that flow into it.\\" _The Washing Away of Wrongs_ certainly is one example of many of the tremendous influence Chinese science has had on the rest of the world. Admittedly the appeal of the book is narrow, but it was a fascinating intellectual exercise."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Apparently most people think this is a fantastic book, including the Nebula Award committee. I was disappointed. The plot is somewhat tenuous, and the characters little more than empty shells around archetypal or symbolic ideas. There is an uneasy mix of about 30% future technology and 70% occultism, mysticism, and parlour magic tricks, which was not what I was expecting from an award-winning science fiction novel. Creative and thoughtful description is the hallmark of a good writer, but Stanwick often tries too hard. He sways from the mildly (and unnecessarily) distasteful [which I apparently can't quote in my review] to the outright pretentious \\"...docks more gap than substance, the idea of Dock a beau ideal honored more in the intent than the execution\\". Please. There are numerous ideas, places, people, and events mentioned in the book which peak your curiosity for more information, but it is never delivered. What is delivered is the impression that there was never any substance to support them in the first place."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"To be brief and to the point, everything Swanwick writes is fantastic. :)"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"I finished reading STATIONS OF THE TIDE last week; I would have written about it sooner, but it's taken me this long to process and digest my thoughts about the book into something approaching a coherent whole.The book's plot feels like nothing so much as an SF take on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS. Like that book, its protagonist is a nameless functionary (he is called simply \\"the bureaucrat\\" through the entire length of the novel) sent to a backwards hellhole (here, a decaying colony world) in search of a dangerous renegade. The world, called Miranda, has an erratic orbit that causes its ice caps to melt every couple of centuries and drown every inch of dry land; the native life has evolved to thrive under these conditions, but the human settlers have not. As the inept and corrupt local government tries to evacuate the populace in the last few weeks before the flood, the renegade - a man called Gregorian, who claims to be a wizard or magus - gains a following by offering to remake the Mirandans into amphibious creatures capable of surviving the deluge, for a price. The offworld authorities aren't sure if Gregorian is a simple fraud, murdering his followers for money, or if he's employing forbidden offworld technology; either way, he must be dealt with.The book is difficult to get into at first, and part of this is because Swanwick respects our intelligence enough to throw us into the deep end right from the beginning. As with Mamet's movie Spartan, rather than giving us exposition, he expects us to follow along and patiently assemble the facts of the story by picking them up in context. Once we get over not having everything spoonfed to us, the sense of discovery as the text progresses is intoxicating. The prose is finely-honed and cutting, getting to the truth of a scene in a few skillfully-chosen words. These two factors combine to keep the book brief but dense - it clocks in at less than 250 pages but feels as packed with character, ideas, and incident as a book twice its size.Swanwick is a disciple of Gene Wolfe, and this is most evident in the way the book's plot takes (or at least seems to take) a backseat to the meandering travelogue of the world on display. And that's fine, because Miranda is a fascinating place: kept forcibly low-tech by the offworld authorities for reasons that are not immediately made clear, it is a planet of swamps and rotting manor houses and superstitious villagers, where travel is effected not by spaceship or hovercraft but by zeppelin, motorboat, or foot. The local religion is a strange blend of voodoo/tribal ritual with Aleister Crowley/Grant Morrison/Alan Moore-style sex-and-drug \\"magick\\", and secret brotherhoods of witches and shamans are more feared and more obeyed by the locals than the ineffectual planetary government - but as the planet's watery end approaches, the locals increasingly ignore all authority and give themselves over to either lawless violence or frenzied, nihilistic partying. The resulting atmosphere could best be described as Sci-fi Southern Gothic, like William Faulkner remixed by William Gibson. The bureaucrat doggedly slogs through this milieu, encountering smugglers of alien artifacts, looters, shamans, a family straight out of a V.C. Andrews novel, and possibly a shapechanging alien.Despite its charms and fascinations, the novel isn't fully emotionally engaging for a lot of its length, and much of this has to do with the rather unsympathetic nature of the main character. The bureaucrat seems to be everything his title would imply: a colorless, charmless, unimaginative automaton, meticulous in the performance of his job and utterly inattentive to everything else. Even his talking briefcase has more personality than him, and his detached blandness makes the starkest possible contrast to the fascinating and intricate world he moves through. Nobody cares about the bureaucrat's mission but the bureaucrat, and despite his dutiful, passionless persistence he seems ever more unequal to his task: the local authorities will not cooperate with him, everyone he talks to lies to him and stonewalls him simply out of spite, he is armed with apparently no knowledge of the world or its customs and culture, and Gregorian's followers are fanatical, ruthless, and seemingly know his every move even before he does.But this is science fiction, and science fiction is about overturning expectations. Nothing in this book is what it seems; not the central conflict, not the bureaucrat, and least of all the plot, which is about as \\"meandering\\" as a Swiss watch. The chief pleasure of the novel, aside from Swanwick's prose, lies in seeing a million utterly disparate threads skillfully drawn together before our eyes and woven into something much greater than the sum of its parts, something not only intellectually engaging but emotionally powerful: we know the bureaucrat at the end, and against all odds we care for him, and his fate moves us. So many SF novels peter out in the final act, but the last fifty pages of STATIONS OF THE TIDE are among the most intensely satisfying I've ever read. We leave the book with a feeling of profound contentment and toe-tapping joy, as if we've satiated a need so deep-seated that we were heretofore unaware of its existence. It's one of the best reading experiences I've had in a long, long time; it's one of those books that burns to be shared with everyone you know."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"SF has never lacked for ideas, which is why it's such a good genre to read, because of that constant inventiveness. However, unless you like to read the equivilent of a physics thesis parade, most readers want a little more \\"meat\\" to their books, if not in terms of plot, at least definitely in charactization and layers of meaning. This book has that in spades. I've read once that it was based on Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\" which having not read that play I can't confirm but I am slightly familiar with some aspects of the play and I'd say it's a good bet. Nothing like some literary allusions to kick a good SF novel off, right? But it gets better, because this novel is heavy on the symbolism and the thinking stuff, though it never gets in the way of the interesting world and culture that Swanwick has developed. In a nutshell, a bureaucrat without a name comes to the world of Miranda to search for a man who barely appears, but apparently can do wonderful things. Why is that? Because he stole something he shouldn't. From there the novel jackknives wonderfully, as Swanwick unravels line after line of evocative prose that eloquently brings to life this water logged and doomed world, in all its grime and grandeur. By far the best part of reading this book is meeting the at first apparently bumbling bureaucrat and then slowly realize that not everything is what it seems and the man isn't so clueless after all. This isn't a novel designed to be instantly pleasurable though those just going by the surface story will find much here to enjoy simply by watching the mechinations of what a lesser book could turn into a simple suspense thriller, instead there are passages to be read again, if only for the way the prose flows so brilliantly, or the levels of allergory that I'm pretty sure went over my head. The moving ending alone, which will guarenteed leave you thinking after you put the book down, is nearly worth the price of admission. A fast read (I finished it in like two hours, it's two hundred and fifty pages with not so small print) that never feels rushed or padded, but just the right length, if you're looking for SF with some brains that isn't totally geared toward cyberspace or relativity, this may be well worth your time."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"_Stations of the Tide_ is, on the surface, a story about an intergalactic cop going forth to catch intergalactic criminal.Thankfully, it goes much deeper than that.Office politics, plantation society, magic, sex, and apocalypse all play primary roles in this compelling and challenging tale. The world on which the Bureaucrat (the unnamed protagonist) pursues Gregorian (the distant, subtly menacing, string-pulling antagonist) is in flux, preparing for the thousand-year flood that will immerse most of the land on the planet. The impending doom/rebirth of the world brings with it strange imagery: masquerade balls lit by furniture too heavy to move, or too cheap to bother with; a group of daughters watching their family fortunes crumble as their possessions become less and less able to finance the cost of moving them to safety, and the dying matriarch revels in their impending poverty; a fortress hidden, not by camouflage, but by centuries of studied neglect. The carnival atmosphere of the world in which the Bureaucrat gamely tries to find his quarry (for he knows he has been sent on a fool's errand) quickly turns sinister, and yet retains its lush, unearthly beauty.The action, for the most part, happens at a distance, the book being more about discovery and ideas than anything else. The denouement is truly stunning, and will leave the reader thinking about it for a long time.I highly recommend _Stations of the Tide_ to anyone tired with the usual science fiction. It is utterly magical, and totally unforgettable."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Michael Swanwick's Stations of the Tide was like a breath of fresh wind into the science fiction field. And as refreshing as it was for SF readers, it was probably even more important to the SFWA, the organization that awards the Nebula, as after awarding the Nebula for four straight years to bombs they were able to retain some credibility, got their act together finally, and awarded a true deserving science fiction novel.The novel is \`only' 250 pages or so, relatively short in this era of 700 page doorstops. But there's an entire fascinating universe contained within these pages. Swanwick's writing is succinct; many concepts in few words. The first three pages of the novel are important to set up not just the setting, but the author's style of writing and it pays-off the reader by taking time to understand it. When the protagonist is talking to his boss, who or what and how is he talking to him. How does his boss after the conversation \`return' to the corner and shut off? When you understand that the \`surrogate' is an advanced form of telecommunication, you appreciate not just the set up of the plot but the level of technology in this novel.Swanwick's characterization is superb and his characters, whew, can be from off the beaten path. When the protagonist meets one, the description of the character when he's sucking on some candy of some sort and \`liquidly' moves it around in his mouth drives a mental picture of this character from memories of others that had done the same, I just never have read anyone that just even attempted to describe it. Also when the protagonist meets the mother of Gregorian, the person he's searching for, she's this obese women that barely can move, you can picture her and imagine her as someone you've read about in the news that was so heavy and never moved that when she died in front of the tv, they had to cut her away from the couch upholstery which became embedded in her skin. And this woman's arrogance on her past beauty when she's way, way past that time but still acts like it when all that's left are some photos of her from years ago that she shows off reminds one so clearly of other people one has met in real life.The planet, Miranda, that the protagonist, the bureaucrat, is on, as he searches for Gregorian, the antagonist who is believed to have stolen some piece of forbidden technology, is in the last few days before being flooded in one of the periodic planetary effects. Planetary celebrations are ongoing and you can feel the buzz in the air, like Mardi Gras before an impending thunderstorm (this meant in a positive way). And labeling the bureaucrat as competent is severely understating his abilities and the events he goes through. He is of course human. He meets this \`witch' who embellishes his life, teaches him forms of tantric sex (which, um, I've tried and actually does work) and falls for the woman, but to her he is emotionally meaningless. The scenes are heartwrenching when he occasional sits down and cries over her, but eventually gets up and continues his quest, because afterall it's his job and his responsibility.It is a confrontation between magic and science. Magic is such a subtheme, and the occurring events are so unorthodox, that towards the end when the protagonist is trekking on a path to a final confrontation with Gregorian, you're blindsided by the reality of when (paraphrasing): \`white objects, measuring a few millimeters in diameter, began dropping from the sky', because at this point you don't know if it's manna from heaven, pieces of paper, or a swarm of living entities. Like a short story, the novel is not concluded until the very end. It is a triumph for science. For those whose careers are in the field of science, this ending is a reminder of all the reasons one entered the field; that it's not a religion, it's the hope and power and promise of science."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"This is a truly bizarre and haunting book, and one of my all-time favorite SF novels. A nameless bureaucrat (accompanied by his sentient briefcase) is sent to a backwater planet whose decaying human civilization is about to be obliterated by a cataclysmic, millenial flood. The bureaucrat is hunting a self-proclaimed mage named Gregorian, who claims he can transform the human colonists so they can survive the coming flood, and who is accused of stealing and using proscribed technology. The plot is basically the story of the bureaucrat's frustrating search for Gregorian, which leads him on a meandering journey across the planet Miranda during its last days of human habitation. What propells the book forward isn't the momentum of the plot, but the exploration of this doomed society, where technology is both so powerful and so inaccessible (it's hoarded by the off-world agency that the bureaucrat works for) that it's essentially the same as magic. One of the wonderful things about this book is the off-hand way in which this dazzling technology is described, as though the reader were an inhabitant of the bureaucrat's universe rather than our own, and therefore wouldn't need to have everything explained.This aspect of Swanwick's writing style can be confusing or frustrating, but by *not* spelling everything out, he creates an atmosphere of disorientation, of things kind of falling apart. This elusiveness also helps build a powerful feeling of mystery and wonder, where things are not as they seem on the surface, which is a major theme of the book. In trying to make sense of what's happening on Miranda, you follow in the footsteps of the main character.This book is a meditation on science and magic, decay and renewal, and office politics. Well, maybe it's not a meditation on office politics, but there's plenty of that in there, along with some breathtaking, incredibly imaginative images and ideas. The ending, in particular, is something special. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"So let's see; I waited entirely too long between finishing this and writing it up, but we'll give it a try.It's the future, and something very odd has happened to Earth, presumably due to runaway technology. Humanity has spread to other planets, and a bureaucracy with institutions named things like The Stone House and The Puzzle Palace has a division called Technology Transfer that tries to keep this, whatever it was, from happening to the rest of humanity. On the outskirts of the solar system, humans have carefully-controlled contact with Earth, in the form of a huge enigmatic Sphinx. After talking to Earth, you have to let the bureaucracy examine your memories and expunge anything they find disturbing there.In this context, a bureaucrat comes to one human world, one which has tragically abused technology in the past and so has had even more of it than usual taken away, in search of someone who (probably, or perhaps) has smuggled in something forbidden and is abusing it. The world is a strange and rich one, and it's about to undergo a phase-change, in which the seas rise to engulf nearly all the land, and all the life on the planet transforms into watery alternate forms, or dies. There are wild last parties, cities being hastily disassembled, lost fortresses slowly sinking under the water, enchantresses and wizards and demons who may be technology-enhanced, or hallucinations, or only rumors. (There's also some nice memorable sex.)So anyway, the bureaucrat moves through this world on this mission, assisted by his high-tech talking and transforming briefcase, and various odd and interesting things happen. Eventually he encounters the person he was searching for (more or less), and finds out just what is really going on (more or less). And he and the briefcase both undergo transformations of their own.It's a good book, a memorable book, a book with fascinating images and ideas, where technology blurs into deity and myth, and I can't recall a single nit to pick. You should read it."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"It's the Jubilee Year on the planet Miranda. Every 200 years the planet floods and humans must leave until Miranda's continents are reborn. Miranda used to be the home of an indigenous species of shapeshifters who, during Jubilee, would return to their aquatic forms until the waters receded, but it seems that humans have killed them off.Gregorian, who lives on Miranda but was educated off-planet by a rich and distant father, now styles himself a magician and is telling the citizens of Miranda that he can transform them into sea creatures so they can stay on the planet. He has stolen a piece of proscribed technology from Earth and our protagonist, who we know only as \\"the bureaucrat,\\" has been sent to find out what Gregorian has up his sleeve. The bureaucrat must track down Gregorian before the Jubilee tides flood the planet. During his quest he learns about the exotic planet's history, meets several strange residents, does a lot of hallucinating, has a lot of sex, worries about his job back home, and gets hooked on a local soap opera. The middle of the book bogs down in a haze of drugs and sex which feels slightly self-indulgent, but Swanwick manages to make it fit the plot. In the end, it's not just Miranda that changes.Stations of the Tide, which has been compared to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, is often surreal and confusing, but this seems to fit the dark exotic planet. The setting was my favorite part of the story -- Miranda is both beautiful and frightening. I especially loved the Grandfather Tree which has many trunks descending from its huge branches and houses a caf&eacute; and a shipwreck.Then there's the technology: the bureaucrat has a walking talking briefcase and can split his consciousness into surrogate electronic forms that can run errands for him. He's very surprised to find that the Mirandans had even higher forms of technology until they were made illegal by the bureaucrat's agency. The Mirandans resent this.Some readers are likely to be put off by the nameless bureaucrat because he's somewhat flat and emotionless for much of the novel, but Oliver Wyman, the narrator of Audible Frontier's version, made him feel like a real person rather than a nameless entity. I liked Wyman's interpretation of the bureaucrat's epigrammatic business-like style. His aloofness made it all the more moving when he rarely but suddenly was overwhelmed with emotion.This is the second novel by Michael Swanwick that I've tried. I didn't at all like the first one, The Iron Dragon's Daughter, but I liked Stations of the Tide even though it had some of the same issues. Both novels are original and inventive with exotic settings but the plot of Stations of the Tide was at least comprehensible most of the time. It reminded me most of Robert Silverberg's fantasy, especially his novel Downward to the Earth.Stations of the Tide was originally published in two parts in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in 1990 but was published as a book in 1991. It won the Nebula Award for best novel that year and was also nominated for the Hugo Award, the Campbell Award, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Try Stations of the Tide if you like lushly exotic alien settings and don't mind feeling like you've taken the same hallucinogens that the protagonist took."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"I read all the reviews that talk about how deep and layered the book is, how spectacular and thought provoking the end was, and wonder if we read the same book.I won't get into the details of the plot since other reviewers have done so. Some accuse the author of lazy writing but it couldn't be farther from the truth, he puts an incredible effort in making his world as detailed and vivid as he can. If only he had put the same effort in the plot, it would have been a magnificent book.Unfortunately, the all consuming quest of the bureucrat is almost meaningless to the reader (why go through all that trouble when the world is ending ayway?) The major revelation is given away long before the end of the book, making the final showdown and resolution drawn out and uninteresting.If you want to read the book just for the pleasure to immerse youreself in a rich and colorful world then you'll love the book. If you are in it for the story, you may be disappointed."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"IMHO, this is one of the best science fiction novels published in the last decade. I can't recommend it highly enough. If you're tired of the media tie-in crap that passes for imaginative literature, pick this up immediately. There's more invention here than in a hundred Star Treks."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"This is one of the few books (out of the many SF/F I have read) I'd still give a ten, years after I've read them.This is not just a beautifully written story, it has that certain kind of touching deepness about it, the kind that makes it stay with you and that makes you understand the world around yourself just a little bit better. Well, to me at least.It reminds me a bit of a far future fairy tale, if there were such a thing. Something the family elders could tell the younger ones, sitting around the (no doubt electric) fireplace, for their enjoyment and benefit.It's a story about what magic is about, basically, though it's about the exercise of power, transformations, talking briefcases and a lot of other things, too. And all this in just 250 (not even small-printed) pages! Not a word wasted, there.The story is very cleverly constructed (pay attention to how a soap opera watched by our protagonist reflects the events in the main story line), packed with beautiful images (like the fungus rain, building fleeting beauty) and interesting ideas (e.g. the hidden fortress, a clever use of technology to explain believably a plot device known otherwise just from fairy tales).I liked &quot;Stations...&quot; for some of the same reasons I liked &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot;, so if you like that one, you just might enjoy this one, too. BTW, Stations of the Tide is set in the same universe as &quot;Griffon's Egg&quot; and &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot;, only much later. If you know &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot;, you will catch a cross-reference or two, although that knowledge is not required to enjoy this book.Well, this one is soooo beautiful, I think I have to quit rambling and go home and just read it again..."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Stations of the Tide is a truly superb book, the kind that will leave even the most discriminating connoisseur of Science Fiction literature wanting for more. Michael Swanwick's award-winning novel delivers in spectacular fashion not just at the &quot;idea for a story&quot; level, but also in terms of characterization, setting, and connection to the real world. This tale of a &quot;bureaucrat&quot; sent to investigate alleged uses of proscribed technology on a most unusual world will stay with the reader long after the unguessable ending satisfyingly concludes the story. Add this one to your collection now - then save it {if you can} for when you really need a damn good read!"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Anyone can write about Mars, and anyone can write about hero's thrust into the heart of galactic turmoil, but to write a story like Swanwick's 'Stations of the Tide' is quite a feat. Fantastic and painfully intimate, the story goes wild, literally. A fun and thought-provoking novel, it takes the stigma out of sci-fi, showing us the art of science ficiton as opposed to the genre."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"From the reviews and the hype I had expected something a little meatier but I was a little dissappointed with what I ended up taking away from this book. Swanwick seemingly jumped from place to place, idea to idea without any transition. Information was suddenly thrown at the reader and the reader was left to use his or her imagination a great deal to fill in the gaps. That's not to say that the ideas weren't wonderful - they were. And the imagery and language was well executed. Swanwick is an excellent writer but Stations of the Tide didn't show off everything he could do as an author."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"I LOVED this author in Tales of Old Earth and The Dog Said Bow-Wow, which is more recent work by him. Stations of the Tide is now 20 years old. I enjoyed it as a look at Swanwick's development as a writer, and it certainly has strengths in its own right. But the weaknesses are significant. The allusions to the Tempest and Heart of Darkness, for example, show a younger author trying to be overly serious and deep. The Tempest is not just about an island of magic and fantasy and who-knows-what-is real; it is all of those things wrapped around a standard love story. It's a poor fit for Swanwick's plot, which is why the Tempest allusions are basically of the throw-away variety. Similarly, in Heart of Darkness, much of the power comes from the true isolation of the protagonist in the depths of Africa. Here, I'll avoid plot spoilers, but suffice to say that the protagonist manages to stay quite \\"connected\\" to the outside world. At the end, the story is a bit of this, and a bit of that, mostly without the light touch and authorial confidence that give Swanwick's later work that extra something."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"First I read Vacuum Flowers, which amazed me: humans vs. Earth. Then I found The Iron Dragon's Daughter, and read that. I hate most fantasy, but TIDD was, again, amazing.Stations of the Tide left me agape, jaw hanging open, eyes bugged out. I read it voraciously, thinking, Me o my, this is the best sf I've ever read. Not hard sf, oh no, but in my eyes, Swanwick is the best, bar none, auteur of space opera.I like Swanwick's jump-cut style and transcendent themes. Amazing, simply amazing.And let's face it: I *want* that briefcase."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Michael Swanwick is one of my favorite short story sci fi writers. He has an excellent sense of purpose and pulls off so much excitement in so few pages that it's hard to believe.A few weeks ago, I picked up both Vacuum Flowers and Stations of the Tide based on his short fiction. Vacuum Flowers was a great read, with clearly set out goals, a great plot, and a fast pace. Stations of the Tide, while a good book, is much more challenging than Vacuum Flowers.To clarify items in earlier reviews: Stations of the Tide might (and that's not 100% certain) be set in the same universe as Vacuum Flowers. However, it is a radically different story and the connections between the universe of Vacuum Flowers and this book are tenuous at best. Yes, there are some items in common, but don't get this book thinking you are going to get another story like Vacuum Flowers. The style of the story, the pace, and the theme are radically different than Vacuum Flowers.Stations of the Tide is written in a very formal style. The narrative actually seemed rather stiff. The technology in the book is pretty much limited to an impressive briefcase that has many different functions and something sort of like virtual reality (used for communication). The overall plot is more like a sociological study than sci fi. In addition, there is a pretty heavy plot line relating to magic which seemed flat to me. It just never grabbed my attention and didn't keep me very interested.Did I enjoy reading this book? That one is kind of a toss up. I think by the time I was about 1/4 through it, I was bored with it. But it did make me think about what makes someone human (hmmm, that's a similarity to Vacuum Flowers) and about what people are capable of. However, unlike Vacuum Flowers which made me think but also let me have a really good time with it, this book seemed to be attacking me with it's message without giving me some fun in return. I still think Swanwick is a GREAT writer and I am glad that I read this book. I also think that this book might be a good read for someone who does not normally read sci fi, because it is much more focused on the personal level than on technology."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"The hero of this Nebula Award-winning book is a bueaurucrat. That Swanwick would choose someone with such a job as his hero, and then leave him unnamed for the entire book, is indicative of the nature of the narrative. It's at times quirky, fun, enjoyable, but also irritating, confusing, and silly.This future world has that the galaxy colonised by humans (and one other intellegent race) who have enormous technological abilities. However, much of the tech is proscribed, especially from the peoples of the colonial planets. This leads to resentment on these colonial worlds, one of which is Miranda. It is this planet's fate to suffer a planet-wide flood (due to a shift in its axis of roation). A 'magician' named Gregorian has appeared, apparently with access to proscribed technology. He appears (to the tech controllers) to be murdering people in the guise of &quot;metamorphosing&quot; them into sea-dwelling creatures. Thus, the bureaucrat is dispatched to investigate.We follow as the bureaucrat tries to track Gregorian down. There are some neat touches, especially his sentient briefcase/matter transformer, a 24/7 soap opera that everyone is watching (that we see in parallel with the characters), and a system of &quot;surrogates&quot; - remote controlled robots that project the image of the person they are representing. Unfortunately, the system of surrogates leads to a great deal of confusion because the characters (and author) treat each surrogate as the real thing, and multiple surrogates are possible. This leads to a number of unnecessarily confusing passages of &quot;himself talking to himself, while his real self listens in&quot;.Another unfortunate characteristic of the book is to leave interesting ideas dangling. For example, resentment of the people from whom technology being withheld is ubiquitous, but nowhere is the bureaucrat's rationale for withholding it justified or even explained. Likewise, bizarre (and scientifically impossible) events are described in detail as being true, presumably because the author thought they were too good an image to drop. This, to me, is lazy writing in a science fiction book, and is especially irritating because long passages are very good/interesting but they alternate with long passages that are confusing/annoying.At any rate, it's an interesting read, with some neat ideas, and worth the cost of the paperback. I would not consider it a classic, in spite of its Nebula Award."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Station of the tide.At its best, a hybrid of Cordwainer Smith and Gene Wolfe, with some beautifully written passages. There is a bureaucrat, never to be named, a weird man of purpose, a kind of Space Stakhanov, who never gives up, until his task is accomplished. There is an old lady and her daughters, the bureaucrat's adversary family who feel creepy and interesting. There is suspense, as you really need to know what will happen at the final showdown.Oh, and there are also: remotely manipulated Avatars (only that they are called Surrogates), a 7 letter habitable celestial body with a female name, and phosphorescent plants. Now, you know.However, at its worst, Swanwick often enters James Joyce territory, becomes too allegoric, too vague, too, which is fine if you grew up with Finnegan's Wake by your bedside table, but not so fine, if you grew up with stars, space and aliens in your mind, like 99,9% of us, poor lowbrow SF readers.All in all, worth reading, but not rereading. 3 stars."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"A surrealistic story rather empty. It looks like MS conceived of a very simple plot then to make it go he had to fill up the blanks with irrelevant events. Even sex scenes are incongruous. Some reviewers say it's nice the book is short. To me the book is too long. I had to force myself to finish it. Some reviewers also say the ending is unexpected. I felt the \\"Jesus outcome\\" surfacing about 50 pages before the end. Again, a questionable Nebula award. Well, it may be I didn't understand anything of it, which in essence is even worse."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but I was ultimately disappointed by it.The plot was murky and even pretentious at times, and I wasn't involved in the characters' plight. The characters themselves tended to be obnoxious, more often than not.The novel's sole grace was that it was fast-paced, but that wasn't enough to save it for me."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Nice to see the book reprinted - it certainly deserves a wider audience than it enjoys now. Swanwick's surreal novel is fast-paced and intelligent, with engaging characters and sometimes way-out-weird situations, alternately delighting and shocking. To describe the plot would be to do the book injustice - it is much more than a mere search by a faceless beauracrat for a renegade wizard. The book grabs you right from the first word, and drags you breathless and amazed up to the surprising ending. I think it's indicative of Swanwick's brilliance that my favourite character is the AI briefcase!"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"In one tiny little volume, Swanwick takes on technology, alien races, witches, oceans, and the nature of time. The bureaucrat goes after the wizard/criminal and nothing at all is what it seems.I tend to agree with the reviewer who found the characters to be a little too allegorical, and that did (for me) hurt the overall quality of the book. I felt somehow that the characters needed more weight to carry so much material, and I was ultimately unconvinced by the bureaucrat's final changes as a result.Still, more creativity than most writers hope to attain..."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"First I read Vacuum Flowers, which amazed me: humans vs. Earth.

This is the book that earned Michael Swanwick all the praise that the science fiction community so lavishly distinguishes him with.The book takes place in the distant future of the world he created in &quot;Vacuum Flowers&quot; but you don't have to read that book at all. It is a totally different story. (In fact I read this one first, a really cool combination). The book follows the 'bureaucrat' as he searches the doomed oceanic world of Miranda for a wizardlike scientist by the name of Gregorian, who has stolen &quot;unperscribed&quot; technology. Sounds confusing? Boring? WRONG! This book is nothing at all like what it seems. Halfway through the book you are still trying to guess what it's REALLY about, but not in a yawning type way like a lot of current science fiction. The book is jammed packed with some of the coolest ideas, innovations, and cut dialogue scenes that I have ever read.Still, like any Swanwick novel, (except maybe &quot;In the Drift&quot;) this is a very complex read. If you couldn't get five pages into Moby Dick, or don't even KNOW who Beowolf is, you may not like this novel at all. In fact, it could give you a migraine the size of Wisconsin just trying to figure out what the paragraph you JUST READ said! It is a pretty tough read, but that's another thing that makes this book great. Swanwick doesn't spend three pages explaining each totally foreign and new piece of technology, he just throws it out there on the page and you're forced to think, &quot;What? How could the entire planet of Earth have it's own surrogate?!!&quot; or better yet &quot;Did his BRIEFCASE just beat the crap out of the people who stole it and then walk back to him??!!&quot; GREAT STUFF!!!"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"This book has a lot more layers than it first appears when it begins. It starts as a simple story of a man trying to find a criminal on an alien world, soon to be submerged in water. But Swanwick doesn't get lazy at any point. When he has a virtual reality office, he makes it from a fully fleshed out virtual reality city. Simple internet searches take on the grandiosity of communicating with planet sized artificial intelligences.And more besides. All told it is a really good book with a lot of original content, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It might not resonate with everyone, but if the beginning intrigues you, I can guarantee that it gets better from there."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"Very cool. Short, to-the-point, hard-ish science-fiction mystery (noirish... was that a \\"dame\\") novel (felt like a novella). Sometimes I want more because there is not enough, sometimes I want more because what's there is so good, but this one was short, self-contained (afaIk) and really did the job completely, competently, and with conviction. Good use of words. I would heartily recommend and would encourage re-read(s) as well, there is a lot of \\"stuff\\" here. There is a smattering of nice analyses available across the interweb; wait until you've read once through first before perusing those."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"The problem with telling stories that involve different layers of reality is that it can be hard for the reader to track which set of rules the story is playing by at any given time. Rich with imagery, fetid with ambiance, this is an interesting story in a fully imagined world, but one that never fully engaged me as a reader. The early chapters had too many lists and throughout the book the choice to devote creative powers to the dark and mucky views made me impatient. While not being quite on the same level of grotesquerie as China Mieville's work, his fans should check this out."},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"I came upon this book purely by chance, while looking for something to satisfy my lust for a world on par with Gene Wolfe's Urth. I added the sample after reading several reviews, none of which could truly impress upon me the enormity and detail of Swanwick's Miranda, and the universe beyond. As soon as I finished the sample I downloaded the rest and I must say it's worth the price and more (not an invitation to up the price amazon >:l ). I'll not ruin the book for you by summarizing the plot, all you need to know is that it's a good read. Really good. Michael Swanwick, if you're reading this, GIVE ME MORE!!!"},{"Title":"Stations of the Tide","review":"This far future cyberpunk detective story is only a thin mask for the underlying speculations on the emptiness of life, existentialism, and mortality. Though only 250 pages, it take times to drink in the poetic prose; Every thought and conversation is wrought with philosophical meaning.A bureaucrat is sent out to Miranda to track down Gregorian - a mystic whom, after speaking to the cybernetic embodiment of \\"Earth\\" was given a box of unnamed technology. In this far future, use of this techonology on small worlds on Miranda is illegal and the bureaucrat is sent out to hunt Gregorian down and retrieve the mystery technology. While humans are fleeing the creeping tidewater, native Mirandan animals prepare to morph into sea-dwellers and the bureacrat races with the tide to catch an elusive criminal.Without a doubt, Stations of the Tide is an intelligent book and compared to most adolescent grunts in SF, it's deservedly a Nebula winner. However, I give it 3 stars as its style is more like a short story where the strength is in morals and themes but weak on characters and plot. Swanwick's unnamed protaganist - the \\"bureaucrat\\" and Gregorian are more allegorical puppets than real fleshed out human beings. Furthermore, for a compelling take on philosophy, Sophie's World is a far better novel....Scenes switch erratically between reality and the cybernetic world without much adjustment for the reader. Thats easy to do in a movie but in a book it gets confusing when at the end of the paragraph you've just realize the person's \\"plugged in\\". The haunts, supposedly extinct aliens that take on human form, were an interesting element, but were not integrated well enough into the plot. The side story of Gregorian's mother and the sisters was a weak device.Read it - its a surrealistic mind-bender where robot briefcases walk and wish to evolve, witches teach tantric sex and leave you tattoos as a trophy, planets rain down mushroom showers, and the wistful ending will leave you pondering about life."},{"Title":"The Gender of Modernity","review":"It's painfully obvious to me that the only other review that has been posted to date was written by someone who didn't even read the description of the book, much less the book itself. S/he probably entered \\"gender\\" as a keyword and indiscriminately wrote negative reviews of whatever s/he found.I say this with confidence because Felski actually challenges the heretofore conventional approach of theorizing the modern as patriarchal or male-centered, and she problematizes feminist readings that demonize modernism as said same. She disturbs simple-minded dichotomies between masculine and feminine experiences of the modern world along their own fault lines. She is not a rank-and-file second wave feminist (at least not from I've read with this book)--she challenges much that is typically found among feminist theorists, including those often considered to be mouthpieces for third wave feminism (the generalized term i would assign to Felski, if pressed to assign one at all).Her work here is full of negative capability: she allows for doubt and for contradictory readings to exist without yoking them into some grand narrative. I can't see how anyone who has actually read the book and understood it on its own terms (rather than through the lens of a fringe-dwelling reactionary) would walk away thinking that she is trying to further some political agenda. She's an academic, a scholar who has offered an interesting detour here to conventional readings of the relationship between feminism and modernity.The book uses history as well as cultural theory, and focuses mainly on the fin de si&egrave;cle, with writers such as Zola, Wilde, Sacher-Masoch, Simmel, Rachilde, Marie Corelli and Olive Schreiner. Felski examines the work of these authors, as well as sociological theory, realist and naturalist novels, decadent literature, political essays and speeches, sexological discourse, and sentimental popular fiction. She explores the gendered meanings of such notions as nostalgia, consumption, feminine writing, the popular sublime, evolution, revolution, and perversion.I used this book along with another work that touches on many of the same themes, Susan Stewart's _On Longing; Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection_ for a long paper for a graduate course I'm taking this semester, and I found both to be amazingly insightful and thought-provoking as well as good resources.I apologize for spending so much time defending the merits of the work and not discussing its contents, but I feel inclined to try and refute the irresponsible comments made in the only other review that's been posted here. Since that reviewer gave it one star, that's all that appears next to the title and that's a gross misrepresentation. It's unfortunate in a way that academic titles such as this one do not receive the attention that popular titles do, as such biased ratings are probably quite common."},{"Title":"The Gender of Modernity","review":"Won't the Seventies ever come to an end?

Yet, it remains an important work for studying American literature in the 20th century, particularly if one is interested in expatriate Paris. The book spans from Caresse's childhood, through her marriages (including - especially - Harry Crosby), noteworthy tales of her \\"partners in crime\\" (Kay Boyle, Salvador Dali, etc.), and her work (as a book publisher, most particularly). After reading the book, one feels that Caresse is someone you can understand and anticipate, even if one cannot completely trust her.In terms of content, the stories are all probably at least partially true. There is the story of how Caresse invented the brazziere. There is the story of how she introduced Dali to the U.S. There is her account of how she attempted to introduce the concept of paperbooks via Crosby Continental Editions. Having been through the Crosby collections at Morris Library, Southern Illinois University, I can say that there is some truth to these stories. Yet, I never felt that I could completely trust Crosby's accounts, even if she has an amazing power to lull the reader (and quite a few of her acquaintences) into some sense of attachment.However, the basic history here is worthwhile. That is, even if it cannot be completely trusted, the residue of truth contained sheds new light on her wide group of influential friends. Moreover, there is a Hemingway-esque braggadocio in her writing - she is a fine author. If one takes her autobiography as a work of literature similar to Kay Boyle's thinly veiled autobiographical fiction (My Next Bride, etc.), then Crosby compares nicely. In fact, if viewed through the framework of fiction, one can easily extract the relevant history without being put off by Crosby's self-promotion.Overall, I recommend the book as either an introduction to the minor figures of 20th century expatriate Paris or as a work to round out a research library. I would also consider the work as worthwhile general reading: Crosby is an interesting writer, and her (and Harry's) exploits should never disappoint."},{"Title":"The passionate years.","review":"I ran across the name of Caresse Crosby when it was still Mary Phelps. My trawling of the internet led me, of course, to her wikipedia page to discover that she invented the bra, was a divorcee from upper society, and began her own publishing company the Black Sun Press. In need of further information about her, I decided her own words would be the best (or at least the first step) into learning more.She was a fascinating woman, and despite some of her poetic endeavors, is a wonderfully engaging prose writer. This book is more a memoir than an autobiography. She very clearly states that she is retelling these tales as she chooses to remember them, and her memories are both vivid and engaging. The scenes and situations include European royalty, the reigning intellectuals of the time, as well as the everyday folk and delve into the romanticism of the decades where surrealism, modernism, and Marxism were gaining ground. Her vivid imagery and attention to minute detail is extraordinary, considering some of here memories are scenes of her at age five or eight. The homes she lives through are a testament to their own times: from her grandfather's mansions on Long Island, to the apartment she shared with Harry in Paris, to the Moulin in the french countryside: each is a step in her evolution from rigidity and old world society rules to the reckless abandon of living life as a free-wheeling artist.Her life is often both inspiring and in many ways tragic.

Fitzroy's achievements in weather forecasting are little known, and his contribution to Darwin's education no doubt proceeds indirectly from the context of disciplined and meticulous scientific work in the Beagle's prime mission."},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"The father of weather forecasts and explorer of South America. Robert FitzRoy will be remembered by me. This book tells us about a great British aristocrat who gave more than he took. I love Patrick O'Brian and this could have been his but it is real story about a real person. FitzRoy was a remarkable man who history has pushed back to the shadows and labeled Darwin's Captain. FitzRoy, whose family is descended from Charles II, becomes a beloved British Man-o-war Captain, explorer, politician and eventual Vice Admiral. Mr. Gribbin gives us a picture of one of the last explorers and scientific innovators who charts South America, tries to support native rights in New Zealand and gives the world weather forecasting, yet is forgotten. His end did not justify his life. He was an amazing man who deserved more. He was faithful to his family, his country and religion. A good man and a great read."},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"This work, by John and Mary Gribbin, combines a deep respect for Robert FitzRoy and his achievements with sound research. The end result is a book that is accessible to anyone with an interest in this complex and multi-faceted man.Described by Charles Darwin as being 'A very extraordinary person', Robert FitzRoy served Britain as a naval captain (most famously as Captain of HMS Beagle), as a Governor of New Zealand, and in the field of weather forecasting.While covering the voyages of HMS Beagle, this book provides information on FitzRoy's governorship of New Zealand as well as his achievements in weather forecasting. Along the way, we obtain glimpses of the struggle between a greater understanding of science and a deep innate religious conservatism. Robert FitzRoy tragically took his own life a few months before his 60th birthday.A fascinating book about a fascinating man.Highly recommendedJennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"If not for anything else he did in his life, this man should be remembered for setting up the first weather forecasting service in England during the middle nineteenth century. That he was the Captain of the \\"Beagle\\" when Charles Darwin sailed on it as 'naturalist'; is not half as important as he was the one who set in motion the random currents that caused Darwin to be on the ship for its' full five year plus voyage.He was a remarkable man who because he was also humble and self-effacing never ended up getting the critical acclaim that his life's work demanded. His five year voyage on the \\"Beagle\\" resulted in the most detailed mapping of the South American continent from the Plate to Valpariso, and especially the area around Cape Horn and the Straits of Magellan. So detailed were his maps that they were used for over 100 years.During the voyage, he also determined all of the meridians and set-up their places on maps by which other sailors were able to determine their place anywhere on the earth at any time. Later, he devised a system by which ships could be signaled at sea that a major storm was brewing created the \\"gale warning\\" system. His work on meteorology was the first to use telegraphy to coordinate the capture of weather statistics so that information could be printed in newspapers the same day. He also devised the first two day weather forecasting, including the coining of the word 'forecast'.The story of his life and accomplishments is well written, and well documented, besides being entertainingly presented. Great Biography."},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"I got this book because I am playing Fitzroy in Timberlake Wertenbakers play After Darwin. It has a wealth of information on the good Captain and enabled me to find a pathway into his mind that would not have had otherwise. The combination of excepts from the Narrative, Sullivan and Usborne's journals, and the record of Darwin himself paint an honorable picture that Fitroy would have been happy with. The recounting of the loss of a ship to the Fuegians on the voage preceeding Darwin is particuary interesting."},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"This is a book that many readers have long awaited. References to Captain Fitzroy abound in many other biographies and in many history and seafaring books, and he has long fascinated me. There were some glimpses of Fitzroy in The Voyage of the Beagle, in the letters of Charles Darwin and in a recent book about Weather Forecasting (Attention All Shipping: A Journey Round the Shipping Forecast (Radio 4 Book of the Week)) by Charles Connolly where is was noted that after more than a hundred years the Captains work in creating Weather Maps was formally, if belatedly, recognized by renaming a forecast area in the Bay of Biscay as Fitzroy. But this life was needed to round-out the man, and John Gribbin has done exactly that, drawing a fuller picture of Darwin's Captain and his astonishing accomplishments as discover, seafarer and Governor of New Zealand. Fitzroy was a compassionate man, despite his \`black moods' and when asked if he expected trouble from the New Zealanders on his appointment he is said to have replied; \\"Only the whites.\\" In this he was right as his attempt to ensure fair treatment of the Maori infuriated many settlers and led to his recall.He rounded out an impressive career by virtually inventing the (still regrettably unreliable science of Weather Forecasting and Weather Maps particularly for Naval safety. Descended from an illustrious family, including one of the English Kings he terminated his own life, as did his father, by locking himself in his bathroom and slitting his throat with his razor.Gribbin has created a masterly account of this man of genius."},{"Title":"FitzRoy: The Remarkable Story of Darwin's Captain and the Invention of the Weather Forecast","review":"This book was interesting, but provided way to much detail. I had a hard time getting through it. However, I did learn a lot and was surprised by it. On the whole I was glad I read it, but would not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Metaphysics: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"Sosa and Kim have done it again. So far as I know, this is the single best anthology of contemporary metaphysics for advanced students in the field. It's coverage is broad, the readings have been carefully selected, and it touches on the most of the central areas of research in the area. Furthermore, this anthology is packed with papers that display the virtues of good analytic philosophy: patience in explaining the nature and importance of the issues, precision in exposition and description, clarity and honesty of argument, and carefulness in analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various positions.The subjects covered here are existence (ontological commitment), identity, modality, universals and properties, persistence through time, personal identity, causation, supervenience, and global realism vs. anti-realism. The aim of the individual sections on each of these questions isn't to provide a synoptic view of the positions in these areas. That, of course, simply couldn't be done in an anthology of this sort. The aim instead is to give the reader a sense of the positions defended in this area, to provide her with the outlines of a couple possible positions on each of the issues, and to give her the background to enter into the contemporary literature on the subjects.Still, this is not an anthology that is stuffed with introductory material by the editors themselves. Most of the sections begin with only a page or two of introductory material, and those few pages are expected to both introduce the basic issues in a few paragraphs and relate the readings included to the basic issues and to one another. However, many of the sections begin with a selection that does the work of introducing the basic issues on the subject as well as presenting a particular position on it. And, as is often the case in philosophy, many of the basic issues discussed don't need much motivation since they can be stated in a few words and since they concern questions that, on their face, are quite straightforward and simple. Some of the questions discussed here are: What is it for something to exist, and when do we have good reason to think something exists? What is it to be the same thing through time? What is it for me to be the same person through time? What is it for one thing to cause one another? Is there an objective reality?This is material that you need to know if you plan to do work in pretty much any area of philosophy. It doesn't seem that you can do much work in contemporary philosophy without encountering modal issues, supervenience theses, identity claims, general ontological issues, claims about the nature of properties, etc. All of these are extremely general, and they're of importance to meta-ethics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, the history of philosophy, etc. So you need to know something about this material if you're going to study just about anything in contemporary philosophy, and reading the selections in this volume would be a good place to start.The reader should know that this is emphatically not a historically anthology, that it's not a place to go for knowledge of the metaphysical views of the great philosophers. These are all contemporary readings. Nearly every election is from the last fifty years, and a good many of them are from the last twenty or so. So the focus of this anthology is on the sort of metaphysics that is being done in analytic philosophy right now. Also, unless you have a thorough grounding in other areas of contemporary philosophy, this is not an anthology I'd recommend for someone beginning study of the subject. While some of its selections should be accessible to anyone with an interest in this subject, many of them technical and philosophically sophisticated. Since many of these selections are journal articles or selections from book-length treatises on the issues, the authors often assume that the reader is coming to this material with a thorough grounding in the aims and methods of contemporary philosophy. So, before you try to tackle most of this anthology, I'd recommend reading an introductory text in contemporary metaphysics or at least doing some coursework in related areas of contemporary philosophy.This is an ideal anthology for courses surveying contemporary metaphysics that are aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduates. The only drawback is the fairly high price, but this book is certainly worth it if you're interested in this area of contemporary analytic philosophy."},{"Title":"Metaphysics: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"The value and use of metaphysics in a rationally empirical centered world is a question without answer. This compendium of essays by analytic philosophers, in the main, provide a vastly diverse scope of approach, as well as divergence of opinion. Jose Bernadette's Metaphysics: A Logical Approach offers a crisper view of the subject and its applications. For pedagogical purposes, any number of essays in this text easily supplement a first course by allowing students to pick their interest. This volume suffers from a lack of bibiolographic back matter, which reduces its usefulness in research."},{"Title":"Metaphysics: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)","review":"This book contains an excellent collection of essays on metaphysics, though it is not for the casual reader of philosophy.

I skimmed this book and felt no wonder, no desire to read further, and no incentive to remember what I had read so laboriously. It is a complete and utter bore.Fortunately, this style of writing has long since become obsolete.

This book isn't just about that, it explains how Joe got to the pros from Pop Warner football to the end of his career in football. I chose to read this book because I am really into sports and I wanted to read a book that was sports related. The main focus of this book is the hardships Joe faced to become a successful quarterback in the N.F.L.Joe had many amazing experiences throughout his football career and I will name a few. While Joe was in college he thought that his coach Dan Devine took all of the credit himself. It took Joe until the last game of his college career to get what he thought was the respect he deserved from his coach. In his last game, the Cotton Bowl, his team, Notre Dame, was down thirty-four to fourteen at half time, and Joe had the flu, but, the doctors put him on an I.V. and had him eating hot bowls of chicken soup since it was about ten degrees Fahrenheit outside. In the second half Joe led the team on an incredible come back to make the score thirty-four to twenty-eight and Notre Dame had the ball needing a touchdown to win. Joe marched them down the field to about the ten yard line with fifteen seconds to play, and Devine called for their tight end to run across into the end zone. Joe threw a perfect pass low and hard so he could dive for it and he dropped it. Joe went over to talk with Devine about what play they should run and Joe says \\"I want to run the same play.\\" Sure enough he does the same play, throws the same pass and the ball is caught! Joe learned that you have to work hard to earn peoples respect. This is important to Joe because he thought he deserved more credit than Devine gave him and after that Devine gave him all the credit.Another big event was when his wife Jennifer had their daughter, Alexandra. This was huge for Joe because she gave him a person to talk to after a game or practice to calm him down. He said \\"Even thought she can't quite understand me it makes me feel calm to talk to her. It's like being in a whole new world.\\" Joe learned that there can be another world almost where nothing bothers you and that's what he felt like around Alexandra.Probably one of the most important events in this book was the nineteen eight-five Super Bowl between the Forty-Niners and the Miami Dolphins or Joe Montana against Dan Marino. Everybody was talking about Dan Marino who had set the single season touchdown passes record that year with forty-eight touchdown passes, but Marino didn't do so great, throwing one touchdown but two interceptions for over three hundred yards. Joe won his second MVP and his second Super Bowl win. He learned that just because someone does something great one day or one season doesn't mean he will do it when it counts. This was important to Joe because it showed he was the NFL's best quarterback.Joe learned many things during his life and I think mainly he learned to be patient to get what you want. He also learned that if you want to achieve something if won't just come to you, you have to go out and grab it for yourself. I think that those are the main things he learned through his experiences."},{"Title":"Audibles My Life in Football","review":"I got this book ages ago because Joe Montana just amazed me with the 49ers.

I will examine just one of these to avoid spoiling the story. The scenario is that a domineering step-mother can totally enslave her children by malevolent strength of will. Yet, the oldest son manages to escape to local dances where he meets and falls in love with a girl who he eventually marries. The couple are enticed back into the family where he gradually sinks into total mental submission to his step-mother but his wife manages to keep her independent spirit whilst staying within the family. Clearly, the two situations are mutually unsustainable over a period of years. Either the new wife would succumb to the dominance of the step-mother like the rest of the family, or, more likely, her presence would act like a hole in a dyke affording an independent focus for the resentment of the family against their step-mother that would eventually destroy the malignant dominance.This, and other characteristic weaknesses in the plot development, are a shame as the repellent figure of the step-mother is excellently drawn at the superficial level. However, she does not stand up to scrutiny in the same way as other mental torturers in literature such as Buchan's Dominic Medina in the decidedly creepy, and highly believable, 'The Three Hostages'.The step-mother is, of course, murdered and the rest of the novel follows the standard Poirot formula with the expected twist at the end. An entertaining read that disappoints because the initial expectations are built-up beyond the ability of the author to deliver. Perhaps Christie deserves 4 stars for trying?"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Appointment with Death by Agatha ChristieBlack Dog & Leventhal Publishers, 1937255 pagesMystery; Hercule PoirotSummary: \\"You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?\\" is the dramatic first line of this book.

But shortly after, the terrifying matriarch of the Boynton family is found dead amid suspicious circumstances.Thoughts: It took forever for the woman to be killed. Almost half of the book is setting the scene, showing how each member of the family revolves his or her life around Mrs. Boynton and is terrified of her, excepting her daughter-in-law who is planning to leave her husband due to his cowardice in standing up to the mother. I was particularly interested in the psychology Poirot undertakes in order to understand their frames of minds during the period leading up to her death. I also liked that there are references to some of Poirot's other cases, including two that I have read.I loved Lady Westholme-she was funny and briskly efficient. I would have liked to see more of her. I did not like the romances in this book. Sarah and Raymond were lame, lame, lame, separately and together.SPOILERWhile I didn't expect to figure out the murderer, I hated that it was Lady Westholme, who was awesome.

What makes &quot;Appointment With Death&quot; stand out is that Christie does a psychological study on an entire family. The emotionally unbalanced Boyntons consist of the cruelly sadistic Mrs. Boynton, the near-schizophrenic daughter Ginevra, stepchildren Raymond and Carol who are eager to escape the confines of their stepmother, an older stepson Lennox and his wife Nadine who remains alone in being undisturbed by the influence of the terrible matriarch.The setting for this mystery is exotic Jerusalem where the Boyntons have come on holiday to visit the Holy Land. Christie excels in providing local color and this novel ranks among her best in that area.Perhaps no reader will be shocked that Mrs. Boynton is murdered or that Hercule Poirot just happens to be on holiday in the same area and agrees to assist the local police in solving the crime. What will be intriguing is the long list of suspects, motives, and opportunities. Also, in typical Christie fashion, will be a surprising twist that leaves the reader saying &quot;Now why didn't I see that coming?&quot; A great read filled with red herrings and the type of descriptive writing that Agatha Christie excels in.This book became popular with the release of the 1988 movie starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot and Lauren Bacall as Mrs. Boynton.

One his first night in Jerusalem he overhears a bit of conversation - \\"You do see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?\\" He assumes that he has heard two people collaborating on a book or play, smiles to himself as he muses that crime seems to follow him everywhere. Of course the conversation comes back to haunt him as he again crosses paths with the speakers.This is another of Christie's dysfunctional families, this time the problem parent is the mother instead of her usual tyrannical father. The Boynton family consists of Mrs. Boynton, grossly overweight, in poor health and whose chief occupation is to torment her family. She has three adult step children, Lennox (married to Nadine), Raymond and Carol and her own daughter, Ginevra. While on an excursion to Petra Mrs. Boynton dies leaving the question of natural causes or murder as the cause. If it is murder was it committed by one of the family or another member of the group?Poirot is consulted by a local offical to sort out the mess which of course he does but not without suffering the hardships of the desert - so hard on patent leather shoes!This 1937 novel is one of Christie's 'psychological' mysteries where much time is spent on motive and character development. The result is that by the end of the novel the reader feels personally acquainted with many of the characters. Also this is set in the Middle East where Christie spent much time herself and gives the novel an insight on the area and travel in those times. It is an excellent mystery, all clues are fairly laid out for the reader to sort out and still quite enjoyable and challenging nearly 70 years later."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"As in some of her books, Christie explores the issue of moral standards. Is it okay to kill someone if they are truly evil and oppress everyone around them? This is the case in a slightly unusual and intriguing book.Who would be so desperate to kill their mother and grandmother? The question stays at the center of the book as you realize each family member had ample motive. After all, the grandmother that was murdered controlled her relatives while slowly choking the life away...You will find yourself questioning the situation and wondering what you would do if you had to do something...as either the oppressed--or as the law.Christie takes this book beyond frivolous murder and into a perhaps even controversial set of events. It is worth reading as her efforts to produce an above-average mystery are apparent."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"In Petra, Mrs. Boynton, the thoroughly evil mother of several children, dies a mysterious death. Hercule Poirot is visiting and decides to help to locate the murderer. Poirot has inside knowledge, as he heard two of the Boynton children discussing the murder beforehand.One of my favorite Poirots."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Mrs. Boynton sorrowfully reached her \\"appointment with death\\" sooner than usual in Agatha Christie's enthralling book. The twisting plot and realistic characters keep you on the edge of your seat as you wade deeper into the unpredictable story. Agatha Christie's magic has once again weaved its way into one of her finest stories, Appointment with Death. Everyone is on their feet cheering the Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot, as he uses his \\"little gray cells\\" in order to determine not who would kill Mrs. Boynton, but who would not kill this old, cruel witch.The characters, although not my favorite part of this book, were unlike any I have ever read about before. Mrs. Boynton a cruel, power-hungry, old woman is hated by everyone in this enriching plot. She is a failure with a thirst for power that is fed by bossing around her family. Everyone has a reasonable motive for killing Mrs. Boynton, especially her \\"devoted\\" yet unhappy family. Hercules Poirot is the other main character in this book. He is possibly the most important. He is a Belgian detective who is extremely proud of two things, his mustache and his \\"little gray cells.\\" He sets out to examine the suspicious circumstances and bring the clever murderer into the spotlight.Murderers on the run with a brilliant Belgian detective hot on the trail... plots don't get much more exciting than that. This is the exciting plot expressed in Agatha Christie's Appointment with Death. The captivity faced by Mrs. Boynton's family, and the prospect of one of the family being the horrible murderer is almost too much to bear. One of the great things about the plot is that the emotion displayed pulls you into the story. This plot was so unexpected and complex that I was kept guessing as to the murderer's identity until the very end. The only way to truly express the feeling put into the plot is to say that Agatha Christie's light shines again.The only thing in this book that thoroughly disappointed me was the setting. It did not take away from the rest of the book, however, it did not add \\"wow\\" factor to the story. I felt like it was a normal everyday setting and that is not what I was looking for in Agatha Christie's book. The setting helped make the whole story more believable, but most mystery lovers are not looking for a realistic, believable book. Instead they are looking for an exciting thrilling book. I felt that Agatha Christie did not live up to her name with this setting.Appointment with Death was, overall, a thrilling mystery book. I was thoroughly delighted with Agatha Christie's effort and felt that her feelings showed throughout it. The plot and characters added a breathtaking \\"wow\\" factor that kept me up all night reading this book. The setting, although not bad, did not contribute anything unique to the book. Overall, it was a great book for mystery readers of all ages. Agatha Christie has done it again, creating one of the world's finest mystery stories."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"&quot;You see, don't you, that she's got to be killed?&quot;Hercule Poirot overhears those words as he travels. They are spoken by a young man named Raymond Boynton to his sister Carol. &quot;She&quot; is their stepmother, a hideous old woman with a talent for mental sadism. She keeps her stepchildren (and natural daughter, who is a schizophrenic) dangling like puppets, doing whatever she says. Lennox, the oldest, has retreated into mute uncaring, and his wife is threatening to leave him. Raymond has fallen in love with the beautiful Sarah King, and lovely young Jinny is beginning to go over the edge.Then Mrs. Boynton is killed. And Hercule Poirot must unravel not who would kill her, but who WOULDN'T kill her.This is one of those mysteries where the murdered person is so loathsome that even if you don't approve of the murder, you DO cheer when it happens. The plot is tight and complex, the characters are excellent, and the ending will surprise, shock, and satisfy you."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"This was my first Agatha Christie book, and I got it only after I realised that Hercule Poirot was the hero! Poirot has been the subject of a series of well acted TV programmes, each of which portrays one book. The actor who plays Poirot is superb and inspired me to read the books, hence my choice to buy &quot;Appointment With Death&quot;. My previous preference for Mystery books has been P.D.James, who is also excellent (Her book &quot;A Taste For Death&quot; kept me hooked from start to finish!)The book added to the TV version/image of Poirot but Agatha Christie's writing really makes you feel as though you were there. As I was reading about their trip to Jerusalem, I found myself feeling the heat and the pent up frustrations of the characters. I also came to intensely dislike the murder victim and I am sorry to report that I thought the mother should have been murdered years before!!The end had a good twist, and the epilogue is also great. I recommend this as a good buy, especially for a new Agatha fan."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Appointment With Death, is probably my personal favourite from all the Poirot mysteries. The atmosphere to the story is claustrophobic and stifling, and the setting of Jerusalem and the red city of Petra is just perfect for a murder mystery. (As are all her books set in the middle east)I first read this book four years ago, and even when i came to re-read it, the vile character of Mrs Boynton was still very much fresh and real in my mind. She is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable characters ever written. (By Agatha Christie or anyone else.)As with all the best Poirot stories (\\"Cat Among the Pigeons\\", for example) the detective does not really appear until later on in the book. This way we get more aquainted the characters, and when Poirot takes centre stage, it is more dramatic. Rather like him beeing the dark stranger who sweeps in, solves the puzzle, catches the killer, and them leaves once more. Much more mysterious and enigmatic.Sarah King is great, wonderful company to lead us into the first 100 pages, until the death.Th puzzle is simple, yet one of Agatha Christie's best. It is tightly constructed, with, as ever, brilliantly accurate psychology. The solution is very unexpected. It may not have an astounding solution like And Then there were None, or Murder On the Orient Express, but it does have one that is very realistic, and that you COULD guess, but never will.One of my very favourite Poirot novels, for the strength of its plot, the brilliance of it's psychology, and its solution."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"&quot;Appointment with Death&quot; definitely was different than any other Poirot mystery I have read but it was definitely a good read. The exotic location and superb developement of the characters made the book enjoyable and engaging. Certainly worth your while, especially if you are a Poirot fanatic."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"The reader for this 5-CD set (six hours total), Hugh Fraser, is terrific. I've listened to other Christie mysteries read by him and no one does a finer job. His performance onThe Mysterious Affair at Styles: Complete & Unabridgedwas nothing short of magnificent.Originally published as a mystery novel in 1938, the story here centers upon a former American prison wardress, Mrs. Boynton, who dominates her adult daughter, three step-children, and a daughter-in-law, in the same manner as she ruthlessly made lives miserable in her prison. In her old age and as a widow, she has become even more malicious and despotic and not one of her unfortunate clan dares to make the slightest move without first gaining her expressed permission to do so.On a trip to the Middle East, accompanied by her acquiescent family, Mrs. Boynton's malevolence achieves a new crescendo and, clearly as a consequence of her tyranny, she is subsequently found dead. While he is sympathetic to the plight of the now-freed family, renowned Belgian detective Hercule Poirot still investigates the incident at the behest of the authorities, especially after a world-famous French physician who was traveling with the Boyntons raises the specter of murder.There is no shortage of suspects in this dark tale and I doubt that most listeners will rightly guess who the killer is before s/he is revealed by the venerable Master Detective. Although Christie employed a few shrewd devices from previous works in this instance, she still did a fine job with this one.As far as I know, this is the only available audiobook of this Christie title. There is a VHS video version starring Peter Ustinov but I have yet to see it:Appointment With Death [VHS]. Unfortunately, I have not been able to locate the DVD format of this same film in Region 1 (United States) format.To summarize my review I can highly recommend this compelling audiobook mystery which springboards from the British \\"Golden Age\\" [of mystery writing]."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"This book has two parts. The first part is devoted to character development and to building the characters motives for murder. Poirot is mentioned only incidentally in this part. Not to worry though. The first half of the novel is actually interesting and moves along quickly. This is partly due to the brievity of the chapters. Part one ends with the suspected murder of the expected victim (the person everyone hates). Poirot dominates the second half with his usual confident flair. For the first time ever, I was able to correctly pick out the murderer in a Christie novel. That does not mean that this novel is predictable. It's very good and I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out for certain who the murderer was. My only complaint is that even after he knew who the murderer was, Poirot took three chapters of explaining to reveal that person's identify to a room full of suspects. Good novel. I would recommend it to any lover of mysteries."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"i thought this book was one of christie's best books right along 'and then there were none' and 'murder on the orient express'. it was almost the end before i figured out who was the killer and i can usually figure out who did it. again i say this was a very good book and i recommend it to everyone"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Although i agree with the other reviewers that this Christie is different from the others I still found it very enjoyable. For some reason i could not put this one down!"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"As a reader of many Poirot books this one seems some what dull. Unlike many of Christie book this case had almost no pychological aspects to it. The solution reminds me to much of Encyclopeida Brown. Also the marriage thing at the end was very pathetic. This is not the Agatha Christie I know and love."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"It's one of the most enthusiastic books of Agatha Christie. The facts are clean ( without any false clues ), and after reading it up to the end, you'll say (... as always in this author's great novels) &quot;but sure it is !&quot;. Besides these aspects, it's a good book because the story wraps up us with interesting characters and a terrific drama. Something rare at Agatha Christie's books. Most of time she worries a lot only how to surprise the reader at the end of the story. Fortunatelly this one is a exception. Take a look!"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"I'm a GREAT fan of Agatha Christie, &amp; this book started off with a wonderful plot. A lady obssessed with power, controls her whole family, in an almost uncanny way. They are unable to do what they want to do. This gives her an almost fiendish glee. Sarah King, a medical student, meets this american family on a trip abroad &amp; is sickened by the power she(the step-mother) holds over them. She falls in love with Raymond Boynton (the young son of the family), but tries in vain to attract his attention. Dr. Gereard, an eminent pshycologist, has his own views about the state of the American family. The other members of the family hate her(their step-mother) with all their heart, but are powerless to do anything. &quot;Why don't they just walk out??&quot; is a question which haunted me, &amp; Sarah King too, but it's impossible. And its even more impossible to believe that they've been so much hypnotised, that they're afraid to go against a single wish of their mothers. But till now, they've been living in seclusion &amp; so were unable to see the unnatural life they were leading. Once they travelled &amp; realised the horrible, prisoners life they were leading, their minds turned to rebel. On the day of Mrs Boynson's death, each one of them informed her that they had had enough, &amp; were moving away to lead their own lives. Then... came the news of her death. A seemingly natural death caused due to heart failure. Or so they think!! 5 people...all with a motive for murder. But who was desperate ( or mad) enough to kill?? Hercule Poirot is at his very best!! The not-modest detective promises the truth within 24 hours... And the truth is what you'll get...but only after reading the book. For my part, I'll say its not a bad book, but I expected the ending to be something sensational, after the way the story was progressing..But well..I think I've said enough. Judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"One of four Poirot classics in exotic locations (the others being Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, and Evil Under the Sun), Appointment with Death stands out as that with the most memorable plot. Among the Boynton children, everyone is a suspect, everyone lies, and it is up to Poirot to find the innocent. A crime in the rock city of Petra, in broad daylight, raises a most eerie feeling. Logically, the plot is most complex, where the same few events can be shuffled into so many permutations, only one of which can be true.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is the built in racism in some of the statements. I cannot be sure whether that is a reflection of Agatha's on racism towards browner people, or merely an accurate caricature of the British people of her time. Examples are references to Petra as a \\"natural wonder\\", as if the massive stone monuments are carved into precise architectural shapes by the forces of nature, rather than the ingenuity of the \\"natives\\". Other example are the constant annoyance of her characters by the lamentations of the Arab tour guides about Jewish immigration to Palestine, a real problem in 1938, in which the British government has played a central role. By dismissing the opinions of the Arabs in such jest, Agatha missed an opportunity to document what has continued to be, to this day, the root of many problems in the Middle East.Still, Appointment with Death is a masterpiece that is a product of its time."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"This is a pyschologically probing mystery that centers on a truly horrible old woman and her oppressed family.

Interesting family dynamics with the classic matriarch.A definite for Agatha fans; top 25% for others."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Mrs. Boynton is one of Agatha Christie's most memorable characters. She is an absolute tyrant who rules her family with fear and the possibility of losing her financial backing. She does not allow them to have contact with outsiders and even arranges a marriage for her oldest son when he seems inclined to seek out a bride. In a departure from the norm, Mrs. Boynton suggests a trip to Jerusalem and brings her family with her. They are accompanied by a family friend, two physicians, two ladies, and Hercule Poirot. Poirot overhears two of the adult Boynton children plotting to kill their mother and he uses this evidence as a beginning to investigate the eventual murder of the old lady. Everyone has a motive, as Mrs. Boynton was rude and obnoxious to everyone she met, so this case takes all of Poirot's deductive powers to figure out the actual murderer. This is classic Christie and as such it is one of the best Poirot books in the series."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"I have read most of Ms.Christie's books in my native language and after learning English I want to read some of them in English.This one is my first choice and I could recommend everyone..

There are other Christie books that are more exciting or more clever than this, but she is in top form here. Characterizations have a bit more psychological depth here than in her other books; the monstrous mother and the near-psychotic daughter, in particular, stand out as memorable creations.Read the book and the play; Christie adapted the novel for the stage herself, and made two changes: she removed Poirot, and changed the identity of the murderer. Typical of Christie, both versions of the story work equally well."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Like all of Agatha Christie's books this one is very good.

In truth, the conversation is being shared in deadly earnestness between two siblings Raymond and Carol Boynton in relation to their sadistic, tyrannical mother. The extended Boynton family, including son Lennox Boynton and his wife, Raymond and Carol, and youngest sister Ginevra, are traveling throughout the Middle-East on a holiday that revolves around their mother/stepmother/mother-in-law's whims and wishes.This attracts the strong dislike of fellow travelers, including Sarah King (who has her eye on Raymond) and Theodore Gerard, both doctors, who train their professional eye on the American family. Psychologically examining them in a way that is quite fascinating, they come to the conclusion that Mrs Boynton is a manipulative, domineering woman who gets sadistic pleasure out of the control she wields over those around her. Together the doctors establish the mindset of the apathetic Lennox, the rebellious Nadine, the despairing Raymond and Carol, and little Ginevra, who escapes her mother by entering an internal fantasy world. Sarah eventually confronts the malignant old woman, and gets a strange threat in reply: \\"I've never forgotten anything - not an action, not a name, not a face.\\"Then, as the traveling party moves from Jerusalem to Petra, the Red Rose City, (beautifully described thanks to Christie's own travels with her archeologist husband), Mrs Boynton uncharacteristically lets her family leave her unattended for an afternoon and evening. When dinner is called, Mrs Boynton is found dead.It would seem somewhat straightforward - Mrs Boynton suffered from heart trouble, and after the exertion of the day, it's unsurprising that she would pass away in the heat. But Doctor Gerard is not entirely convinced, particularly when he realizes that one of his hypodermic needles has gone missing) and calls in none other than Colonel Carbury and Hercule Poirot to look over the situation.Promising a solution in less than twenty-four hours, Poirot interviews the suspects, wades through the mass of contractions, confusions and lies (including an egregious timeline in which several people spoke to Mrs Boynton *after* Sarah King claims she must have died) and - sure enough - knows exactly what happened by the deadline he set for himself.Although this is not one of Poirot's/Christie's best cases, it is still an ingenious mystery with strong characterization in regards to its victims and suspects. \\"Appointment with Death\\" is more of a psychological thriller, in which the personalities, behaviour and motivations of each Boynton family member is carefully diagnosed by Gerard and Sarah. Mrs Boynton in particular is a horror of a character, described as \\"a monstrous swollen female Buddha\\" and whose power and influence extends out even from beyond the grave. She's enough to give you nightmares.There have been two film adaptations of this novel, one starring Peter Ustinov:Appointment With Death [Region 2] (which remains faithful to the storyline), and the other as part of the Hercule Poirot BBC series starring David Suchet (which makes drastic changes and omissions in the story, though is still an entertaining watch)."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Once again, Christie has written a mystery with an ending I didn't see coming. This time, I can't decide if I think she left enough clues to lead to the culprit, however. Normally, I find myself saying \\"oh, yeah!\\" as I read the outcome, but this time I thought it was a little shaky. But, as usual, Christie does a beautiful job fleshing out the characters of a well-rounded cast, with plenty of doubt cast among almost all of them. I changed my mind a few different times as to the possible outcome, but still didn't get it right!I love that Christie devotes pages and pages of detail leading up to the murder, rather than just starting the book out with the murder then recounting everything that had happened through the various characters' eyes. I find myself always paying close attention to what is happening and storing away possible useful information, just waiting for Poirot to start his investigation. This particular book also had an epilogue that I thought was interesting and I appreciated it for this story. Despite what I think may be a lack of evidence to point towards the culprit, I think that anyone who likes mysteries would enjoy this book. Agatha Christie never fails to please!(Additional Note: My actual rating is 4-1/2 stars but I round up for sites like Amazon.)"},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"I was very surprised at the exceptional condition of the book. It really is wonderful to be able to aquire books from so many different places when, up till now, I've been unable to get them from conventional book stores."},{"Title":"Appointment with Death (A Hercule Poirot Mystery)","review":"Agatha Christie is well-known for the twists that are in her mystery stories, but should receive just as much renown for her psychological examinations within certain mysteries. \\"Appointment With Death\\" is much more the psychological study of a family and those involved with them, than it is with the murder at the heart of the story. Therefore, the novel is heavy on character development and motive for murder, and lighter in terms of mystery and crime.Mrs. Boynton was a mental sadist, a woman who loved holding her family captive to her every whim and fancy, allowing them no freedom of thought or action. Enclosed in their own world and oblivious to any difference, a trip to Jerusalem finally makes her children aware of how miserable their lives are. Two of the children come to the conclusion that she must be killed, especially to protect the youngest child, but hardly know how to carry out the deadly act. So when their mother is found dead (and murder is believed) all of the children are immediate suspects to Hercule Poirot, but also among each other.\\"Appointment With Death\\" is as fast-paced as any of Christie's other works. Hercule Poirot is more of a minor character until the latter part of the book when he pieces together all of the evidence to arrive at the truth of who killed Mrs. Boynton. The chapters in which he lays out motive and means for the innocence and guilt of each member of the Boynton family is both exhilarating and frustrating, but it shows the remarkable plotting that Christie had to explain the criminal elements in her books. While not the best Poirot mystery, \\"Appointment With Death\\" is an enjoyable read with plenty of motives to keep the reader guessing the identity of the culprit."},{"Title":"Sugar Town: Hawaii Plantation Days Remembered","review":"This is a great book. It was brought to my attention by the grandmother of one of my fourth grade students. She told me &quot;Take it home over the weekend and relax&quot;. How right she was. Reading this book will give you a realistic idea of the life style of Hawaii's sugar plantation camps, particularly on the Hamakua Coast of the island of Hawaii. The author, Yasushi &quot;Scotch&quot; Kurisuwas born, grew up and worked in Hakalau, one of the plantation communities on the Hamakua Coast. He possesses great insight and shares this with many anecdotal accounts of life at this time and place. It is well written and easy reading. I had a difficult time putting it down. I needed to return the book to the owner, so now I am purchasing my own copy. It is one of those books that you can read over many times, and still enjoy and learn from it. If you have an interest in the times of the sugar plantation camps in Hawaii, you should add this to your reading collection."},{"Title":"Outside Looking In","review":"There's virtually no \\"plot\\" here as such. The \\"action\\" switches (frequently!) between various residents of the English village of Aston Favell. Be prepared to spend a lot of time being inside each of their heads as they reflect on where they are in life. The author handles that well, but the story unfolds in (to me) a rather non-linear fashion that way."},{"Title":"The Voice Of The Dolls","review":"This was a good short mystery.

The Author had not heard of DNA sexing which is now the considered norm. This fact immediately made the book obsolete as far as I was concerned."},{"Title":"Conures","review":"This is a good book in some of it's own ways. I think it should have more info about each of the different conures. I own a pair of green cheeks and they are not rare nor are they expensive. They are the cheapest of the conures.

All of the stories collected in this volume are true stories of real people who were attacked or killed by mountain lions. It is written in an energetic style that really puts the reader into each of the scenes. There are graphs that describe the number and demographics of recent trends involving human-puma encounters. Probably of most interest though is that fact that the writers of this book do not approach mountain lions from a tree-hugger perspective, which is rare for book on mountain lions. It is an exciting read, and some of the chapter titles may give you an indication of the kind of mountain lion book this is (for example, \\"Profile of the Killer\\"; \\"A Father's Nightmare\\"; \\"Hunting the Truth\\"; \\"Into the Jaws of Death\\"; \\"Stalked\\"; and \\"Hard Truths\\" to name just a few).Most of the stories are re-created as though you're there on the trail with these people as they're attacked: Barbara Schoener, for instance, when she was attacked and killed near the American River on the Western States Trail. Or there with Cindy Parolin when she wrestled with a cougar to save her six-year-old son. Or the Cuyamaca State Park stories near San Diego with ranger Laura Itogawa where mountain lions seem to be unusually aggressive and have attacked people a number of times.This book dispels many of the popular myths, most of which ironically, have sprung up because of conservationist efforts in the past fifty years. Because I live in a remote area of Arizona and I often go for long-distance jogs alone, I can not tell you how helpful (and welcome) this book was. Most other cougar books I researched painted the mountain lion out to be a wonderful, beautiful animal and glossed over the very real facts (some times quite literally with beautiful photographs) that this animal has attacked nearly 60 people in the US and Canada since 1986.Despite the fact that cougar numbers are at their all-time highest in 150 years, the general belief is that the animal is endangered. This book offers a very different perspective in the question as to who really is the endangered species.Stacey CochranAuthor of CLAWS available for 80 cents"},{"Title":"Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country","review":"fo ay one inerested in the subject this book is a great read. it picked up momentum until I couldn't put it down.

The details are heartbreaking and it would've been easy to come away with a very bleak picture of cougars.But &quot;Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country,&quot; tells the stories objectively. It teaches readers about lions and the problems they face. It also brings to light the growing problem of cougar attacks and the risks we face if we live in cat country.My only knock on the books is there isn't more information from Maurice Hornocker, the world's leading expert on mountain lions. It would've been interesting to hear his theories on how we can strike a balance with the wild cats.Overall, it was an interesting read with plenty of biology and tons of stories that made me -- a long-time hunter and angler -- say: &quot;There but for the grace of God, go I.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country","review":"This book is a needed dose of reality for those who venture into lion (cougar) country. It is well reseached and documented with the details of fatal and non-fatal lion attacks. The book also has a lot of good research data on lions and their behavior that is informative. As the authors admit these attacks are unusual but they do occur, and the information given in public service brochures on being safe in lion country is not as helpful as one might be led to believe. Having hunted lions on several occassions and been stalked and hunted by one of them on one occassion makes it refreshing to read a well documented account of the darker side of some of these cats. If you spend any time at all in lion country, even a short hike from your car along a park trail, you need to read this book."},{"Title":"Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country","review":"This book is full of helpful research and terrifying stories. My son and I both had cougar encounters in 1999 and felt lucky to escape injury. Our story is reported on pages 173,174 of the book. The account is accurate and to the point with no embelishment or distortion.After reading the book I felt reassured that encounters (and even sightings) are so rare. Never-the-less the impact of our encounter will live with us forever. The deep forest is not so comfortable after a person has been face to face with a mountain lion.I have heard from two different big cat tamers, that high pitched air horns are very effective in driving big cats away. They train lions, tigers, and leopards. They report that a boat horn with compressed air is used by them when they get into dangerous situations. That's pretty cheap...insurance. Reportedly does not work on bears though. They assume it's a threat. This should have been mentioned in the book."},{"Title":"Cat Attacks: True Stories and Hard Lessons from Cougar Country","review":"\\"Cat Attacks\\" investigates the nature of the growing number of strange and terrifying encounters of ordinary people with wild cougars. Too many of these incidents are full-scale, blitz-like attacks on unsuspecting people, especially children, out to enjoy the bounty of the great outdoors. Virtually all these attacks end, if not in the death or injury of the people involved, then in a serious loss of their sense of security and well-being through the shear terror of what they endured. \\"Cat Attacks\\" proves once again that not only is reality stranger than fiction, but more captivating too.People have forgotten the dangers that cougars present since their numbers have been so severely decimated through centuries of extermination. Once their range extended across the entire country. Cougar attacks were once almost unheard of and many people now seem to assume they present no real danger. However, since 1990 attacks have been steadily on the rise.Like the setting in a fictional horror story, the people attacked in \\"Cat Attacks\\" were engaging in innocent, everyday activity: jogging, hiking, sleeping, picking mushrooms, watching birds and cross country skiing. The children were walking to school, running track, horseback riding, clinging to their parents in the presence of a park ranger and one was even riding inside a camper with his family! None of these people suspected the imminence of life threatening danger.The authors explain that cougars are virtually silent and attack so quickly witnesses report only a blur. Most victims never know danger is present until they are hit hard usually from behind. The animal bites the back of the victim's neck trying to cut the spinal column while pinning the victim with its claws. If the attack is successful, the victim is dragged away by the head in the cougar's mouth. Some people are still conscious as they are being eaten alive.I read this book to make sense of my own unexpected cougar encounter, which occurred by remarkable coincidence the same month this book was published in June 2001. I was near the end of the Lost Mine Trail in the Chisos Mountains in the Big Bend National Park, Texas. Having a bad hip and being unsure how far and fast I can hike, I go alone so I won't slow others down. [Big mistake! See page 109.] I only had a bottle of water, a trail map and two canes with me. After three hours or so I made it to the end of trail-it was spectacular-and had started back down. Suddenly I looked up and there was this huge monster, killing-machine mountain lion crossing the trail about 30 yards in front of me! Good God! 30 yards! I was hours away from safety. I did not run [Good move! See page 109.], but remained still. He had massive legs and huge jaw muscles! He could have easily killed me and dragged me away to be eaten [See chapters 1 and 14], but by shear chance he was not interested [A probable low risk encounter. See page 180.]. Without betraying any fear, he crossed my trail and slowly meandered down the ridge and out of view. Going into the wilderness will never be the same again.\\"Cat Attacks\\" is a very disturbing book. It set my own experience in context. It is informative and well written. With protection cougar populations are rising and ranges expanding; encounters are expected to increase. Anyone who lives in or near cougar country should read this book. Even people who live in cities are not completely safe. In 1992 a cougar ran into the underground parking garage of the opulent Victoria Hotel in downtown Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.

Weil gives examples of patients who have been healed despite medical failures, proof that the human body is capable of curing itself, an idea that Weil describes repeatedly in the book and that can give hope to all patients whom modern medicine has failed.

It is more complete in that instead of ending with a sermon (The edification to be found in the thought that before God we are all in the wrong)as does Either/Or, it actually explores the religious sphere, the highest sphere of existence in Kierkegaard's schema. As in all of Kierkegaard's writings, this is not an abstract exploratiton of the spheres, but is embodied in characters, the most characters in any of Kierkegaard's work. It is an alarmingly complex and aggravating work. The aggravation comes in with the characters occassionally demanding to know whether the reader has a life and how can s/he possibly waste his time with drivel like this. The work is divided into three parts, one for each sphere. The aesthetic sphere is represented by a updating of Plato's Symposium, with Kierkegaard repeating a number of pervious characters, (Constantine Constantinus, Victor Eremita, the Young Man, Johannes the Seducer) and introducing a new character, the Fashion designer. The subject of the speeches: Women. The second part, presenting the Ethical sphere, heralds the return of Judge William from the second part of Either/Or, this time uncomfortably sandwiched between the Aesthetic and the religious spheres. In Either/Or he is smug, but in this book he cannot pretend his position has any kind of ultimacy. The Religious calls his position constantly into question. The ethical is the relative, the religious the absolute. The Ethical claims we should repent our sins, while the religous claims that all the sins of the world are our sins, and not only collectively, but individually. We must repent the sins of the entire world. This is something the ethical cannot accept. The Religious sphere is represented by &quot;Quidams's Diary.&quot; This is a repetition on the &quot;Seducer's diary&quot; which ends the first half of Either/Or. This time, however, the principal is a sufferer instead of a predator. He is hopeless, sad and sorrowful having just ended an unhappy love affair. This sorrow launches him beyond the ethical into a dark night of the soul. The Diary entries are interpursed,on the fifth of each month (Kierkegaard was born on the fifth of May) by brilliant little stories which comment on the process of the soul's healing. Frater Taciturnus (Brother Silent, perhaps related to Johannes de silento of Fear and Trembling?) also provides a commentary. The problem with the book is that once Kierkegaard claimed that he wanted his reader to expend as much effort reading his books as he did in writing them. He has made sure in this case that he would achieve this goal. If it weren't for the quality and overwhelming wealth of the content, this one wouldn't worth it. As it is, you should probably read the earlier books of Kierkegaard's authorship first. With this one, you need all the help you can get."},{"Title":"Stages on Life's Way: Studies by Various Persons (Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol. 11)","review":"This book moves from comic fiction to beautiful oration, to intense tragedy, to accessible philosophical analysis--in that order. I can say about the first section: I laughed out loud. You don't think about that with Kierkegaard, but he was a writer's writer--could have been anything. Concerning the second section, I read a portion during a best man speech and it brought people to tears. The pastor requested a copy. And for the last two sections, it was hard going; so tragic to see a mind fall apart in fiction, and then to have it explained. But SK was, as is said above, explaining his theory of existence-spheres, which is a surprisingly down-to-earth concept of great usefulness to anyone. SK is consistently misinterpreted by philosophy buffs, but I tell you from experience, if you live his writings alongside him, you will understand and be the better for it. SK is a St. Paul for our time, and because of this book I dodged a few bullets: big ones! SK has four types of books: propositional (e.g. this one), psychological (e.g. The Concept of Anxiety), polemic (e.g. the Moment essays), and homiletic (e.g. Without Authority), and ALL fall under the category of inspirational. Look up his self-written epitaph. May he rest in peace, and he writes peace to those who genuinely seek it in Christ; thus he is often misunderstood as just another \\"philosopher.\\""},{"Title":"Stages on Life's Way: Studies by Various Persons (Kierkegaard's Writings, Vol. 11)","review":"For a long time, _Stages on Life's Way_ sat atop the list of my favorite books of all time. This book is a gut-wrenching account of Kierkegaard's tragic problems with women, and is a vivid portrait of a man who is snake-bit in his love life. I can especially relate to this book, being that I am not married, most likely never will be married, and am singlemindedly obsessed with sitting around reading philosophers like Kierkegaard and Jung. I can honestly attest that I broke up with the love of my life, with no regrets, just because she was preventing me from reading as much Kierkegaard as I would have liked. And this is eerily similar to Kierkegaard's own experience in this book.Although this book still qualifies as non-fiction philosophy, it often has an autobiographical, and sometimes outright ficticious feel to it. This ultimately enhances the readability of the book, because it often refers to situations inspired by the author's own experiences; these real-life situations then help to exemplify and clarify Kierkegaard's key concepts. It is frustrating to read authors who expound one abstract theory after another and never bother to set-up a realistic situation in which these human-behavioral concepts might come into play. Kierkegaard is almost never guilty of doing this. His style is always firmly grounded in reality, and is thereby more readily translatable than most other authors from the same time period.I highly recommend this book to anyone out there, especially someone who, like myself, has found himself torn between a philosophy-centered avocation and a love life which always seems to be trying to tear us away from our real passions and duties. If I could give it 6 stars I would. Unconditionally recommended."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"OK. I confess. I liked this series enough to order the last book from Amazon in the UK, just so I wouldn't have to wait for it. (I also saved myself a couple bucks because it was available in paperback there). That having been said, I found this book at times wonderful and at others god-awful, just like the other two books in the series.If you haven't read the first two books, then you need to know that this series involves a one-armed genius who is a combination fightin' and rock climbin' machine and also the liberator of his world. The inhabitants of the world (Nulapeiron) live in an extensive series of caves that honeycomb the entire planet.The first book covers the protagonist's rise from rags to riches (and back down to rags again) as he battles the ingrained caste system of his world. The second book covers the fight against an energy creature called \\"The Blight\\" which is gradually taking over the world. The last book involves the battle against the Blight's Daddy, the Anomaly.One of the saving graces of this book is the story-within-the-story, which consists of a series of vignettes which take place about 200 years from our own time, and which cover the creation of a race of uber-mensch called The Pilots. The Pilots have the ability to throw lightning bolts from their eyes and can exist in the sub-basement of the universe called \\"Mu-Space\\". You spend all three books trying to figure out how this story is going to move the main plot-line along.One of the reasons I bought this book is because Charlie Stross (whose fiction I adore) recommended it as great \\"hard Science Fiction\\". It is not. If that is what you are looking for, don't shop here. It is techno-gibberish through and through. If you want great hard Science Fiction, stick with Charlie.This book is much more a science fantasy, a space opera, with futeristic deus ex machina geegaws. About the time that you start reading about people with the ability to warp space and time, and who use \\"femtatech\\" (one million times smaller than nano - COOL!) you know that you need to let out the clutch on your suspension of disbelief and let it ride.What to say about this book? It's like Bill Baldwin's Helmsman series, but without the well-rounded characters and scientific grounding (that's sarcasm, if you're not familiar with the series). Hey, don't get me wrong - I LIKE space opera. I own ever Helmsman and \\"Sten\\" book made, and eagerly await more. However, good space opera this is not. If you want THAT, try Julian May's Many Colored Land series.In summary - this book has lots of mediocrity interspersed with enough periods of brilliance to make you grind you teeth and cry out for a better editor. It IS a page turner, though. Wait for it to come out in paperback, read it with your bedroom door closed and don't admit you ever read it."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"This is the final installment in the Nulaperion trilogy and the story of Tom Corcorigan. The revolution and the invasion of the Blight has come and gone and Tom is now together again with Elva. He is also the sole recepient of the wisdom in the severed head of the seerer Eemur. The head is severed, but still strangely alive and able to see the present with a searing clarity which she passes onto Tom.However, there is a new threat on the horizion that will make the revolution/invasion in book 2 look like a child's play-pen, and Tom is proably the only person who can pull all of Nulapeiron together to fight it before they loose their world to a galaxy spanning engulfing darkness.This was a satisfying conclusion to this series. It ties together the threads in books 1 & 2 and we finally get to see why the pilots story is so important to both Tom and his world and those fighting The Anomaly. All 3 books are told on a mythic scale of story-telling, but they do tend to fall into a bit of a noticable plot pattern at times. However, despite that I was egar to finish this series and was glad I read it. A keeper to be re-read at another time in the future, and a sci-fi series that successfully combines myth with science."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"OK, I liked the book, but only \\"OK\\".This is the conclusion of a trilogy. As such, much of the backstory has already been told, and you don't need or expect as much backfill and explanation. But even saying so, this volume felt a little thin compared to the sheer magesty of the first two. Like even the author was a bit tired out and just wanted to wrap it up and go home.As I write this, also, only the first and third books are available on Kindle. Um, publisher, what freaking sense does that make???? As a result I re-read the first two on paper before switching to this one.Note also that this author uses a lot of non-standard paragraph formatting to indicate things like machine communication (headers/footers) and internal dialog and the like. Not all of that comes across cleanly in the Kindle edition. Had I not read the first two on paper I might have wondered if the OCR program was just having a fit the day they converted this novel."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Anomalous interlude.Tom, now a respected, if broke figure has one main concern - that something worse than the Blight is coming.You could almost say this book is two novels, as each chapter alternates between Tom's story and the story of the McNamara Pilot family and the establishing of Pilot society, until they briefly intersect in the latter part of the novel.The death of a friend leaves Tom with more resources, and the rest of the planet realises that they need him to lead their defenses again the attack. The rest of Tom's story is fragments and pieces and glimpses of what he has to do, with Eemur's head helping and his not-so-human insights into other times.The style of Tom's story you could perhaps compare to Modessit's Lerris story in Recluce, in an SF version, that sort of tone.A pretty good SF novel, I'd go so far as 3.75 for this one, I think.3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"In Resolution, the third book of the 'Nulapeiron Sequence' trilogy, the war against The Blight has ended and the Nulapeiron people have a chance for peace except for Tom Corcorigan, revolutionary and war hero, who knows threats remain.

Only Tom's forces have a chance against such an invader because Tom is a warlord who is no longer human Resolution concludes the trilogy of tales featuring Tom and is a top pick for prior fans."},{"Title":"Resolution","review":"Paradox, the first book in this series, was chock-full of ideas and story. There was some violence, but it advanced the story. Context, the second book, had fewer ideas and more violence. Resolution is chock-full of blood and gore, and very little story.It does explain how the world got the way it was, but the explanation feels pro forma. The main character becomes more and more cardboard - painted in lurid colors. The action is also lurid, and the reader's emotions are force-fed.I'm sorry I read it. Read Paradox - it's really quite good. Maybe read Context. But if you like Context less well than Paradox, don't read Resolution at all - just go online and find a plot summary with spoilers."},{"Title":"The Man Who Listens","review":"This is a truly excellent read, with a 'twist' to the end of each story presented. Although to reveal the 'twist' might spoil the reading. It is a path and a lesson for life's journey - both for living the journey and being a true friend and encouragement to those in need or suffering."},{"Title":"The Man Who Listens","review":"\\"Taylor Caldwell has written a modern religious novel about an idealist who builds a remarkable chapel - no minister, no congregation, no service, merely a quiet, comfortable room with drawn curtains behind which sits the man who is ready to listen to the troubles of all who care to come there. In this revealing and moving novel, all kinds of people come for help - the neglected wife, a factory worker who is thinking of deserting his family, a negro who has lost his faith in God, to mention a few. Miss Caldwell's talents are again well demonstrated in a story which will inspire readers by its simple eloquence.\\""},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"Before I came across Inverloch online, I had regarded webcomics as being forgettable, dime-a-dozen newspaper strips without the paper (and a vast majority of them are just that). However, Sarah Ellerton's amazing accomplishment opened my eyes to the fantastic talent that the internet, as an artisitic medium, can showcase.Simply put, Inverloch (both as a whole and in the form presented in Volume One) is a graphic novel that any American or Japanese comic company would be proud to publish. And yet, its not authored by a committee of experienced writters, illustrated by a master inkist, or funded by a major company. Instead, it is the work of a single, dedicated woman.The most striking thing about the work is the sheer quality of the art on every page. Backgrounds are intricate and brilliantly textured. Characters, human, elf, and goat-dog da'kor alike, are sharp and detailed from every perspective. The mood of each chapter is expretly enhanced by pacing, lighting, and angle, be it the soft simplicity of a peaceful da'kor village, the uncertain dimness of a overgrown forest, or the dreary hostility of a distant human town.Additionally, Inverloch's story, though relatively simple (or so it seems), captures and modifies well the fantasy style of Tolkien and other great authors, creating a believably unbelievable world that begs for further investigation. The plot is easy to follow without being overly simplistic, and is well supported by a full cast of characters, many of whom remain unintroduced by the conclusion of this first volume. As such, this book does feel somewhat imcomplete, but it is nonetheless worthy of purchase by anyone with even a passing interest in fantasy; after all, even the greatest of epics must be begun somewhere."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I, too, fell in love with Inverloch online. While I read several webcomics, I would recommend it to anyone who even slightly enjoys fantasy stories. It really is incredibly well thought out, enjoyable, and even epic compared to almost every other webcomic. It's definitely a must-read.However, that being said, I was a little bit disappointed with the published volume. The print quality is great, and it's nice to see a larger version of the pages than on my computer screen. Still, considering you can read the whole comic for free online, I kind of hoped she might redraw more pages for the actuall book. She did do the first five, but a similarly newly published webcomic went the extra mile and redrew EVERYTHING. Granted, Inverloch had a very solid first volume to begin with, and didn't need a total redraw as badly, but Ms. Ellerton's art evolved so much that I hoped she might bring certain pages (or even just key panels) into closer harmony with her current drawing style. In particular, Lei'ella, a character who appears at the end of the volume, is in facial features almost unrecognizable compared to her current, vastly improved attributes.Anyway, that's just a minor nit-picky note, which resulted in my grade of 4-stars instead of 5. Having a printed version makes it easier to convince my friends to read it; a published comic has a lot more 'street cred' than a webcomic. It is, in the final analysis, an amazing comic that definitely deserved to be printed."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I first read the comics online and fell in love with them in no time, after reading them for a few months I decided to check out the rest of the site coming across the order page and was more then happy to see that two volumes of this very awesome comic were available. I ordered both, they quickly came and were read even quicker.A great read, deals with many different situations like predjudice and racism with that good ole fantasy twist.Huge recommend to everyone!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"The only reason why I haven't rated this 5 stars is because it gets even better in the future. Inverloch, read by many (including myself) as a webcomic, offers a refreshing usage of fantasy, dealing with Elves, Wizards, but also creatures invented by the artist. Such as the main character for this volume, a Da'kor.The artwork in this comic is amazing (again, only gets better in the future of the comic) and the characters are entirely believable.Even if you have read every single page as a webcomic, this is totally worth buying, as it's such a good story and having it on paper only adds to the intensity of it! New to Inverloch or not, this is a must-buy for any lover of fantasy!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"This is the print version of a web comic. In web form, this comic has consistently ranked in the top 10, usually at the top spot, and with good reason. The art is lovely, and the story is one that has clearly been carefully mapped and thought out. Also, I have seen a few forums in which the author has moderated, and she presents herself as a thoughtful and considerate person. In other words, you're buying a product from someone nice - always a plus.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"Well worth the money, it's great to have such a high quality book available for when I want to look back on the comic without going online."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I have been following Inverloch online for a while now, ever since my friend told me it was a good webcomic. She was wrong. Inverloch is beyond good, and into the realms of amazing, incredible, and most definitely one of the best things I have ever read. The art is breathtaking, the storyline gripping, and you become completely invested in the characters.If I had one negative thing to say, it would be that Volume 1, while fantastic and having some extremely heartwrenching, touching moments, is not one of the most engaging when compared to the later volumes, especially since Sarah's art improves drastically with time. However, I would much rather read even a slightly less interesting first volume of Inverloch that just about any other manga or book on the market today."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I've been reading Inverloch online since the first 20 pages. I loved it so much, and was so drawn in, I had to take another look. I've come to Volume 4 online and have absolutely fallen in love with the characters. I'm hoping to see the rest of this wonderful comic on Amazon, so that I can own it for myself.The characters are detailed, they have their ups and downs, but all stick together. Even some of the villians I've come to love. This is an adventurous story that I can't stay away from. The artwork is beautiful, the plot amazing, there is no way to rate this but with 5 stars+!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I have read the first installment of this wonderful graphic novel online and would buy it in a heart beat to own a physical copy of it! It's a story that keeps you engaged and wanting to turn page after page (or click page after page online!) to see what happens. The main disappointment (at least online, I am hoping this is rectified in this volume) is that the story isn't over in the first installment (online at least-don't know yet about the book), and leaves the urgency to read further installments from this artist all the more pressing.It's an excellent story and would make for a great movie, if anybody thought of making one."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I have been following this webcomic online for some time now and I would say that it is one of, if not THE best webcomic out there. Amazing story line that pulls the reader into the world of Inverloch. The art is absolutely beautiful with attention to detail that many artists out there tend to miss. Readers will be drawn to the character's stories and personalities as they find themselves on a never-ending adventure to discover what really happened to a mysterious young elf lost in the past. I recommend this to EVERYONE, whether young or old. I can't wait to buy it!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I've been reading the online version since my friend first introduced me to it.

I just couldn't stop because it was so good."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"Inverloch is the first serial webcomic that I ever got in to. I was very excited to have it in hard copy. Some of the early artwork was redrawn from what was online and though I was leery with messing with \\"perfection,\\" I really liked the redrawing. Check out the webcomic online, and if you like it, grab it in hard copy!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"...because you'll want to read it again and again. The story, originally published on Sarah's page as a webcomic, makes a fantastic book. Glossy pages showcasing Sarah's art bring a detailed, lush world to life through the lives of Acheron and his friends. This isn't a thin volume, and it's only the first half of the story! Extras in the back make the purchase worth it, although you can still read both parts online.I bought this to support a great artist, because mainstream fantasy/fiction hasn't been catching my interest lately. Try it for yourself, and see what you've been missing!"},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"I had Inverloch bookmarked for weeks before I finally decided to start from the beginning. My husband had been reading it for a while, and it finally drew me in as soon as I looked at the first page.The artwork is top notch, which is something that can't be said of some comics when they're starting out. The story is evolving, but you can tell that Ellerton actually PLANNED the story, at least an outline, before she started. Too often webcomics seem like they have an idea, but no set plot to speak of. I'm very happy this isn't the case here, because it makes the storytelling so much tighter and more admirable.I work at a bookstore, and literally the second this came out of the box with our shipment, I grabbed the stack to put one on hold for myself and the rest on a display as my staff pick. I can't say enough good things about it.Aside from just the story: the print quality is great, the size is comfortable. It's just a really well-rounded publication."},{"Title":"Inverloch Vol 1","review":"It seems kind of strange to buy something that's freely available online. I bought it as something of a souvenir.

The best book ever.Silver Dollar Fortune-Telling"},{"Title":"Silver dollar fortune telling","review":"Hi. It's been 30 years since Sue and I published the first edition of Silver Dollar Fortune-Telling. Amazing, isn't it? Back in 1977, you could still buy original BU bags of 1,000 Morgans (1879-S, 1885-O, 1904-O, etc) for something like $8,000. Today, one of these bags could very well contain a single coin worth that much money (PCGS MS67). We told people buying Silver Dollars at 1977 prices was a no-brainer, and thousands of collectors followed our advice and did very well. We've done very well over the years, too. I recently turned 60, but I look and feel like 45! I run and bike, and Sue and I have been married for 39 years. We are still professional rare coin dealers (and 19th & 20th Century American Art dealers) and we recently developed a new product called Rare Coin Trading Cards which we hope to launch soon, but we're still setting up national distribution. In 2001 and 2002 we created PCGS autographed coins with former U.S. Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George H.W. Bush. We also build custom homes, and you will see our new calorie counter on TV starting around the holidays. We're also hoping to publish an annual edition of The U.S. Rare Coin Handbook illustrated with our trading cards. No complaints here. Interestingly, our most successful publishing venture was not in numismatics. It was The Beanie Baby Handbook, which became the # 2 New York Times bestseller for 6 months and sold 4,000,000 copies.

Cuffs and Coffee Breaks by Mary Janice Davidson tell the tale of Julie Kaye who, against her better judgement accepts a date with a coworker. And although he's drop dead gorgeous, who would think that people would actually be dropping dead around him? But such is the case, and the rest of this ridiculous tale is spent on Julie trying to prove date Scott's innocence, while ignoring their physical attraction.Leslie Esdaile tells the story of a group of singles who are close friends, and dreading the Valentine's holiday. Determined to prove that they can survive the day manless, Jocelyn Jefferson plans an evening of pampering to take everyone's mind off of flowers and chocolate. But when the plan falls through and a spontaneous party gets out of hand, it is a delectable piece of very masculine chocolate which casts a whole new light on the day for Jocelyn....In Susanna Carr's tale, Shanna Murphy has it all planned out. Reservations at the best restaurant in town and a hot date. So what if the date is not with her gorgeous ex-boyfriend, Calder Smith. Shanna seems destined to have a real Valentine's Day after all...until the date cancels and the health department closes the restaurant. Things really take a turn for the worst when Shanna's boss turns up dead....and the gorgeous Calder is right there just waiting to pick up the pieces.Not being a fan of short stories, my opinion may be somewhat jaded. If not for Carr and Esdaile, this seasonal anthology would have been beyond redemption.DYB"},{"Title":"Valentine's Day Is Killing Me","review":"Ok I have to admit that this was an impulse buy. The cover looked cute and the back cover blurbs were promising. But now? Grrr! $14 down the toilet! Where exactly is the romance in ANY of these three stories? I tell you where....its nowhere! Nada. Zippo. Zilch. Its supposed to be about Valentines Day isn't it?!?! Sexual tension? -barely enough. Love scenes? -blink and you miss them. Just alot of blah, blah dialogue that has nothing to do with romance. The characters were barely likeable (I'm being generous here!) and the plots were just ....whatever, but certainly not interesting. Who cares for smarta*s characters that are extremely rude to each other? Who wants to go out with the 'brilliant' law student who 'accidently' hosts a dope party? And who wants to marry the guy who absolutley refuses to be romantic even for the woman he supposedly loves? Not me! I want..uh..what is it called?...yeah.....ROMANCE in my romance books. Sheesh! You'd think this was rocket science! This one's going straight to the donation bin."},{"Title":"Valentine's Day Is Killing Me","review":"I expected more from this anthology. Overall I am not a fan of the Brava line but I love MJD's work so I expected more. In MJD''s story, \\"Cuffs and Coffee Breaks\\", Julie Kay About has been emailing Scott Wythe regarding the greeting cards she designs, as well as insulting his email lingo and lack of proper punctuation when he asks her out for Valentine's Day (V-Day). She has sworn off of V-Day due to numerous disasters but agrees to the blind date only to arrive at the restaurant and find a dead man. Luckily, the dead man is not her date; however, her date is the suspect. Julie bails Scott out of jail, takes him home for sex, and hides him from the cops until the matter is resolved. In Leslie Esdaile's \\"A 'No Drama' Valentine's\\", Jocelyn Jefferson and her 3 friends are sick of disasterous V-Days and decide to pamper themselves with their own party. Unfortunately for Jocelyn, her friends bail out on her and she is stuck with the non-refundable Pamper People. The ladies of the Pamper People quickly become caught up in Jocelyn's sob story and, after several drinks, invite their friends to her home to party. Unfortunately, 2 drug dealers being investigated by Detective Raymond Mayfield come to the party and Jocelyn is arrested. Raymond is attracted to Jocelyn and, well, the rest is history. The 3rd and final story, \\"Valentine Survivor\\", by Susanna Carr, revolves around Shanna Murphy who is determined to have the perfect V-Day. She even has a list. In fact, she made reservations at her dream restaurant last 2/15! But then her dream restaurant is closed down due to Hepatitis A, her date cancels, and her boss makes her work late on V-Day. Meanwhile, Shanna's ex-boyfriend, Calder Smith, is all she wants in a man- except he isn't romantic whereas Shanna is caught up in the trappings of V-Day. They come to the realization that they belong together, only to find Shanna's boss dead and Shanna the main suspect! Overall, this anthology was disappointing. Most of stories did not have sufficient pages to develop the depth of characters I would prefer to have read about. I wanted to like this one better but....."},{"Title":"Valentine's Day Is Killing Me","review":"My mom got this book for me, knowing that I am a fan of MaryJanice Davidson. I even pointed it out to her and of course there it was on the table on V-Day as a gift. Ugn...I wish she could have taken it back and saved her money.I really wanted to like it, especially MJD's story but it fell short of being a worth while read and felt more like trash.Julie Kay, an angst adult who is hung up over how bad her blind date's have been decides to finally cave and date her co-worker who uses the word 'lurrrrrrrrrrv'. V-day arrives and Julie, who in all honest sounds like another Betsy with less fashion sense, arrives at the restaurant only to find that her date is being ushered away by the cops on suspicions of murder! The story quickly takes a turn for the worse as Julie becomes insane, and refuses to take her date back to the cops (who she was allowed to pick up on belief they would show at 1:00 the next day) afraid he'd be arrested again. There is also a would-be half done sex scene that is not worth reading. I highly recommend any MJD fan just back away from this one and continue reading her other stuff, which is much better than this.While my two star rating is mainly for MJD the other two stories are not that good, and I could barely get through five pages. This is one book that I plan to toss."},{"Title":"Valentine's Day Is Killing Me","review":"CUFFS AND COFFEE BREAKS by MaryJanice DavidsonJulie About is a greeting card writer.

He's actually never met her but they've exchanged numerous emails and he's been the victim of more than one of her insulting emails. He's still brave enough to ask her out though.Julie is determined not to allow her sister, Kara, to nag her into yet another disastrous blind date. When Scott's email arrives asking Julie out, Kara jumps on it. After all, if Julie's been emailing with him, he wouldn't really be a blind date, would he? And besides, it's just one date, what's the worst that could happen? Arriving at the restaurant to meet her date, Julie meets Scott for the first time. He's in handcuffs, and the waiter is dead. At least she didn't get stood up.I absolutely love the emails in this story! Julie is so feisty and doesn't back down to anyone. It's laugh out loud funny.

She has a fresh new idea for this year. A \\"pamper\\" party just for her girlfriends and herself.Raymond Mayfield is a vice detective. He's not into the Valentine's Day thing either. Too much drama. All he has to do is look around the precinct to know that this holiday draws out the craziness in people.Jocelyn is so excited about the \\"pamper\\" party she's throwing. She's gone way out of her way to make it truly special, only to have each of them call and cancel on voicemail, no less. Trying not to cry, Jocelyn tries to cancel The Pamper People's appointment, but at the last minute she's going to get stuck paying for the service so decides to have them come and pamper just her. Things get a bit wild and since one of the Pamper People had called a stripper friend, when an officer arrives at her door she assumes he's a stripper and grabs the goods. Definitely not a good idea since it lands her in handcuffs and being questioned while she's freaking out!You can practically see the saucy head rolls and snappy attitude of Jocelyn and her girlfriends in this story. Leslie Esdaile uses slang dialect throughout the story that adds to the realism and makes the whole police station freak out scene so very funny.VALENTINE SURVIVOR by Susanna CarrShanna Murphy has Valentine's Day all planned out this year. She even reserved the restaurant a year in advance. We'll just disregard that she's not actually dating anybody to make her ideal holiday special for her.Calder Smith is Shanna's ex-boyfriend. He's never stopped loving her, just thought he'd give her some space. Discovering that she planning to spend Valentine's Day with Dominic, a serial dater, isn't going over well with him but he can't figure out how to stop her.Shanna's ideal Valentine's Day goes from letter perfect to complete disaster a little at a time. One by one every plan she had for the holiday falls through, even her date cancels on her. As if the day isn't going bad enough, her horrible boss dies and Shanna discovers her body. Her perfect day has turned into a nightmare and Calder is the only person she can turn to for support.Susanna Carr does an amazing job of taking the reader through the various stages of emotions that Shanna experiences. You can empathize with her and laugh through each new crisis.If you've ever planned the perfect Valentine's Day only to have all your plans blow up in your face, then this is the book for you! Knowing that someone else's Valentine's Day is worse than mine always makes me feel much better. These stories are so comical that they're a pleasure to immerse yourself in and forget about your own troubles for a while. All three stories are very well written by very talented authors.

Feinstein writes that Hughes himself \\"was not writing to stun or to startle, but to understand,\\" and Feinstein achieves as well a clear understanding of Hughes in his own right, not as the murderous mysogynist some may believe him to be. She focuses on Hughes' interest in mysticism, folk talkes, the occult, British as well as world literature, and his strong sense of individualism. Brilliant book, I'd reccomend it strongly to any interested in Hughes, Plath, or poetry."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"First of all it deserves 5 stars because it's magnificient entertainment and well written. For some reason the lives of poets make much easier reading than does their work. I have to confess that on my shelves sit well-thumbed biographies of Dylan Thomas, Anne Saxton, George Barker (Fraser's \\"Chameleon Poet\\") Coleridge, Shelley and Byron, but not a single volume of their work (except \\"The Bell-Jar\\" and \\"Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.\\")Ted Hughes was married to Sylvia Plath. She killed herself, possibly because of his affair with Assia Weevill. Assia had his child, Sura, then killed herself and the four-year-old Sura.Of course he is not to blame for these suicides, but was his conduct good? I am struck in this biography. which is written from a pro-Hughes standpoint, by his behavior towards the children. After their mother's death the nine year old and eleven year old were packed off to boarding schools so that their father could have \\"more time to think and work.\\" Feinstein does not comment (and perhaps comment is superfluous) on the poignant irony of his Jewish child being gassed ( I only hope and pray that she died before her mother did). Feinstein throws in a suggestion that Sura was brain-damaged but gives no more details. This is all the more relevant because his often-stated reason for withholding material from bioraphers was to protect his children. If he had nothing to hide then why withhold?From this account it seems that Hughes became rich and famous mostly because of having been married to Sylvia Plath. He might have been a notable poet, which might have made him famous, but even the most notable poet barely makes a living. His poems that were best-sellers were \\"The Birthday Letters.\\" He was Plath's legal heir and received the royalties fron \\"The Bell Jar.\\"Feinstein seems to have had access to some of the medical records on Assia ans Sylvia. Both took anti-depressant medications;it would have been relevant to tell us more about these. Both women died by gas poisoning. Did British household gas supplies still contain carbon monoxide at that time? These are details a biographer should have researched. My next reading stop will be Alvarez's \\"Jealous God.\\""},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"Elaine Feinstein, a friend of Ted Hughes, has written what amounts to the first full length biography of the former poet laureate. Readers, especially those with a strong interest in his first wife, Sylvia Plath, will feel, I suspect, rather let down by this book, even though the bulk of the biography seems to be about Hughes' relationship with Plath. Feinstein's caution and wish not to offend - Ted's living family, friends, and maybe Ted himself - is evident throughout the book. But more than that, there seems to be little here that readers have not already read before in various sources. Anyone familiar with one or more of the several Plath biographies, or Lucas Myer's recent memoir, 'Crow Steered, Bergs Appeared,' will find the information on Hughes' years in Cambridge, his meeting of Plath and their life together until her death in 1963 completely unsurprising. There are a few 'new' bits of information with regard to Hughes' childhood in Yorkshire but nothing of major interest. There are also some interesting pieces of information regarding his relationship with Assia Wevill and about Assia herself, but again, not much we didn't already know. The relationships he had with Emma Tennant and Jill Barber are better and more thoroughly documented respectively in Tennant's book 'Burnt Diaries' and presumably in Barber's forthcoming memoir. Almost nothing is said about his 2nd wife Carol, or Hughes' children with Plath, seemingly because the biography is unauthorized and Feinstein wishes not to infringe on the personal life of the still living wife and children of her friend Hughes. This restraint for the sake of the living is admirable, but it hardly makes for a well-rounded bio (readers interested in the inherent implications and difficulties of writing biographies would do well to read Janet Malcolm's 'The Silent Woman'.) Indeed, Carol Hughes becomes hardly more than a footnote in her husband's life in this book. In any event, the personal details entailed are certainly not salacious; in fact, I've read quite a few things in Plath bios, on the internet and in the newspapers that are hinted at in this book but never fully explained, or left out altogether, probably because they would be considered too disparaging to the subject. I personally have no problem with this - biography is more than simply gossip and the airing of dirty laundry (at least it should be.) Feinstein is mildly defensive of Hughes when it comes to his personal behaviour in relationships with women, and strikes a balance between that defense and holding Hughes accountable for his actions or non-actions. Feinstein also seems to have a genuine respect and fondness for Hughes, although her use of the first person in some sections in the book throw the reader out of 'biography' and into 'memoir'. I came away with the feeling that biographers should never personally know their subjects, and if personal friends write books about the lives of those friends, the books are more properly called memoirs. The biggest surprise is the fact that Ted's work seems to be discussed hardly at all. Again, since this book is unauthorized I can only assume that Feinstein was unable to get the permission to quote freely from Ted's works. Perhaps I'm wrong, but in any case I was very disappointed at the lack of in-depth discussion of Hughes' work. There are repeated references to Hughes' interest in astrology, hermeticism and neoplatonism, but not much discussion of these influences overall. Basically, I came away from reading this bio no more informed about Ted Hughes than I had been before I read it. For me, Hughes remains a creative, talented, engimatic presence in 20th century literature. I look forward to subsequent biographies that may offer a more psychologically in-depth portrait of the man with a more detailed analysis of his work. Feinstein's book is a general primer for those that want an overview of Hughes' life but not much substance."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"Superficial, scattered with an odd smattering of references, this is one of the worst biographies that I have ever read.

Sylvia Plath certainly cast a huge shadow over Hughes' life, but we get very little insight into the Hughes-Plath marriage from Hughes' perspective. Feinstein doesn't know how to write biography--a difficult art form for anyone who isn't willing to hurt feelings or take criticism. Feinstein didn't want to annoy ANYONE with her lame book. Dates are given incorrectly and names are misspelled to the point at which I wonder exactly how much attention the author was giving to her sloppy manuscript, and how quickly she felt she needed to get it published before somebody else decided to cover the subject of Hughes in a thorough, responsible fashion.

But more than this, it illuminates the life of a brilliant poet, and an often misunderstood human being."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"This is a beautifully written and extremely informative study of a great poet. I really enjoyed reading this stylish and illuminating biography. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"TED HUGHES: THE LIFE OF A POET by Elaine Feinstein was a fabulously engaging read about the &quot;other half&quot; of the famous Sylvia Plath-Suicide Poet story. Hughes, born in Yorkshire, read English, Anthropology and Archeology at Cambridge, and met Plath, the ambitious American while she was on a Fulbright to Cambridge, after he had graduated. Their meeting was violent and dramatic (she bit him on the cheek when they kissed at a party he had brought another date to), and they quickly married. They had two children, and after she discovered his affair with another woman, they separated. During a harsh London winter, Plath killed herself by putting her head in an oven and leaving on the gas, and Hughes suffered the weight of that death for pretty much the rest of his life. That's the short story. The long version, as told in Feinstein's book is fair, multilayered, well and accessibly written, and includes informative critical comments of his work, and follows the path of his career. After Plath's death, Hughes maintained a relationship with the object of his affair, Assia Wevill, and other women. She had a daughter with him, and suffering her own depression, she killed herself AND their daughter within 10 years of Sylvia's death. Hughes was marked by some feminists as a horror of a husband, which was based on Sylvia's own viewpoint in her poems (poems that Hughes published, even though he was horrified at Sylvia's use of personal incidents for public poetry). Later, Hughes married a woman named Carol Orchard, and they were married for nearly 30 years. He also seems to have had numerous affairs in his life, and yet found Carol to be a stabilizing influence. Feinstein's work is important because she gives us a fuller picture of Britain's Poet Laureate Hughes (a work she began after his death in 1998 from cancer). Hughes, in an effort to protect his children with Plath, Freida and Nicholas, liked to maintain privacy about his life with Plath (and also, one suspects, because he just WAS private). When his book of poems about Plath was published in the years before his death, BIRTHDAY LETTERS, positive feeling was overwhelming for him, as people read the beautiful poems that spelled out his love, fear, hurt, empathy and his sense of powerlessness in the face of Plath's need in his relationship with her. This is a book you may read with other books around. I got out Plath's COLLECTED POEMS and Hughes's LUPERCAL and BIRTHDAY LETTERS to refer to. I recommend this biography to anyone. The dramatic events of his life make this compelling to those who have never read a word of his poems, and it stands as well, as fine example of the art of biography alone. Feinstein, who knew Hughes socially after the death of Plath, is sympathetic to him, but fair, I felt. As the quote on the book states, this is a book that needed to be written. It was written well."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"This biography is wonderfully written and compulsively readable. But most importantly, it finally sheds light on the full, real, complex people that Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath were. It also dispells and negates much of the awful Anne Stevenson/Olywn Hughes biography, &quot;Bitter Fame&quot;.This book captures the man that captured Plath. It's a much for all fans of both."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"I know that a good number of people would purchase this biography on the basis of what new light could be shed on Ted Hughes' relationship with you-know-who, or through curiosity on what the infamous poet was really like, from birth to death, but either way, I think you'll be satisfied and a whole lot more once you put it down.I checked this out at my local library and became immersed in every chapter in no time flat. The book is hard to put down because it is written extremely well and offers broad insight into everything that made Hughes who he was. It's obvious that Hughes was a very engaging presence even in childhood, and the biography, like so many others, inevitably plunges into his first meeting and ultimately unstable relationship with Sylvia Plath (an entire chapter serves as a quick summary of Plath's life before the fated meeting).What separates this biography from, say, \\"Her Husband\\", is that after Plath commits suicide, the book carries on in Hughes' favor, chronicling his rather difficult life onward, indulging us with every detail as to the seemingly major damage done to his reputation in the wake of Plath and Assia's suicide, his short-lived relationships with the few women in his later years, his artistic struggles, and his eventual redemption. The book does not glorify him or draw a biased line just because it's his biography, although some would beg to differ; it simply tells it like it is. Some moments of his life were great, but most were rife with darkness, and it makes you understand that he was not a man to be hated for his indiscretions, but a man to be cherished for his grand vision and bold demeanor. There is no question that he and Plath, two extraordinary poets that made each other famous, have made their peace in the afterlife."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"I am appalled by the factual inaccuracy and imbalance of this book.Stylistically much of it is overdone beginning with chapter titles such as \\"The Last Flowering\\". In addition, the author's tendency to sensationalize, often mixed with a disturbing tendency to force conclusions from unrelated facts, falsifies her account, as in: \\"William [Hughes' father] had golden hair which, as a child, Ted liked to comb, learning as he did so the fragility of the human skull beneath\\" [p. 7] or \\"The discovery that he could never look forward again to more than occasional visits from his brother knocked Ted out, as he put it, even though he received the Gold Medal for poetry in 1974.\\" [p. 186]Even when referring to original texts Feinstein manages to embellish and falsely paraphrase. On p. 8 she claims Hughes' \\"The Deadfall\\" told of a woman \\"dreaming of the cries of dying men on the night of the Normandy landings.\\" [p. 8] But the story only tells us of a character who, on the night in question, becomes increasingly agitated, gets out of bed and looks out of the window to see that \\"above the church, the whole sky was throbbing with flashing crosses.\\" [\\"The Deadfall\\" 1].Feinstein does not bring across the Sylvia Plath whom Hughes was fascinated by, whom he loved. And though a published poet herself, she even fails to do justice to Plath's (and Hughes') poetry. Throughout this book, poetry is repeatedly dunked into a shallow interpretation of biography, very effectively depriving it of any other life and foreclosing other possible readings. So we are told that \\"the focus of 'Daddy'\\" were \\"crucially on Sylvia's masochism, a common enough element in female sexuality, which feminism is unlikely to eradicate\\" [p. 132] or that \\"Sylvia's image of Hughes as a vampire substitute for her dead father with a 'Meinkampf look' and 'a love of the rack and the screw' would live in the minds of readers for nearly half a century [...].\\" [p. 132-3] Never does it seem to occur to Feinstein that a 'criticism' like her own caused this situation. Plath's poem never mentions Hughes and it was years after its publication that the questionable interpretation of the male figure in the poem as Ted Hughes became fashionable. Feinstein, however, chooses to unreflectingly repeat the verdict.The distribution of chapters is highly imbalanced but telling: Compare 16 pages (1 chapter) of \\"Childhood\\" spanning 20 years (1930-50), with some 151 pages (10 chapters) spanning eighteen years (1951-69), with a meagre 66 pages (7 chapters) dedicated to the remaining 29 very active years until Hughes' death. Worse than Feinstein's pre-occupation with the more colourful facets of this \\"Life of a Poet\\" (affairs and such) is her large ignorance towards aspects of Hughes' life and work which may ultimately be more important to the reader in the long term.So, she manages this \\"Life of a Poet\\" without an explanation or an understanding of many topics which considerably influenced Hughes' writing and outlook. There is nothing substantial on Hughes' ideas of art or his interest in mythology and folklore, or environmentalism and education, nor on such topics as Shamanism, Astrology and Alchemy. Nor is there anything substantial on his poetics or on central poetic themes, which pre-occupied him.A majority of works are only mentioned or given flimsy paragraphs outlining the general context (e.g. \\"Cave Birds\\", \\"Wodwo\\" or \\"Remains of Elmet\\"). Of over a dozen major children's books Feinstein mentions \\"How the Whale Became\\" and includes brief notes on \\"What is the Truth?\\" and \\"The Iron Man\\", which barely scratch the surface [cf. p. 175 on \\"The Iron Man\\"]. Feinstein also ignores major essays, which would, as a side effect, have thrown light on Hughes' general outlook.Where Feinstein does offer literary criticism, she often presents herself as clueless. So she describes \\"Gaudete\\" as \\"a puzzling book\\" [p. 203] and does not seem interested in attempting to overcome that first impression. Instead we are given a highly superficial and biased summary of other people's responses to \\"Gaudete\\" - in the typical jumble of off-the-point remarks (to colour her argument) and unrelated (and unverifiable) assertions (1st sentence): \\"Whatever reason Hughes had for choosing this story inside his failing marriage to Sylvia Plath in 1962, it was Faas's knowledge of the two suicides in Hughes' life that lead him to read the poem as 'personal'. Both Keith Sagar and Ann Skea offer interpretations of the poem, which see spiritual resurrection rather than misogyny as the source. Michael Schmidt - the poet, critic and publisher - described the book as 'appalling'. Yet a Yorkshire poet of another generation, Simon Armitage, wrote an admiring letter of praise to Hughes about Gaudete, as if he intuited something of what Hughes had in mind.\\" [p. 204] Such 'criticism' gets the reader nowhere.Feinstein even ignores the well-known record of Hughes' publications if it fits her need for content in support of her legend. As if there were no Laureate publications to write about, she falsely chooses poems from the 1970s to characterize Hughes' poetic voice in the 80s. [p. 224] But not only are these poems (\\"Moortown Diary\\", 1989) re-publications from 1979 - most of them, like \\"Ravens\\", which she quotes, are even dated! - Feinstein's choice appears even more peculiar if one considers the fact that she had already (correctly) mentioned \\"Moortown Diary\\" in the 70's context [cf. 194-5].Taken as a whole, \\"The Life of a Poet\\" is a poor excuse for a biography. Feinstein's ignorance towards the work of Ted Hughes and towards major aspects of his life is incredible for a book which claims to \\"attempt to understand the man behind the poems and to tell the history of his life as he experienced it.\\" [p. 1]. And although it contains many interesting facts and details, the overall factual account is patchy and inaccurate, while the literary criticism offered is often weak or questionable."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"This is not a bad book. It is well structured. It is elegantly written.As background for a curious general reader, it is admirable. But it fails to paint the essential picture of Hughes.For this and other generations, a large, all-encompasing work, examining Hughs' life, poetry and sources of inspiration, is badly needed to put this major writer of the 20th century in true perspective."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"This book, though well written, contains far too much information on Plath. True, we must understand Plath to get at Hughes, but the book seems to be telling the chapters on Plath from her point of view. I would like to see a biography of Hughes from solely his point of view b/c he deserves that."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"Hughes as a callow husband is a caricature. He was born in Yorkshire in 1930. His father had served in the Lancashire Fusiliers in the First World War. World War II gave Ted Hughes the opportunity to learn to cope with material scarcity. The 1944 Education Act enabled any brilliant student to pursue admission to Oxbridge. He attended Mexborough Grammar School. In 1948 he won an Open Competition to Pembroke College, Cambridge. His personal canon of poets by then included Rilke, Yeats, Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Keats, and Hopkins. After national service, he entered Pembroke in 1951 to read English. Hughes felt that for reason of social rancour, the university was a destructive experience for him. He had natural reserve and natural good manners and made an impression on contemporaries. He found it hard to write poetry as an undergraduate, but his dedication to becoming a poet did not lessen. Ted was fascinated by the theories of Robert Graves.Ted Hughes married Sylvia Plath when she was at Cambridge on a Fulbright Scholarship. In some respects the couple wanted to live like D.H. Lawrence and Frieda. Sylvia, though, was not really suited to a vagabond life. She sought a secure existence in financial terms. Fortunately Ted looked forward to meeting American poets at Smith College where Sylvia was to be an instructor. He found it difficult to function in America. Leaving Horthampton for a freelance writing life in Boston pleased Ted but made Sylvia anxious. In 1959 the couple was determined to return to England. Ted, among other things, feared American conformity.In April 1959 Ted was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He wrote material for the BBC. Much of Ted's spirit was sacrificed to placate Sylvia. By this time Frieda had been born. The family moved to Court Green in Devon in 1961. At that time THE BELL JAR was completed. Ted became convinced, in retrospect, that it had been an error to move to Devon. Nicholas was born in 1962. Ted and Sylvia separated after Ted developed a friendship with Assia Wevill. Nevertheless, they went as a couple to Ireland, and made plans to go to Spain. Sylvia was writing. In her intense love of syllables she resembled Ezra Pound.Sylvia sought a divorce, not Ted. By December 1962 she had moved back to London. Ted gave her money and lived on funds borrowed from his aunt. In the final week of her life Sylvia confessed to Ted that a divorce was the last thing she wanted. Assia felt her own life was linked to Ted's through Sylvia's death. Ted was determined to publish Sylvia's last poems. He considered them stunning. Olwyn, Ted's sister, was to help with the children. Ted became an advocate for other poets. He supported poetry in translation. Poetry was seen as a spiritual strength. Sylvia Plath's worldwide fame was posthumous.Ted lost his mother, Assia, and their daughter Shura around the same time. In 1970 he married Carol Orchard. Hughes released his copyright claim to Aurelia Plath to enable her to publish LETTERS HOME.The problem was that Sylvia Plath's letters were not an accurate statement of the facts. The portrait that emerged of Hughes was extremely damaging.Vilified by Sylvia's supporters, Ted was urged by friends to tell his own story. He was appointed Poet Laureate December, 1984. Ted came to feel that he had made a mistake in suppressing Sylvia's personal problems. He had sought to protect the feelings of his children and Sylvia's mother. Anne Stevenson's book, BITTER FAME, came out in 1989.In the end Ted decided that in poetry he must confront his ghosts. BIRTHDAY LETTERS, 1997, tells his own story. He died of a heart attack in 1998. Ted Hughes discovered his poetic voice early. This book details the ruses a major poetic talent was compelled to use to circumvent the downward pull of Plath's mega-fame. Everyone will enjoy reading how Ted Hughes averted a catastrophic blow to his own life prospects. He was very steady in output and very brave."},{"Title":"Ted Hughes: The Life of a Poet","review":"Elaine Feinstein writes clearly and with fairness and affection about Ted Hughes. She gives a general idea of his life. She does not however really try to deal with the central moral question about Hughes life and work. And this is the question of his relation to women and why two central relationships in his life ended in disaster.Feinstein also does not write about Hughes wife of many years, nor really about his children. The picture we then have is very incomplete.There is a sense of some kind of ' cover-up' and this is increased when it becomes apparent that not only was Feinstein a friend of Hughes she was a quite close friend of Hughes sister who has a major part in the whole Plath controvery .There too is no deep reading of the poetry.Nonetheless there is an appreciation of Hughes relation to his parents his brother and his sister, his Yorkshire background.

It makes no great claims to interpret his ideas inside the covers. What I liked about this book was its attempt to make a balanced description of what happened with Sylvia Plath and the other significant people in his life. The author avoids the rancor and emotionalism that must certainly have engulfed Ted in the years subsequent to Sylvia&#65533;s suicide.It&#65533;s the first account of Ted I have read which suggests that although he had a weakness for beautiful women, he was very patient and kind with Sylvia and tried to help her even after their separation.

Neither Ted Hughes nor Sylvia Plath are villains; the author does not take sides, but simply portrays them as two young people, who were in love and made mistakes. The author seems to have intimate knowledge of Ted Hughes. I've been captivated by Sylvia Plath since high school, and I'm an admirer of her work. Reading this biography was really just a means to know more about her. There is great debate of what kind of scoundrel Ted Hughes was, but I found him extremely human, a great friend to poets, a very humane person, who was more befuddled by Plath's behavior than anything else. I believe he genuinely loved Plath, and her insecurities wore him out. He continued to love Plath even after her suicide, going out of his way to publish, praise and promote her work, and he was very protective of her, though Plath and the public have not always treated him well. I believe he also loved Assia Wevill, and he could not ignore the female attention he received. He was vulnerable to falling in love. He was a great friend to many, always with a kind word and a wonderful father to his two children. I like that the author could write so openly, particularly about her friend, Olwyn Hughes's desire to protect her brother, through her misguided idea of a biography of Plath, which backfired horribly. I kind of feel sorry for Olwyn now. Aurelia, Plath's mother, mourned that she did not own the copyright to her daughter's works, and now Carol, Hughes's widow, owns the copyright. This is a story of a great man, a really good person, and I hope he is remembered for his poetry, rather than just his association with Plath."},{"Title":"Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications","review":"This is the text I used this previous semester for my Linear Algebra class. I had no linear algebra background before taking this class. That being said, this was one of the roughest classes I've ever got through only because the book kept going against the grain in every way possible. I didn't even begin to understand the entire point of linear algebra until about chapter 7 and 8 when the chapters started going into the general cases, and even now, I know how to \\"solve\\" all the problems without even knowing their meaning, which seems totally pointless to me. The selected answers to the problems in the book are in no particular pattern. It's not \\"all odds\\" or \\"all evens\\"; it's just scattered and it made doing homework a nightmare. I felt like I was back in elementary school while reading this book, because back then all I did was learn \\"methods\\" of solving problems without understanding \\"why\\". The book almost never discussed the purpose or main idea of the subjects it discussed. The \\"explanations\\" it gave would be based off of other vague topics. For example \\"What is the Eigenvector Problem? Well, the eigenvector problem asks if there is a basis for R^n in a nXn matrix consisting of eigenvectors of said matrix\\", OK so What's a basis? \\"A basis a set of vectors for a vector space S is linearly independant and/or set that spans the space S\\" and the cycle kept hitting me with one definition after another without giving me a big picture or anything. A bit of the book is about \\"applications\\" of linear algebra, but doesn't help until you've understood the meat of the book that came beforehand. Also, there were no teachers' solutions manuals available when I took this class, because the distributers have been extremely lax about getting them out (why? who knows).

These are very tangible things to most maths students. Accordingly, explaining how to take determinants or to invert a matrix lets you build confidence in your knowledge. Also, these topics lends themselves readily to many problems for you to do.After this, the book heads into more abstract territory. Null and range spaces and the rank nullity theorem, for example. You are exposed to the concept of an abstract vector space. Which invariably some students always trip over.

Applications: Schneider &lt; Lawson ~ Lay &lt; Anton, but only because Anton's discussions are a little more extensive (not by a great margin).Applications really seems to be its strong point, spanning more than 100 pages in a single chapter, with many interesting and somewhat detailed discussions on \\"Real World\\" (to use a term dear to Computer Science types) applications: ecology, graph theory, computer tomography, etc. (none of which you'll learn from this book, by the way, each is a field of its own).I can't recommend it, except as a curiosity."},{"Title":"The Condition of Jewish Belief","review":"This symposium, originally sponsored by Commentary magazine, was first published in book form in 1966. It consists of responses by 38 prominent rabbis and theologians to five basic questions about the nature of Torah, Judaism, &quot;choseness,&quot; politics, and God.There are some heavy-duty names included here: Emil Fackenheim, Eliezer Berkovits, Eugene Borowitz, Mordechai Kaplan, Chaim Potok, Gunter Plaut, Zalman Schachter, Jacob Neusner, Herbert Weiner, Hershel Matt, Bernard Bamberger -- just to name a few. That roster alone makes the book of historical significance.This is academic discussion, not &quot;inspirational&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; reading. Modern readers may find some of the answers to be rather pedantic -- even boring -- in language style, but keep in mind the historical background against which this symposium was held. One can clearly discern the burning issues of the 1960s, especially in the answers about the &quot;God is dead&quot; movement (which in itself is pretty dead today, but it was a big deal on campus back then.) These responses were published during a time when American Jews were first moving out of ghettos and into the formerly all-white-gentile suburbs. It was only two years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forced &quot;exclusive&quot; colleges and universities to open their doors to Jews, who then began to challenge the mostly Greco-Roman-Christian approaches to theology. Then there was the anti-war movement, in which many young Jews were actively questioning the relevance, if any, of their own religion to political issues. In short, Jews were encountering American society, and that society was encountering Jews, in a type of dialogue that had never happened before. Multi-culturalism as we know it was still decades in the future, but the 1960s were definitely the beginning for Jews.The primary value of this book, in my opinion, is that it provides a cross-section of Jewish thought during a crucial decade in American history. It's also a type of bridge between the pre and post-WWII generations. Included are well-established Jewish thinkers of the time, plus some newer thinkers who, over the next four decades, became leaders into the 21st century. (Jewish Renewal people will find the &quot;early&quot; Zalman Schachter especially interesting).In short, this book is worth reading if you are interested in how American Jewish theology first confronted some major issues of the mid-20th century. My only complaint is the high price of the current Jason-Aronson edition. However, it did go through a number of mass-market paperback printings, so my advice would be to track down a used copy, or try the library."},{"Title":"The Condition of Jewish Belief","review":"This is a symposium of responses to five questions that were posed to leading rabbis in the early 1960's:1) In what sense do you believe the Torah to be divine revelation?2) In what sense do you believe that the Jews are the chosen people of G-d?3) Is Judaism the one true religion, or is it one of several true religions?4) Does Judaism as a religion entail any particular political viewpoint?5) Does the so-called &quot;G-d is dead&quot; question ... have any relevance to Judaism?The answers are diverse and uniformly interesting. Since the format forces the respondents to be terse, some of the essays are pretty dense. Nevertheless, this is highly recommended reading for anyone who is puzzled by central questions in Jewish theology. It should, however, not be viewed as a primer - there are more complete books available for this use"},{"Title":"The Condition of Jewish Belief","review":"I read this set of responses when it was originally published in 'Commentary'. It involved asking a very broad spectrum of Jewish leaders questions regarding their religious perspective. One central question was that of 'Torah from Sinai' and how they understood and accepted this. Another related to the whole question of Jewish chosenness and the meaning of this concept. A third asked whether the respondent believed Judaism to be one true religion, or whether they also assigned truth- value to other faiths. Another question related to the G-d is dead controversy, and a fifth question related to whether Judaism tended to lead one to a certain political position.The whole symposium gave an impression of a rich and varied Jewish community. It did not however anticipate by and large what has happened to the Jewish community today i.e. so many have assimilated, and a growing minority have moved to a more strict Orthodoxy."},{"Title":"The Condition of Jewish Belief","review":"This book is a classic, and should be in the library of every Jew who takes his or her Judaism seriously."},{"Title":"Final War and Other Fantasies; Treasure of Tau Ceti","review":"In The Treasure of Tau Ceti, by John Rackman, a rich boy named Alan Noble is sent, with free lancer Neil Carlson, and linguistic researcher Fiona Knight, to the planet of Tau Ceti in search of touching stones. They are not the only ones after the treasure. A high powered operator and his thugs are after it too, which makes for a much more exciting book. After befriending the natives, the trio sets off for the mysterious island where the artifacts of a civilization from the stars are hidden. Not far behind are the crooks, who outnumber the fearless adventurers by more than two to one. A native girl joins the trio and renders them invaluable services. I found this story to be excellent reading.Final War and Other Fantasies, by K.M. O'Donnell, is a collection of eleven short stories. The title story is a catch-22 like tale, in which a private in a seemingly endless war tries to get a convalescence leave. In Death to the Keeper an actor is shamed by the audience after he announces the cancelation of a play after the national leader is assassinated. In Triptych, three astronauts are packed into a small ship in an orbit around Earth with no certainty that the engines will fire properly and get them back to Earth. In How I Take Their Measure, an investigator from NYC Welfare makes applicants squirm and enjoys it. In Oaten, Sam was sent down to deal with the Grabalzi without proper preparation, which is costly for him. O'Donnell calls Ascension the third assassination story. The Major Incitement to Riot is the story of a fourteen year old finding a purpose for his life after his father dies. In Cop Out, two men play out a crucifixion until it becomes real. In We're Coming Through the Window, a man invents a time machine whose imprecise calibration causes real problems. The Market in Aliens is about the market in aliens. By Right of Succession is about assassinating a public official to take his place, in lieu of holding elections.O'Donnell, aka Barry N. Malzberg, probably never wanted to be a science fiction writer, but that's the only place he was able to get his Kafka like writings published, at least at first. His ambitions were to publish in more literary journals, but that didn't happen. I give this volume an overall three stars, but really enjoyed Treasure of Tau Ceti."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS AND TWO PLAYS OF WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS","review":"Good condition but way too much writing all over the book.

I had been begging my family and friends for a true piano for years...I was ready for a grand...a Steinway, Yamaha, or something of the like. I would have bought such an instrument on my own, but I just couldn't afford it.Needless to say, when I received the oversized book with its built in mini-keyboard I was skeptical.Lets just say that Babar taught me his rendition of \\"SHOO FLY\\", and it opened the proverbial door to my musical universe. Previous to this book the words had no meaning. With every key I pressed on the 14 note keyboard, the lyrics \\"I belong to somebody\\" inched closer to the core of my soul, and struck some very deep chord within me. I was awakened, and felt the enlightenment bathe me like a newborn deer, struggling to free itself from its magenta hued birth-sac.This is no mere book, nor any mere mini-electronic keyboard. It is a gateway for those wishing to be reborn in music, and walk in the footsteps of Babar himself."},{"Title":"Hardy Classes","review":"There are a few books within a subject of mathematics whichstand out from the others, and this is one.

A wonderful book for private library or gifting."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book, unlike most other books which blindly focus on independent aspects of poverty and well being, succeeds in bringing together a pool of information on Fathers. I found the writing articulate and the information at worst a honed compilation of all research on the topic, and at best an excellent resource for all in the field of population studies."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is written by small, established clique with association to the Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty. Individually, each researcher has turned out years of credible research. Unfortunately, they have a reputation for deviating from credible research results when arguing policy to the public and when making a case for specific reforms. The major failures of the current child support system are largely attributable to this crowd, which from the 70s have promoted the application of old Soviet Russian &quot;welfare policy&quot; in the United States. Perhaps the most bizarre aspect of this history, is that Congress was so willing to implement the reforms, forcing states to replace traditional Constitutionally based mechanisms for dealing with family issues.I too, would like to rename the book. A proper title would be &quot;Our Two Decades of Failure and the New Spin for the 21st Century: What We Want You to Believe Now&quot;.I agree with the previous reviewer that lack of focus on the effects of child support reform at higher income levels underlies a basic failure of the book to enter current discussion in a rational way. The &quot;success&quot; of the authors in promoting policy reform is largely concentrated in the fact that federal &quot;welfare laws&quot; and welfare bureaucracy have now been extended to all income levels. Simply ignoring the most damaging effects of these reforms doesn't make them go away."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"Each chapter of this book is a separate study looking at child support enforcement and its impact on nonresident fathers. The authors believe the biggest impact of enforcement efforts falls on low income and poverty level fathers, therefore virtually all of what they study focuses on that group alone. Consequently, it would have been more appropriate to include &quot;Low Income&quot; in the book's title. Unfortunately, the majority of nonresident fathers are not in this population, as enforcement activities impact them as well. Understanding the impact on the bigger population would help policy makers improve overall enforcement activities. One area that I was especially disappointed about in this book is the fact that none of the authors address the foundation for child support enforcement, and that is the basis that child support orders are determined. Statistics and figure abound on what nonresident parents (usually fathers) &quot;owe&quot; in child support, yet it seems to be simply accepted as a given that the guidelines used in each state are fundamentally sound in their philosophy and economics. If, as many argue, the numbers are overstated through lack of consideration of the expenses of an involved nonresident parent's &quot;parenting&quot;, the impact on them can be enormous, creating a roadblock to involvement in their child's life. This creates enormous conflict of its own, and certainly can't help but contribute to the problem of father absence. As the US Census has pointed out, when a nonresident parent is involved in their child's life, compliance with child support is approximately 90%. One could argue, which this book fails to do, that for enforcement to truly work, we should do all we can to foster dual parent involvement. This book provides an interesting look at poverty level fathers within this public policy arena. Its usefulness from a practical point of view however, is limited to only that population. Focusing change based on this material would be dangerous as the data is &quot;incomplete&quot;."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is a composite of papers written by social scientists and legal scholars prepared for a conference in 1995. Although revised to consider criticisms and suggestions from the conference, the chapters fall short in providing significant information regarding the impact of current child support enforcement activity, as much of the most significant new government mandates occurred after these works were written. Even though the majority of enforcement activity in this country involves non-welfare related cases, this book focuses almost exclusively on fathers at or below poverty. The title of the book should have been &quot;Low Income Fathers Under Fire&quot;. Although the chapters are interesting, none touch on the fundamental issue dealing with the economic foundation for most state guidelines. It seems to be accepted as a &quot;given&quot; that state review committees have &quot;sound&quot; bases for their respective guidelines, rather than picking them apart to ensure what is said to be &quot;owed&quot; by fathers is indeed appropriate. For instance, an involved father not only is responsible for a formal child support obligation, he must also spend additional money for the child's time spent with him, to which little to no credit is considered. Although father access to children is given some review in the book, very little qualitative attention is given to the subject. This could be explained by the quote in the book that defies common sense, &quot;Children may also benefit from spending more time with nonresident parents, although the evidence for this is mixed.&quot; Throughout the book, it is pointed out repeatedly that data is slim about nonresident fathers, yet somehow there is enough to justify this compilation. Its usefulness from a practical standpoint is minimal."},{"Title":"Fathers Under Fire: The Revolution in Child Support Enforcement","review":"This book is written by small, established clique with association to the Wisconsin Institute for Research on Poverty.

(USAWC Military Studies Program paper)","review":"Gutman's analysis of T/C is marked by the same measure of excellence as T/C itself; Gutman's successful venture into cliometrics is obviously indicative of his prowess and flexibility as a historian. Gutman's greatest success in writing his criticism amounts to this: he beat Fogel and Engerman at their own game by demonstrating the lack of uniformity and impotence of the statistics used by the authors, as well as exposing many tenuous claims Fogel and Engerman drew from their data. His criticism, although at times annoyingly tenacious in its attempt to prove the cliometricians wrong, is thorough and a solid piece of scholarship. His persistence, though admirable, is also his biggest folly, for Gutman fails to refute the overarching implications made by T/C, most notably the implication that the antebellum south was capitalist in nature, and was managed by the planter elite, who were, like northern industrialists, driven by economic rationality and the profit motive. This oversight is significant for Genovese, and he quickly addressed the fallicy put forth. He draws directly from Marx (aptly) the distinction between capitalist and pre-capitalist being wholly contingent upon the social (labor) relation between the bourgeois and laboring classes. Because, as Marx deliniates, the social relation in capitalist society is characterized by the presence of wage labor, Genovese rightly rejects the classification of the southern economy as capitalist. Explaining why the Marxist interpretation is more fitting would require a lengthy and tedious review of the first volume of Capital, but if the reader is familiar with Marx, he can appriciate that the advantage the Marxist model offers over the Capitalist (chiefly Ricardian) interpretation (the emphasis here being placed upon the existence of labor markets). Furthermore, Genovese's indictment of T/C places a necessary emphasis on the societal aspect of planter society, pointing out its unique, often contradictory place inbetween capitalist and pre-capitalist societies. He characterizes the south as being merchant capitalist, essentially societies that were heavily influenced by profit motive and raw commodity production, yet still retaining a feudalistic flavor in regards to social, and more importantly, labor relations. Fruits of Merchant Capital by Genovese and his wife offers a much more vivid and deep examination of T/C than the overview I've provided, and a more historically pervasive and satisfactory case for rejecting many of T/C's arguments than Gutman's statistical retaliation. I know, my adoration of Genovese is not well hidden, but the assessment of T/C in Fruits is undoubtedly a stronger and more thorough (while remaining less viturperative) socio-economic indictment than is Gutman's Slavery and the Numbers Game. Read both if you have the time and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Weight Management","review":"I read this book during my second pregnancy. Now pregnant again, I knew I needed a refresher. I realize that many books and magazines provide pregnancy and postpartum information, but author (and mother) Theresa Francis-Cheung includes quotes from interviews with moms that really tell it like it is - from their worries about weight gain to battling postbaby blues. The most helpful tip for me is a list of \\"Nutrient-Rich Foods\\" (Chap 22) designed to help you lose weight postpartum. I made a copy of it and posted it on my fridge. I recommend it to all moms, whether this is your first child or not."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Weight Management","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I wish I hadn't wasted my $$$ on this book.

It wasn't full of ground breaking information or anything, but it was good. The author just reiterates what we know already: eat healthy, exercise, and realize that each woman's body is different and unique. What I really liked was the many quotes from \\"average\\" women on subjects such as exercise and pregnancy, weight gain, intimacy after a changed body, and dieting. Makes you feel better to know that lots of other women feel the same as you do. Overall, I probably wouldn't recommend it simply because I could've written it myself! It's pretty basic."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Weight Management","review":"I didn't expect this book to be as good as it was. It's so detailed about pregnancy weight gain and you can't get that anywhere else. It reassures you that every woman is different but also tells you what kind of weight gain is typical so you have something to measure your weight gain by and can talk sensibly to your doctor if you are concerned; and perhaps avoid any problems later on. I loved the chapter written from the father to be's point of view as well as the author's honest discussion of how pregnancy weight gain was difficult for her and is difficult for every woman who has worried about her weight - which let's face it is most of us.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Synanon is one of the many controversial organizations that wove its way through the 60s, becoming a commune, then developing a &quot;cultish&quot; reputation while at the same time becoming a powerful influence in Corporate America. How odd. It's a good history of the program, and is important reading for that reason alone. I read it to try to understand and come to grips with my own history in a &quot;drug program&quot; that apparently had its roots in this one.

It's tragic, I think, that we leave the most desperate of our citizens at the mercy of people who exploit them mercilessly because we don't know what else to do, and basically, we just don't care.

The content of the text is two-fold: a narrative of the author's life at the start of the book and then an explanation/description of the components of how we can rising above the anger and hurt we all face. As B.J. Phillips opens her life to us, we read without pausing in utter awe and almost unbelief of her triumphs through God's Grace of what would seem to be unsurmountable trials and difficulties. Through her life we find evidence and confirmation of the promises of God. And, then through reading the remainder of the book, we are given hope that there truly is a way to change ourselves and the lives of others. A great, easy-to-read text for young parents, teachers, and just anybody wanting to 'see the light' in this society of darkness and violence."},{"Title":"Rising Above the Violence","review":"Why do we live in such a violent society, the author asks, and what can we do about it? She begins with her own life-story and family background, It is a deeply moving, often shocking account of abuse, gratuitous violence, alcoholism, and the struggle for a better life. This first chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book, in which she explores the roots of our violent culture.Author Phillips does not offer any quick fixes, but she is unsparing in her critique of our materialistic society. We must change our priorities, she says, and give up the fruitless struggle for power and control. She has done a prodigious amount of research for the book, delving deeply into the fields of sociology, psychology, philosophy, child development and comparative religion in laying out her case. The question is asked in many different ways: what are your true priorities? Until we get our priorities straight and turn from the blind pursuit of more and better stuff...well, you get the picture.This is a remarkable book, but it is not for everyone. It is definitely not light reading. If you are looking for a book that will cause some soul-searching, that might make you uncomfortable, this one is definitely worth your time. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"Though not explicitly meant to be this book might also serve as an introduction to both CORBA and COM: quite an achievement. The authors waste no words and keep a neutral standing between the poles. I hope the next edition will contain some information about Microsoft.Net too."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"A lot of information has been written on COM and CORBA in the last few years, but it often seems to be written in such a way as to favor one approach or the other. This book maintained an objective viewpoint and helped me to figure out where and when I want to use COM and where and when I want to use CORBA."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This book finally brings out the possibility of coexistence of these two powerful, yet competing technologies. For developing an enterprise software system, a company has to go through the hurdle of picking a technology. Often times, a company has substantial investment on one of these technologies, yet the other one can add some outstanding value to the infrastructure. Because of the common believe that these two technologies are mutually exclusive, an enterprise often have to make a tradeoff. This book shows that these two technologies can supplement each other without breaking the logical model of the system. The author has shown good examples for COM/CORBA using VB, C++, and Java. I think the book is a must read for enterprise architectural direction and decision."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This book provides an extremely useful comparison of CORBA and COM, it is rare to find in one volume side by side examples like this. Mr. Pritchard also provides useful insights into the advantages and problems with each Object Model. It is a very valuable resource for those who are embarking on integrating these technologies."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This book reveals both sides of the component development world and may also allow the reader to discover previously hidden prejudices.

Dr. Pritchard provides an excellent overview and unbiased comparison of the latest technology (COM, CORBA, EJB, etc.) being used to implement distributed applications along with invaluable insights that will help you make the right design and implementation decisions in this complex environment."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"Not only did &quot;COM &amp; CORBA Side by Side&quot; did an excellent job of comparing COM &amp; CORBA, it laid out a number of strategies to apply *both* technologies' strengths in designing and implementing your distributed system solutions. As Part 1 of the book is aptly titled, the book's overriding theme is embracing COM &amp; CORBA to your advantage. Evolutionary background and current technology trends in distributed computing were covered thoroughly. Development issues on both client &amp; server sides were given enough treatment to satisfy 2 groups of audience: developers who want to understand the implementation details &amp; differences of COM &amp; CORBA, and decision makers who need strategic information on the technology's main players and future directions.However, the key to the entire book is Part 4 that covers COM &amp; CORBA bridging strategies ranging from custom approaches (C++, JVM) to third-party commercial products (Visual Edge's ObjectBridge) to enterprise application servers that provide support for client &amp; server components implemented with both COM &amp; CORBA. This is probably the only COM &amp; CORBA book currently available that provides comprehensive information on this topic. My only complaint is that only one commercial bridging product was covered in this section. I wish the author had spent more time on other third-party bridging solutions. Well, maybe that can be covered in a second edition.The book is also logically laid out with executive summary before and after each chapter and major section. What I also like about the book's presentation is the example code are higlighted with light gray background, making it easy to distinguish between text &amp; programming details. In all, it is refreshing to come across a book that promotes building solutions by harnessing the strengths of competing technologies and does a very good job at that with real code &amp; examples."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This is an amazing book which covers such a diverse field in distributed computing. This field is often confusing and sometimes even intimidating with many emerging technologies involving many programming languages and different platforms. Dr. Pritchard did an excellent job to bring much needed clarity in his book.The book has a very good organization and it is very easy to follow. It starts with a brief discussion on the history and background of distributed objects with some fundamental concepts. It then presents a comprehensive and objective comparison of COM and COBRA on both server and client sides. The book is completed with the presentation of bridging techniques between COM and COBRA, enabling the two to interoperate and coexist in an enterprise system. Dr. Prichard apparently has applied both COM and COBRA in practical projects, and therefore he is able to share his past experiences in using these technologies. He offers many technical insights in the planning and assessment, design and architecture, as well as implementation details with code examples in C++, Java and VB. I enjoyed reading his strategy discussions the most. There are too many books on the market which are filled with codes and technical details. This is a rare book which puts an equal emphasis on planning and design strategies.This book covers a variety of topics such as: MTS, MSMQ, ADO, ASP, OTS, JavaBeans and Enterprise JavaBeans, just mentioning a few. Dr. Pritchard presents these topics in a concise yet clear fashion. I am truly amazed that he could present all these topics with such a clarity, illustrating his deep understanding on the subject. It is certainly a book to keep for anyone who is working on or planning an enterprise distributed object system with either COM or COBRA."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"If you're in the process of architecting a new system or planning to rearchitect an existing system, this book will prove invaluable in helping you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Even if you're just interested in both technologies and want to dig deeper into each, this book is a sure bet!"},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This book is quite thin, and yet it includes so much. The open mind towards competing technologies is important, we should all look at facts in an objective way. The book gives an excellent view on COM, CORBA and the differences between them. It also shows programming examples (not in depth) and explains things like &quot;push&quot; technologies very good. I would expect the first book in this subject (side-by-side approach) written by a technician, to be too detailed, with a poor language and not very educational. I was very wrong. An amazing book!"},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"After reading most of this book it is clear that the author has significant practical experience developing solutions with both COM and CORBA technologies. This is a pleasant change from the theoretical emphasis in the several books on each of these subjects. It seems many of these are by professional writers, trainers or technology evangelists, and others are sponsored by technology development organizations.I like the very clear way that Dr. Pritchard imparts real world insights into engineering with both COM and CORBA. The comparisons of different aspects of the technologies are well presented in a (for once) unbiased manner. The code examples, which are in VB, Java and C++, are well thought out and clearly illustrate the issues under discussion. Also the organization of the book into client, server, and bridging sections adds to its overall readability.This is not an entry-level developer textbook, but for those familiar with one or both technologies it is great for understanding the relative benefits of each technology. It has lots of tips and helpful insights, and addresses some issues that hadn't occurred to me before."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"This book is quickly becoming one of my favorites because it is helping me decide between using COM or CORBA in our future product line. I know COM fairly well but didn't know CORBA, thus this book is helping me immeasurably. Talk about perfect timing! Using this book I am can compare the architectures as advertised- but I can also get a feel for the coding effort involved by using the code samples supplied. This was been an unexpected bonus and will allow me to prepare the development teams for whatever path I take. I have recommended your book to others in the company and it is now required reading for my architecture team."},{"Title":"COM and CORBA Side by Side: Architectures, Strategies, and Implementations","review":"Jason has done a great job in comparing both COM and CORBA from not only a technical stand point but more importantly from an implementation stand point. He points out the pros and cons of both technologies giving in-depth code examples, reviews issues that organizations face everyday when implementing the technologies and how to pick the right technology to use for your organization/project.The examples are great not only to explain a point but also for reference.

It is an excellent tool to acquaint me with any unfamilar terms or other diagnostic procedures that I haven't been exposed to. I would recommend anyone in the transcription profession to purchase this book because it not only acquaints you with the most recent neurosurgery procedures, but it also provides you with common lay terms dealing with neurology in general. Because of my unlimited usage of this book, I have just invested in purchasing the complete set of Stedman's Reference Books and would advise anyone else to do the same.

Brother Nee does repeat things a lot, but you have to relish that repeating because it gets the truth down into you and helps you to see things you've probably not realized so deeply before. This is my favorite book of his I've read so far and will read it again and again. It is very helpful for anyone not happy with their own spiritual walk. It is a little slow to read because the translation is a little choppy, but I think it is good that way because you have to absorb what you are reading and it is definitely worth the time to read - again and again!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This is one of those \\"life-changing\\" books we hear about that should be a must for every believer...even, and perhaps, especially new believers.

The words of Watchman Nee are very profound and makes the reader stop to think about what is written more than once."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This book is deep and rich! Watchman Nee startes with God's satisfaction in the finished work of his Son, goes on to God's eternal purpose; a frank discussion on the enemy of God; how the body of Christ is the primary testimony of God in the world; necessity of death to self but how we come to life on \\"resurection ground.\\" He closes with the goal of the gospel - which is Christ himself, not His work.This is a great book for anyone entering or living the Christian life.

One would think that a dual capability would be given to such a product as this."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"For most believers, understanding and applying Scripture in one's life is not unlike assembling a large puzzle. We are typically mentored through the discovery of the corners. During our early years in the faith we quickly discover and place the side pieces. Then comes the tough part--trying to figure out the middle pieces. On first read, this book appears to contain a marvelous patchwork of insight to the middle of the puzzle--the day-to-day life of an engaged believer. Wow! What a treasure! Someone who can explain in plain language the deeper truths of Scripture!However, if one looks more than skin deep and you begin to notice something very troubling. Watchman Nee's theology in this book is all over the map. Examples? In the early chapters, prayer is said (correctly) to not be a prerequisite to salvation. [He even correctly addresses Romans 10:10.] In later chapters, prayer is clearly described as a necessary prerequisite. Nee also describes the importance of the indwelling Holy Spirit to the believer, but later flatly states that the Holy Spirit does not indwell the believer until after water baptism.Clearly, Watchman Nee has some issues with his \`corners and sides.' The question you, the reader, must decide is how much credibility Nee's insights into the difficult middle pieces of the puzzle carry if he hasn't yet settled on his corners and sides?Did, for example, the Holy Spirit reveal to him that the Spirit indwelling did not take place until post-water baptism (thus, denying the Spirit's role as \\"earnest of our inheritance\\")? If your answer is no, then what assurance do you have that Nee is correct about anything in the middle of the puzzle?It's a shame too. I wanted it to be true. I wanted those insights to be the answer. As an evangelical, I must define truth by comparison to Scripture. Nee fails in a very disappointing way in this regard."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I am not yet at the point of accepting the doctrine presented here.The book is mainly from short portions of Paul's epistle to the Romans.I suppose I still see things as a child. Jesus was early a hero to me. I heard his message of love and freedom and took it to heart. He went to his death most sincerely and responsibly. There is awe for that, though the gratitude comes hard because, hell, please don't do that for me.If Paul can decide the world wanted a new religion, maybe anyone can; clearly that fire can spread fast.Maybe after reading this I've come closer to prayer than ever:Dear God,Are you only my better self after all? Please God, don't let my better self die before I do. Your son said your house has many mansions, I hope by now there is some affordable housing as well.You know, they say forgive and forget. I hope you have forgiven your son for asking you why you had forsaken him. That's a common thought down here.In Jesus Christ I pray.Amen"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I struggle even how to describe this book other than saying it is definitely one of my all-time favorite books. Nee's depth of insight and ability to communicate with colorful imagery and language is simply amazing - it really makes for not only an informative read, but an entertaining read as well. Nee's concept of \\"the normal Christian life\\" is that it is a life marked by sacrifice - identified with the death, burial and resurrection of Christ - and if only more followers of Christ really understood this biblical principle, Nee believes that the world would witness truly transformed individuals by the power of God.Nee uses as his backdrop the Book of Romans and walks the reader through the writing of Paul to demonstrate the significance of the blood sacrifice of Christ, the death of Christ on the cross and then the resurrection of Christ from the grave. There are far too many wonderful examples that Nee uses to lividly describe the biblical principles put forth in Romans and other books of the Bible - in fact, one of the amazing things about this book is how comfortable Nee is with the entire Word of God; he continuously drops in references and verses from almost every book of the Bible, Old and New Testaments!Two things that really stood out to me in this book were Nee's insistence on the believer truly understanding the significance of the Body of Christ, the church, and each person's role in being an vital part of that body. The other part that really struck me was his last chapter where he talked about a life of service being a life poured out at the feet of Jesus - the essential element is that our lives satisfy Christ, because He is worthy, and that our primary concern is not taking care of the poor or the homeless, but rather satisfying our Lord and Savior - it really is about perspective and focus - Christ is the only thing we should have our eyes on as we evaluate our lives!There is a new version out of The Norman Christian Life and I intended to read that one as well. My version was my dad's and was published in 1957. I would give The Normal Christian Life to almost any Christian, especially one interested in a book that will really challenge his walk with the Lord - an outstanding book!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Second only to the Bible, no other book has ever had such an impact on my life! In this book, Nee explains the book of Romans; a somewhat confusing book for probably a lot of Christians! In very clear and simple terms, he explains what it REALLY means to be crucified with Christ. He sheds great insight on the text \\"not I, but Christ.\\" In this book, Nee calls Christians to a completely different level of Christianity, or probably to put it better, a much more intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. But, as Nee points out often in this book, he is not trying to make \\"elite Christians,\\" he is trying to show what the Christian life SHOULD be like; every Christian that is not at this standard is an abnormal Christian. Which, sad to say, that is probably the vast majority of Christians; I know I was before I read this book. This book in itself will not make you a more holy Christian, but if you go into it with an open heart and an ear to hear and seeking Jesus; your life will be changed. I especially encourage this book for every new beleiver!!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"In a time when American Christianity has been reduced to a weak, anemic, apathetic, watered down fairy-tail, Watchman Nee's writings call us back to the foundations of all that is important and meaningful. To wet your appetitite, from chapter 14, a little subchapter called \\"Waste\\" cleary defines perpective on the Christian Life. If I might quote Nee, \\"...in approving Mary's action at Bethany, the Lord Jesus was laying down one thing as a basis of all service: that you pour out all you have, your very self, unto Him; and if that should be all He allows you to do, that is enough. It is not first of all a question of whether \`the poor' have been helped or not. The first question is: Has the Lord been satisfied?\\"If I were to send someone away with two books, naturally, one would be The Bible, and the other would be The Normal Christian Life.

This book is soooo liberating in showing Christian's, in such a practical way, how it doesn't depend on us and our &quot;self-control&quot;, but soli on what Jesus did on the Cross through His Blood and Death. Which, after all these years, of not experiencing the personal side to His blood and death, has finally come home for me through the skillful teaching and story illustrations of Watchman Nee.But, it doesn't end there, it just begins!Watchman Nee explains what so many of us long to hear. How not to despair in trials, and failures but to see them as God see's them. They bring us to the end of ourselves, and to a dependence on God. Hallelujah! No more striving.Two more awesome books are: The Overcoming Life, by Watchman Nee and Hudson Taylor's Spritual Secret"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I have strengthened my spiritual relationship as a result of reading this book. First of all, Ni To-sheng, aka Watchman Nee, (1903-1972) was a man of inspiring determination and courage. During his thirty years of ministry, beginning in 1919, Nee travelled throughout China planting churches among the rural communities and pastoring in Shanghai. In January of 1956, Nee was brought up on charges by the local authorities in Shanghai. He was imprisoned until 1972 when he was released days before his death in his home province. I am thankful that I live where religious tolerance is practiced. I am also impressed with Mr Nee's example. His book is equally impressive. The book of Romans deals with some difficult theology. At times, I have been unable to explain many of its concepts, particularly, to non-Christians. Watchman Nee is simple and thorough, but never thoroughly simple. He eschews theological discussion in favour of explanations and examples intended to provide new Christians with tools to build a spiritual relationship. This direct approach was in response to his audience, as he explains, &quot;We have learned in China that, when leading a soul to Christ, we must be very thorough, for there is no certainty when he will again have the help of other Christians. We always seek to make it clear to a new believer that, when he has asked the Lord to forgive his sins and to come into his life, his heart has become the residence of a living Person. The Holy Spirit of God is now within him, to open to him the Scriptures that he may find Christ there, to direct his prayer, to govern his life, and to reproduce in him the character of his Lord.&quot; In this manner, Mr Nee explains that a spiritual life begins with an objective revelation followed by a subjective experience which is composed of typically, a crisis and an on-going process. From this book, I understood more that the LORD, my GOD, plays a personal role in my life, building a spiritual relationship.

Of course, this is certainly a healthy thing to examine every now and then (2 Cor. 13:5).If you have never read any of Watchman Nee's books before, I would start out with this book, \\"Sit, Walk, Stand\\", and \\"Let Us Pray\\". These books are certainly full of depth, and they will be good for understanding some of his even deeper writings down the road.If you are already familiar with Watchman Nee's writings and you haven't read this book, put this on your must-read list right away.

Second, let me say that I have read equally non-Christian historians decribe &quot;Romans&quot; as one of the all-time classics of human literature---one of those books that, regardless of your belief, will change you, and broaden your perspective on the life you live. Why? Because it is the most incisive anti-religion treatise you will ever read. What, and this book is in the Bible???Anyone familiar with my reviews will know that I admire true individuals. Watchman Nee was one of these. Despite the fact that he's a favorite among many Christian believers (even those who tend toward fundamental Christianity), I seriously doubt many of these would agree with some of Nee's most fundamental tenants. He was considered somewhat of a &quot;problem&quot; by other missionaries in China at the time (1920s-1930s). It's no accident that Angus Kinear's biography of Nee is titled &quot;Against The Tide.&quot; As a simple example, Nee strongly believed in &quot;the local church.&quot; By this, he meant that each individual congregation not only had the right but was *obligated* to establish their own set of doctrinal beliefs. He was solidly anti-institutional religion. He also had a unique view of what consituted human nature (most clearly outlined in &quot;The Spiritual Man&quot; [three volumes]). This view, I believe, was far more consistent with healthy psychology than what most American Christian churches currently preach.In &quot;The Normal Christian Life,&quot; Nee takes on the Apostle Paul at his finest. I'll avoid saying much about the contents, as it's a complicated and detailed study. I'll simply relate one of my favorite chapters. It's Nee's commentary on Paul's exposition on &quot;The Law&quot; of Moses. This actually constitutes several books of the Old Testament, but it can partially be reduced to what most of us know as &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot; Are these rules that we're expected to follow? No, says Nee. The whole point, he says, is this---you can't do this! There is no way that anyone who has ever lived could do it. The person who says they can understands *nothing* about true religion.Nee uses a very Christian language in his discussion of this issue. If you're not able to &quot;translate&quot; that into your own world view, then Nee is unlikely to do anything for you. If you're a Christian, you *MUST* read this book. If you're *not* a Christian, it would be nice if you could. In any event, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The Normal Christian Life is a true classic! This book has helped me to finally grasp Paul's presentation of the new life for a new law in Romans.Nee takes you through Romans ch. 1-8 and deals with who a person is in Christ. If we are not bound by sin and the flesh, then why do we struggle? Have we really been set free? Yes! Nee concludes that many Christians are living in their own strength. Many fail because they will not \\"take their hands off\\" and walk in the Spirit. It is in the moment of failure that we did not place our faith in the Son of God. It is in that moment of failure that we were living in our own strength and walking in our own power.Nee reminds the Christian that he has already been given all that he needs to live a victorious life. We were given the \\"fruit\\" of the Spirit, not the \\"fruits\\" of the Spirit. We were given one gift! Christ is our love, joy, peace, patience, etc. We need only ask that he be more realized in us. We have been fogiven and we are now free to walk in the Spirit!I believe Nee's book cries out to Christians in America to identify with Christ and the new law of love. It has been my experience that most Christians living in America only give lip service to this \\"new life\\" and are still living by the old law in the old man. We can live exactly like Christ... because we've been given his very life!I pray that you will learn from Nee what Paul meant when he said, \\"The life I live in the body I live by the faith of the Son of God.\\"I pray this book makes it on to your shelf with pen and highlighted markings galore.After you have read \\"The Normal Christian Life\\"... I suggest readingThe Release of the Spiritby Nee.Further Recommended Reading:Christ the Sum of All Spiritual ThingsThe Centrality of Jesus Christ (Works of T.

However, he makes the point of his teaching well."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The only way I can describe the amount of help I recieved from brother Nee's spiritual insight is to say that it changed my life. I went from a passive, religious Christian into a consecrated disciple of Jesus Christ. The simple truth laid out in this book is that Christ himself is all we need. Victory, not defeat, is the normal for a Christian who recognizes that God has already given us all we will ever need when he gave us his Son. Would that every Christian would learn the truth revealed in this book by brother Nee and would engage in the victorious, Spirit-empowered, normal Christian life!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I recommend this book to all Christians. I believe that this book has essential facts for the Christian life and if you do not know and experience these things your Christian life will be lacking the reality. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"For the newcomer to a relationship with Christ and others who have been living the Christian life, this book addresses several aspects that can be difficult to grapple with and understand.The author discusses process of salvation and sanctification, in a way that is not only informative, but inspirational and encouraging. For the reader, who is fascinated by the Book of Romans, the writings in this book do an incredible job of developing a type of topography in the book, such that the book can be really explored and mined; however, the book is not a commentary on Romans. Romans may perhaps be the foundational writings, with the author reaching out and drawing upon other related writings in scripture to give the reader a comprehensive view of the material.When reading this book, don't consider it as an academic read, but treat it is an experience that will strengthen your Christian life. You want to strive to experience what the author is trying to describe. As I read it, I find that while I might run through a book of this size in less than a week, just a matter of days, I have been reading this book for 2 weeks, and I find that it is pulling me into scripture and challenging me to give serious thought to the material, so while you will read the writings of the author, the author is focused on scripture. The writings of the author truly reflect the attitude and mindset of \\"Less of me and more of Him\\"."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This book is must for a believer who desires to know God, to understandNew Birth and Life in spirit. A great teaching on Romans. I am going to read it many times again."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"If you could only choose one book beside the Bible, I would tell you to choose this one. I always underline and use my books for future reference. In this case I underlined more than what I left unmarked. I also made notes in the back of my book with page # and subject pertaining to explanations of many biblical terms. In my opinion, this book would greatly help every reader and I wish I could put one in every Christian's hand. The Church would be so victorious if all Christians read this. I am planning to give as many copies away that I can. And to everyone I talk to I will mention this book is MUST READ!

It is a must read for any seeking Christian!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This book is a rich resource for believers. I think it should be read and reread yearly, as a reminder of all that we have 'in Christ'. Nee breaks down the meaning of the cross and allows the reader to reconsider what the 'exchanged life' really means."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This is basically a really in depth look at the book of Romans. Nee takes you through Paul's systematic theology in a way that is easy to understand, but also stays true to the original text. By listening to this book, you will have a better understanding of what it means to actually be a Christian.I really enjoyed this book. Romans is one of my favorite books of the Bible, so I knew I would be blessed by listening to it. Think of Romans as a really long mission support letter!The narrator of the audiobook wasn't great in my opinion. I have heard much better.This review is made possible by the Reviewers program at [...]"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The Normal Christian Life is Watchman Nee's take on the book of Romans, just as Sit, Walk, Stand was his journey through Ephesians. Nee uses these pages to remind his readers that everything depends on our resting in Christ's completed work. On that basis he calls Christians to live holy and upright lives, not in their own strength, but in the Spirit. And he calls his fellow believers to realize that God is not content to simply undo the results of the fall. There is much more in view.He does a wonderful job of bringing home theological truth, though I found a few pieces of his thought process difficult to swallow. I must admit I found the last third far better than the first two. But as a whole it is rich in material you will want to go over more than once, and full of imagery that brings the subject to life.While Sit, Walk, Stand was full of moving personal stories and interactions, The Normal Christian Life stands out for its use of analogies. Simply, they are brilliant and succinct.Not only am I in Christ, but Christ is in me. And just as, physically, a man cannot live and work in water but only in air, so, spiritually, Christ dwells and manifests himself not in terms of \\"flesh\\" but of \\"spirit.\\" Therefore, if I live \\"after the flesh,\\" I find that what is mine in Christ is, so to say, held in suspense in me. Though in fact I am in Christ, yet if I live in the flesh - that is, in my own strength and under my own direction - then in experience I find to my dismay that it is what is in Adam that manifests in me. If I would know in experience all that is in Christ, then i must learn to live in the Spirit. (p.176)In this way he presents the difference between what we experience and what is objective reality, and shows that if we are to live as disciples, we can only expect to do so by breathing in the right medium. Or his grappling with the nature of the two \\"laws\\", of sin and death and of life:If we will let ourselves live in the new law, we shall be less conscious of the old. It is still there, but it is no longer governing and we are no longer in its grip. That is why the Lord says in Matthew 6: \\"Behold the birds...Consider the lilies.\\" If we could ask the birds whether they were not afraid of the law of gravity, how would they reply? They would say, \\"We never heard the name of Newton. We know nothing about this law. We fly because it is the law of our life to fly.\\" Not only is there in them a life with the power of flight, but that life has a law which enables these living creatures, to overcome the law of gravity. Yet gravity remains. (p.192)His dealing with the nature of the church and its relation to the creation of Eve out of Adam's side is beautiful (p.213). As well, his treatment of the normal source of our strength (pp. 230-231) will make you rightly question every spiritual gift inventory you have ever taken, encouraging you to drink from the well of the Spirit.I did find his treatment of our sinful nature lacking (p.35), as it calls into question how we should take the humanity of Christ (though I don't think that was his intention). I also think he takes 2 Corinthians 4:11 out of context to prove a point on p.228. And as I already suggested, I found the early parts of the book more tedious than the latter due to his incessant reminders that everything is the work of Christ; nothing is to our credit. I got the point early, and was ready for some balance before he was ready to provide it.The best way I can think to end this review is with a story involving a biscuit, from near the end of the book:I was sitting one day at supper with a young brother to whom the Lord had been speaking on this very question of our natural energy. He said to me, \\"It is a blessed thing when you know the Lord has met you and touched you in that fundamental way, and that disabling touch has been received.\\" There was a plate of biscuits between us on the table, and I picked one up and broke it in half as though to eat it. Then, fitting the two pieces together again carefully, I said, \\"It looks all right, but it is never quite the same again, is it? When once your back is broken, you will yield ever after to the slightest touch from God.\\" (p.265)"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This book was awesome. It is the first Watchman Nee book i've read and it was recommended to me by a friend. I will definitely be reading Nee's writing again in the future.

Once I left for college, I disregarded it all because I lacked a relationship with Christ. Christianity seemed like drudgery and a boring set of rules to follow. After 10 years of self-destructive living, I turned back to God out of desperation. I then experienced God's grace, intimacy, and redemption power in relationship with him for about 5 years. However, it seemed like the more &#34;churched&#34; I got, the farther away God seemed.I finally began to understand that I was trying to earn His approval and had gone back to my &#34;roots&#34; of Christianity that I learned as a child.....&#34;don't do this, don't do that, be good, be happy, act Christian&#34;. Ugh....what a waste of time! After a few years of that junk, God answered my prayers and led me to read and listen to teachers that ministered God's grace like Watchmen N&eacute;e and Joseph Prince. This book was an eye opener for me (and my husband). It is an easy listen but not simple. My relationship with Christ is new and deeper than ever AND my marriage is better.

This, IN ADDITION, to the Word of God, should be considered essential reading!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The Normal Christian Life (Hendrickson Christian Classics). If you purpose yourself to be principled by this book it will change your life forever and you will find yourself being used of the Lord in a fresh way. As we approach His merit it's essential we recognize and confess our sins appropriating the blood of Jesus. To walk in the gifts freely given, we are encouraged to practice repentance and consecration. Author Watchman Nee proves it is not by gaining strength that we overcome sin but by becoming weaker so His power can be made perfect. The law was given to us to prove our weakness, exposing our true nature and inability to keep it. This book stresses that we must determine to put no reliance on the power within ourselves, our souls, for overdeveloped souls crowd out the life of the Son of God in us.If we are to be used it is though the Word that we get the light that cleanses and kills what should not be there. When God compels us on to new discoveries our attitude should be subjected to the Holy Spirit. For all the \\"doers\\", \\" movers\\", and \\"shakers\\", The Normal Christian Life will make you take 2 steps back and rethink about \\"works\\" in a new way while revealing the heart of God's will for your life. It is not what we attempt to do but our focus must be the Lord Himself- losing ourselves in Him alone- no strings attached. For the aroma of Christ to ooze out of our lives we must first suffer and with the limitation brought, be willing to still find satisfaction only in the Lord. What we become more than what we do are key and our prayers should be directed that we might touch others and impart the presence of God out of our broken alabaster boxes. He sets us here to create in others a hunger for Himself."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Watchman Nee does the best job I have ever found on the Book of Romans.

Contains many truths that Christians, both new and mature should grasp."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Here is another classic on how the biblical Christian should live \\"IN\\" Christ from a Chinese pastor and missionary who spent many years and died for his faith in prison. One of his most endearing and well-known chapters is on how God's Grace triumphs over Law in Romans 7. The story of the one woman and two husbands is as timeless and insightful as it is biblical. The entire chapter is full of insights into our new position in Christ, and the believer's relationship to the Law.In the first chapter, The Blood of Christ, Nee starts out with the question, \\"What is the normal Christian life? He gives us the Apostle Paul's answer in Galatians 2:20, \\"It is no longer I, but Christ.\\" He summarizes it this way, \\"I live no longer, but Christ lives His life in me.\\" What follows throughout the rest of the book is a superb biblical study on how the Christian should and can live victoriously In Christ. As a missionary to Africa, I have seen how important it is for converts from a syncretism of animism and Islam to truly realize their new position in Christ. This teaching, empowered by the Holy Spirit, is their only means of throwing off the chains of fear and darkness that have imprisoned them. Yet, this applies to all believers the world over.From the back cover of my 1977 edition:\\"Watchman Nee (1903 - 1972) is remembered for his leadership of an indigenous church movement in China as well as for the books that continue to enrich Christians throughout the world. Beginning in the 1930s, he helped establish local churches in China that were completely independent of foreign missionary organizations and were used to bring many into the kingdom of God. From them came many of the house churches that continued a faithful witness when Western missionaries were forced to leave the country. Arrested in 1952 and found guilty of a large number of false charges, Watchman Nee was imprisoned until his death in 1972.\\""},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This is a great, fantastic book for Christians. \\"The Spirit who dwells within me is no mere influence, but a living Person; He is very God.\\" There are truths that we have learned so well, mechanicaly, that pass us by without becoming real and alive, through meditation, in our hearts and souls. When one reads Mr. Nee one has the feeling that knowledge becomes revelation, and that the political map of our normal Christian life becomes suddenly a relief map. I believe that this precious book will do for you what it did for me. It will be a revelation for you in certain aspect of your life most needed.It is divided into 14 chapters that cover everything that a follower of Christ needs to know to help him enjoy a spiritually fulfilled Christian life. What I appreciated most of Mr. Nee is that not only he explains clearly his subjects, but he brings along examples of his life experiences that illustrate his points convincingly. If one image is worth a thousand words, then one illustration is worth many books. This is no ordinary Christian literature; it is really a treasure."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Watchman Nee always makes matters so clear. In this book he lays out what it is to live the Christian life. According to chapters 6, 7 and 8 of Romans, the conditions of living the normal Christian life are fourfold. They are: (a) Knowing, (b) Reckoning, (c) Presenting ourselves to God, and (d) Walking in the Spirit, in that order.In the first matter, of knowing, there is no need to pray but only to praise. God has put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was crucified we were crucified also. If you feel that you have died, you have died; and if you do not feel that you have died, you have nevertheless just as surely died.Likewise, our reckoning must be based on knowledge of divinely revealed fact, for otherwise faith has no foundation on which to rest. When we know, then we reckon spontaneously. It is that because we are dead --because we see now what God has done with us in Christ --therefore we can reckon ourselves to be dead. \`Reckoning' in Greek means doing bookkeeping, which is the only thing in the world human beings can truly do with precision. Reckoning and faith are here practically the same thing. Faith is the acceptance of God's fact.\\"Present yourselves... and your members\\", says Paul, and again: \\"Present your members\\" (Romans 6:13,19). God requires of us that we now regard all our members, all our faculties, as belonging wholly to Him. Because Christ is risen, we are therefore alive \\"unto God\\" and not unto ourselves. Nee asks how many of us dare not use our time or money or talents as we would, because we realize they are the Lord's not ours? How many of us have such a strong sense that we belong to God that we dare not squander a dollar of our money, or an hour of our time, or any of our mental or physical powers? Nee also points out that we must remember that God will always break what is offered to Him. However, after breaking it, He blesses and uses it to meet the needs of others.The final point of walking in the Spirit means to trust the Holy Spirit to do in ourselves what we cannot do ourself. This life is completely different from the life one would naturally live of one's self. Each time you are faced with a new demand from the Lord, you look to Him to do in you what He requires of you. It is not a case of trying but of trusting; not of struggling but of resting in Him. If you have a hasty temper, impure thoughts, a quick tongue or a critical spirit, don't set out with a determined effort to change yourself, but, reckoning yourself dead in Christ to these things, look to the Spirit of God to produce in you the needed purity or humility or meekness. This is what it means to \\"stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you\\".Watchman Nee uses plentiful examples of real-life scenarios to drive these points home. Reading this book really clarified for me what it is to live a \\"normal\\" Christian life, versus a typical one. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"When I was 9 years old I got my first pair of glasses and was amazed by the detail and clarity of my new vision. What was once green blobs atop brown cylinders became gorgeous, complex trees in their full, leafy glory. In a similar way, thanks to Nee, I see the details and wholeness of God's greatest gift to us, His Son.Watchman Nee makes Paul's Letter to the Romans accessible and applicable. I have been a Christian for many years and participated in many Bible/Christian studies. Nevertheless, I did not grasp the fullness of the Cross. The Normal Christian Life explains in everyday terms the many benefits of Christ's sacrifice for us and how to walk in Him. Please read this book and share it with others. It is a life refiner."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Watchman Nee is one of my favorites. This is for the intermediate Christian. Nee takes us through the book of Romans. Not like every other study that is out there. One needs to read this to advance. Many People don't like Nee but I find him a great teacher for those who are willing to get off of the milk of Christianinty and start cutting their teeth on some meat! Worth the money. Great for an indepth Bible study guide."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I've never heard anyone teach some of the things in this book but I've seen glimpses of them myself in my own scripture study. This book is simply life-transforming! I'm almost done with my first read thru the book and plan on immediately re-reading it."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The title of the book doesn't stand out but the point is that most Christians are not living what God considers normal but what is actually subnormal. Watchman Nee presents what the normal Christian life is all about and the reasons why a lot Christians never get above subnormal. The book of Romans comes alive and the normal Christian life is meant for all believers not just a select few. It is the overcoming life that is meant by normal. All believers are overcomers because of who they are in Christ but not all believers recognize and appropriate this fact into their thinking and are, therefore, defeated and/or subnormal."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I recently finished reading The Normal Christian Life by Watchman Nee. This is one of the best books I've ever read that is centered around Christianity. I get tired of seeing all the \\"Christian\\" books out there with 3, 5, or 10 steps to being a better Christian or how I can obtain spiritual maturity by praying certain prayers. However, The Normal Christian Life is a basic explanation of Christianity in simple, real terms. Watchman Nee is so genuine in his writing and helps to explain certain aspects of my Christian faith that are still kind of hard to grasp even after all these years. This is not a new book, in case you've never heard of Nee. He wrote the book around 1957 and why I am just now hearing about his writings is most likely due to the Christian \\"self-help\\" books that have always been shoved my way instead. If you get a chance, grab a copy from Amazon.com for cheap. It has really given me some things to think about and has helped grow my faith."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Well reality is I have not yet started reading it, eventhough I am going to a Bible study class for it. The discussions have been good of the chapters we have read so it must be OK."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I have read this book repeatedly for many years now starting in 1969..There is absolutely nothing in it that would offend in terms of race and gender. I am surprised that when I read the front of the \\"Hendrickson Classics\\" edition that there is a warning for parents to tell their children that views on race have changed. There is nothing in the book to justify that warning."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Just started this book but fantastic so far. Because these are adapted from speeches Nee initially gave, there is some redundancy in the text, which is what you do when speaking publicly to emphasize points. But this redundancy doesn't distract in the least from his message. He is clear, methodical and intensely insightful into the Scriptures and how he uses them to measure and motivate his life. I recommend this to new and seasoned Christians alike because there're some tremendous insights to think and pray over. I recommend this to seekers for the same reason. I also recommend this to those who don't believe as it may provide its own insight into those of us who do. Meaningful and interesting on every level."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This is another insightful book by Watchman Nee. Anything I have ever read of his has been great. I recommend anything from this author."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"You can approach this book in two ways. The first is just read it. Contents will bless and amaze you. It is, in a sense, the most straight forward presentation of what Christianity should be. Second, you may want to take the time to actually look up and ponder the scriptures he references. The book can easily absorb and direct a bible study of significant length. I'd say that if I were to teach a foundations of Christianity class, this would be the textbook.

I hope my life will never be the same. Watchman Nee's words were very sweet to my soul. The other reviewers say it all. The only thing I would add is that what others might have called redundancy, I would call critical, necessary, and creative repetition. These basic Biblical truths have been so lost in our Western Christianity that we need a clarion call to get our attention. The book is progressive, so that after the early chapters lay the foundation, the later chapters build on them to take us from the elemental truths to the deepest truths, always reminding us that all these things are true because we are crucified with Christ, we are dead to sin in Christ, and we are alive to God in Christ. These are the facts for those who are in Christ. It's all him and none of us.

Apart from a great recommendation, this 50 yr. old book would have been overlooked. Watchman Nee had a knack for breaking down scripture for easy absorption. Totally altered my life."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"The top values when reading Watchman Nee are depth in Bible exposition and insight. The drawback of reading Nee is lack of hermeneutical restraint. He sometimes \\"reads in\\" meaning that may or may not be true, but is not warranted under a grammatical-historical hermeneutic for the passage in question.This book is his best. His conclusions are all well reasoned and exposited from the text of Romans. Nee has a delightful grasp of the grace of God and what a living relationship with him should be like. You get the depth of insight, but without allegorizing or undue license.-Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Watchman Nee (1903-1972) was a Chinese church leader. He spent the last twenty years of his life in prison, as Christians were (and continue to be) severely persecuted by the Communists in China. The Normal Christian Life was originally published in 1957 from a collection of Nee's spoken messages and magazine articles.The Normal Christian Life is a Romans-centered exposition of what Christian living should be. The key verse of the entire work is Romans 6:6: \\"We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.\\"This book is refreshingly well-reasoned, and Nee's explanations are simple and his illustrations are good and helpful. Nee brings a eternal perspective (and I like anything with an eternal perspective) to the work of Christ. He has a good theology of sin and the sin nature. He also has some interesting insights on baptism.Nee deals with some basic yet fundamental and sometimes misunderstood concepts. Freedom from the sin nature, for example, is something a lot of Christians (including Lutherans, of whom I am the worst) neglect, don't understand, or refute.A lot of Nee's message seems extreme. It certainly is, but the real question is, is it correct? I have never read any meaningful work on Christian living that was one hundred percent doctrinally correct. But most of what Nee has to say is sound, and more often than not, his principles are valid where his specific applications might not be.This is a great book for Christians who are just getting by - those who are \\"truly saved and yet bound by sin,\\" as Nee says. Nee's is a Christianity of deep and powerful faith. He takes almost for granted a level of faith that most Christians do not have or strive for.One thing, and I include this as an interesting aside rather than a knock on Nee: when Nee discusses Romans 7:24 (\\"Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?\\") he uses as an example the old Roman tradition punishing murderers by binding the corpses of their victims to them hand to hand and foot to foot (Nee was not the first to use this illustration, nor was he the last). Well, this set off all my urban legend alarms. I did some research and found no evidence whatsoever that this ever happened. It certainly doesn't seem in line with Roman attitudes toward punishment, particularly of capital crimes.But I do not wish this to be held against Nee that the good of his message should be overlooked. This is an excellent treatise on how Christianity \\"works\\". To those interested in the manifold fullness of Christian living, this book must beHIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"This is one of the most challenging books I've ever read as a Christian. It's not challenging because of its language, the language is simple. It's challenging because of how direct, simple and clear it is. The book is a pseudo-commentary on the book of Romans. Despite being translated from the teachings and writings of a Chinese Christian in the first half of the 1900s, the illustrations and language read as if they had been written by your closest friend.There is so much in this book that has transformed my understanding of Paul's writings to the Romans and what that means to the overall message of Christian teaching. I got rebaptized as Nee gave me a better understanding of the need for baptism. That's just one of the ways this book has seriously impacted my walk with Christ. Ever since reading it I've been trying to get my hands on as many other Watchman Nee books as I can and I've already bought a couple extra copies of this to pass on to firends who are being changed by it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"Before reading this book, I have a lots of question about what is the real spirutal life.

Recommend it for anyone desiring a deeper walk of faith and a deeper/closer walk with the Lord Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"When I first read the printed version of Watchman Nee's \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" I sensed that here is a book revealing the hidden secrets of what really matters, a map pointing to Bali Ha'i (the island of heart's desire). It's a treasure trove of wisdom densely packed - fairly easy to read on the surface, yet needing repeated reading and meditation to fully unlock it. During my teenage years many emotional troubles made concentrating enough to retain its message difficult, so I longed to have an audiobook I could listen to again and again to get an overall grip on the book and anchor it in my mind.In the 1970s, audiobooks (also called \\"talking books\\") were virtually unheard of unless you were blind. Thank God sighted people can have them today and there now exists the recording I longed for. There are even two editions; I own both for variety, rotating a copy between my house and my car. The readings are clear and generally rightly nuanced, and the narrators' voices can be listened to repeatedly without becoming annoying (at least to me). They are doing a narration, not preaching a sermon. A slight thing I noticed is that although Nee was Chinese, both he and his editors spoke and wrote in a British style of English. Yet the narrators sound American, like me; to hear them speak of \\"shillings and sixpence\\" with an American accent is a little amusing but certainly not distracting. The message is so wonderful that focusing on THAT will be rewarding forever!The audiobooks encouraged me to meditate again on the printed version, which includes helpful footnotes by editor Angus I. Kinnear who prepared the book for its first publication in Mumbai, India in 1957. There's also a study guide by Harry Foster published separately in England in 1976 available on Amazon. Both Kinnear and Foster heard Watchman Nee deliver the original late 1930s spoken addresses on which the book is based.Watchman Nee has been criticized in some circles because of the doctrines and practices of some of his disciples and colleagues - \\"guilt by association\\". It is no more legitimate than criticizing the apostle Paul for Hymenaeus, Alexander, Phygellus, Hermogenes, Philetus, Demas and \\"all who are in Asia\\" who had been Paul's associates and followers but decided to \\"distance themselves from him\\" (I Timothy 1:20; II Timothy 1:15; 2:17; 4:10). Some of them became proto-Gnostic heretics who claimed Paul as their hero while totally perverting what he actually said. Unlike them, Watchman Nee sometimes extrapolates beyond the Scriptures in a few of his other books but not in what we would think of as outright heresy. \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" has only one prominent mistake I've noticed: he applies Luke 17:26-37 (\\"one shall be taken, the other left behind\\") to the doctrine of the Rapture found in I Thessalonians 4:13-18; but the context of Luke's passage actually refers to the flood of Noah and the judgment on Sodom \\"taking away\\" the sinners, not the saved. Nee is not alone in this traditional misapplication. Just ignore his mistake here and don't let it rob you of the wonderful benefits of everything else he has to say.The message of \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" is not just for a few Christians who might enjoy it as their own particular interest or emphasis. Rather, it is the core of what it means to be a Christian. This is far different from what the average person thinks, or even the average Christian thinks. Had I read this book when I first believed in Jesus it would have put me on the right track and helped to save me from the will-power moralism of average Christianity. Nee's message may seem radical or strange, but that's only an indication of how far we've drifted from the Gospel of the Grace of God as it was revealed through Paul by the ascended Lord, Christ Jesus. The late Francis L. Patton, godly and able president of Princeton University (as quoted by William R. Newell in \\"Romans: Verse-By-Verse,\\" 1938) said, \\"The only hope of Christianity is in the rehabilitating of the Pauline theology. It is back, back, back, to an incarnate Christ and the atoning blood, or it is on, on, on, to atheism and despair\\". I have found this to be true in my own life. May Watchman Nee's \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" help you as it has helped me, to deeply experience faith, hope, and the love of God!"},{"Title":"The normal Christian life","review":"I've been in the church since I was a small child, but Nee presented perspectives on many issues and scriptures that were entirely new to me.

However, there was some redundancy in the book, so I give it four, not five, stars."},{"Title":"Turning Toward Joy","review":"This is an excellent book to use if you desire greater joy in your life.

On the other hand, some scenes from the episodes were removed or changed. Also, the television episodes have a weird, wild, twisted feel to them that the book does not have. I did like the illustrations by John Wood, even if they did look a tad strange.I would suggest this book for any fans of the earlier Doctors, people interested in weird alien worlds, or people who like ants."},{"Title":"Doctor Who and the Zarbi","review":"Originally written in 1965 (the same year the story, &quot;The Web Planet&quot;, was broadcast), this was selected amongst the first three novelisations of Doctor Who probably because the author Bill Strutton (who wrote both the script and this book) and the BBC hoped to have a second Dalek success story. They didn't. What they did get with this book is a fairly interesting story of a quite alien world.The Menoptera, who once ruled the world of Vortis, have been driven off when the previously docile Zarbi mysteriously become both organised and aggressive. At the time when the Menoptera are re-invading, the TARDIS arrives and the Doctor, Ian, Barbara and Vicki find themselves split up and under threat from the various sides in the conflict.Whereas the TV story looks rather clunky, as the special effect technology wasn't able to cope with the demands of the story, the novel allows for the reader to make the Zarbi, the Menoptera, the venom grubs, the Optera and even the Animus far better than they appeared on TV. One does question, however, how useful the line illustrations in this novel are. Their quality is variable, but not that good.What we have here is an interesting concept, better realised in this book than on video, but if this kind of story was written these days it would have been even better (I suggest you read &quot;Venusian Lullaby&quot; instead)."},{"Title":"Bible History: Old Testament: Set of 2 Volumes (7 Volumes Complete in 2)","review":"Edersheim probably had no idea people would still be reading his book hundreds of years after he wrote it so some of this book concerns itself with refutations of other authors modern-day readers will have never heard of.

And this genre continues its vitality to this day, needless to say. Modern versions of this approach (e.g., those of Josh McDowell, et. al.) fall far short.I suggest that anyone interested in the subject of Bronze Age-Iron age Canaanite religion should buy this.

It seemed, however, to be missing bits and pieces (e.g., incomplete character development, minor characters that seemed as though they'd have larger roles dropping out altogether), which wasn't consistent with my experience with the only other Heyer novel I'd read. As I was replacing the CDs in the case, I checked the back cover and confirmed that the Audio CD version is, indeed, abridged--a fact which is missing from the product description and is only noted in one of the editorial reviews (which I don't generally read in detail). While I'm sure the full novel is delightful, I'm only rating this at three stars due to the unadvertised abridged nature of this version."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I have read nearly all of Heyer's books at this point and this was my least favorite.

I have read plenty of Heyer's books, and this one definitely would be amongst my favorites. The premise is simple, chemistry is subtle but continually develops.

It is a mixture of the light-hearted romp (the young 17 year old girl)and the pleasant gentleman of 35 who marries her on her request. When Honoria marries Lord Rule she marries into the ton, goes slightly overboard with gambling and gossip, and gets involved with the villain of the piece, Lord Lethbridge who has an ugly history with Lord Rule and his sister. There are at least three young men who try to help Honoria out of problems she unwittingly gets into connected with Lord Lethbridge. They are definitely written as light relief. The book is similar to quite a few other Heyer books in that a young innocent lady gets into trouble with the world of the ton and is rescued by her husband, after many convolutions. It is amusing and easy to read.Linda Sheean"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is my fourth audio book by Naxos Classic Fiction and am very pleased with the quality of the product.Richard Armitage always reads these books with such energy, enjoyment and his different character voices are entertaining.Usually with audio books being read by a man or woman, you don't always find the different characters as believeable. Mr. Armitagemakes them believeable and makes the entire story a real joy to hear. Please have Mr. Armitage read more of Ms. Heyer!!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is a Georgian (the 1700s), so imagining the men in full dress attire is always amusing. Think powder and wigs and fake moles/facial decorations and just sheer colorful dandyism and ridiculousness. This book also introduced me to the proper meaning behind the line in Yankee Doodle Dandy about sticking feathers in hats and calling them Macaroni.The heroine, who is plain and has a stutter (and really does stutter through all her dialogue in the book) but is quite outgoing and charming, proposes to marry a handsome and wealthy earl so that her sister does not have to marry him. The characters start with the marriage and then have to figure out how to make it work as they go along. There's a vast age and maturity difference between the leads (our heroine is very young and foolish, and I think I would have found her annoying in person), but it is interesting to watch them come to understand and genuinely care for one another.I feel for the poor mistress though who had the audacity to aspire above her station due to the earl's seeming affections. There is definitely classicism in the book, as well as mockery of male fashionists."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This was by far my least favorite of Georgette Heyer's books. After the promise of the first few chapters, I found Horatia to be an irritating twit and could not fathom why Lord Rule would have been in love with her."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This story is actually a Georgian romance ( Georgette Heyer usually rights Regency romances). Hory is one of my favorite examples of an imperfect but absolutely adorable character. Hory is unorthodox, short and plain, and badly stammers. Because of this, the reader actually gets a dose of laugh out loud fun. The Earl of Rule is looking to settle down and he chooses Hory's sister who wants to actually marry for love. Hory steps in, willing to make the sacrifice.I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Both Hory and the Earl are great loveable characters. I was afraid that I would become irritated by Hory's stammer, but it didn't get old, and was quite endearing. I haven't discussed the plot much because all of the characters are so amazing. However, the book has great pacing and has a bit of comedy with a rather predictable ending. I would recommend this book to all historical fiction fans."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This was my first Georgette Heyer book, and for a romance novel I was pleasantly surprised. She was clearly an expert about the historical period and wove fascinating details about 18th century culture throughout the story. The dialogue was cute and had me laughing out loud. The plot was a bit predictable, but who wants to read a romance novel where the heroine doesn't get the handsome hero in the end?"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This was a quick, funny read--the secondary characters were quirky and often LOL-hilarious. I adore the hero, the Earl of Rule, and how he's perpetually slumberous, amiable, and oh-so-polite. The heroine was also a unique character, although there were times that I thought she was too flighty and stubborn for her own good. I don't recall ever having read about a heroine who is a \\"hereditary\\" gambler, and it's a testament to Georgette Heyer's skill that I overcame my initial aversion to this aspect of Horry's personality. I would recommend to this fans of the Georgian period."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is not actually a review, but a historical commentary. I apologize to any who find it inappropriate here./The Convenient Marriage/ has always been one of my favorite Heyers, but it was only very recently that I found that the characters were inspired by real life counterparts. Elizabeth, Charlotte and Anna Horatia were the Waldegrave sisters, the subject of a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Even a rough outline of their lives and times is a romance in itself.[do an online search for \\"Ladies Waldegrave\\". I recommend the commentary at 'The Duchess of Devonshire's Gossip Guide to the 18th Century'.]While Charlotte Winwood states that \\"marriage is repugnant\\", Charlotte Waldegrave married George Fitzroy, Earl of Euston (later 4th Duke of Grafton), the inspiration for the Earl of Rule. Their descendant, the current (12th) Duke of Grafton succeeded to the title in 2011, and is now managing the extensive estates and properties, but he previously had employment as a radio host in Nashville, Tennessee, and merchandising coordinator for the \\"A Bigger Bang Tour\\" of the Rolling Stones. Times do change, don't they![search for \\"4th Duke of Grafton\\". The picture in Wikipedia is not very good, but I cannot find another.]Anne Horatia Waldegrave married Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Lord Hugh Seymour. She had seven children and is a direct ancestor of Princess Diana. Yes, the eyebrows were notable.[search for \\"Anne Horatia Seymour\\". I favor Wikipedia's copy of the miniature, but my sister prefers a portrait of her by Gainsborough, painted before her marriage.]I hope this information will increase the enjoyment of readers both old and new."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is one of the funniest Georgette Heyer books, horry is an unusual heroine, but very likeable.One particular scene with the heroine, her brother, his friend and the villain had me in stiches. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is one of Georgette Heyer's unusual novels in that it took place in Georgian period about 40 years before the Regency era when most of her novels took place. The plot is focused around a marriage on convenience between Horatia, a 17-year-old girl (with a stammer) who is constantly getting into trouble, and the 32-year-old earl of Rule. The premise was interesting enough as at the very beginning it was clear that Horatia was rather guileless and said what was on her mind, while Lord Rule was a rather laconic man who clearly found her quite amusing.Unfortunately, it wasn't long before the promising premise fell apart in my book. Horatia is in fact a reckless, irresponsible girl with a penchant for gambling, spending money quite wildly, and doing any impetuous thing that comes into her mind. She came across to me as a spoiled brat, and I had more pity for Lord Rule than I had a desire for the two to fall in love. I didn't find myself really at all interested in her character, though I enjoyed Lord Rule's. I could also see some readers being annoyed by reading Horatia's stammer, which is portrayed throughout the book (constant \\"b-but,\\" etc.).I did not find the romance convincing. Being intrigued initially, yes; falling in love, no. After the first chapter or two, none of Horatia's positive traits are really portrayed, and you only see her causing trouble and grief for her husband.This book was a bit more melodramatic than the other Heyer books I've read, with mistaken identities, double-crossing, an abduction, a sword fight in an inn, etc. This is less appealing to me. On the plus side, like the rest of her books, this is \\"clean,\\" without any sex scenes, or even any more than a couple briefly mentioned kisses. There's also wit in her dialogue, especially in Lord Rule's. But, I wasn't able to enjoy it nearly as much because of Horatia's character.I've now read about a dozen Georgette Heyer books, and this is probably my least favorite. I would recommend insteadA Civil Contract,The Nonesuch, orThe Foundling. The Convenient Marriage is not going to find a home on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Yeah!

I immediately started haunting bookstores (including Amazon.Com) trying to find the rest of them, but alas, most of them were out of print.I was delighted to see that they are being re-released. Unlike some of the reviewers, I found the antics of Pelham and his friends to be one of the highlights of the book. It was laugh out loud hilarious.It is a little ridiculous that we never know if the marriage was consummated or not and I agree that Horry is not the most sympathetic of heroines after her marriage.

What follows is a story of at times hilarious and at times exasperating hi-jinks with the seventeen year old taking Society by storm and going from one scrape to the next. When an enemy of the Earl steps up and attempts to stir the pot and ruin his new young bride in the eyes of Society things take a dangerous turn and sword fights, high way robbery and a great deal of intrigue ensues.While being just as well researched, well written and interesting in its own way as other Heyer works, the book The Convenient Marriage had a heroine that I did not like nearly as well this time. Horatia was stubborn, obstinate, mulish and very naive. I had a hard time learning to like the character and only started to enjoy her towards the end as she started to finally realize the horrible mess she was making of things. I honestly could not see what the Earl got out of the match at all, unless it was simply that he wanted a child-woman for a bride that he would look after, mess with, and run circles around all the time.That being said, the novel was absolutely hilarious. The situations were amusing and comically well written, the dialogue was witty in sometimes sly and sometimes exasperating ways, and Horatia's family (not to mention Horatia herself) provided excellent comic relief to some at times very tense situations. I also loved the depictions of the Macaronis, just picturing the clothes, powdered wigs, make-up and mincing stride (not to mention the girly attitude) of these 18th century metrosexuals often got a chuckle out of me throughout the book.Even though the heroine was at times very frustrating to read about, the plot kept me engaged to the last page turn with all of the sword fights, the various back stabbing characters, and the intrigue of London's Ton. Though by the end it was pretty easy to guess how it all was going to end, and I just found it (yet again) frustrating that the characters didn't even guess what was about to happen next, it was that obvious. So, though well written and engaging, it had to lose a star for a frustrating heroine that took away a lot more than she added to the book. I just wish she had been written in a slightly different way, though I guess for her to grow and change as much as I wanted her to, there would have had to have been a much longer book!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I guess I've been living under a rock because I feel like I'm one of the only book bloggers who hasn't read a book by Georgette Heyer. I have a few on my shelves, but it wasn't until a few days ago that I finally decided to pick one up and see what all the buzz is about. I chose to readA CONVENIENT MARRIAGE, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.I'm not usually a big reader of romance books (unless you count the occasional chick lit book) so I wasn't quite sure that I was going to like A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE. I just figured that I should try one of these Heyer books that everyone seems to be talking about. When I read the book description, I have to admit that I was skeptical -- it really didn't sound like a book that would appeal to me. I couldn't have been more wrong. A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE was just a wonderful book.I thought the storyline in this novel was extremely creative. Horatia, the youngest sister in Winwood family offers herself in marriage to the Earl of Rule to allow her older sister to marry her true love. She and the Earl agree to have a marriage of convenience, and Horatia does her best to be a good wife; however, she still finds herself in some uncomfortable situations. While Horatia does seem to appreciate her husband, she fails to realize his genuine feelings towards her. It takes awhile for them to \\"get on the same page,\\" and the confusion and adventures that occur along the way are just incredibly entertaining.I couldn't help but like Horatia, although I did get frustrated with her actions and sometimes wanted to shake her. She was such a unique girl/woman who wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She did do some rather stupid things, but I kept reminding myself that she was only 17 years old and very naive. In addition, I tried to understand that she was thrown into an entirely new life -- she married an older and very wealthy man whom she really didn't know at all. Nonetheless, Horatia was such an interesting character and I can see why the Earl was enamored by her.Not only did I like Horatia, but I absolutely loved the Earl. He was such a wonderful male character. I found him to be smart, charming, witty, and best of all patient with Horatia. Time and time again, he saved Horatia from her own careless actions and always seemed to forgive her. It was almost as if he could read her mind and anticipate her next move. I just thought he was such a romantic man.Of course, I was rooting for Horatia and the Earl to realize not only their own feelings, but also each other's feelings. There were many twists and turns and zany mishaps along the way, but I felt very satisfied with the ending of this book. I was happy to see that the married couple \\"lived happily ever after.\\" I'm starting to think that I appreciate romance stories more than I thought!While I was a little surprised by how much I enjoyed this story, I was absolutely blown away by how much humor was in this story. For some crazy reason, I wasn't expecting this book to be so funny -- I guess I thought a romance set in Regency England would be \\"stuffy.\\" I was just incredibly wrong. This book was a hoot! The characters (especially Horatia's brother) and their escapades were extremely funny, and I found myself laughing a great deal.After reading A CONVENIENT MARRIAGE, I definitely will be recommending it to many of my friends; and I certainly want to read more of Ms. Heyer's books. I am so glad that I have a few more of her novels on my bookshelves. She has written something like 56 books over a 53 year period (that's pretty incredible to me); and her books include romances, historical fiction and even mysteries. According to the Sourcebooks website, she is supposedly known for her \\"research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations.\\" Based on this one novel, I agree; and I am definitely looking forward to reading some of her historical fiction novels in the near future."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is one of the most unusual of Heyer's Regency romances. For one thing, it's not even set in the Regency period but a long generation earlier, during the 1770s. For another, the plot is much more sophisticated and the characters, both leading and supporting, are far more multidimensional. And there's far less dependence on impenetrable sporting cant -- except for the highwayman, of course, whose jargon confuses even some of the young gentlemen.The story opens with negotiations between the Earl of Rule and the Dowager Viscountess of Winwood for the hand of her sweetly beautiful eldest daughter, Elizabeth (who is fifteen years Rule's junior). Only Lizzie is downcast because she's very much in love with young Lieut. Heron (newly returned from the war in America), whom she has known all her life. Still, the family needs money desperately, Rule is extremely wealthy, and it's a daughter's duty. But Lizzie has two younger sisters, including Horatia, only seventeen (with a monobrow and a stammer), who thinks she can fix things to everyone's satisfaction by visiting the earl and offering herself to him as a wife in place of her sister. Rule accepts on the spot -- and that's really the only unconvincing part of the plot. So Lizzie gets her lieutenant, Rule gets an even younger wife, and Horry gets a title and a very large allowance. Then (naturally) things get complicated. Rule's presumptive heir heretofore has been his excessively foppish cousin, Mr. Crosby Drelincourt (\\"the Macaroni\\"), who has come to think of Rule's fortune as almost rightfully his own -- so he isn't happy about the marriage and the prospect of other heirs. Rule also has a dedicated enemy of long standing in Lord Lethbridge, who will go to considerable lengths to embarrass the earl and cost him his prospects for a family by subverting his young and nave wife. Heyer practically has Lethbridge twirling his mustaches as he plots the downfall of Lord and Lady Rule, but in no way is he a laughable villain. In fact, the author includes in the story a duel in deadly earnest, which is the only occasion for serious bloodshed that I can recall in any of her books.The bride also has a brother, Pelham, the current Viscount Winwood, a likeable wastrel and gambler (which is why the family has become so poor, but the whole family apparently is prone to the Fatal Tendency, including Horry) who, with the assistance of his friends and the now Capt. Heron, will do his best to come to his sister's rescue, . . . if only he can stay sober long enough. And those efforts provide sixty-odd pages of an almost Marx Brothers style of careening, pall-mall comedy that is also quite unlike anything I can remember in any of the author's other novels. This is one of Heyer's most enjoyable books."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This book looked like it was going to be charming in the first couple of chapters. Lord Rule and Horry's meeting was a really humorous and delightful scene. Unfortunately, once it got underway, I quickly lost interest. Horry's stammer was really annoying to read and I found her naivete and stupidity astounding! This was my first Heyer that followed a married couple and needless to say it didn't leave a very good impression."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"According to the Naxos Audiobooks website, this is an ABRIDGED edition of the Convenient Marriage."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Another of my favorites by Ms Heyer! I've read it at least 4 or 5 times! She is brilliant!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I had not read THE CONVENIENT MARRIAGE before this new Naxos Audiobooks recording happily landed on my doorstep. I will confess all up front. I did the unthinkable. I read the complete plot synopsis on Wikipedia before I delved into the first chapter. *horrors* Don't even think about following my example. It will spoil the most enjoyable aspect of this novel - surprise!THE CONVENIENT MARRIAGE is one of Georgette Heyer's more popular Georgian-era rom-com's, and for good reason. It has all the requisite winning elements: a wealthy and eligible hero, a young nave heroine, greedy relatives, a scheming mistress and a revengeful rake. Add in a duel, a sword fight, highway robbery, abduction, switched identities and scandalous behavior, and you are in for comedic high jinxes and uproarious plot twists. As I laughed out loud at the preposterous plot machinations in the synopsis, I thought to myself, \\"How does Heyer do it? How can she take us on such an outrageously wild ride and make it believable?\\" I was soon to find out.Handsome and elegant Marcus Drelincourt, Earl of Rule, is comfortable in his bachelorhood. At thirty-five his sister Lady Louisa Quain urges him to marry, suggesting the beautiful Elizabeth Winwood. She is from an aristocratic family of good pedigree but little fortune. With two unmarried younger sisters, prim Charlotte and impulsive Horatia, and their self-indulgent elder brother Pelham (about as much help to his family as a rainstorm at a picnic), she must marry well. Lady Winwood is thrilled when the Earl agrees to marry Elizabeth and save the family from destitution. Seventeen-year old Horatia is not. Presenting herself at the Earl's doorstep she boldly offers herself to him in exchange for her elder sister who is in love with Lieutenant Edward Heron. Horry proposes a marriage of convenience to Lord Rule with the promise that she will not interfere with him after they are married. She does not bring much to the bargain. Not only is she poor, she does not possess her sister's beauty, and she stutters. Intrigued by this young, brave girl, he is tempted and soon sees the logic, agreeing to her proposal.The new Countess of Rule wastes no time in becoming the sensation of the bon ton dressing to the nines, attending parties, the opera, gambling huge sums and getting into all sorts of scrapes while her husband continues to pay attentions to his mistress Lady Caroline Massey. With patience and fortitude, Lord Rule councils his stubborn young bride against excess and the dangerous liaisons of Baron Robert Lethbridge, a known rake with a history with the Drelincourt family.Determined to teach her husband a lesson for his interference, she defies his wishes attending a masked ball. Escorted by Lethbridge, he sees their friendship as the perfect opportunity to ruin her reputation and punish Drelincourt for thwarting his elopement with his sister Louisa years before. Horry tempts Lethbridge with cards, bending his resistance by scandalously agreeing to offer a lock of her hair if he wins. Unbeknownst to Horry, her husband has followed her to the ball, overhears their conversation and intercedes by stepping on her dress and ripping it. While she is away he disposes of Lethbridge and exchanges his costume with his own. Returning, Horry loses badly at cards and must give Lethbridge/Rule his winnings. Penitent, she concedes the bet which is met with a stolen kiss. Furious, Horry rushes away running into Lady Caroline Massey who recognizes her. Certain that her husband's mistress will reveal to him that his wife was at the ball, she confesses all to him first. The Earl in turn reveals his charade. Discovering that he has fallen in love with his wife, how will he court and convince her that love is much better than a marriage of convenience?Heyer's characterizations just sparkle and shine. This May/December relationship presents great opportunity for difference in opinion and blunder. If Horry had not been an impulsive, stubborn seventeen-year old there would have been little conflict and no story. Lord Rule's patience in dealing with his teenage bride commanded respect, endearing us to him by opening up the possibility of the love relationship that we hope for. This delightful romp was made all the more enjoyable by this new audio recording by British stage and screen actor Richard Armitage. This is his third foray into Georgette Heyer for Naxos Audiobooks. His skill at unique characterization and resonant, velvetly voice transports the listener like Cinderella to the Ball. Unfortunately, once the story ends, so does the enchantment. My solution was to start it again. For me, a new audio recording combining fanciful storyteller Georgette Heyer and the sultry and seductive voice of Richard Armitage is like la petite mort. Hopefully they are not few and far between.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I'm new to Heyer's work -- but understand her legendary position in the world of romantic fiction. I did not enjoy this book as much as the two recent rereleases (&quot;Frederica&quot; and &quot;The Nonesuch&quot;). For one thing, other than a show of pluck at the start of the book, the heroine comes off as a self-absorbed, ninny. She spends most of the book gambling, overspending, and running with a bad crowd. In fact, it is impossible to see what the Earl of Rule -- an interesting hero -sees in this girl. Heyer spends little time developing the relationship between the two and much too time on the slapstick antics of Horry's brother and drunken friends. One never really understands the motivation of the villan in the novel and understands even less why the Earl has a trust in Horry which she never seems to earn. The end of the book has a brief excerpt from the next novel to be released, &quot;Cousin Kate.&quot; I suggest waiting until then."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"3.5/5 starsFun, well-written, and refreshingly comedic, I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Convenient Marriage'. It was everything I hoped it would be and, while lacking in the deep-thinking department, it more than made up for it in wit and humor.At the outset of the story we are introduced to the eldest Winwood daughter, Elizabeth - a beauty of of noble birth, yet virtually penniless. At the prodding of her well-intentioned mother, Elizabeth is about to turn her back on her true love, Captain Heron, and marry a complete stranger, the Earl of Rule, solely for his vast wealth. However...Enter: Horatia (\\"Horry\\") Winwood, Elizabeth's younger rebellious sister. Though rather young and uncouth, as well as stuttering and stubborn, Horry decides to save her sister from a loveless match! After much scheming, and to her elder sister's relief, Horry eventually takes her her position as the Countess of Rule. The Earl accepts the swap, but not without 'enduring' the adventure and hair-brained antics that ensue, involving the Countess herself, Pelham (the Winwood's congenial gambling brother) and his drinking buddy.'The Convenient Marriage' literally brims with witty dialogue and interesting back-and-forths, with well-drawn characters and a quickly moving, easy-to-follow plot. The ending, albeit predictable, will satisfy any true romantic at heart.This was my first Heyer experience - I was so charmed by it that I *know* it won't be my last. :)"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Read this book was short, I liked it, but was a little confussing, i would have loved to read more of The Earl (Marcus) and Haratia (Harry). There was alot in there of other charactors. I was glad that Harry and the Earl did have feelings for each other, which the basically told each other at the end. Wish to read more of them!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"In order to help her oldest sister and her sister's suitor, Horatia Winwood proposes a marriage of convenience to Marcus, Earl of Rule, which sets in motion a novel that was intermittently excellent and frustrating.This is a book that vacillates in the amount of interest it elicits. I was prepared to admire Horatia without question because of her nerve when it came to propositioning the Earl of Rule. Once this marriage was set in motion, however, I literally felt my interest dwindle.I found myself on the brink of disliking the heroine who had initially shown so much promise, with her daring and her stutter, because she conducted herself so senselessly during her marriage.But this novel presents a tremendous turnaround as the narrative, which passively described their marriage from a distance, begins to localize itself and focus again on Horry and Marcus. This shift in narrative style allows the reader to reassociate themselves with these characters who, along with an pleasantly active plot, drive the story successfully onwards toward a satisfactory ending."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"The premise of the book was just too ridiculous. Maybe I didn't give it enough time (34 pages) but a 17 year old with a stammer and a 35 year old rake? It was just preposterous. Also, I found reading the text with the stammer was very annoying. I gave up at about page 35 because the plot was not convincing!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Ms. Heyer's masterful wit and knowledge of her subject make this a wonderful read. Her command over words and talent for making evryone fall in love with her hero, Mr. Beaumaris at once. The way she incorporates her heroine with her brother's folly and her ridiculous plot to get Mr.Beaumaris is delightful. Good work Ms. Heyer, a Regency Masterpiece"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Frankly, Richard Armitage could read the phone book and I'd probably be entertained. But reading Heyer's complicated story of a marriage begun for all the wrong reasons to two people who haven't a clue how to have a real relationship, he is genuinely wonderful. His characters come to life in such a way as to keep one riveted. His interpretation of the heroine's brother, the Viscount, was so hilarious that I liked him better than Rule - obviously, Armitage does comedy very well. I would buy any other Heyer that had Armitage spinning the tale!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I absolutely loved this extremely delightful and charming novel. It is well-written and exceptionally descriptive, with a liberal dose of humour (evocative of Sheridan's \`The School for Scandal'). Another feature which I admired is the historical accuracy (which, unfortunately, is not met by many contemporary \`historical' fictions)- the fashion, entertainments, geographies, and even the language stay true to the Georgian era.The prestigious and noble Winwood family, albeit impoverished (thanks to the ill-effects of gambling), have much to be thankful for when the wealthy and handsome Earl of Rule offers to \`address' the eldest and most beautiful daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth unwillingly accepts to hear Rule's addresses for she is deeply in love with a childhood friend, Lt. Edward Heron, who hails from an excellent but more impoverished family. Her predicament compels the youngest Winwood sister Horatia (or Horry) to save her sister by \`sacrificing' herself. She secretly visits Rule to propound an alternative solution to the dilemma (which he wasn't aware of, in any case): Rule should marry her instead of Elizabeth (or Charlotte). Of course, she (being tiny, dark haired, and with thick, straight, and dark eyebrows..... oh, and a stammer) is a far cry from Elizabeth, but she presents solid reasons. Although it did seem as if their age difference (he is 35, she is 17) might pose a problem, Rule (who is amused, especially by her candour and foibles) eventually assents. The two reach an agreement on a purely marriage of convenience, with Horry promising not to interfere with his life, provided he becomes Lt. Heron's patron.Soon after, Rule and Horry tie the knot, honeymoon in Paris, and return back to London. And the hilarious drama begins, with a few individuals keen on creating discord for the newly-weds: Rule's mistress, the beautiful and scheming widow Lady Caroline Massey, who certainly hoped that she would be the next Countess of Rule; infamous nemesis Lord Robert Lethbridge, who yearns for revenge against Rule; and Rule's cousin and heir presumptive, the truly comical, vain, and cowardly Crosby Drelincourt, who was hoping to succeed to the earldom.Admittedly, there are some drawbacks. The characters are not explored in depth, there are quite a few times when the plot is unconvincing (including, the growing romance between Marcus and Horry), and the ending is quite predictable.But if you need a light, humorous, melodramatic, and engaging novel to cheer you up and take you back to the Georgian times, don't look any further!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Ever since I began reading heyer -- in 1966, when I was 15! -- this is the novel I have loved the most. Although set earlier than many of her novels, the beguiling story of Horatia Winwood, who offers herself to Marcus Rule in her sister's stead to save the Winwood fortunes, has all the panache and wit that charcterizes Heyer at her bets. Originally written in 1933, I feel that some of the descriptions about the erotic frissons between Horry and Rule HAD to have been read by Margaret mitchell, whose GWTW in 1936 has passages that read almost identically to Heyer's!Hilarious comic characterisations, especially the effete Crosby Drelincourt and Pelham Winwood, Horry's dim but dashing brother.Amazon found me a British first edition which i treasure, but I buy the stylish new copies as gifts. A Must-read for Heyer fans."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"*****Light SPOILERS, but nothing unexpected for a Heyer book******I became a Heyer fanatic in my late teens, about thirty years ago, but I'm not sure this is one I read at the time. (It seemed a bit familiar, but since Heyer recycles characters and plot elements, I can't be certain one way or the other.) I am purchasing the new editions as they come out (replacing my ragged old mass markets), and I found this one an engaging but not compelling read.Early Heyer tends to be more sexually frank than later Heyer, but that is still pretty much on the circumspect side for most turn-of-the-millennium tastes. A book where the hero and heroine marry early on, but then must still find their way to the actual in-love-happier-ever-after ending presents unique problems: even those not of prurient bent may find it odd that Lord Rule has never kissed Horry \\"like that\\" until the book's ending. Has the marriage perhaps not even been consummated--maybe because Rule finds his bride just SO young and wants to woo her first? Since the reader knows much more about what is going on than Horry does, and since Heyer is fairly straightforward about Rule's relationship with his mistress, the vagueness about the marriage unnecessarily obscures the nature of Rule's and Horry's relationship.As to the characters, I enjoyed both Rule and Horry, without finding either notably memorable. I liked the variety of Horry's personality: she is clever but unworldly, and enjoys cutting a figure in the ton. I also really liked how well Rule understood and appreciated Horry, and the depth of his trust in her. (He trusts her because he understands her.) My favorite parts of the book dealt with Horry's brother and his spectacularly easygoing approach to life, whether engaged in a duel or told there's been a murder. Heyer has a special gift for comic relief characters such as this. Where the book fails is in some of the plotting, especially later in the book, where the ending is only held off by some foolish actions on Horry's part. (But at least someone is around to tell her she's being a fool.) Some of these plot elements, particularly those involving playacting on Rule's part, require a suspension of disbelief similar to that in watching a Shakespeare play--only this isn't Shakespeare! All told, the book is well worth reading, because most Heyer books are, but it is not her best.I complained in another review about the publisher putting Regency covers on Heyer's Georgian romances, so props to them for using a Georgian cover on this one."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"So, I finished A Convenient Marriage yesterday. I must say that Horrydrove me up a freakin' wall! She's seventeen and naive and it neveroccurs to her that maybe her thirty year old husband knows what he'stalking about. I don't know, maybe I've just forgotten howhard-headed teenagers can be but she just seemed to me to bebordering on TSTL status. And Rule was great.*SPOILERS AHEAD*I loved when Rule snuck into the masquerade and tossed the bad guy into the duck pond. But then the end...ugh. Where he's got the brooch but he doesn't tell her he's got the brooch and he lets Horry and her brother drive themselves crazy trying to get it back. Bleck. I skimmed through all that part and skipped to the end. In fact, after Rule dueled with thebad guy I pretty much skipped all the way to the very last pages.Horry just got to be too much.I thought her brother Pel and his cronies were amusing at times if a bit over the top in their besotted states. I was sad that Heyer seemed to be setting up a romance between the prudish sister and the secretary and then never developed it. The whole book seemed to me like Heyer had started out with grand plans for it and then discovered she only had enough stuff to make half a novel. It's probably one of my least favorite Heyers I've ever read.Of course, it should be noted that a bad Georgette Heyer is probably at least as good as a mediocre book by anyone else."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I only bought this so Richard Armitage could read me a bedtime story. In the end, I very much enjoyed the romance and I thought the characters were well-voiced. With the intricate dialogues in some scenes, RA's distinct and often humorous characterizations were very helpful. I didn't much like Horry; I prefer my heroines with a bit more art and a lot more intelligence."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"\\"The Convenient Marriage\\" is a funny historical romance set in 1770's England. The hero, Rule, reminded me of The Scarlet Pimpernel - he seemed lazy and unconcerned yet he was a lot more aware and athletic than he outwardly appeared. Horatia was charming and very funny at the beginning, but then she behaved rather badly (though not so much so that I stopped liking her). Rule's old enemy and a previous mistress of Rule's did some shocking things to try to break up the marriage. The comic relief mainly came from Horatia's usually-drunk brother and his friend doing their bumbling best to prevent her actions from creating a scandal...and only making things worse.There was a fair amount of historical detail--mainly about the clothing, though some about dueling, highway robbery, and such--woven into the story. I had a hard time putting the book down because of the bad scrapes Horatia and her brother kept getting into, some of them dangerous.There was some explicit bad language. There was no sex. Overall, I'd recommend this funny novel."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I wanted to like it but I just cannot like a heroine that is too naive plus not enough scenes that convinced me how the main characters fell inlove."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This was the first Georgette Heyer book I ever read when I was 13 years old. It started a lifelong passion for her novels. It is a hilarious book with great romance woven throughout! I have lost track of how many times I have read it over the years. Admittedly, Horry is clueless because she is so young and naive. However, her heart is so good and the idea that Rule would fall in love with her instantly for her selfless sacrifice to help her sister have her true love works for me. I think in the past 47 years I have read all of Georgette's romance novels and she is brilliant. Probably my next favorite is Devil's Cub but I always go back to A Convenient Marriage. When Horry asks Rule to put her in his heart and he says she is already there, it is truly a romantic moment."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I must admit that I love Georgette Heyer and am making my way through her catalog in the slowest way possible (so as to savor each find). I LOVED this novel though (Cotillion was my favorite until now), Horry is an amazing heroine who, after her marriage, finds a love of spending money and gambling. Shenanigans ensue from there and, yes, there are two swordfights and plenty of scheming.Others have outlined the plot in more depth on here, so I won't rehash, but the ending is assuredly happy!

I admit that I did not like the mystery that I read, Why Shoot a Butler? - but I am not really a big fan of that genre as a whole. This one, on the other hand, was delightful. The characters were charming and at times a little outrageous - especially for the time period. Like in the very beginning when Horatia takes it upon herself to visit Lord Rule and ask him to marry her in place of her sister Lizzie. And of course, she does all this behind her family's back. Horry proceeds to become the Earl's wife and quickly becomes the toast of the town. She is burdened with a stammer and I got the impression that as the youngest Winwood she was not always taken seriously. Once she becomes a wife, and a wealthy one at that, she lets nothing stand in her way to do whatever she feels she wants to - including catching the eye of Lord Lethbridge. I believe she pursues him only because everyone warns her to stay away from him - and he uses her as a pawn because of his dislike of the Earl. If you are a fan of Jane Austen type romances - and haven't yet tried Georgette Heyer - pick this one up soon. Sourcebooks is reissuing a slew of Georgette Heyer books - mysteries, romances and historical fiction. A whole new generation will be able to appreciate these works!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Horatia (Horry) Winwood is the youngest of three sisters. At age seventeen, she's not what society views as a beauty, and she herself has pretty much accepted that she will not marry. Horry is short, has severe eyebrows and a studder when she speaks.Horry's eldest and beautiful sister, Lizzie, is promised to marry the Earl of Rule. She needs to marry the Earl to save her family from the gambling debt that her brother has put them in. Lizzie, however is madly in love with Edward Heron. But Edward is is not wealthy and would not be able to take Lizzie's family out of debt. Horry decides to take it upon herself and visit the Earl and convince him to marry her instead. Being that her other sister, Charlotte, flat out refuses to marry him herself. The Earl is amused by Horry, and he decides to take her up on her proposal, he agrees to marry her.This book had me laughing out loud. Especially when Horry arrives back home after proposing to the Earl, in his carriage, to the shock of her family. She then announces that he has agreed to marry her instead and that she's convinced him to be a Patron to Edward. Her family can hardly believe it, they have to whip out the smelling salts so the mom won't faint. But true to his word, the Earl arrives that afternoon to officially ask for Horry's hand in marriage.As the story goes on, Horry does Marry Lord Rule and she begins to live a life of luxury. Soon enough, she begins to gamble and winds up getting herself a bit of a reputation. She meets a man named Robert Lethbridge, with a reputation himself of being a ladies man. Before she knows it, Horry starts a friendship with Lethbridge, against her husbands wishes. But Horry wants to make Rule jealous, she knows he keeps a mistress himself, the Lady Massey.I really enjoyed The Convenient Marriage. What a fun, light, and sweet read this was. There's plenty of interesting characters and the plot has good twists and turns. I liked Horry's character, although she annoyed me a little at times with her foolishness. I did like Rule's character, lucky for Horry, he was older and wiser than she was. Horry's brother Pel, who enjoys gambling and drinking was another memorable character. He gets himself into plenty of trouble including a duel over Horry's honor.Georgette Heyer is one of my favorite authors, I will have to read more of her work."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I love this author! Georgette Heyer has been around for a very long time, yet with the reissue of her many novels she is attracting a new generation. The Convenient Marriage is my third Heyer, and second romance that I have read of hers. The blurb above really tells the gist of the story, so I am not going to reiterate it here; with all the the simplistic and predictable events we still get pulled in a fantastic way. It is full of quaint scenes and fun romance set in earlier times, in Jane Austen fashion, but what I enjoy the most is the fact I find myself grinning to myself as I read her books. The Convenient Marriage is no exception to the grinning, sometimes it is laugh out loud funny with the hi-jinks of the heroine and her brother and his bosom buddies. There is a slew of interesting characters with Horry and her sisters and of course the obligatory numbskull character Mr Drelincourt who is upset the Earl of Rule has decided to marry after all these years which puts him further down the line in the inheritance.Here is a fun teaser from the book:p. 164:\\"While the waiting -woman collected her scattered jewels and garments she sipped the chocolate, pondering her problem. What had seemed a mere prank twelve hours earlier had by now assumed gigantic proportions. There was first the episode of the curl.\\"Horatia is stuttering fool, her brother is a drunk gambler, and the older man she married is besotted with her yet she is too immature to realize it. Her new husband, The Earl of Rule, is portrayed as a doting and tolerant man with none of the typical 'rake' or roguish ways so typical of a Heyer romance. This romance is complete with a sword fight, kidnapping, parties and pinching diamond shoes. Since this is actually one of Heyer's earlier romances from 1936 she was still honing her writing skill and perhaps had not perfected the Heyer Genre as this is not one of her most popular books. I admit that it was a teensy bit slow in one or two parts but I really did enjoy the comical aspect of it and I do not hesitate to recommend this to anyone interested in the Jane Austen/Regency Romance genre. To try and explain the scrapes that the characters got into reminds me a lot of the Three Stooges with a leg up on the intelligence factor, and this book is the epitome of a comically charming period romance."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Fast-paced and hilarious from beginning to end, it's another in the huge line of greats by Georgette Heyer. Horatia and the Earl of Rule are an unlikely pair who capture eachothers and the reader's heart by the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I believe this is the best Heyer I have ever readit is very difficult to write a comedy and this bookhad me in stiches from beginning to end. Horry is a verydelightful heroine, honest and very funny, and Rulewell, he is a gorgeous hero very smart and always ahead of thegame and he has a sense of humor too, I just love this bookI can read it over and over and not get tired of it.I also like Arabella, Regency Buck, Black sheep, April Ladyand many more."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I thought this was so fun, the humor in it was great, I just found out about Georgette Heyer and I like what I have read so far."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I am a fan of Georgette Heyer's historical novels, and this was the last one I needed to complete my collection. As with all the others, it is an amusing, rollicking story that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"A splendid tale well told with superb characters well drawn. One of my favourite Heyers. A great pleasure to read. One book I have read several times."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"While I have been a fan of Georgette Heyer since the mid-1960's, I can honestly say I did not enjoy this book very much as the main character, Horatia, is just too immature, silly, and plain annoying. I found myself wondering over and over again why the Earl would put up with her. Perhaps my dislike comes from listening to the audio version of the book, I don't know. Over the years I have read many of Heyer's books and know she is a wonderful author, but I doubt I would've liked this character even when I was a teenager like Horatia. Like another reviewer said: Read this one for the hero(the Earl of Rule)!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"and a stammering heroine! As always, Heyer's dialogue is spot on, her characterisation warm and powerful, and her characters very strongly drawn. The Convenient Marriage is considered in some circles to be one of the finest ever examples of a romance that portrays a flawed and unorthodox heroine, with its portrayal of the stammering, plain Horatia, and her marriage of convenience to the extremely handsome Earl of Rule, thus releasing her sister from any obligation to marry Rule. How Rule discovers the truth of his heart, and that he loves his funny, extravagant little wife, makes for moving reading, whilst Heyer gives us abundant humour in her portrayal of the mincing, petulant dandiprat Crosby Drelincourt; and in the escapades of Horatia. It is all the greatest of great good fun, and one of Heyer's most easily accessible books - its readability, exuberance and humour make it an excellent book for a potential introduction to the world of Georgette Heyer. However, this book is NOT a Regency Romance, but a Georgian Romance, and if you don't think it's as historically accurate as she usually is, consider that it is set in 1770 - about 50 years earlier than usual! It's still a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Before Georgette Heyer found the Regency period she wrote Georgians - and this is one of them. The Conveninent Marriage is set in the last couple of decades of the eighteenth century - when coach roads were still muddy morasses, highwaymen lurked on the outskirts of London, and men and women were corseted, laced, fringed, feathered, bewigged, powdered and patched to within in inch of their lives.The book starts right into the thick of things - The Earl of Rule is looking for a wife and it looks as though he will offer for society beauty, Lizzie Winwood. Lizzie is not enamoured of this idea - she wants to marry some worthy suitor whom she actually loves. Luckily it is her practical, straight talking younger sister, Horatia (better known as Horry) who steps into the fray instead. The interview in which Horry presents the revised plan to the Earl of Rule is hysterical.Horry is still rather young, and the Earl (who I instantly fell in love with) finds that he needs to rouse himself out of his usual langour to save her from herself. In the midst of all this there is a fiendish plot afoot to break up the marriage, Horry's well-meaning brother Pelham attempting to help Horry, a spare highwayman or two and some good old fashioned romping.The characters are generally so likeable and fun. The only problem I had is that Horry has a stutter - and they just don't make good reading (I think). A fun, quick read."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I heard wonderful things about Georgette Heyer and decided to give one of her novels a whirl. I heard Heyer wrote mostly Regency romances, so I was surprised to see that this one is actually a Georgian romance. I am not a big fan of the Georgian period because I don't like the elaborate clothing and I have a difficult time picturing men wearing powdered wigs, tights and corsets, but The Convenient Marriage is one of the most endearing and most hilarious period pieces I have ever read! Heyer had me in stitches during some scenes. The Earl of Rule feels it is time to get married and asks for society darling Lizzie Winwood's hand in marriage. Lizzie isn't interested in Lord Rule. She does want to marry a wealthy man, but she also wants to be in love with whoever she decides to marry. So her sister Horatia (Horry) takes her place. Horry isn't your typical heroine. She has a very bad stutter, is plain in appearance and has a rather particular sense of humor. Will those qualities endear her to Lord Rule or will he run a mile? There are many hilarious twists throughout the novel.I have never laughed so much reading a period novel. Since most authors have to keep with the times, attempts at humor in historicals aren't as funny as contemporary efforts. This isn't the case here. There are so many funny moments that I still smile when I think of them. Horry is such a wonderful heroine. Her sense of humor is compelling and she is remarkable in spite of her plainness. It is always refreshing to read about a plain heroine instead of a drop-dead gorgeous one. Her stuttering was difficult to follow at times and became annoying after a while though. Lord Rule is also great. I fell in love with him. He's my idea of the perfect man. Crosby Drelincourt is an awesome character as well. He made me laugh during various scenes. The language of the novel is quite interesting. Even though it is set during the 1770s, the novel reads more like a Regency romance instead of a Georgian one, something I found odd. I wouldn't say the historical references aren't accurate, more like she made the period sound a little too festive, not unlike Regency England. All in all, this is a wonderful historical romp and I am glad I gave this wonderful author a whirl. I heard Georgette Heyer was an author during the 1930s and was born around the turn of the twentieth century. I had no idea about this until I read her bio. So, I suppose her novels are probably considered classics then. I shall give all of her books a whirl."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"If you have skipped Georgette Heyer because you find her hard reading, I beg you to read \\"Convenient Marriage\\". This is a fun book in every sense of the word; a romp in Regency era (I'm sorry, I stand corrected, it's Georgian). There is not alot of major plot twists or deep character analysis, but plenty of just plain fun that is really very, very funny.There is the signature Heyer's extreme meticulousness of detail, down to the exact fashion of the year, and there is also her signature dialogue, and humor. But what I loved most of all was the love story between Hory and Lord Rule. It is hard to do seventeen and thirty-two - there is such a disparacy of age, seventeen is really SO young - and most authors who do have this age gap in their protaganists usually simply gloss over it. In the \\"Convenient Marriage\\", the age gap is one of the underlying problems which keep husband and wife apart - in a \\"Convenient Marriage\\", and it is with great skill, tact and humor that Ms. Heyer brings them together, at last. Everything is done exactly right - Hory (Horatia) acts within character, Lord Rule acts within character - at least the way I think it is realistic, I have never actually seen that kind of marriage up close.Some reviewers didn't like Horry - give it a break! She's only seventeen! And very spirited for seventeen, too.But the highlight of the book for me was definitely Lord Rule. He did and said everything just so perfectly, he treats Horry - who is leading him for a merry dance, but is also young enough to be his daughter - exactly the way a hero should! He deals with her gently, but deal with her he does. Although it may seem at times that Horry is coming across the winner in their battle of wits, Lord Rule is always a few steps ahead of her, but, oh, so gently, so cleverly, does he outsmart her! I could not have imagined their interactions any better, at all. Simply, simply perfect.For all those who complain about all those alpha males in other novels - here is your hero! He is about as un-alpha-male as you can get, yet he does not sacrifice his masculinity in the least! Just for the character of Lord Rule alone it is worth rating this book ten stars!If you are a romance reader, and have not yet read Georgette Heyer, read this book, you will NOT regret it!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I have read and re-read all of my Georgette Heyers every few years since 1973,and shall probably continue to do so for the next 30 or more years.Her dry,acerbic heroes,spirited heroines, and the not-too-bright characters who confuse everything and hence contribute to the plots,all add up to a great read.I have a long list of Heyer favourites,but the Convenient Marriage tops the list.The Earl of Rule is a perfect hero,Horry isn't such a perfect heroine but very likeable all the same,but the stars of the book would have to be Horry's brother Pelham, and his singularly inept friend Sir Roland Pommeroy,who gamely try,and fail,to rescue Horry from her various scrapes.Highlights for me are the drunken scene in Half-Moon Street and subsequent confusion at Lord Lethbridge's house;also when Pelham,Sir Roland,and Captain Heron take to the high toby,particularly when Sir Roland attempts to buy a horse from a very irate victim;and when Sir Roland invites Rule to a card party.This last is worth a quote:-(Sir Roland has gone to Rule's house in a desperate bid to keep him away from a party in Vauxhall Gardens,using a card party,for which he needs a fourth player,as his excuse)'Now don't say you cannot come!Can't play whisk with only three people,my lord.Most awkward situation!''I am sure it must be,'agreed his lordship sympathetically.'And I expect you have tried everyone else.''Oh everyone!'said Sir Roland.&quot;Can't find a fourth at all.Do beg of your lordship not to fail me!'.....The Earl appeared to meditate.'I am of course very fond of whisk.'Sir Roland breathed a sigh of relief.'Knew I could count on you!Beg you will dine first-five o'clock.''Who are your other guests?'inquired his lordship.'Well,to tell you the truth-not quite sure yet,'said Sir Roland confidentially.'Bound to find someone glad of a game.Have it all fixed by five o'clock.'"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Noel Coward once said that Georgette Heyer was the greatest ever writer of English dialogue. And it is in 'The Convenient Marriage' that she hits her peak. The various exchanges among the innocent and candid Horatia, her arch and sardonic husband the Earl of Rule, his arch-enemy, and her various earnest but not over-bright admirers and friends is nothing short of priceless.It's a pretty good action-romance, too."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"You will be smiling right through the book. It is so funny and at the same time more than just a collection of witty dialogue. It is a touching love story. I am an avid collector and reader of Georgette Heyer Books. This is one of her best. Ths is one author I can read and re read over and over. Also recommended are Grand Sophy and My Lord John by the same author. Love her books!!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"Set in the late 1770's, of all Georgette Heyer's books, The Convenient Marriage is la cr&egrave;me de l&aacute; cr&egrave;me of great reads, right up there with Cotillion, Venetia, Arabella, These Old Shades, and The Grand Sophy. Like many of her heroes (such as Mr. Beaumaris in Arabella), Marcus, Earl of Rule is, in the words of Jane Austen, \\"the epitome of manly excellence\\" with one obvious flaw: he is a \\"rake,\\" though a fairly moral one. He is, after all, thirty five years old and a product, to some degree, of the morality of his times. Seventeen-year-old heroine Horatia Winwood (named after her godfather, real-life Horace Walpole, 1717-1797), or Horry for short, is one of Heyer's most delightful creations. Horry captives the Earl, and the reader, by cataloguing her flaws as she proposes a switch: that he marry her instead of her sister who is in love with a young officer named Heron. Despite the age discrepancy, they marry. It is to be a marriage of convenience, as Horry naively points out; she engages not to interfere with Rule and expects, as a matter of course, the same of him. Gradually, as she learns a bit more about life and the social world she has barely entered, Horry finds this arrangement not at all what she wants. And Rule, suave but unexpectedly uncertain where his young wife's heart is concerned, discovers the same. It's a mad romp through pages of expert and witty dialogue, cleverly wrought misadventures, and scenes both hilarious and tender, complete with superbly written side-characters who work either to destroy the marriage by bringing ruin on the bride (in one case as a method of revenge upon the groom) or to save both the marriage and the bride in rather bungling ways. Despite the various efforts of well-wishers and ill, Rule and Horry find themselves in a marriage that is exactly what each truly wanted: a marriage of mutual fidelity, love, and esteem. Trust Arrow to publish an edition with period cover art! Finally, a publisher that gives a Heyer's work the well-educated, classy look it deserves!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is one of the earlier Heyer romances and, while it displays many hallmarks of her signature style -- the language, the references to current styles, the immersion in the period -- and begins delightfully, the parts don't quite come together. Lord Rule makes a charming hero but, in the end, Horry is too childish to make a satisfying romantic heroine. The material -- young bride with improvident brother tries to salvage her whirlwind marriage to an older man -- is handled more successfully in April Lady. A more satisfying child bride is Hero Wantage of Friday's Child (a book which boasts one of the great opening scenes of all time, plus a terrific screwball finale). Read this one for the hero, not the heroine."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"That's what Horry discovers when she offers herself to the Earl of Rule in place of her sister. She is sure he cannot object, because after all, she does have the Winwood nose!In fact, Rule is most happy to accept the substitution, as he was bowled over the the charmingly innnocent Horry in an instant. But innocence doesn't mean she won't lead him a merry dance...Heyer never failed to please, and The Convenient Marriage is a perfect example of her ability to spin a delightful tale, whle showing us the heights and pitfalls of a Season in London."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"This is not a commendable Heyer &quot;work of art.&quot; I wonder at what time in her life was she writing this particular novel...it has a weak plot, weak characters, and a terrible ending. I have read all of Heyer's books and am avid collecter of them but this particular one will not be joining my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"It was not easy reading. I found myself reading each sentencetwice to understand what was being said. I decided not to finish the book."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I really enjoy reading, at any time I'll have at least three books I'm reading at the same time. So for me to say an audio book is good that's saying a lot. I like Richard Armitage, he's nice to look at and he's got a very pleasant voice. But I think in this case Richard's reading of this book is what makes it wonderful to listen to.I've listened to it three times and each time I am amazed that the range of voices is just one man. There is one part of the story where there are three men having a conversation and it sounds like there are three different men, two of the men are nobles and one a highwayman. Richard's ability to change voices from one gender to another or social status with out a pause is just amazing.If you like Georgette Heyer and Richard Armitage this is good combination."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"How wonderful to have Kindle access to Georgette Heyer--I've purchased a dozen or more of Heyer's books that I'd never read before, including this one. CONVENIENT MARRIAGE has all the earmarks of the style that makes Heyer so well loved by her fans. Humor, crackling dialogue, adept characterization, with the addition of a flawed heroine who is nevertheless lovable and feisty. She is young but by no means unintelligent, and \\"Rule\\"--the earl she marries, is a delightful change from the hardened alpha male we often find in the romance genre, while not without the dignity or manliness we want in a hero.This is a quick, fun read which I absolutely recommend."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I have to say that I love Georgette Heyer and have never been disappointed but our heroine here is not interesting me in the least. She's annoying boring and I find myself wishing that it was another character that was going to catch the eye of Rule.The stammer doesn't bother me but I just feel like the other characters in the book that she's immature young and doesn't carry anything interesting for me to wish the Rule would fall for her. The first meeting didn't grab me with these two and that's vastly disappointing as I always rely on Heyer to take me in with the couple upon first sighting even if they aren't at first attracted to each other.This is the first time for me that it falls flat and I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I'm really disappointed in this book. It's all over the place. I do like (enjoy) the Earl Rule very much. Horry is very annoying and idioctic. The story has yet to grab me. I'm waiting for \\"it\\" to happen and \\"it\\" has not happened. Not sure where the humor is that the other reviewers have mentioned."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I enjoyed the story thoroughly, as I do most of Heyer's books! The other reviews express the books very well, so this will be a short review. I just wanted to add that in my opinion, there is not enough interaction between the hero and heroine!"},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"I wouldn't have thought having a male reader for a Georgette Heyer novel would work...until I heard Richard Armitage. In this high comedy (about being married, not getting married), Horatia Winwood, the stammering youngster of three sisters, tangles with the Earl of Rule when he proposes to her oldest sister...a match that makes financial and social sense, but would break two hearts. Armitage's narration is elegant and unhurried, and he makes the various characters' voices sufficiently distinct for the listener. Be aware that this recording is abridged: I know that's an issue for some people. I wish it were all here, but I listened to the first two chapters with the original book in front of me. While a lot of description has been jettisoned, I didn't notice anything of consequence to the plot--such as it is--getting lost. It's a different medium, and as such I found the result most enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Convenient Marriage","review":"STORY BRIEF:I excerpted much of the following from the website Heyerlist dot org which says it well - what to expect when you read this book.The Earl of Rule (Rule) is 35, proud, wealthy. He has a pleasant, mocking, lazy charm which belies his keen mind and iron will.The Winwood family has title but no money. Rule doesn't know much about her but decides to marry the eldest daughter Elizabeth. Horatia (Horry) is 17 and the younger sister. Horry goes to Rule and tells him Elizabeth loves another and that Horry would like to marry Rule instead. She has heard that men like him have mistresses and Horry assures him she will not interfere with that. Horry admits to Rule her flaws - she has straight, thick black eyebrows, a pronounced stammer, and is short. They marry. Horry is mischievous, honest, frank, high-spirited, and has inherited her family's tendency to gamble. She gets into numerous scrapes.Three people try to cause problems with the marriage, Rule's mistress, Lethbridge who wants to hurt Rule in any way he can, and Crosby (Rule's cousin who is further removed from inheriting Rule's wealth now that he is married). Pel is Horry's brother who gambles and drinks too much. Pel plans various schemes to help Horry get out of messes.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I didn't want to stop reading. I wanted to know what would happen. I loved Horry's zestful spirit, refreshing honesty, and her roguish charm. Part of the draw was I kept hoping and waiting for Rule and Horry to fall in love. Rule stopped seeing his mistress and I wanted Horry to know about it, but she didn't. I was chuckling a few times at the ridiculous plans and actions of Horry's brother Pel trying to help her. Pel's actions were silly but entertaining.One part is probably more humorous hearing it as an audiobook than reading it. Pel puts on a mask and attempts to rob a horse-drawn carriage. He shoots his gun to stop the horses and yells \\"Stand and deliver.\\" The narrator says this with a British accent which was funny. It's so different from American westerns where the robber says \\"This is a holdup\\" or \\"This is a stickup.\\"The author is very good with dialogue which a lot of current day authors should do more of.SOUND QUALITY:The narrator Caroline Hunt has a pleasant voice, but the recording was hard to hear - as if too many low tones and not enough treble. At times I had to turn up the volume which was not a good solution. I don't know if the problem was her voice or the equipment used to record this. I downloaded the version with the best quality audio.CAUTION SPOILER:Horry and Rule finally communicate that they love each other during the last few sentences of the book. I wanted another chapter or epilogue to experience the love and to see their feelings and interactions AFTER that moment. That would have taken it to 5 stars for me.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 9 hours. Narrator: Caroline Hunt. Swearing language: none. Sexual content: none. Setting: 1776 England.

Then, he is kidnapped, transported and sold to gold prospectors in Alaska. Buck's life drastically changes. He must fight off rival dogs, withstand the blows from his master's club, and survive the treacherous frozen wilderness. Buck grows strong and cunning, eventually heeding \\"the call of the wild\\".I found the story fascinating and rich. I was impressed with London's ability to write believably from within the mind of a dog. It was definitely a unique view of the world. The book is full of adventure and is never dull.The vocabulary is intensive and we did have to stop several times each evening to discuss the meanings of words and the basics of plot. My nine-year-old son enjoyed the story, but even he had to ask a lot of questions about plot and meanings of words. I think he might have been able to grasp it better if he had simply read it by himself. My smaller children were completely lost. They asked each night to read, but I think it was simply to prolong bedtime and because they do like to listen to me read. This particular book was definitely beyond their understanding."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London, an American author, journalist, and social activist, was born in 1876. He led a hugely colourful life, one that included being caught up in the Yukon Gold Rush. His time on the trail formed the basis for his two best known books - \\"The Call of the Wild\\" and \\"White Fang\\".\\"The Call of the Wild\\" opens in the Autumn of 1897, and tells the story of - Buck, a St Bernard - Scotch shepherd cross and four years old when we first meet him. He lives at Judge Miller's place in the Santa Clara Valley and is his owner's pride and joy - literally the estate's top dog. Unfortunately for Buck, with the Klondike Gold Rush in full swing, there's a demand for big, strong sled-dogs. While the Judge wouldn't ever consider selling Buck, one if the Judge's unscrupulous gardeners is bad need of some cash - and, sooner than you can say \\"Get down, Shep\\", Buck is heading to the frozen north.Buck serves a number of different masters - some treat him well, others terribly. (The level of cruelty that Buck suffers on his journey north is appalling and only one of the humans in \\"The Call of the Wild\\" earns Buck's undying loyalty). Many of Buck's fellow dogs are little better, however - his own team has one cruel and dangerous rival called Spitz, for example. Although Buck's easy life is over, he luckily proves to a quick learner - as clever, hardworking and adaptable as he is strong. However, as time goes on, the call of the wild becomes louder and Buck longs to join the wolves.A short book, one that can be easily whizzed through and - despite a number of unpleasant scenes - totally recommended."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The author of \\"Call of the Wild\\" is Jack London. I think the meaning of the title means that there is a voice inside, calling to us to go out and battle nature. The setting is Alaska in 1897 during the gold rush, and the story happens over 2 years. The significance of where it took place is huge, because Alaska was a hard place to live because it was primitive and didn't have nice things like running water or toilets. They had to get everywhere by dogsleds. It was hard to survive there. The protagonist is Buck and he is believable because he is this huge dog that turns from a spoiled dog to a wild animal. The antagonists were the people that were mean and would beat him when he didn't obey or did something wrong. These men are very believable because some men are just bad and don't treat animals well.The major conflict was Buck battling to survive against bad men and nature. The rising action was when he was with the worst owner who almost beat him beat him to death. That's when the kind man found him and Buck's life changed and it was the first owner he had ever really loved. It was the turning point in his life, because he had a purpose and someone to protect. He spent a few years with him and saved his life twice. But in the end, his owner died from Indians even though Buck killed the chief and others during the battle. After the Indians left some wolves came and he earned their respect and joined their pack. He ended up in a really different environment than where he started from. In the middle, he was in really bad places and almost died. But Buck found out where he belonged and that was with the wolves. But I think he would have been the happiest if he could have stayed with the owner who loved him.I really liked this book, that is why I gave it four stars, and I recommend it to everybody who has a little wild in them."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"loved this book as a boy. still reads well today. i want buck as my dog."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London takes the reader on a trip of personal discovery. We first meet Buck in California where he is satisfied and reasonably happy. Then we embark on a harrowing adventure that takes him to the deadly competition of a sled dog, following the dreams of his human users and abusers and ultimately abandons him to the reality of his ancestral place - \\"The Wild\\".Mr. London successfully produces an anthropomorphism that delivers his story poignantly and with purpose. You will be caught up in the evolution of a dog that grows from man-dependent to independent. It does not take too much effort to relate a young person's development from child to self-sufficient adult in this story. Sadly, the disappointments and harshness of life shown in this tale are all too true in most lives. But the conquering of doubt, terror, and hurt are what make this story remarkable.This is a \\"must read\\" for all young people. Most of Jack London's tales follow this theme of trial to personal achievement and a young person can find hope in his own life by following the exciting journeys he presents."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The language of this book is beautiful and amazing! When the main character is an animal, there is a danger of the story being \\"told\\" instead of \\"shown\\" to the reader, but London does an amazing job of keeping the action moving without it feeling contrived to be seeing the events from the dog's point of view. Yes, much of the story is sad and heart-breaking, but the story is engaging.

This is a really great book.It is powerful, clear-eyed, direct and informed by a natural and compelling realism. It is violent, but honestly so. It is plain, unvarnished and unsympathetic.

It's about a dog, Buck, stolen from his lavish life in California and shipped to the Yukon as a sled dog to be used in the gold rush there. The book deals with his adaption from an easy domesticated life to one of a work and toil as a sled dog and eventually of one to a wile dog.London's socialist ideas come through as he talks of the joy Buck and the other dogs get from the work they do on the sled. He shows us that creatures are happier working than they are without it, but also shows us the detriment of working in poor conditions under bosses who don't care for their workers.Hard not to argue that Call of The Wild is one of the greatest socialist works ever, as well as one of America's greatest. Few had the ability of Jack London, and it may never have shown better than here."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"\`The Call of the Wild' follows Buck, a strong, dignified dog as he is torn from his home and taken to pull sled in the Yukon during the gold rush. It is written mainly from a dogs point of view which makes for original and interesting reading and shows how Buck gradually creeps back to his primordial and hereditary roots as a wild dog. This is only a short book but you are quickly drawn into Bucks world and viewpoint and before you know it the last page has been turned and you are left both satisfied and saddened to have finished. Written in simple, yet richly descriptive, language this book is aimed at children, although adults can get as much, if not more, from it as younger readers can. Having heard about this book for years but never getting round to reading it, I can say that it was a delight to pick up and immerse myself in and I only wish I had done so sooner. A classic wilderness tale and one well worth checking out.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I liked this book because it was very descriptive and interesting. I would recommend that only children of twelve years and older read this book. It is filled with much violence, blood, gore and some brief language (in French). The author did a great job of making you not want to put it down. The main character, Buck, learns some valuable lessons that stay with him. You can relate to Buck because he makes his emotions so great. - M.C.This was a short and sorrowful book. I liked it but I would not recommend it to readers under twelve, or if you are depressed. It's about a Saint Bernard cross-breed who is dognapped and forced to be a sled dog in Alaska. It is now his job to survive. I liked it because of its good description and historical accuracy. Don't read it if you dislike blood, fighting or dogs being abused. - D.J.\\"The Call of the Wild\\" is very well written by the author, Jack London, who draws you into Buck's adventure. I enjoyed this book very much, not just because of Jack London's amazing writing, but because Buck (the dog) shows us human greed and how the love of a man could tear his world in half. Of course, Buck was created by London, but London gave Buck emotions and feelings any human can relate to. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is a great book to relax and read. This book is highly recommended for 12 years of age and up because of violence and gore. - M.L.This book is a great book. It's about lots of different dogs Buck (the main character) meets. There are many deaths and lots of love and death situations. Some dogs get killed in this book, because they don't have the will to go on. I liked this book a lot, except for the deaths. I'd recommend it for 13 years and over. - J.T."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"If you haven't read this in a while - or never - please do. Wonderful, insightful.

I'm a sixth grader who happened to read 'The Call of The Wild' because the title sounded interesting and attractive. 'The Call of The Wild' is basically about a dog who goes back to the wild because he had a vague feeling of wild calling him. I liked this book because Jack London describes exciting scenes well and uses the perfect adjectives for nouns. I think the book has a lot to learn about the world.\\"The Call of The Wild\\" is a novel by Jack London. It is a allegory about the unfairness of the world. The allegory in \\"The Call of The Wild\\" is very hard to find because Jack London had hidden it very well. Jack London talks a lot about how there's never a fair fight between living things and never everlasting things.When a wolf-like dog fought with Curly and Curly went down, she never came back to her feet and was buried under vicious, hungry huskies. Once you are down, that's the end of you; people never help anyone when someone falls. He never mentions anything about world playing fair games. The world is never fair, loving or warm.He also tells that there's power that we can never get over and which we have to obey. He shows this by describing a fight between the man in the red sweater with a club and Buck who was in rage. Buck, after fighting, learns that he stood no chance against this man with a club. He sees a lot of dogs go through the same fight and learn the same lesson as he. Then he once saw a dog who refused to obey the power being killed. No chance against the power that rules over, no denying of it.He also shows that nothing in the world lasts long and forever. Not even loving relationship. Curly, who was a friend of Buck, died. Perrault and Francois were given official orders to give Buck away; they disappear out of Buck's life forever. Buck's sled team dogs disappears or dies one by one until the four last dogs, Pike, Sol-leks, Joe and Teek and the three humans ended their lives when the whole section of ice underneath them gave way. Even the love and deep relationship between John Thornton never go forever. John Thornton died when other dogs and people in the gold search group were attacked by Yeehats. The gold search group all died, too. The death of John Thornton drives Buck crazy with rage that he kills most of the Yeehats in the camp. Jack London strongly believes nothing ever go forever in the world.Jack London has strong emotions towards the world. Because he was raised and born in a poor environment, he sees the world as an unfair world. He sees a lot of negative sides of the world. There's almost no one to hold onto and it is common to see people breaking up and ending their relationship. There is a center power of the world that we can never win and is forced to obey. Nevertheless, all the negative sides of the world is much true; it isn't wrong.Gloria Lee*************************************************I am a 13-year-old student living in Seoul, Korea. I read this book The Call of the Wild by Jack London which is about a Southland dog named Buck who adapts to the rough life of the Artic North and slowly changes like his ancestors who lived freely in the wild.In this novel, Buck finds his instincts while living in the Artic and later goes back to the wild instead of living with humans like he did before. We humans also have our instincts from the past, like when we try to get to the nature like mountains and beaches once in a while. Since they have changed over time to adapt to the environment, it may look like animals' old instincts had disappeared. However, many of those instincts are still inside them.Buck also had many relationships towards the end of the book. He had been raised by Judge Miller, trained by the man in the red sweater, traveled with Perrault and Francois, also with the dogs, later with the three men. He had had a loving relationship with John Thornton, his last master. Those relationship, however, all ended by many events, even with Thornton who Buck really loved. This book shows that there is no such thing as forever, relationships that do not end.With Jack London's great ideas and writing skills, this book is very thrilling and adventurous- sometimes humorous, happy, sometimes scary or serious. I think I learned many things and also learned to think more deeply by reading this book, and I strongly recommend it- you would never regret buying this book after reading this.Yuna Suh*************************************************Hi, I am an elementary school student in Korea learning English. I got to know about this book from the academy I am attending. I guess you can say I read it because of the academy homework.When I first saw the cover and the tile of this book, I thought it was going to be rally boring and sad. I usually don't like books that lack humorous parts, so I didn't like this book at first.However, my feeling for the book changed as I read on. I figured out that it wasn't just a story of a dog. It had some sort of messages and hidden meaning behind the great descriptions London used. \`The Call of the Wild' is a book that you shouldn't judge by its cover. It is not boring, but it is somewhat violent and sad. But, the violent and sad moments in the novel is not something that caught my eyes. It was how London wrote things. He didn't say things directly, but suggestively. I think I had fun guessing the hidden messages with my friends at the academy. Also, reading about how Buck is changing every time is another great part of this book.One thing about this book is that it uses weird words because the men in the book use old accents and such. But I don't think that makes this book inferior because it actually makes this book more fun and unique.I really recommend this book to anybody who is thinking of buying it. Don't ponder over this, just read it and I promise you'll never regret it.Jackie Sim*************************************************Hello. I am a Korean elementary school sixth grader who read \`The Call of the Wild'. The reason why I read this book was because of my English academy's recommendation for reading class.I had a negative feeling about the book before I read it. Since the title is \`The Call of the Wild', I expected some story about nature and nature's potential power. However, as I read on this book, the book gave a story about a dog(Buck) that goes through all kinds of pain in the Northland. It is not just a story, it is almost like an autobiography. Since the writer, Jack London, expresses Buck like a human being, it feels as if Buck is within me.When I read the rest of the story, I was able to know what the moral that Jack London wanted give out. Love against Wildness. One of the themes that I want to point out is the part when Buck meets a man called John Thornton while going through Northland. This man adores Buck, and Buck defines John as his only master. So when John was killed by a native tribe while Buck was gone, Buck takes revenge upon the tribe's chief and then goes into the wildness where he joins a group of wolves. By reading this part, I was able to understand what love and the wild was.I recommend this book to you. Even if you don't think it is fun, it is actually more exciting and comical than \`fun'. Although the start is not quite good, the story progresses into a book that you will never forget. Thank you.Sue Joo*************************************************I am a fifth grade girl in South Korea. I like to read in my leisure time, but that's not how I began to read for this book. With \`The Call of the Wild', I read it because the teachers of my English academy assigned it as homework. I began to read it and pretty soon I was hooked on.I recommend \`The Call of the Wild' because it is a book that is good for leisure reading and for fun. However, this book is also good for reading by thinking the meaning of the metaphors the author Jack London was hid in every nook and cranny of this book.I also liked this book because it teached me some of the truth in reality. People usually think that the government provides them with a lot of safety, and that they are extremely safe and free within the borders. However, Jack London shows you that you are not safe or free, and that you have to evolve a sort of a survival instinct by making his characters see the real world.Reading the previous paragraph may make people think that \`The Call of the Wild' is a very boring book that lectures to you about the \\"real world\\" and the \\"truth.\\" That is not at all what I meant. What happens in \`The Call of the Wild' is that a lesson is hidden behind a fun and amusing story. The author saves us time from reading a boring lecture by hiding it. That's what makes this book good for light reading as well because if you concentrate only on the literal meaning and storyline of the book, \`The Call of the Wild' suddenly becomes an amusing book.In \`The Call of the Wild' the author explains a whole bunch of his thoughts. He writes about love, a primitive instinct for nature, heredity, and the cruel law that favors the powerful. The characters in Jack London's book have to go through some harsh times, and have to adjust to their new surroundings. It seems like another person's story that has nothing to do with your own personal life, but as you go on reading, it somehow seems a bit familiar. I think that's one of the things I like best about this book.I like this honesty about life that Jack London weaves into the book. The fact that this book is also good for pleasure reading, and not just good for thoughtful reading makes \`The Call of the Wild' even more appealing. Therefore I strongly recommend this book.Sarah Park*************************************************"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is a review I previously wrote for four books in the Whole Story Series (Call of the Wild, The Jungle Book, Treasure Island, and Around the World in Eighty Days). I hope someone finds this helpful in their decision to purchase these books. :)This is a wonderful series for children (and adults) who value learning through literature--especially classic literature. What makes it even more appealing to parents and educators is the way the publishers have integrated historically relevant facts with the complete, unabridged text. Each classic branches over several areas of learning--history, culture, geography, customs, animal life, architecture, literature, and science.The Call of the Wild includes sidebars, maps, photographs, line drawings, diagrams, and paintings describing the Gold Rush, Klondike region, transcontinental railroad, sledding, traveling routes, harsh conditions, animal life, tools and procedures used for mining gold, and more.The Jungle Book provides details about India, animal life, religious landmarks and architecture, culture and customs. It also includes two-page features on wolf children, the seal massacre, and a photo spread of India.Around the World in Eighty Days takes the reader across a geographical journey using various forms of transportation. Maps, illustrations, and photographs provide rich detail into the culture and landmarks of many different locales and the means of transportation used in each leg of the journey.Treasure Island provides abundant information on ocean-related topics--sailors, pirates, treasure chests, ocean voyages, living conditions, crimes and punishment, weaponry, traditions, slavery, animal and plant life, medicine and disease, and more. It includes two- or three-page spreads featuring ocean charts, navigational instruments, compasses, types of ships, a cut-out diagram of a ship's compartments, sails, rigging, ropework, points of sail, and famous pirates.These books inspire an integrated approach to learning and would make a wonderful addition to your home library."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Heart-touching. Although this novel is not one of the books that I would choose for myself, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. The fact that this is historical fiction should have turned me off, but it wasn't mainly about the Yukon gold rush. It was about a dog's life going from owner to owner and finally finding a place in which he feels he belongs. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is often refered to as the best work of fiction ever written about dogs, and I must say I definitely agree. As a dog lover, I found parts of this story heart-touching and breaking. When Buck was removed from the civilized Southland where he reigned supreme among his animal kind, to the cold of the Yukon, it broke my heart. Especially when terrible men literally beat him and whipped him almost to death. Take the man in the red sweater for example, his job is to break dogs. I could not even begin to imagine how he could live with himself.Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Poor good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while the good-natured Dave was moments from dying but still wanted to continue in his place as a sled dog. Even the harsh Spitz has to be pitied because it was clear that his harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for gold. Buck not only conquers the weather, he conquers the harshness of the men who abuse him and his sled team.When he finds his rightful owner, John Thorton, he finally feels at peace. Life becomes better than it ever had been for Buck, and all of this was due the kindness of Thornton. Buck was very afraid that John Thornton would disappear as all of his other masters had such as Perrault or Francois. Additionally, this man meant more to him than anyone else he had known in his entire life, so it would have been devastating to lose him. Buck respects and loves John more than any other human or animal in the entire world. Their relationship continues to grow stronger as they became inseparable, watching over each other with plaesure, developing a bond that could never be broken.The future was looking wonderful for Buck, and as the days went on \\"The Call of the Wild\\" could be heard more clearly. Buck became curious, and he found that \\"The Call\\" was none other then his ancestor's own kind, the wolf. Buck began to live in the wild as well as with Thorton. Life could not have been any better, but suddenly, everything changed. Buck was going for his normal stroll through the woods when suddenly, something did not seen right. He went back to the camp to find that his beloved John Thorton was dead. He was filled with such rage and when he looked over at the Yeehats, he attack them. One by one, he killed until almost half were dead. The other half went back screaming into the woods. What was done was done, and even though there will forever be a void in his heart where once it was filled with John Thorton's love, he has found his rightful place with his brother, and the pack of wolves.Overall, I do not think there is any part of this novel I do not like, but the part I like most was Buck's whole journey and how well Jack London described it. As Jack London once said, \\"I wrote a thousand words every day.\\" He is such a talented writer and I really apprciate him. Second, the character I like most was Buck. He is such a dynamic character. He went from being a domesticated house pet to a creature of the wild. Third, the final grade I would give this novel will definiately be an A. Finally, I would recommend this novel to anyone who can read. Although it might be hard to understand for some, It is a great classic for everyone to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Perhaps Jack London's most famous (and shortest) novel, THE CALL OF THE WILD is an undeniably powerful book. Its reputation as a children's book is unfortunate, as this one has something to offer readers of all ages. It is more than the simple-seeming story of a dog taken from civilization and thrust into a harsh and brutal environment, where he is forced to thrive or die, kill or be killed. It is also a story of making the best of the worst, persevering against overwhelming obstacles, living up to ones potential, and reclaiming lost heritage. The emergence of Buck's instinctual fire for life and the almost ghostly visitations from his ancestors is really a joy to read. London's ability to draw you into his stories is also much in evidence here. Even though Buck is a dog, London is able to make him into one of the most intimately knowable and lovable characters in fiction, a remarkable feat when considering the brevity of the novel. Additionally, the sometimes extreme brutality of Buck's surroundings, and the graphic nature in which London describes it, certainly indicates that children were not the intended audience for this piece.Buck's journey in the North and his transformation into the powerful adept of the Fang and the Club makes up a tale that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to readers of any age or experience. London's message is more than the straight forward story that it usually gets credit for. If you haven't yet read it, or haven't since your childhood, pick this one up for a few hours of enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This book was a pretty good book.

This novel is about a four year-old husky named Buck who lived peacfully in the Santa Clara Valley. He was used to living in luxurious surroundings, until one day while walking through an orchard, he is taken away from his home. He later finds himself in an old truck with some unkown strangers. Then the people sent him to a train station, he was put on a train for approximately four days without any form of consumable matter, or in other words-without food! He was mistreated and beat along with a few other dogs. He was begining to feel alone and betrayed by human kind after this experience. Buck was sold to some men who owned sledding dogs. Buck was going to be used as part of the pack. The dogs were to be traveling across the Yukon in Alaska where it was freezing cold. Buck was not used to this type of weather, but he had to cooperate because he didn't have much of a choice. There was a slight problem with getting along with the other members of the pack. Spitz was the top dog for this particular pack, and he disliked Buck and tried to get rid of him every chance he got. Buck thought very carefully about what he was going to do to show Spitz who the real boss was. One day Spitz and buck got into a huge fight, a fight that would leave one of them without life. Luckily the day had come, Buck gained the victory and the respect of both the pack and his human caregivers when he killed Spitz at the end of the terrible fight. Well, I guess you want to know what happened next, but you can only find out the truth when you read this excellent book and find out for yourself! I hope you had fun reading this, I truely recommend this novel to all of you and rate it 4 stars because it is a great adventure to experience!

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read this as a youngster. In fact I read it a couple of times. But I never really got it until I read it again as an adult. Now I see clearly what London set out to do.I have always enjoyed Jack London's look into the savage mindset of animals. His understanding of the line between captivity and freedom is unparalelled.In this classic story we meet Jack, a pampered house pet, who is one day swiftly and savagely swept from his home to the Yukon. Jack is treated brutally and eventually his spirit is broken. He in turn becomes a brute of a work dog, pulling sleds across the frozen arctic.Some of my favorite scenes are those in which Buck learns the law of the club and fang. Buck finds himself plunged into a world of brutality in which the only law is the law of the club and fang. He is taught this law by a man in a red sweater who challenges Buck to a contest of wills. Which is deftly won by the one holding the club. I love the look into Buck's thought process. I also enjy how London nails Buck's slip from strong independence to complete servanthood.Buck settles into a life of hard servitude, until he finds the love of a man once again. It is amazing how London pulls Buck away from man to the brink of being a wild animal, only to bring him back into a loving relationship once again with John Thornton. It is interesting to see Buck's thought process as he learns to trust and love human's again.In the end Buck is swept once again to the wild. London expertly takes Buck from transformation to tranformation... from crossroad to crossroad.By the end of the story we are Buck and know fully what it's like to be Called by the Wild.I highly recommend this classic book!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's The Call of the Wild has staying power in the brutal world of literature. Only the very best books ascend to the top of the heap. Only a select few of those stay there for a hundred years. The Call of the Wild is one of these books.The book is a relatively simple, straight-forward tale about Buck, a large mixed-breed dog stolen from his comfortable existence in California and sold as a sled-dog for the Yukon gold rush. Buck faces the trials and tribulations of the far North's harsh environment and harsher masters. This is a story of transformation. He must forget his trusting, dependent ways and fend for himself, fighting for his very survival. He digs deep, variously finding and losing both hate and true love, and ultimately discovering the elemental animal within.The book's shortcomings are few. London employs a risky anthropomorphic narrative style--though he does it well. We see the action from Buck's perspective. But dogs don't talk, so there is very little dialogue. This results in more &quot;telling&quot; than &quot;showing.&quot; The descriptions are sometimes a bit long, typical of turn-of-the-century writing style. And I was left wishing for more of the wonderful colloquial French-Canadian dialect we saw in the small smattering of dialogue.The book is a fantastic transition choice for kids graduating from fluffy chapter books to more adult-like fare. The stark, life-and-death issues it confronts grab their interest and make life-long readers of them. In poetic irony, London's book is like the character within it: a survivor. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Of all the book I have read in my life, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; takes the number one spot. When I was nine-years-old, 35 years ago, I had a reading dilemma. My father had passed away when I was very young. AS a result of his death, I didn't want to read. I believed that if I allowed my conscious mind to be taken into the world of imagination, I would somehow lose the memory of my father.My parent, and school teacher, were very concerned as my classmates were way ahead of me in their reading skills. One day the teacher came to my house to talk with my mother and particularly to me. Eventually, my teacher got to the base of the problem. She turned to me and asked: &quot;Marv, why is it hard for you to read? I said to her, &quot;I can read, I just don't want to. I don't want to forget my father.&quot; My mother told me that it was okay to enjoy other things in life, and it was okay to dream.The next day, in school, I went to the book cupboard and searched for a book. I knew there was one book, among the hundreds of books, that had my name on it. I found that book when I picked out &quot;The Call of the Wild.&quot; As I read about &quot;Buck&quot; and how he had a good life that was taken from him, and how he had to endure losing that which was dear to him, I knew I had found someone who could identify with my crisis. It didn't matter if it was animal, or human, Fiction or non-fiction. There was someone who understood what I was going through.I've never stopped reading since that day, and more importantly, I have never forgotten my father.

Buck has the emotions and thoughts of a human yet the physical shape of a St. Bernard. Buck began as a domestic pet and became an agressive, life threatening wolf. This story tells the way of a dog life but through a human perspective. Jack London explains the agony of abuse through brutal beatings and shows the pleasure of love through the positive environment created by John Thorton. I believe this book was written in a creative point-of-view and is descriptive to of how life in the horrible Yukon would be. Buck learns &quot;the law of club and fang(p.8)&quot; in chapter two when his friendly companion is viciously murdered. This book is a story about how much an individual can change by being exposed to a negative environment and treated poorly, devolving a friendly pet to a fierce warrior."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild is a book about a dog named Buck who was kidnapped from an easy life of roaming around a country home by some dog smugglers.

London tells about what Buck has to go through everyday in order to survive. Buck has to overcome the problems he runs into every day like finding food and getting along with the other sled dogs. London explains in detail the setting and other characters from Bucks point of view and what he thinks of them. If you have read other books that Jack London wrote like White Fang or Sea Wolf, you will enjoy reading The Call of the Wild.Because London described everything in detail, the book was a bit slow moving and sometimes boring. When I was in eighth grade, our class had to read the book as an assignment. I thought the book was good, but most of my classmates did not agree with me. I Would recommend the book to teenage or older kids that like to read about nature and the outdoors."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is a great book.

Being kidnapped from his leisurely home in California Buck finds himself going through dog traders on his way to Seattle. He is bought by two Canadian mailmen that need a sled dog to pull them north. During his stay with the two mailmen Fracois and Perrault, Buck develops a rivalry with the lead sled dog Spitz. Buck ends up showing that he is a changed dog and has adapted to the life in the north when he kills the lead dog Spitz. Buck becomes a great lead dog. London does a wonderful job of showing how Buck grows to become adapted to his new surroundings and his new way of life tin the north. London also shows how the wilderness can be cruel and an unpredictable place. I recommend this book to anyone who loves animals and the great outdoors.

He is mistreated and abused as he is harnessed to work a sled dog's life. Buck quickly learns the harsh law of club and fang in his gold-hungry Alaskan environment. As the instinct of his ancestors surfaces, he gains wisdom and courage which help him to survive. Through long journeys and different masters, he becomes more wild and begins to forget his mellow past. While north, Buck experiences suffering, triumph, friendship, and love from both men and dogs in Jack London's book. I first chose to read this because I thought that it would be an interesting book of a dog struggling in the Alaskan cold. When I read it, the book turned out to be much more than I had expected. Torn between the worlds of civilization and the wild, Buck fights to live among gold-greedy miners in the northern widerness. He is forced out of comfort and tirelessly pulls sleds in a world where only the strong and fittest survive. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of its detailed and action-filled events. I found it especially addicting during the high-speed dogsled runs or the hide-tearing fights.

The author used a lot of emotional feelings in this story about a dog named Buck. He experiences a lot of feelings from beginning to end.One day Buck gets kidnapped from his owner. He felt very sad and confused. If I was kidnapped I would feel the same way as Buck did. Buck tried to escape from the kidnapers. The kidnapers saw him try to escape. Then they hit Buck with a club to make him obey. This made Buck feel very angry. He learned never to fight someone who has a club.The kidnappers sold Buck because they needed dogs for the gold rush in Canada. When he was sold, he was sold to people that took very good care of him. Buck trusted them. Buck felt more like a dog than a pet because he used his instincts to survive in the wild like digging a hole in the ground so he could sleep with warmth.Buck felt like a dog because he got to pull the sled with the other dogs, he became strong and muscular, braver and he was able to run fast. There was one dog that Buck did not like. His name was Spitz. Spitz had been attacking and biting Buck and the other sled dogs. Buck wanted to become the leader of the pack. One day Buck killed Spitz, in order not to be killed. Buck became the leader and the team worked as a group. Buck felt very confident at this time.The two owners of the dogs had to sell all of the dogs to some people that didn't know how to take care of them. The people that bought the dogs were not nice to Buck. Buck was always upset with them because they worked the dogs too hard and did not let them rest. They had hardly enough food for the dogs. They were very strict. Some of the team starved to death or were close to dying, even Buck. Buck felt he would die and was hopeless.One time the owners forced Buck and the rest of the dogs to pull the sled on thin ice. The sled weighed a lot. Buck refused to cross the ice and was beaten for this. John Thornton was a man that loved dogs and took good care of them. Thornton saved Buck from death. The rest of the team and the owners fell into the ice and died.Buck felt love for the first time in his life and would do anything to help John Thornton. One day Buck went out into the wild away from camp where John Thornton was because he heard a little call from the wild. When he was in the forest he killed a black bear blinded by mosquitoes. He felt very confident.When he went back to camp, he saw Indians. They had killed many of his best friends, including John Thornton. He felt very angry and depressed at the loss of John. I can't imagine how I would feel if that happened to me.When Buck killed the Indians, the wild wolves came to Buck. He remembered one call from the wild, a lone wolf he had become friends with. Buck decided to join the wolf pack. Buck felt peaceful because he had returned to the time of his ancestors.You can see by the range of feelings that happened in this story, that the author used great emotions in the text. If you read this book, I think you will be in Buck's \\"shoes\\" and experience the same emotions."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Buck, a dog, lived in California in the Santa Clara Valley. He was top dog at Judge Miller's place. He weighed one hundred forty pounds.In 1897 the Klondike strike drove all manner of men to the Northland. A gardener sold Buck. He was put in a crate. For two days he did not eat or drink. He was broken brutally with a club.Buck was purchased by Perrault, a French-Canadian. He traveled by ship to Alaska. Mixed breed dogs and huskies, the sled dogs, are described interestingly by London. Buck toiled in the traces for an unending number of days. He found newborn cunning and ceased being a fussy eater.Buck's team encountered a starving group of dogs, (a walking and menacing example of the danger in the North to which animals and men were subject), who attacked the food with manic intensity. Perrault and his partner Francois sought to save their dogs from the famished beasts. The members of the team were wounded grievously. Nothing remotely edible had escaped the famished huskies.It is evident that Jack London loved the play of ideas swirling about a scene containing both the wild ancestors and the domesticated carnivores. Buck may have been a strange Southland dog, but potentially he was a ferocious one. Inevitably his mettle would be tested in a clash for leadership with a dog named Spitz.The party sought to reach Dawson. There were many men and countless dogs in Dawson. Afterwards they, Buck's party of men and dogs, went onto the Yukon Trail. The first day they accomplished a fifty mile run. Buck continued to challenge Spitz. He also gave way to wild delight. He sampled ecstacy, the summit of life in the great chase for prey. Buck bested Spitz. Next Buck prevailed on the men through rebellion to place him at the lead position. Buck became the giver of the law, (this is another theme running through Jack London's works).For fourteen days they averaged forty miles. After Skagway Francois and Perrault left for other pursuits. Buck and the dogs carried the mail. In less than five months they traveled twenty five hundred miles. The team, exhausted, fell into the hands of inexperienced owners. The sled was overloaded. A fourteen dog team meant starvation because it was not possible to carry enough dog food for the journey.The reality of Arctic conditions became too harsh for the people to bear. In their own misery they became callous to the suffering of the animals. At John Thornton's camp Buck refused to get up because he sensed that something was amiss. Thornton undertook to save Buck and the other members of the team and people drowned in the thawed ice. Buck became lavish in his love for Thornton. In the course of time he rubbed noses with a wolf, the call of the wild. Following Thornton's death Buck joined the wolf pack and became a ghost dog. In a London tale Social Darwinism, the struggle for existence, overwhelms everything else. The story is sharp, brutal, compelling."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"\\"There is an ecstacy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise.

But whereas Crusoe's goal was to return to a state of civilization he found familiar and comfortable, Buck, the hero of Jack London's novella, simply drifts further and further into the primitivism that is his natural canine calling.The story takes place during the Alaska-Yukon gold rush of the end of the nineteenth century, where large, strong dogs are in demand to run the sleds between Skagway on the Pacific coast and Dawson inland, a trip hundreds of miles long through bitterly cold weather and treacherous terrain. Buck, the 140-pound offspring of a St. Bernard and a Scotch sheep dog, is living in a nice home in the sunny Santa Clara valley of California when he is kidnapped by a gardener with gambling debts and sold up the Pacific until he is bought by two French Canadian couriers who immediately indoctrinate him into being part of a sled dog team.This is a rude awakening for Buck, who must learn the strenuous routines of hauling the sled and running with the pack, all the while adjusting to the new climate and feeding patterns. Soon a rivalry develops between him and the lead dog, Spitz, but as he gains strength and ferocity, he manages to fight and defeat Spitz and take his position as the lead dog. London keeps Buck and the other dogs \\"in character\\" with this one important exception: he allows them to have human feelings of pride and achievement.Buck passes from master to master as the route is traversed back and forth and different sleds come and go; but finally he finds his best master in a man named John Thornton, who nurses him back to health after a particularly cruel and inept driver nearly kills him with over-exertion. Buck becomes Thornton's most prized possession and accompanies his party to a remote mine to search for gold, where he helps the men with hauling and hunting. This expedition turns out badly for the men, though, when they are attacked by Indians; Buck, hearing the \\"call of the wild,\\" completes his transformation into a wolflike warrior and seeks revenge.The story of Buck's progression from a creature of comfort to a beast of burden to a leader of wolves has the mythic quality of a folk legend, a nocturnal warning of the thin line that separates dog and wolf. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" remains possibly the world's most famous canine yarn because we sense that its message is true to nature -- that all animals, including humans, gravitate toward the savage when removed from civilization and forced to rely on strength, agility, and cunning to survive."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild by Jack London is an excellent book set in 1897 during the gold rush. The book opens with Buck, a St. Bernard and Sheepdog mix, being taken from his comfortable life in California to the rugged country of Canada. In the middle of the night, he is kidnapped by his master's gardener and thrown into the baggage car of a train. It takes some time for Buck to get used to his new surroundings, but he is a fast learner. He quickly realizes what he must do if he wants to survive in the new and difficult situations he is placed in. After witnessing a dog die from a fight, he knows that if he is going to live, he must never be killed by other dogs. As Buck is placed in primitive situations, he begins to feel the call of his ancestors and acts more like a wild dog. He learns to defend himself from the other dogs he is with, and feels his animal instincts returning. While the book takes some time to get into, I recommend it to readers above the age of 13. The entire book is from Buck's perspective, which seems odd in the beginning, but proves to be helpful later in the book. I gave this book four stars because it was very entertaining and had important themes such as friendship, loyalty, and survival. Once I was used to hearing the story through Buck's eyes, I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild, by Jack London is one of the most intriguing and riveting books I have ever read. Jack London's tale of a dog's fight for survival takes place in the frozen Yukon in Alaska. Young Buck, a four-year-old husky, has lived all his life in the luxurious surroundings in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. One day he went on a stroll through the orchard when, all of a sudden, he found himself riding in the back of a baggage car. He was then put on a train for two days and three nights without food or water. When finally he was placed outside of the train and on the ground, he found himself with people all around him. The people beat him and placed with several other dogs. He was put to work immediately and found out soon enough that he had been shipped up north and sold as a sledge dog. Life filled with happiness and joy has faded away and life filled with horror and fear has just emerged. In the beginning, Buck was a small, insignificant, withered dog who kept to himself and didn't want anything to do with anyone. Spitz was the leader of the dogs and was absolutely evil in every way. He hated Buck and wanted to get rid of him. Throughout the entire book, Buck fought to stay alive against the wearying conditions of the trail and the viciousness of the almighty Spitz. It all came down to a final battle with all of the dogs looking on at both of them. In the end, Buck succeeded in killing Spitz and overcoming the trail. Buck was admired by all the dogs and all of his human friends for this great victory. After reading this book and seeing what Buck went through I am now more appreciative of my dog and pay more attention to him. I give this book five stars and would recommend this book to everyone who knows how read. This book sends a very strong message and I think that it is important that people read and understand this message."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild focuses on a house pet named Buck who is stolen from his comfortable life and inserted into a harsh life working as a husky dog in Alaska. Buck becomes acquainted with some vicious animals and begins slowly to de-evolve. He reverts back to a wolf like his ancestors were before him. The Call of the Wild is useful as an historic tribute to the Alaskan Gold Rush. It tells of the hardship up in Alaska through the eyes of a dog but it's about more than a search for a metal. It's about an animal de-evolving. He is removed from domesticated life and finds the life of a working dog difficult at first but he eventually grows to love it. A man saves him from his turmoil and he becomes domesticated again but he can't silence the wolf inside him. On the death of his new master he reverts to the wild where he stays forever. How can this be classified as a children's book? This is one of the most adult stories I have ever read and I don't think any child will get the books qualities. This can only be appreciated by very mature adults but if you can appreciate you're life will be better for it.

Maybe it was the concept -- a dog that is kidnapped and goes on adventures in the Klondike gold rush. I mean, what's to say, right? A story for 12-year-old boys maybe, and even then, probably something I'd fidget through once I was past 12.My mistake.On a recent Saturday afternoon, I picked this one up off the shelf, where it had been gathering dust for years. It took me a second to figure out that Buck, the protagonist, was a dog, but once oriented, I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I was finished.At one level, it's a dog story, reminiscent in its own way of \\"Black Beauty,\\" who also goes through a range of owners, good and bad, and experiences the vicissitudes of an animal's life.At another level, it's an adventure story -- and there are some adventures, cliff-hangers, elements of suspense and even a little humor packed into a relatively small number of pages.It's also remarkable story-telling and a very lean prose style that, like Hemingway, carries you along. It's a story about a dog, for crying out loud, yet you care about what happens to Buck throughout.In some respects, though, I can see why kids might not like the book. The concept (\\"It's a dog story.\\") may be off-putting, the story can be violent in places, and some might ask: \\"What's the point?\\" (My 14-year-old declined my recommendation to read it, probably the same way I did many years ago.)All told though, I'm glad I came to this one later rather than sooner. I'm even intrigued enough to consider some other Jack London."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Is it possible to dramatically change your character, who you are fundamentally, in order to adapt to your environment? This is the profound question that Jack London explores in this timeless classic. Buck, a dog accustomed to an easy life as the pet of a well-to-do family, is kidnapped and forced to work as a sled dog during the Klondike gold rush of 1897. Facing brutal weather, harsh treatment from his masters, and fierce rivalry from the other dogs, Buck is forced to call upon the instincts of his ancestor, the wild wolf, in order to survive in these hostile conditions.Filled with raw, powerful prose , intense action, and beautifully drawn protagonists, this novel is as much a profound statement about character as it is an edge-of-your-seat adventure. London unflinchingly traces Buck's transformation from loveable pet to fierce, rugged animal, but never let's the reader forget the tenderness and compassion that will always be at the core of this character. And in the end, Buck struggles with the most fundamental of dilemmas - mustering the courage to accept his true nature and to acknowledge who he has become. This is a book about life's journey, about living bravely, about playing the cards you are dealt and finding your true calling. It is a classic to be treasured."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Just Voice(Mimic one of the characters voices and have him explain what he thinks about the word choice and sentence structure as well as the character traits)Hi, I'm John Thornton, I sure hope you \`member me from the book. I'm here to tell you what I think about the book The Call of The Wild. The author, Jack London, probably chose each and every word from his heart, exactly where I keep my memories of Buck. Believe me, this book has word choice different than any other novel. In cases where he could've used words like dog over and over, he switches off between words like canine or hound.Also, that creative author, Jack, has the best sentence structure that I have seen ever since I have lived in the Dakota's. In places where no man I know can add anymore detail, that amazing man can squeeze in a couple more details. Even the best author in Oregon, Billy Bob Hilton, can't do that. He can change any ol' boring story into an action packed novel. I sure hope that Jack can make another sequel to this magnificent classic.He really made each and every one of those hounds into a strong unique canine with its own personality. He made Buck the meanest, strongest, most determined mutt in the Yukon Territory. And as for Hal and his companions, well I've seen fools just like them. Yep, if anyone asked me which story had the coolest character personalities, I'd have to say The Call of the Wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"(This review is in response to the following quote: \\"Dynamic character description delivers an emotional message.\\")In the novel The Call of the Wild, Jack London exquisitely describes Buck. He endured many struggle-some situations, and through it all, we felt like we were Buck. We felt his sorrow and his pain as well as his joy and abundance of love. When he was happily following the call of the wild, we felt his happiness. When he was in pain, we felt the heavy whip blows upon our backs and the struggle to pull the loaded sled. We felt his anger, a deep, pure, hateful anger wriggling inside of him and us. We were as one, making our way through the obstacles life threw at us. We were thrown inside his brain, his heart, his body. We were transported to the wilderness, swept up in the struggle to survive, and our surroundings seemed to change. We were no longer slumped in our uncomfortable chair in our classroom. We were shivering in the icy arctic terrain, following Buck, like an undercover reporter. Buck's feelings were so immensely well described. At every moment we knew exactly what was going on. Not only around him, but on his insides too. Which is certainly difficult to do, to describe a dog's point of view when you are a human. Even though the book had no dialogue between dogs, it was made up for with the emotions and feelings of the sled dogs. (And it made it more realistic.) We have never read a book about dogs that is as wonderful, as descriptive, and as realistic as Jack London's The Call of the Wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The start of this book The Call of the Wild was slow and did not coptivate me. But, like most great books this one got much better as the story went on! Buck a huge house dog belonging to a rich man (naned Judge Miller), is sold secretly by his gardeners assistant. Buck is then transported to northern California. The dog finally gets baught from the saloon by Perrault and Francois. Perrault and Francois are gold crazed men and whose goal is to get to Skagway. The two arrive at Skagway and sell their dog team to the mail service with wich they travel south to Dawson. Buck and his sled mates are sold again to a groug of novice sled drivers. This part of the story takes place during the summer months. The novices meet John Thorton (a more experienced sleadsman) at the bank of a wide river. John suggested not to cross but they did not listen to his advice. Bucks fellow dogs and his former sledsmen all drown. Buck was saved by Thorton because he cut him from his traces (harnesses that hold the dog teams together and allow them to pull the sled), becaues he would not get up and was getting beaten. Two years later John Thorton bucks belovid and favorite master was killer by the northern indians the Yeehats. Buck moarned over the loss of John but he moved on after a full week of waiting for no one amd morning of Thorton. Two weeksafter John Thiorton's death a gargantuan pack of wolves come upon Buck. Buck quareled witha few of them and eather killed,paralised,or disabled every attacker, but Buck finaly saw his wild brother and stoped hurting members of the pack. He was able to join the wolf pack and he did. Yeehat lagends say that thay ance saw a huge dog different from all the other dogs running at the head of the pack. I wonder who that is? Like I said before i think this was a good book to read and it gets better and better as the story goes on.

One kid made a diarama of Call of the Wild that was amazing. You looked through an aperture at the end of the shoebox and there were trees &amp; the dog &amp; snow drifts, the whole nine yards. Meanwhile, for my book, Jonathon Livingston Seagull, I pasted blue paper in the bottom of a box &amp; glued in a seagull. I believe our grades reflected our respective efforts.Reading Call of the Wild as an adult, one realizes that it's not actually written for kids. Seemingly the tale of a dog in Alaska, it is actually an argument that our primitive natures lurk just beneath a thin veneer of civilization.The fact that it can be read &amp; enjoyed by youngsters is just a bonus.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I don't know why, but I was never required to read this book as a youngster. At 42 I read it for the first time along with my daughter. I agree with another reviewer, as an adult I have a great admiration for this work (much more than I would have had as a young person). The written story is a great one of adventure, the underlying message is a tremendous exploration of survival and spirit. If you are buying this book for your child as required reading, take the time to read or re-read it yourself. It is amazing how Jack London survives the passage of time.As a side note - the afterword by Dwight Swain is a great help to young people to try to understand the underlying concepts, as are his comments on the life of Jack London."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This novelette is a chiling, gripping masterpiece of Survival lore, set in the brutal harshness of the Yukon during the Alaskan gold rush of 1897. The plot is the gradual metamorphosis of Buck--a splendid rancho dog of the warm, soft Southlands (part St.Bernanrd/part German Shepherd). From pampered pet on his master's country estate, he is kidnpaped and sold into the bondage of dogteam slavery for sheer Greed, where he endures the horrors of weather plus those of cruel and stupid men. Yet Buck ultimately carves out his own domain in the bitter wilderness, leaving a legacy of prodigious strength, cunning and ferocity. When his last master dies, he answers the growing Call to revert to his ancestors' wild state, as the alpha male of a wolf pack.

It may be a little sensetive to the dog lover, but isn't too bad. I would definitely recommend this book for someone to read. &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; is very descriptive. It describes the Terrain of the northern goldrush. A great part about this book is the length. It isn't a long book to read and keeps you reading once you've started. I like how Jack London tells how and what the dogs are feeling throughout the book. He gives the dogs great human characteristics. Even though the book is short some of the reading may seem a little irrelevent. This is an overall great book. I give it two thumbs up! Here is a great quote from the book. &quot;Death, as a cessation of movement, as a passing out and away from the lives of living, he knew, and he knew John Thornton was dead.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I would not recommend reading The Call of the Wild by Jack London because although it has its high points the lower parts are indeed low. While the brutal fight scenes keep you entertained for a brief period of time,the ending is slow and some of the reading seems irrelevant. There is a sense of bondage between dog and man in this novel but in some instances the events seem far fetched with Buck,the protagonist,always seeming to come out on top. A quote to support this is in chapter five on page fourty when John Thorton comes to Buck's rescue. He says &quot;If you strike that dog again, I'll kill you.&quot; This is an example where any other dog would have been beaten to death while Buck gets out alive. This is a detailed novel with a good description of Buck's life but at the same time the reader,most likely,cannot relate to the story. The lower points of this story drive me to not recommend the reading of this novel."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I think Call of the Wild by Jack London was an alright book. About a trip through the Yukon with a bunch of sled dogs including Buck. &quot;Naivre such a dog as dat Buck&quot;(pg 27) was said by Francois, which is quite true. Buck was a great dog very strong and he worked hard if you treated him right. He was especially loyal to John Thorton, whom of which he cared very much for. When John Thornton was murdered Buck became free and loved it. John Thorton was Bucks last tie to mankind, when he died he had nothing left but the wild.I thind this book had a good plot and some great points, but all in all I didn't like it. It just wasn't an appealing subject to me."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion, The Call of the Wild by Jack London, is a very descriptive book. The novel shows how the dogs feel as if they are human. The setting of the book is not great because it jumps back and forth from one place to another. Another bad thing about the novel is Jack London makes man look like animal killers when they beat the dogs. London did keep me reading because I wanted to know what was going to happen with Buck and if they would make it to there destination. My favorite part of the book is in the beginning London describes the seeting of the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley where Judge Miller lives. A quote I will always remember is &quot;Well, Bck, my boy, we've had our little runction, and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that. You've learned your place, and I know mine. Be a good dog and all'll go well and the goose hang high.

It made you sit on the edge of your seat, and made you feel like you were really there. However, some of the events are unclear, and the beginning and ending were unclear. The fact that the dogs had human characteristics was creative and unusual. My favorite scene was when Buck approached Sol-lecks on his blind side. Jack London really captured the essence of savage behavior, but he ran low on the details of the gold rush. Overall the book was good and worth reading. My favorite quote was, &quot;When he was made, the mould was broke.&quot; Refering to Buck by Pete on page 57. The Call of the Wild was one of those books that you can read over and over."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the wILD BY jACK lONDON IS ONE OF THE MOST INTRIGUING BOOKS i'VE READ TO DATE.

I like the personification of the dog, but when Buck calls people and dogs half breeds, full breeds, etc, it takes a while to figure out what they are. Between the exciting scenes are long, drawn out worthless bits of drama, but when its good, its pretty good. I do like the richness and abundance of the descriptive details, though."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The reviews that give out only one star are valid if you are not willing to let London guide you. In this day and age it is tough to imagine just how rough Alaska was 100 years ago. When reading this book just relax and listen to the images that London creates. Try to see the characters. Most of all enjoy this classic. This is the kind of book that one should enjoy several times to really begin to reap the benefits."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I have recently read THe Call of the Wild as a school assignment. It is probably one of the most meaningful books that I have ever read.

He had to fight his way to the top and was constantly adapting to new circumstances of a new musher, difficult dogs, and the cold climate. This book was more exciting then I ever could have imagined.

At his Californian home, Buck sees himself as the King. He could do whatever he wants. The Klondike is a whole new world for him. He has to get accustomed to the harsh weather, the other dogs, and the rules. Buck learns it all very fast.Before taken to his new owners he had to be 'broken in'. He was put in a cage with a man in a red sweater, that is holding a club. When Buck sees this man, he immediately trys to attack him. Every jump that Buck takes at the man, he is knocked back by the club. Later, when he is just put with his new owners, a friendly dog named Curly walks up to one of the owners' Huskies, and the Husky attacks her right away. All the other dogs seem to circle the fight. When Curly is knocked to the ground, all of the Huskies attack her. When the dog owners clear the mess, all that is left of Curly is pieces in the snow. Jack London calls these the Laws of Club and Fang.The Call of the Wild is a very good book. The first chapter hooks you to the story right away. With lots of action and adventure, this is a good book for anyone who can read it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I really enjoyed The Call of the Wild because although it was not a book I could relate to, London kept the plot running smoothly and lively. The book rarely became boring. London used so many metaphors in his writing I got a real feel for the scene. He made it very possible to see the characters almost beyond the third point of view. London's use of detail helped the scene come to life. He used such descriptive words that I could almost get into the scene alongside Buck. London seemed to be showing the different levels of loyalty of both men and dogs through his book. He showed the absolute extreme circumstances loyalty goes. I really enjoyed learning about the Alaskan culture. This book depicted a perfect image of what it would be like to be out on a trail on a sled with a team of dogs leading the way. It was very enriching and enlightening."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I have read this book so many years ago in Russian translation. Recently, I read it in original language.

Read it Americans, read it immigrants."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion, The Call of the Wild is a good book to read if you are wanting something quick to read. If you are interested in dogs than this is the book for you. It is loaded with lots of detail, but within the course of the book not a whole lot is covered. At the begginng of the book it is very slow, but near the end it starts getting good. It is definitely not hard reading. Anywhere from a fifth to sixth grader would be able to read this book. I probably wouldn't suggest it, but after reading I can say that it is a decent book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London was a wonderful sort of writer. He was master of nothing, not of tone, nor of language, pacing, character or plot. But he was honest, he was familiar with the world surrounding the actions of his cartoonish creations and he knew enough tricks to paste them into some genuinely exciting and vivid experiences.The character of Buck is actually quite strong. Who cares that its a dog--all criticism of the personification are pointless and all assumption of a dog's inability to function as such are superfluous in the telling of the story. Too much has also been made of perceived philosophies, from Darwin and Nietzsche through the Communist doctrine of some and the fascistic impulses of others. Sure, perhaps if one were to try hard enough to justify some linked meaning it could surely be derived, but the actions are in the moment and the ideas deal more with survival than with any encrypted motive for desiring to do so. The story is what it is, harsh and frequently silly, enhanced by an enthusiasm of description and a consistant interest in the telling.A pleasent book to read before bed when feeling bored and perhaps sullenly apathetic. Three and a half stars rounded up because its violence is not tamed by the passing of a century since publication."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I've always wanted to read the classics, but up until I picked this book up I'd been reading illustrated editions adapted for young readers, none of which had much effect on me. Then I picked up the real thing -- and what a thing it is. In \\"The Call of the Wild,\\" Jack London pulls the reader in from page one and never lets go. The only words for it are Amazing, Powerful, Compelling and Wow.This immersive and compelling story of Buck, a high-socioty dog who is kidnapped during the Gold Rush, beginning a journey to the frozen North and to his wild wolf roots, is action-packed and ever fast-paced, and yet told with incridible care paid to description. London draws the reader's attention to even the smallest details and yet never bores; any writer who can do this successfully has my upmost respect.This novella is nothing less then perfect. no literate dog lover should miss it. It will deepen your love and respect for the canine species. Essensial reading! ***** (5/5)"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Have you ever witnessed change? Some of you have, some of you haven't. But the main character, Buck, witnessed change to the extremes from being a housedog to becoming a strong and powerful sled dog. In \\"Call of the Wild\\", Jack London actually makes this dog human by giving him feelings, thoughts and mostly knowledge that only we can express or obtain. Buck's journey is long and hard but as time passed by, he learned to live and behave like a real sled dog.This breathtaking story starts when man's best friend lived in a house in which dogs were treated almost as equal as humans and in that house lived children and a judge, who buck knew as his master. The judge treated him very kindly and always gave him attention. But there was a traitor in the house who was Manuel, the gardener. He sold Buck to a stranger for some money and took him to a training camp where he was taught to attack and fear his masters. In that camp he was taught a lesson by a wooden club that whacked his whole body dozens of times. After, he knew he could never defeat the man with the club so he stood there lying down. Then the man became nice to Buck and gave him food and water and also they became friends, but not for long, two French- Canadians bought him and their names were Perrault and Francois. They had other dogs too, but Spitz was the meanest of all. Buck learned a lot from him even though he hated him and killed him for being a thief. After, Buck became the leader and got better and better with each trip in the arctic. The sad thing was that every time he became fond of his masters, it was time to part. He liked all his masters but when he got to Thornton they shared great and lovely times as the best of friends.This five star novel catches your attention and expresses love, courage, confusion, and understanding.

Some have treated him with love and some have treated him with hate. The people who hated him just wanted to get where they were going. They were just going to sell him to someone when they're done with him.Buck is an ordinary dog who lives in a wealthy family. One day that is all turned around. Buck was sold to a man and Buck was taught a lesson with a bat to his head. Buck saw many dogs he knew that had been sold to people who needed sleigh dogs. Finally Buck was sold as a sleigh dog. He fit in with all the others. Buck could not be lead dog. He wanted to, but there was another dog to take that position.This is a very slow paced book, yet it held my interest. I like how the book put Buck in a bunch of different settings. I like how the author changed Buck from tame to wild to wilder.If you like to read comedy and romance, I would definitely not recommend this book for you. If you would like a nice wilderness adventure this is definitely the book you're looking for. If you like dogs you would like this book. Even if you just hate those beasts you would like seeing them getting beat up.Buck started out and grew up in a rich family were he was loved and had to do absolutely nothing he didn't want to.

Now if I would stop there I would have gave it a 5 star rating but reading a book in the perspective of a dog gets kind off track and a little boring, but since there was some exciting parts in it I gave it a 3 star rating out of 5 stars.This book is about a dog named Buck who lives in the Santa Clara Valley in the beautiful state of California during a gold rush in 1897. He moves to Canada were he is kidnapped by his master's gardener and put on a train car. He then becomes a sled dog used during the gold rush. He is then treated harshly by his master and is beaten up many times and also beaten up by the other sled dogs he stays with. He struggles at first, but after he sees his good friend killed by the other dogs in the wild he realizes he must be able to fight back to survive.

If you enjoy animal adventure books, Call of the Wild is a good book to read. This book is written from the main character?s point of view, but the main character happens to be a dog. Buck is a St Bernard and Sheepdog mix, who was born and lived in California for the early parts of his life. Judge Miller owned him while in California. One day Buck gets kidnapped and sold to dog trainers. He was beaten and starved while being shipped to the Klondike. After arriving in the north, Buck has to adjust to the cold and to becoming a sled dog. His first owners in the north were Francois and Perrault, Canadian nail carriers. Then Buck gets sold to three American gold hunters, who starve and beat him. After going through this terror again, he comes across a very kind, caring man. This man was John Thornton. He becomes Buck?s owner and Buck shows total devotion to him. John and Buck continue their northern adventures together, where Buck figures out where his true home is. I recommend this book to people who like adventure and have a kind heart for animals. The part of the book that I couldn?t stand was the narration. I feel that having the book written from the dog?s point of view made the book more confusing and harder to understand. I also felt the book got repetitive in the middle, making it very boring. The only good part of the book was the ending, and then it still wasn?t worth all the time I spent getting to it.

London omnisciently narrates the difficult life of a dog named Buck in 217 pages. While the book was with out a doubt interesting, I fear it lacked substance. Its simple nature resembles a children's book but at times the vernacular would be difficult for a child to comprehend. At the same time, the introduction of characters is another confusing aspect as I found myself unable to conclude whether the new character was a dog or a person until five pages after their introduction. This leaves me wondering who his target audience was. It is with out a doubt too simple for an adult, yet too confusing for a child. The book definitely kept my attention, though, for I read it cover to cover in two hours. I suppose I would recommend Call of the Wild to middle-schoolers.

Buck was born to luxury, but when gold was found in Alaska, he was kidnapped to be used as a sledge dog. He traveled thousands of miles, and since he was with an owner that didn't know how to take care of him, he nearly died.In this extraordinary novel, Jack London shows how an ordinary dog adapts to a tough and dangerous life. London's characters show how some people were very brutal and had no love for the dogs, but that there were some people that saw the dogs as beings instead of slaves. He sets a mood that keeps the readers interested and makes them want to read more. In this way, he makes them feel that Buck is not just an ordinary dog, but a smart, loving and heroic one.In my opinion, this book is very moving overall and well written. It starts out a little slowly so not many surprises pop up until the middle when buck gets into a fight.I would highly recommend reading this book. It left a great impression on me, as I hope it does for all other readers."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is a book of adventure.

I don't rememeber seeing anywhere that this was an abridged version of the book. I have no intention of reading the chidlren's version and now I will have to buy the unabridged version."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I had read this book in my early childhood, as most normal people do, but for some nostalgic reason I decided to revisit it. It's always funny to see fellow subway commuters' faces when they realize an adult is reading high-school freshman material. Nevertheless, I went through with it, and this time didn't nearly experience the excitement I felt the first time around.Don't get me wrong, the story of Buck, the half St. Bernard half Scotch Shepherd dog, turned sleigh dog, turned wolf leader, is a good story. It is the ultimate animal lover romantic story. However, as an adult who has lost a lot of romanticism, due to the hard ways of realism, the story didn't really work.There is a lot of doggie character development. Buck goes from a lazy, cozy, happy-go-lucky life, to a vicious native-American killer. Jack London, the ultimate romantic, takes it upon himself to describe how the dog felt through the entire stages of his turbulent life. And what a development that is. Buck, truly is a champ, that can start a half-ton sleigh stuck frozen to the ground, and pull it for a hundred yards. As Buck learns from the rough laws of \\"the club and the fang\\", we learn from Buck that sometimes we have to bow down to superior weaponry in life, be it literally or metaphorically.I have to acknowledge the warm fuzzy feeling transplanted from Jack London's choice of language. He does really well with the descriptions of the wild world deep in the arctic winters, and frozen prairies. The vivid language brings those improbable surroundings dancing through my mind. I can see myself running with Buck through thousands of miles of snow-covered trail, chasing down deer, camping on frozen lakes, or hunting for salmon in the brisk water of Canadian Rivers.The part that I had a hard time buying was the whole Buck reintegration with his wolfish origins story (which happened to be the main story). Not only did he integrate with a pack of vicious wolves but also he became the alpha male that lead the pack of wolves into legendary heights. It's just my skepticism that gives me a hard time accepting how a domestic animal can roll with one of the most dangerous kind of animals in our continent. It is possible to happen, as anything can happen. There is just not enough reinforcing background material on the matter.The other huge issue that I have is with the certain hostility directed towards the Yehaat native people. Of course, in the nineteenth century political sensitivity was not important. However, we are in the twenty first century now, and very much aware of the wanton crimes performed by the white man on any native tribes in America. Haven't we done enough to these people, but we should continue looking at them as villains for trying to protect their land. That whole issue makes me sick.Therefore, I conclude by settling the score once and for all; this book is way past its prime and not worth very much in present day literature."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

As the traditional American frontier has basically ended, these symbolic stories of adventure and hardship do help to serve as a representation of challenges, but there are such better works that achieve these goals. Even a novel like The Catcher in the Rye uses savvy to explain the ironies and false pretenses that life offers. Holden, like Buck, is faced with the choice of how to adapt in a losing situation. While you may now be wondering how The Call of the Wild and this Salinger novel can be paralleled, the point is that the theme is so universal and not restricted by the plot, that there are many other works that accomplish similar goals."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I hated this book!

It was painful to read and I don't think that anyone could torture me into reading it again. I would give this book half of a star if I could.

Which, the author didn't really explain well. The author put in all of these characters that don't really need to be put into the story at all. The author didn't really make the story interesting.

It drags on and on even though it is only about a hundred pages long.

This book takes place in Alaska around the time of the Alaskan Gold Rush. The main character in the story is a German Shepherd named Buck. The entire story is told from the dogs perspective, meaning it is more concrete getting information and it shows the surface of an experience. This lets you draw your own conclusions, Rather than being swayed by the characters view. This book is also historically accurate because it shows that the Alaskan wilderness was a dark, dangerous tundra. If I where to rate this book, I would give it **** (four stars) out of 5, because the book is intelligently written trough the eyes and mind of an unintelligent creature."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"If you like dogs and bad guys getting what they deserve then you will like this book.

The reader goes along on the journey through Alaska during the gold rush of the 1890s. Buck is used to a pampered, domestic life until he is kidnapped. He must learn to become a sled dog and find in himself those traits possessed by his ancestors. He must learn to fight, sleep outside, salvage for food, and undergo abuse. Through his journey, he gains independance and leadership. London's superb storytelling techniques are bound to capture the reader. His detail and description keep the reader's attention throughout the entire novel. This classic tale portrays the thin line between wild and tame. London uses imagery in his many descriptions of the Alaskan frontier. He cleverly intertwines symbols of civilized and uncivilized law into the story for a unique comparison. Foreshadowing is also present to add to the ending effect of the novel. The overall theme of the story is the adaptation to new environments and lifestyles and the ability to differentiate wild from tame."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"It's very, very rare that I ever read something twice--I'm not the most avid reader, and I don't have time for that anyway--but I loved this story so much that I just had to read it a second time. The story of Buck's life is unique in the sense that the narrator tells the story from the dog's point of view. Jack London brings Buck to life and gives him emotions I never thought a dog could have. He thinks and feels things just like a human, and it makes the story more personal. I got so attached that I even cried at the end, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it. It's a beautiful story, one I'll never forget."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's novel takes the reader on a journey through the escapades and travails of 'Buck' the husky/shepherd mixed sled dog in the novel. Buck travels from a state of wealth and luxury to one of misfortune and brutality as a sled dog. In this story we learn the potential evil in nature and in man. London shows us what it might be like to be a slave, an oppressed member of society, or even . . . a dog. This story is crucial to any 5th grade and higher teacher seeking to impute humanitarian feeling in her/his learners. At the same time, this book calls to those readers who would become more humane in their dealings with others. It is a conversation starter for finiding the difference between cruelty and punishment. Because the protagonist isn't human, it allows us to vicariously examine ourselves, without defensiveness. A classic tale to be read by all lovers of rich, luxuriant writing about the human condition."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Spitz, king of the Yukon Wilderness, verses Buck from the sun-kissed Southland, in extreme combat. The two of them bite and growl at each other with kindling eyes of fire.

At that very moment, Buck has only begun his journey in learning the one definite law of the North, the Law of Club and Fang. The one that says kill or be killed, every dog for himself and survival is above all.From then on, Buck is adjusting his ways to the snowy plains of the Yukon. He learns important rules of survival like to eat your food before other dogs scarf it down behind your back and to dig a hole and sleep in there until the harsh, hurtling, wind finally comes to a halt.But the owners of the sled team changed over and over until Buck finally met John Thornton. Until then, Buck never had truly loved any of his other sled team owners. Buck shared a deep, compassionate, unconditional, relationship with John Thornton and saved his life many times.But when angry Native Americans, ---- the Yeehats, come steal all of John Thornton's gold, ruin the entire camp, and mercilessly murder everyone, Buck comes to the rescue. He viciously tears and kills every single one of the Yeehats that comes in his path.

Now, he does have one weakness, his love for his owner. When the owner dies, Buck goes off to become a leader of a wolf pack. He then changes the breed of wolves forever. Over all I liked the book. It is told in a fun and interesting way. You learn what the dogs are thinking and how they feel about the peole they interact with.

Some have treated him with love and some have treated him with hate. The people who hated him just wanted to get where they were going. They were just going to sell him to someone when they're done with him.Buck is an ordinary dog who lives in a wealthy family. One day that is all turned around. Buck was sold to a man and Buck was taught a lesson with a bat to his head. Buck saw many dogs he knew that had been sold to people who needed sleigh dogs. Finally Buck was sold as a sleigh dog. He fit in with all the others. Buck could not be lead dog. He wanted to, but there was another dog to take that position.This is a very slow paced book, yet it held my interest. I like how the book put Buck in a bunch of different settings. I like how the author changed Buck from tame to wild to wilder.If you like to read comedy and romance, I would definitely not recommend this book for you. If you would like a nice wilderness adventure this is definitely the book you're looking for. If you like dogs you would like this book. Even if you just hate those beasts you would like seeing them getting beat up.Buck started out and grew up in a rich family were he was loved and had to do absolutely nothing he didn't want to.

Buck lived in sunny Santa Clara when he was stolen and sold to a dealer for transport to cold, snowy Alaska as a working sled dog. You can imagine this as a symbol for an ordinary man who is forced into a life of hard work, poor pay, and perilous working conditions. There is no retirement plan for a dog like Dave. It is informed by the social Darwinism that was in vogue among capitalists and socialists, but with different interpretations. Like many other novels for adults it evolved into a story for children! [Those who study the life of wolves can comment on the fantasy of a dog leading a wolf pack.]Buck and the other tired dogs are sold to new owners. These owners do not have the experience of judgment to travel (Chapter V). Buck is rescued by a new owner. London created an idealized picture of Buck (Chapter VIII). But John Thornton and his gold-seeking partners find their good luck has turned terribly bad. Buck survives as the fittest of the pack. The story doesn't tell what happened to Buck in the near future.

I believe that Jack London was an alright author.Some of this book seems as if it was written by a seven year old or a small child who is obseesed with gore and nothing else.All these parts of the story in which dogs die are not pertinent at all.So basically this book is about the murder and abuse of Dogs.If you like this you should DEFINATELY read this book.If not my advice to you is to STAY AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AS POSSIBLE!!!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"i had more fun watching my dog pull this book apart than reading it.

The Call of the Wild is a boring book to read. Because of the tedious actions done by the characters, you really would not get a feel of the story. The story did not keep me interested. This book did not leave an indelible mark on me whatsoever. When the protagonist is walking through the mounds of snow, the author could have described the scene more so the reader could almost feel the same way as the characters were. Although I did not like this story I would recommend this book to kids between 7-11 years of age to let them know how other sorts of books are."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought Call of the Wild, by Jack London had too much detail. In some places, the detail was needed, but sometimes it was just too much. The begining and end of the book was interesting, but the middle part was just stupid.It was like,&quot; Oh my gosh Buck! We have to deliever the mail!&quot; This wasn't my favorite book, and if reading Call of the Wild wasn't school required , I would have chose another book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read this book in my grade 8 english class. It was a pretty good book. I must admit, I had dooubts about it at first. The whole wildneress thing isn't usually 4 me.

It's good!!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; in my reading class in 8th grade. I really enjoyed it. At times the book was hard to read or understand and sometimes London's vocabulary escaped me. On whole, however, this is a great book that anyone who likes adventure stories should read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild would stand up to about anybody's benchmark for literature when &quot;literature&quot; meant something. This book is too good to be crammed down the throats of today's English classes. Give 'em Judy Blume. The tiny fraction of good readers will discover authors like London on their own."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read Call of the Wild by Jack London. It was about a domesticated dog named Buck. He was brought into the wild to learn to survive on his own. He meets many good and bad people like the three disorganized people. He also meets many other dogs. Buck fights several and is punished for disobedience. Call of the Wild is an historical fiction book. It has adventure and animals, but it is sometimes sad and can be a bit boring. I would rate it four stars. I really liked the ending. I liked the beginning before Buck gets taken away. The book takes place in Alaska, and in San Francisco, California. Call of the Wild takes place during the Alaskan Gold Rush. The part I thought was the most interesting was when the pack of wild, hungry wolves came to his camp. They injured all the dogs, and killed some that were in the camp. The wolves ate anything they could get that was edible in Buck's camp. When all the survivors were back at camp some of the dogs went crazy and chased other dogs. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I thought the book was interesting yet boring in a way. I liked the part when John Thornton whispered in Bucks ear and said &quot;Do it as if you love me&quot;. There was also alot of cheasy parts in the book. I also thought the book went too into detail in spots it didn't need it. It really didn't get my attention enough. In some parts it made me want to keep reading, but it didn;t enough."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my mind, Jack London's The Call of the Wild is not a very good book. First of all, I would only recommend this story to older or mature readers due to its extensive vocabulary and brutal description of the Yukon life in the late 1890's. One of the most spectacular attributes to the novel is the detail London uses to describe the characters in the story, the environments, and the atrocities of man and dog. An example of his extraordinary detail is in this quote: &quot;Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan.&quot; (London pg.52). Unlike most of the stories that I have read, The Call has every part or major event in the novel somehow fitting in a sequential order, how Buck starts life easy at home in CA, leaves home, then learns his ancestry, and grows to answer the call of the wild, all while acquiring the skills and know-how of the trace and trail. One detrimental effect in the depiction is how London keeps the reader interested when something vital to the plot is happening, such as when Buck fell in love with John Thorton or when Buck was fighting Spitz. All in all, if you are bored, love the wilderness, or enjoy a good dosage of vocabulary, then I suggest that you should have this book in your hands right now because this novel is right up your ally. My suggestion; however, is to not bother reading this story. Sure it is good reading, but the time span of the 1890's I cannot realate with, due to technological advances in history. The story The Call of the Wild did not do a very well job of capturing my interest at all."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The call of the Wild by Jack London is doltish and aimless. Although it was vert desriptive and symbolic, I felt every chapter duplicated the next. Therfore you were left uninterested and tiresome. This book did have great characterizum dealing with the realization of the dogs, &quot;as they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to buck with a sense of familiarity. He seemed to remember it all,-- the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the trill of battle.&quot; (pg. 23) Remember this is my interpretation of this book and only you as the reader can determine how you view this book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"These past eight to ten weeks in eighth and ninth period english class, we have been reading the Jack London novel The Call of the Wild. This book was easier to read because I don't understand a lot of what I read therefore, I don't like reading longer books. So it made it convenient to read this story because of its short length. He also used great vocabulary to keep me thinking and appreciate his knowledge of writing. On the other hand, he didn't really catch my attention because I thought there would be more action and suspense. On the same token, Mr. London made it hard for me to distinguish between the characters, except for Buck. This depiction didn't have any pictures so furthermore it was hard to see his description of the characters. Another thing that caught my eye that isn't good or bad, is the short poem at the beginning of The Call: &quot;Old longings nomadic leap, Chafing at customs chain; Again from its brumal sleep wakes the ferine strain.&quot;(page 1) This caught my attention beacause it was an unusual way to start a novel. All in all I thought The Call of the Wild was a decent book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Has 'man's best friend', his dog, been neutered to obedience?

Even the introduction can be fascinating- I have a collection of the best of Jack London with an intro written by Eugene Burdick. Given all this, can you imagine having a copy of The Call of the Wild and on the cover is a picture of a German Shephard? The dog in this story is a St. Bernard and that is pivotal to the story- long hair dogs in california were being kidnapped for work in the frozen North.

A younger crowd may find it boring, but with enough action to keep them entertained. Also, the book only had 7 chapters, but with enough detail to keep you informed. (Perhaps too much.) Despite the good, at a few parts you may find yourself happy about things that you wouldn't normally be glad about. (Like death.) All in all, this book was good, but I wouldn't probably read it again under my own free will."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London out does himself in an amazing story about a Californian dog that learned to be an Alaskan sled dog. A pair of thieves stole a large dog (Buck) from his California home. The Alaskan gold rush of 1898 has started and there was a huge demand for strong sled dogs. His newly acquainted owners treated him poorly. The thieves ran the dogs and sled at least thirty miles a day. The sled drivers did not tolerate mistakes. They would whip the dogs for the mistakes. Since Buck is new at, this he recieved many bruises but learned quickly. Buck, soon enough, had an enemy. He learns by a previous fight that during a fight if a dog falls all the other dogs consume and attack them to the death. Buck had to be smart to survive. After hard work and triumph they made Buck lead dog. Even then they sold him again to even harsher owners, which he did not stay with for long. A man saved him and taught him to love again. After he found his new and loving owner they both saved each others lives at different parts of their lives. With the incredible relationship the reader is left with the question: Will everything go well or will Buck answer the call of the wild? An intriguing plot and interesting story, I rate the story highly. The great story receives a four out of four stars. The author does an astounding job. The two main reasons I liked it is first it had the best idea for story and the story keeps one are interested the whole time. With great character development, one receives a certain feeling for the characters. The wonderful use of adjectives makes one feel as though when one is reading it that the wolves are your friends and you are a part of the pack. The story is an amazing American tale and an easily enjoyed book. I suggest this book for intermediate readers, at least fifth grade and older."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild takes place in 1896-1897 during the period of the Klondike Gold Rush. The story starts out in Santa Clara Valley in California, a small town around San Francisco. The setting soon changes, however, after Buck is sold to the man in the park. For the rest of the book, the setting is in the Yukon, a territory in Alaska. Men were the dominant ones and the women's role was to take care of the kids and keep the house tidy while their husbands went to find gold. I really enjoyed Call of the Wild. It gave a good view about what life during the time period. It showed that dogs (as well as people) change when exposed to new experieces. It also showed how people take for granted everyday things ... I don't think Francois and Perrault would ever have the chance to watch TV up in the Yukon. I would consider Buck a hero. He created togetherness and cooperation among the team rather than chaos under Spitz's leadership. Buck's love for John Thorton is an example of his being a hero, just because he made someone feel loved and cared for."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was an okay book. Some parts were kind of boring, but most kept you want to keep reading. I liked the ending the best, b/c the dog, Buck, goes where he's always wanted to."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I find this book to be very adventurous and over all exciting to read. This novel is about a four year-old husky named Buck who lived peacfully in the Santa Clara Valley. He was used to living in luxurious surroundings, until one day while walking through an orchard, he is taken away from his home. He later finds himself in an old truck with some unkown strangers. Then the people sent him to a train station, he was put on a train for approximately four days without any form of consumable matter, or in other words-without food! He was mistreated and beat along with a few other dogs. He was begining to feel alone and betrayed by human kind after this experience. Buck was sold to some men who owned sledding dogs. Buck was going to be used as part of the pack. The dogs were to be traveling across the Yukon in Alaska where it was freezing cold. Buck was not used to this type of weather, but he had to cooperate because he didn't have much of a choice. There was a slight problem with getting along with the other members of the pack. Spitz was the top dog for this particular pack, and he disliked Buck and tried to get rid of him every chance he got. Buck thought very carefully about what he was going to do to show Spitz who the real boss was. One day Spitz and buck got into a huge fight, a fight that would leave one of them without life. Luckily the day had come, Buck gained the victory and the respect of both the pack and his human caregivers when he killed Spitz at the end of the terrible fight. Well, I guess you want to know what happened next, but you can only find out the truth when you read this excellent book and find out for yourself! I hope you had fun reading this, I truely recommend this novel to all of you and rate it 4 stars because it is a great adventure to experience! Take my advice and discover the true moral of the story that opens your mind and changes your perspective towards animals."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Buck is an ordinary house-pet, completely civilized by the gentle Southland ways. When Manuel steals him and sells him to the man in the red sweater, Buck realizes it isn't all champaigne and caviar. He is broken in soon, but not without a fight that arouses the true beast in him. Francois and Perrault buy him, and along with Dave, Curly and Spitz, Buck journeys north to his ultimate destiny. He soon learns the important Law Of Club And Fang, and sees it put into practice when Curly is ripped to shreds by a pack of huskies. As the team works toward Dawson, Buck is whipped into shape by Spitz and Dave. Spitz soon makes himself Buck's archrival, and the two's enmity grows until finally the two duel. In a fierce battle, Buck summons all his ferocity, as well as some tricks remembered just in time by his primordial instincts and kills the evil Spitz. After this, Buck becomes the leader of the team and more ferocious, being unstoppable by any dog. When Buck and his team are sold to Hal, Charles, and Mercedes, things slide downhill from there. The trio are from the Southland, and do not know how to do anything right. They are in a fine kettle of fish, however, when they run out of dog food halfway through the trip. Eventually, the dogs cannot go on, and, when Buck refuses to get up one day, Hal almost succedes in beating him to death. John Thornton, who is present at the time, stops Hal and saves Buck. As the rest of the team drives away, John and Buck hear an enormous crack, and just see the others fall down to their deaths. What happens afterward I won't tell you, but it is a great book, especially for all those ferocious-beast loving people like me. Jack London's books are simply wonderful, except for the Sea-Wolf, which has a very misleading title and is very dull. Two claws up!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"When I first starded to read The Call of The Wild by Jack London, I thought the book was boaring. After reading several chapters I begin to enjoy the story. I felt that Jack London gave a powerful messege to let you know that you should never be content in life because you never know when thing may change. This was shown by Buck who had a very good life living with Judge Miller. After he was stolen and sold several times he found himself in a cold, mean, harsh world. He hafd to learn how to adjust to a different way of life.I think the book is a great book for young teenage children. He teach you how to set your goals in life, however your goals should not be base on one thing."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This novel, even in 2004, can still be considered a major piece of literature that has infulenced American Literature since its first writing. Adventure, intrigue, hardships, friendships, and loyalty,even if it means death, are all found in this story. Aren't these the elements of a good example of literature. Isn't this what we educators still use to engage our students into reading? Dog lovers will adore this book, written in the perspective of our dog hero, Buck, an animal with human-like tendencies,intelligence, strength and dignity. A classic in every true sense is the best way to evaluate this novel. Jack London allows his readings to become a part of his stories; we begin to have empathy for Buck as he nearly dies, or when he risks it all to save his human friend, John Thornton. If you like this book, you might also want to read some of London's other classics White Fang, and Sea-Wolf."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is really one of the finest books on the market. The Call of the Wild is about Buck, a German Sheperd, who is dagnapped from his home when word comes of a Goldrush up in the Canadian wilderness. From then on, Buck experiences adventure, companionship, and tragic, tragic losses. This all, however, is character-building to Buck, and he becomes one of the best sled-dogs ever, except for the fact that this is fiction.That is the overall premise of this book. In case you didn't know, this book was written in the early 1900's by the world-reknowned author, Jack London. Jack London wrote many other books based around canine-human interaction, but none were as masterfully done as this one. The whole adventure that Buck has in this book is both tragic and woderful at the same time.One of the things that makes this book so wonderful is the way that it is written. The description, the emotion, all of the writing is done is such a great fahion to the point that that this book is amazing on a grand scale. In short, the writing is really good.Another great thing about this book is that it deals mostly with what is going on in Buck's head, and dialogue is kept to a minimum.

Buck, which is the name of the dog, learns not only to survive in the wilderness but also to thrive and to be top dog. Never before has he actually felt a bond with a human being until a man by the name of Thornton rescues him from a foolish death. Buck is torn between the feeling of returning to his natural state in the wild and his loyalty to Thornton. Although he loves this man, he continues to hear the call of wolves, which are his own call of the wild.In this book London brings out a 3rd person point of view where we can see the feelings and thoughts of both the dogs and the men. He almost makes Buck seem human by having him deal with internal conflicts. I believe that many people can relate to Buck's story of dealing with the real world and having to depend on themselves to survive. It would be a great book for anyone who loves the out doors and who wants to read an adventure novel. It's an easy read because it constantly keeps the reader's attention by not using difficult and confusing language.

So well written and easy to read that I read it in one day. Great book."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read this book twelve years ago, when I was 14. I picked it up again last week and couldn't believe how fresh it seemed. I remembered the excitement I felt the first time I read it, and none of that seemed to have gone away. This novel does so many things so well, it's difficult to know where to begin. It is a classic, but not in the sense of a book your teachers want you to read so you can be well-rounded and literate. This is a classic in the sense of a book that everyone should read, because it will change the way you look at human life, animal life, and the way humans interact with dogs and our world in general. I don't know of many books that have affected me as deeply as The Call of the Wild.Maybe the first thing I should mention is getting into the dog's point of view. Just about the whole book is told from Buck's viewpoint. This will seem strange until you actually get into the book and start reading, and then it makes sense and works out in a way that seems natural. London presents Buck's thoughts and desires in a natural way. The dog has basic needs and wants, he expresses these, and then he goes about getting whatever he needs. As I read, I found myself adjusting to the dog's way of looking at things. He didn't like being beaten, so he tried to figure out how to avoid the beatings. This is logical, of course, but to see it from Buck's point of view was fascinating and challenging to me. I think the beatings would have seemed repetitive if they had been portrayed from a human point of view, but from the dog's, they again seemed cruel but also very natural. The fight with the lead dog, Spitz, was well done. I don't think I put much thought into the genius of this 12 years ago, but last week, I realized this was the crowning achievement of the novel. I came to accept Buck's personality, and Spitz's, and understood Buck's ascendance to lead dog from HIS point of view. What an amazing thing for Jack London to pull off!I didn't think much about the almost endless beatings and fights and lashings and general all-around violence of this novel 12 years ago, either. It all seems a little more cruel and gruesome sometimes this time around, but now that I've read a couple hundred novels, I see why London put all this into the book. It had to be there because he wanted us to really experience things from the dog's perspective. The beatings and lashings and making the dogs pull more than they should was a way of demonstrating human cruelty, but also a way of showing that dogs could rise to the challenge, really that they could rise above. And part of it is the idea that there is kind of a way about the world. The new mushers were cruel, but the guy who cared for Buck almost to the end, John Thornton, was the opposite of cruel--just a nice guy who loved dogs. He nursed Buck back to physical and mental health, which was another side to the natural order of things. There's good and bad in the world of dogs, too.This is an important novel, and it's one of the few 100-year-old novels I can recommend to anyone, child or adult, because I know just about everyone ought to love this book. It really is a book everyone should read. It will change the way you think about many things: dogs, nature, winter, animal cruelty, and the way we should treat other living things. It is one of the most powerful things I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Review by Haley. I read the children's version when I was in third grade and then read the full version in sixth. There is animal cruelety in it such as a dog being shot, another being whacked on the head with an ax, and dogs being beat with whips, but it's a great story. Buck, a Saint Bernard/Scotch Shepherd mix, is the main character in the story. He is stolen from his home and is taken to the Arctic for gold hunters. He meets many humans such as the man in the red sweater and John Thorton as well as many dogs including Spitz, Billee, and Sol-leks. Follow Buck in this wonderful classic, and discover where he truly belongs."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"A classic about a dog with two sides: an undying loyalty to man and an inherited spirit of the wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I first read this book when I was in 9th grade and loved it. 30 years later, I read it again from the perspective of an old fart, and I still love it, except some of the story's events seemed impossible to me now. A St Bernard and a shepard mix turns into a leader of a wolf pack?? Highly improbable. Buck kills a large black bear?? The scene where he kills two Teehat indians and the rest of them were shooting each other with arrows and impaling each other with spears, that was high comedy, or kind of reminds you of a bad B-movie!! Of course, Jack London lived before the movie era so kudos to him for adding a little embellishment.Overall, Jack London's imagery is classic.

It is written mainly from a dogs point of view which makes for original and interesting reading and shows how Buck gradually creeps back to his primordial and hereditary roots as a wild dog. This is only a short book but you are quickly drawn into Bucks world and viewpoint and before you know it the last page has been turned and you are left both satisfied and saddened to have finished. Written in simple, yet richly descriptive, language this book is aimed at children, although adults can get as much, if not more, from it as younger readers can. Having heard about this book for years but never getting round to reading it, I can say that it was a delight to pick up and immerse myself in and I only wish I had done so sooner.

It is based on a large wolfish dog, well a Saint Bernard mix to be exact (similar to \\"white fang\\")who transfers between a few different masters, that for the most part treat him cruelly (also similar to \\"white fang\\"). He Eventually Lands in the hands of a master that treats him with respect. There is a twist to this though, it doesn't quite end the way you would expect it to. ( I dont want to spoil it so you are gonna have to read it to find out what happens.)As you would expect from a Jack London story, he uses graphic descriptions that gives you a vivid picture of what is going on in the story (This is what keeps me reading his stories). Unlike \\"White Fang\\" which is my favorite book by London, this story kinda failed to keep me reading all the way through. Some parts i had force myself to read.... The whole story inst like this, it just has it ups and downs. I'm not saying \\"White Fang\\" didn't because it definitely did in the beginning but for the most part it kept you wanting to know whats gonna happen next. \\"Call of the Wild\\" was a little different.Overall i think \\"The Call of the Wild\\" is a Great book and read. It had a good story line with some interesting twists to it. I'm sure while you read it, from on point to another you will be like \\"wait what...?\\" or, \\"Wow....\\".

On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love. As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.This book is well written. There is not a wasted word or thought and the story while building on its self has purpose and direction.

That, along with it's wide commercial success, has allowed this story penetrate our culture in a significant way. Buck, although a dog, has been a powerful symbol for dedication and courage and heart and soul within our culture.I suppose that the celebration of these virtues is the most important purpose of this book. But there may be other subtexts to the story as well. Jack London was socialist, and the sled dogs working as a team may have been a metaphor for socialism. Also, the use of dogs which by nature subordinate their wills to that of their owners may be a metaphor for subject/state relationship in a socialist state.Also, the story is set in a particular corner of American history, during the Alaskan Gold rush, told by a writer who lived it. For those interested in history, this story puts meat on the bones of that time in history.Finally, this was FREE for the kindle version!!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I should have read this sooner - it' only 105 pages. What a book! While it was interesting all of the way though, the last chapters got even more remarkable with the descriptions as the call was taking over. I was very pleased that Buck(The main character who happens to be a dog/wolf) didn't die at the end like some formula-matic authors would write today. Instead it becomes about the call. It's clearly a masterpiece, and, it kept me reading - I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Now this is what I consider a classic. Can there be a more exciting tale than that of Buck? Well, I don't think so anyway.Buck is a family pet in California when he is kidnapped and sold into the gold rush up North because he is a strong large dog. He quickly learns that this is a harsh new world, and that it must be treated differently from the tame life he is used to. He becomes part of a sled dog team and struggles to learn the ins and outs of sledding life, including dealing with the other pack dogs. Each new master brings additional lessons and Buck can feel himself growing wilder and wilder, getting closer to his roots as an animal that was not bred in captivity.Buck is a very inspiring dog, and very real-seeming as well. Since his plight is that of what hundreds of dogs had in real life during the gold rush, it's easy to see how his story has an element of truth in it. I also like how we almost get to see his emotions directly through the telling of this story because you can see the way his thoughts and actions changed and how he adapted. And you really can empathize with him, even though he's a dog. The different people in the book were interesting too, although it's Buck's beloved owner John Thornton that truly steals my heart with his treatment of Buck. The chapters with him in it are some of my favorites. That's not saying the other characters didn't have their place, but he was one that stood out.Since this is based on a real time in history, I think it does a remarkable job of showing the lesser known aspects of that history. We all know about the Gold Rush, for instance, but few of us knew that regular dogs were being shipped up there to be sled dogs. It never even occurred to me that there were dogs other than huskies doing the work. I also thought that the book was perfectly paced. Since it's technically a kid's book it's shorter than most books, but it's done in such a great way that you become so involved in the book and lose track of time. However, one thing to note considering that this is a kid's book is that there is a great deal of violence and graphic description of fights, killings, etc. For those sensitive hearts that love animals and can't handle one in pain, this isn't a book that should probably be read.I absolutely love the book and think it should be one of those books that everyone reads at least once in their lifetime.

The story has some exciting parts and the setting, being in the Arctic during a gold rush, is also interesting. However, the book was written in the early 1900s and the language, giving it a formal feel and is full of words seldom used today. But, that being said, I was still surprised to see how interested many of my 7th grade students actually were while reading this story and getting to know its characters.Synopsis: The Call of the Wild is about a dog named Buck who is kidnapped from a beautiful home in California where he lives with his kind owner, Judge Miller. His kidnappers transport him North, to the Klondike area on the border of Northern Canada and Alaska, where he sold as a sled dog. Though the abrupt end to his relatively privileged former life in California, and the sudden start of a harsh new life in the Arctic as a sled dog, is initially shocking, Buck learns quickly what it takes to survive. Specifically, he learns the law of club and fang: when there's no civilization or laws to protect you, you have to do whatever it takes--steal, fight, even kill--in order to survive. Buck does learn to do this and, in the process, becomes a very powerful sled dog and eventually team leader. All of the while, he feels called by some mysterious force in the wilderness, experiencing some primal connection to the wild wolves and raw elements of the environment. Though he has some incompetent owners for a while, he eventually comes under the authority of a gold-seeker named John Thorton. Thorton, who saved Buck from his cruel former owners, instantly becomes the object of Buck's affection and even worship. Buck is willing to do anything for him, and even saves his life on multiple occasions. Because of this, he wins a high-stakes bet for Thorton on another. However, at the end of the novel, when Thorton and his companions are camping in the woods near a site where they've found gold, they are confronted by a band of Native Americans. It is up to Buck to save Thorton, even if it means risking his own life against the entire band of native warriors. Lucky for Thorton, Buck is a loyal companion and is willing to take a risk. Will he be able to save Thorton and continue his life as man's best friend, or will he be left to once again, take the call of the wild?Title: The Call of the WildAuthor: Jack LondonPublisher: Pocket BooksDate: 1903Pages: 105Genre: Adventure/Classic LiteratureReading Level: 12"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Now I never read this when everyone else was in High School.

If someone asked me if the book was good I would surely say yes."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Great book. I can't believe that I never read it or remember reading it as a kid. I found it very entertaining. The only reason that I bought this book was because I was reading Lost in the Wilds, the true story about the kid that disappeared to Alaska by himself and ended up dying of starvation. He brought different books along and one was Call of the Wild and the other was Walden Pond. I read both try and figure out what he was thinking."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"While reading this novel, I felt as though I was on a journey. The sensory detail and connections that I could make with Buck made his jouney seem more and more real to me. Watching Buck transform from a domesticated house dog, to a wild, one with nature, almost wolf-like animal was both amazing and heart-wrenching. It was amazing to see how the wild changed Buck so much, but it was sad to see how the major struggles and difficulties he faced sort of forced him to change. Buck had great determination and spirit that was clearly shown through his actions and reactions to his surroundings.When John Thorton came to Buck's rescue like an angel, it foreshadowed that Buck was about to change again. He slowly began to change back into a more domesticated dog. He protected Thorton with all of his life now. Everything was no longer all about Buck anymore, but now it was about Thorton and Buch together. They were like father and son or even almost like brothers, in my opinion. It stayed this way until Buck heard the almost ever present call of the wild. Buck's personality then began to split. He had to choose between following the call, or staying by his rescuers side. His confusion in this situation was almost like a mini climax.When Thorton and Buck were finally serperated due to horrible circumstances, Buck then only had one choice to make. He was to follow the call of the wild. It was almost as if he was set free to follow his heart, like fate or destiny even. Out of the most terrible situations, hope and new opportunity can arise. That is what happened to Buck, new opportunity arose.I compliment Jack London on his captivating writing style. He made it so that anyone could take this long and eye-opening journey with Buck just by picking up the book and start reading. \\"The Call of the Wild\\" was like a portal into a new world for me. I have never read a book like this before, and I thank Jack London for giving this experience to me."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London needs to be given his proper due. He is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow-enshrouded world of the upper latitudes. Although The Call of the Wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog's story, it contains as much truth and reality of man's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life's work of many other respected authors.Jack London's writing is beautiful, poignant, and powerful, yet also somber, morose, and infinitely real. London doesn't paint pretty picture, nor is the story elevating or uplifting. As an animal lover, I found parts of this story heartbreaking from Buck's removal from the civilized Southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard, weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes.Even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled's traces around him. Good-spirited Curly never had a chance, while Dave's story is only made bearable because of his brave, undying spirit. Even Spitz, the harsh taskmaster, has to be pitied, despite his harsh nature, for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches. Buck's travails are long and hard, but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero, despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him. Buck not only conquers the weather, the harshness of the men, the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with, he thrives.Hopes for redemption with John Thornton are dashed in the end, and that's when Buck finally gives in fully to \\"the call of the wild,\\" becoming a creature of nature only. While this is a sad ending, the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at Buck's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Whitney BoehmPeriod 313 August 2006\\"The Call of the Wild\\" book reviewA book that influenced my life greatly is \\"The Call of the Wild\\" by Jack London.

While Sprits went for help, Buck started defending him self from this. The leader couldn't last any more so he ran away. After that they got back to the race.

I disliked the book at the beginning because it is boring to me, but then towards the ending the book started to be more fun and exciting for me.

One was when Buck had to fight to a death to get the lead position on the sled team. I also like the flash backs Buck had throughout the book. The flash backs tell the parts of the story that the book is based on. These help you understand what is happening. There were times that I found this book hard to read. When some of the characters such as Perrault and Fran?ois spoke it was also difficult to follow. Like \\"gif it to heem by gar the dirty teef.\\" In the end this books ending may surprise you.

Both stories seem like Jack London was writing fictional happenings on what happened to him in the Klondike. They are both about surviving in the freezing Yukon Territory. In this essay, I will relate the classic theme of survival, the conflict Character vs. Nature, and the similar settings, which is in the cold, harsh winter of the Yukon. Both settings are in the snowy, wilderness type climate. With the temperature 75 degrees below zero in the &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; and cold enough to freeze your eyes shut in The Call of the Wild. It seems they are both during the gold rushes in the Yukon since it specifies in &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; the man was headed for the old mine. And in The Call of the Wild the whole plot was that the man was searching for the place, Barracula, which was said to have gold. The setting also had a big affect on the characters and their roles. In both stories, nature acts as the main character. The characters had to fight the cold in both stories. It is almost a Character vs. Character scenario. You have to survive nature. It's another character that will kill people, like in &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; it murdered the man. Every move the men and even dogs make in both of the stories, they have to take precautions of the snow, ice, temperature, hidden springs, and many other obstacles. Like for example, sometimes there are hidden springs in which both men characters fell into. Foot after foot of snow on the ground slows down travel. Nature is the number one thing someone can think about when traveling and looking for gold or shelter in the Yukon in negative 75 degrees weather. It creates conflicts and roadblocks throughout both stories. You must survive it. Both stories have strong survival themes. In &quot;To Build a Fire&quot;, the man and the dog have to go to the shelter, which is the old mine through -75 degrees and many obstacles that are hard to survive past. For example, the hidden spring the man fell into. He had to survive not to be an ice cube after being drenched in below freezing water. Not only that, but to get out of the spring in the first place. In The Call of the Wild, the dogs on the sled had to keep going and survive from being shot if the collapsed. Although, if they all stopped, shooting them would be no good since you would be stranded and die in the middle of the Yukon. If you have noticed, these paragraphs all connect onto each other through a main idea about nature. What it is, surviving it, and most importantly of all, how it effects us. I have read other books about surviving the winter. When I read this short story and saw the movie of The Call of the Wild, it really reminded me of those books. Sometimes Mother Nature becomes an actual character, and beats you down."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Call of the Wild is, in fact, in so many people's head as a classic story about the faith and trust in savages.

There has never been and will never be a similar story. While the novella is essentially a story of love and survival -two of the most common storylines in literature - the plot is totally unique to anything that has ever been written.

The main character is a dog named Buck. I love the descriptions that London gives about all the dogs. He tells you emotions as well as physical traits in great detail. However, he could have spent more time describing the humans. This book is, in my opinion, hard to follow. There are a lot of flashbacks and dreams. This makes it hard to tell whether the book is in the present or flashback. The weather and conditions of the land were described well also. &quot;No lazy, sun-kissed life was this, with nothing to do but loaf and be bored. Here was neither peace, nor rest, nor a moments' safety.&quot; (London page 8) This is a prime example of the description of enviromental conditons. To sum things up, I would reccommend this book to any person interested in the era of the Gold Rush and the great outdoors."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I found that The Call of the Wild by Jack London is a very odd but unique classic liked and disliked by many. Personally I found the beginning drab and it did not seize my interests. Around the time when Francois and Perrault bought Buck is when the action started to rise and grasp my attention. The overall plot of this story was found unlikeable but I really liked the theme that was expressed. &quot;And not only did he learn by experience, but instincts long dead became alive again.&quot; (London p.14) In this passage London symbolizes the digression from civility and the progression into the primitive by displaying how Buck's ancestorial behavior was awakened when he adapted to a new environment. There were many passages I enjoyed because they were filled with description. This quote is a wonderful example of descriptive writing: &quot;Something wriggled under his feet. He sprang back, bristling and snarling, fearful of the unseen and unknkown...a whiff of warm air ascended to his nostrils...&quot; (London p.11) I found the dogs' personalities were believable however, London lacked realism in the people- especially Mercedes, Hal, and Charles. I have come to the conclusion that The Call of the Wild is a wonderful novel despite some of the weak points. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinion The Call of the Wild by Jack London is mediocre. My favorite part of the book is the in depth descriptions. For example, I really like the way that London describes Buck after he had been pulling the sled for awhile. &quot;His muscles had wasted away to knotty strings, and the flesh pads had disappeared, so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness.&quot;(London p.38) I also like the way the book is written and how it doesn't drag on forever. I do not like the beginning of the book because i think it is boring and doesn't grab the attention of the reader. I also think that the vocabulary is too tough and overall the novel is a bit confusing. Although personally I do not like The Call of the Wild, I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a great adventure."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I read this book as an 8th grader and didn't take much at all from it. Reading it now as a sophomore I realize what Jack London was getting at the whole time. Everyone deep inside is truly a savage such as Buck knew he was. Domestication was holding him back from what he really was. Out in the Artic where he ancestors resided once, brought out his primitive instincts actually learning there's more to life then he knew."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Gold was found in Alaska, the rush to obtain it required a strong constitution and many dogs to do the work that horses usually did in the states. The environment bread harsh attitudes. Also in the testing of ones mettle one finds their true potential.Buck (a dog that is half St Bernard and half Shepherd) goes through many lives, trials, and tribulations finally realizing his potential. On the way he learns many concepts from surprise, to deceit, and cunning; he also learns loyalty, devotion, and love. As he is growing he feels the call of the wild.This book is well written. There is not a wasted word or thought and the story while building on its self has purpose and direction. The descriptions may be a tad graphic for the squeamish and a tad sentimental for the romantic. You see the world through Buck's eyes and understand it through his perspective until you also feel the call of the wild.The Call of the Wild - Dog of the Yukon (1997)"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London has a very sophisticated style of writing. But the book is relatively predictable. the plot pulls you in and the book is hard to put down. Some of my favorites scenes are when Buck goes back to his primal instincts and sees the ape-man by the fire. The only negative feedback i have on this book is that Jack London is sort of racist agains Indians, the Yeehats are portrayed as the bad indians that killed everyone and then danced. But overall all i have is praise for the call of the wild."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was a wonderful book if you like adventure, and dogs.

Not the best I've ever read, mind, but easy and relaxed and straightforward. However, the book left a bitter taste in my mouth, so to speak, because of the ending. The ending just spoiled the whole thing. Not because it was unhappy either, (I am a devoted fan of Robert Cormier, patron saint of unhappy endings.) But because it didn't seem right somehow. I mean, Buck just forgets everything he's learned and goes to live with the wolves. It made the whole story seem pointless."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This was a great book to spend your money on. It's worth it! The book was great and so sad.

On one level, it is a story of finding one's true identity during the passage of life, and the struggles that are involved. As a dog breeder, I was able to appreciate London's deep understanding of canine behavior and character, and of the bonds that have tied humans and dogs together for thousands of years. Although this is often thought of as a book for young readers, I would certainly recommend it to an older audience, who will doubtlessly appreciate it so much more, as I did."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I mean I never read this book, I have a book report due for it in about 15 hours.....but thanks to the marvel of modern techknowlegy known as the internet this procrastinating, ill prepared student will have a masterfully writen report legibly completed by 8:00 tonight thanks to the countless summaries accumulated on this web site.

I was a seven-year old boy and I had never read anything but cartoons. After reading it, I suddenly found out what incredible worlds could be hidden behind all those books filled with nothing else but letters. After that, I became an avid reader and books became my passion. I still remember the adventures of Buck and his tale of courage, devotion, friendship, loyalty and survival.

Click on the paperback link, and ignore the part that says it hasn't been published).The elegant Library of America edition of &quot;London: Novels and Stories&quot; has three complete novels _The Call of the Wild_, _White Fang_, _The Sea-Wolf_, and a very well chosen selection of stories. It's great. Viking's _The Portable Jack London_, is cheap and excellent; it's edited by Earle Labor, has _The Call of the Wild_, and an excellent selection of short stories, nonfiction, and letters. If you want copies of _The Call of the Wild_ to give to LOTS of friends, the Dover Thrift Edition is just a buck.But if you want _just_ The Call of the Wild, Dyer's edition is nice enough to give as a gift, is clear and legible, and has just the right amount of pictures and annotations. Not a scholarly work, but every time you get to one of those places where you have a question--where was Dyea?

For that reason it made it interesting."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"In my opinoin THE CALL OF THE WILD was a non interisting book. The only thing that i thought about the book that was good, was that it was discriptive in the fights against each other. One of the biggest things that i disagree with is the vocabulary, it was very hard for me to read all those big words, and phrases for example. With the Aurora Borals flaming overhead, or the stars Leaping in the first dance,and the land Numb and over its pail of snow. I read that phrase about fivr times and i still do not know what it means. I would only reccomand this book for people who like to read and have a good vocabulary."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I have nothing against Jack London. He writes very well and some passages of this book are moving and intense. For a great portion of this book, however, I suffered from intense boredom. Call of the Wild drags on, inch per inch, just as our young canine hero, Buck, trudges along in the snow.I can't say that I really got any enjoyment out of reading it at all. I was very mericiful by giving it three stars, but one of those stars is because I liked the ending, one of them is because it was well written, and the other was because the book was short.I would rather watch paint dry than have to read this again. Once more, it is WELL-WRITTEN... the descriptions are good and the relationships among the dogs is interesting at times, but the book itself is no joy to read. I hope that the ghost of Jack London does not send a pack of wild, hungry, Alaskian wolves to maul me after writing this, but I did not like this book!"},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"For example, when London says &quot;A dozen times he charged, and as often the club broke the charge and smashed him down.&quot; (London p.5) I just thought it was sad that Buck got beat up and he didn't know what was going on. It also upset me when &quot;The scotch half-breed retraced his steps to the camp they had left. A revolver shot rang out. Buck knew, and every dog Knew what had taken place behind the belt of river trees.&quot; (London p.31) Poor Dave he was trying so hard! This novel did have some good parts in it such as; when Buck was willing to pull one thousand pounds for his master. That was a good part because John Thorton and Buck got to prove everybody wrong.

I think that they threw away life too easily, when life is such an amazing thing. You only get one! I also think that Buck is a very flat and static character. The only change made in him is a negative change. He becomes savage and cruel. He also doesn't seem to have any faults, making him more of a \\"super dog\\" than a realistic character. He is big, strong, the best fighter the there is, kills people, dominates the land, kills all other predators around (including single handedly killing a bear, which in reality takes upwards to above 6 or 7 wolves to take down) and becomes more wolf-like. But what are the contrasting traits? There really are none that I can see, making him very unbelievable as a character.Also, I thought that it was very unclear about the other characters (mainly the other sled dogs). Their personality descriptions were mentioned only once or twice, if at all, and you never really got a clear picture of what they looked like and who they were as a character. I think that they should've been described more fully, as well as with Buck,who we only find out what he looks like in the last couple of pages, when really he should have been described from the get go."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"First of all the book is about 5\\" x 7\\", real small. I purchased this for my 10 year old grandson because i read this book when I was about his age and really loved it. This book is written in old english style and small letters. My grandson started reading it and could not understand the words, he got frustrated and gave up. I thought it would be a regular size book geared to children. It is not for children. It is for adults, but not for elderly people because the print is too small.

The added bonus was the inclusion of \\"Batard,\\" a short novel published by London prior to the publishing of \\"Call of the Wild.\\" Having to exceptional stories from the same genre in one book is convenient and a great value."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"The Call of the Wild is a moving book written by Jack London in 1903. It is a wonderfully written piece based on the historical facts about the Alaskan gold rush. The characters are lively and interesting. It is very entertaining to follow the dramatic, sad, adventurous, fun, and loving lives of the characters.The story is about a prideful and well respected dog named Buck that is kidnapped, sold as a mush dog to the Canadian government, and mistreated. When he was being beaten so badly that he was about to die, a man named John Thornton saved him. Buck stayed faithful to his new master until the man died while searching for gold. In the end, Buck left mankind to join a pack of wolves.Jack London builds beautiful characters- dogs and men that are just like real dogs and humans. Buck begins in his story as a proud and faithful dog, so the readers do not expect him to change or grow at all. However, as he learns more about being a dog for an unfair master, his wild side grew and he became untamed. John Thornton, the man who saved Buck's life, is described by London as a kind, gentle, and soft hearted man that is adventurous and sets off to find a legendary gold mine from which no one has returned. London was very skilled at making his characters just like real humans and animals. He made them come to life with the way that they acted and the things that that they believed and stood up for. They all had faults and failures, but they also had good things that made them special.The book is packed full with action and adventure. The book is only 62 pages and the action starts on the first ones when Buck is kidnapped and it ends when he joins a pack of wolves and haunts Indian people whose ancestors killed his favorite master.Jack London wrote an unsatisfying ending in which one of our favorite characters, John Thornton, dies tragically and Buck, another favorite, becomes discontented and wild.The book is dramatic and many loved characters die. The mush dogs find themselves in the hardest situations. Only half way through the book, the most loved dogs are limping and struggling to survive along with their masters who they defend and remain faithful to.The Call of the Wild is action packed, has realistic characters, is historically accurate, does not have too much or too little description, is dramatic, and the characters have qualities that make you love them. These are all traits that a good book should have. It demonstrates the irresistible call of the wild that dogs have and the persistence of a faithful dog that loves its work and will not fail his master if he is treated right. It demonstrates the love between dogs and their masters."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"I love this dogs spirit. Two primary themes are present. A dogs struggle for survival, and man's yearning for adventure. This is an adventure story about the transformation of one of mans best freinds. Buck is a gritty and dignified dog. He led a lavish life at judge Miller's estate in the Santa Clara valley California. Then one day he is kidnapped for money and sold to traders as a sled dog, during the gold rush. He endures men's cruelty and fights for his life with other dogs. He eventually slays the lead dog and takes his place. Chapters 5-7 are worth reading several times. In 5, a civilized miner John Thornton saves Buck and their relationship grows. Chapter 7 I won't reveal. Just read this book, I promise you will love it."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London presents an enthralling tale about the Yukon Gold Rush of the 1890s through the eyes of one dog, Buck. Buck is ripped from his home in sunny California and forced into one of various dog-sled teams in the frozen tundra of Alaska. Buck must learn how to survive in this wilderness and he manages to not only survive, but thrive. Although his masters change, he grows most fond of his last master, John Thornton. However, even his love for John Thornton cannot supress his desire to roam free and wild, like his wolf brethren.\\"Call of the Wild\\" presents a stark contrast between the civilized and uncivilized worlds that Buck inhabits. It is in this uncivilized world that Buck grows to love and eventually becomes a master himself, first as leader of the dog sled team, then as a legendary leader of a wolf pack. Buck quickly learns the \\"law of club and fang,\\" that is, kill or be killed.Although it's told from a dog's perspective, the novel is not gimmicky or unrealistic in any way. Buck's yearning to be free may represent a human desire to be free of civilization and all its rules and handicaps. For only in the wild is Buck truly free, as many of us may wish to escape from the civlization that we are trapped in.Overall, this is a short, yet well-told and thought-provoking story that is enjoyable to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"Jack London's book \\"The Call of the Wild\\" was well written and I think that everyone should read it. The book starts out talking about how Buck, the main character, lives in a large house in the Santa Clara Valley. The place he lives at is called Judge Miller's place. Buck's father, Elmo, was a large St Bernard who had been the Judge's very close companion. His mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Buck loved hunting and outdoor delights, which made him stronger. Buck loved living at the Judge's house but one night when he went on what he thought was just a walk with Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, his life changed. Money was exchanged between Manuel and another man and Buck was sent off in a baggage car. After a couple of days they stopped and he was turned over to a black-faced giant called Francois. Buck traveled with Francois starting at Dyea beach where Buck's life was changed to a not so lazy life through the Yukon. Traveling he learned that it was a wolf manner to fight which he encountered a lot with a dog named Spitz who is the sled leader. One day Buck and Spitz get into it and Buck ends up killing Spitz and takes over the head position, which was my favorite part in the book. A while later in the book, Buck meets a man named John Thornton who Buck loves and will do anything for him and even earns Thornton sixteen hundred dollars. With the money they set off into the East with six other dogs and found lots of gold. I would recommend \\"The Call of the Wild\\" to younger readers who like adventurous stories."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"&quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is a novel written by Jack London, the &quot;most widely&quot; read author in the world at the turn of the twentieth century. London lived a &quot;wild life&quot;, traveled the continent of North America, and committed suicide at the age of forty. London's story about Buck, a family pet stolen and sold to be a sled dog, is a realistic tale of the Alaska Gold Rush. Buck's new life is a hard one as he learns to adapt to the cruelty of people, animals, and the weather. Buck learns from his experiences that some people and animals are good and kind, and others are cruel and deadly.London, also, learns from his experiences in the Northwest, and the experiences make his novel seem to be true of that time and that place. London's life was not an easy one, and the life he created for Buck was not an easy one.When I read &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;, I was impressed by the way Buck survives the cruel treatment and the harsh land of Alaska. The realism in the story suggest the way life really is. Some people, like Hal, are cruel and show no mercy. Other people, like John Thornton, are kind as he saves Buck's life. I wish that Jack London could have had a friend like John Thornton in his life."},{"Title":"The Call Of The Wild","review":"This is a review of the unabridged audio version of Call of the Wild, read by Frank Muller, and my comments are specific to that edition.I had often heard that Frank Muller is one of the best audiobook readers out there--the go-to guy for authors like Stephen King and John Grisham--but I think this is the first book I've listened to by him. Believe the hype!Call of the Wild is Jack London's classic masterpiece of survival in the frozen Yukon during the 1890s Klondike gold rush. The protagonist of the tale is Buck, a magnificent dog leading a lush life of luxury as the pet of a judge in Santa Clara, California. He is dognapped and sold into servitude as a sled dog at a time when strong dogs were almost literally worth their weight in gold.The tale follows Buck's adventures as he is broken to first obedience and then to the sled harness, and finds his inner beast's survival and pack leadership instincts as he passes from master to master. The series of masters and duties (and different levels of treatment) also provide a microcosm of the sorts of people traveling the Yukon during the gold rush years. It's a fascinating story, extremely accessible for a work considered \\"great literature\\" and appropriate for even younger readers. It's a short novel, around 80 pages and even the unabridged reading is just a bit over 3 hours long.Jack London is a master of prose and his descriptions of the frozen North would make you feel cold on a July day. You feel the joy in Buck as he discovers his inner wildness and his love of the work and his best master; and you feel his pain during the times he is wounded or starving, beaten and confused.Frank Muller's reading brings all this to life beautifully. He has a wonderful flowing style that lends itself perfectly to Jack London's prose.I recommend both the book and this recording of it--if you or your child has been assigned this for school and is put off by reading it, pop this CD into the car stereo for a 30-minute errand running expedition and I guarantee everyone in the car will be sitting in the driveway listening for what comes next by the time you return home!"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},M={key:1};function O(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),p(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const q=u(D,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-c49a819f"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/4.md","filePath":"library/4.md"}'),L={name:"library/4.md"},R=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{E as __pageData,R as default};
