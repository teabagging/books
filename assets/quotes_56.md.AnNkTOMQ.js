What inflamed peoples passion so, in this seventeenth century book? It was governement and religion, of course. Hobbes, who was a private tutor for a wealthy family for most of his career (until he fled the country, that is), picks apart both the why-to of government and its use of manipulations, and the nature of humanity and the mechanisms, he proponents, whereby it operates. And that is just the first hundred pages in this volume.It seems Hobbes intent was to refute the conscience, and instead say that everything was an opinion of the person wishing to act ever which way. This would be false however, because Hobbes himself is an exception to his rule for he has set himself up in the role of The Great Observer, or God.In any which way, it was an interesting read and I recommend it for those who are looking for Order within the chaos.I also recommmend in relation to this book is Joseph Butler's book Five Sermons, edited by Stephen Darwall, which stands as a refutation of some of Hobbes ideas and was written in the very ealry 1700s."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"I assert that this work of Thomas Hobbes is amazing.

If you like thick political philosophy, you may enjoy this though. Unlike most political works, you should not feel compelled to agree with everything Hobbes states, as it is quite a difficult sell. But he is very enjoyable, unless of coarse you are an eternal optimist or true-blue believer in democracy.Although vilified by most for his extreme view of an all powerful head of state governing over the cruel and devilish populace, Hobbes creates a senerio that I think most would agree with in some way or form. People, left to their own devices, will inherently murder and steal from each other to the point that civilized life becomes unbearable. It's quite a world picture that Hobbes presents, and quite fascinating as well. The idea I believe Hobbes asks each person to explore is fundamental--what is the true nature of the individual? His answer in short is chilling--the individual is not to be trusted! While we can ask that education and high moral fiber dictate the peoples actions, do we really want to rely on the goodness of our neighbors, or do we want to keep a steady eye on them while holding fast to our sword?While I find it hard to believe any person would call themselves a die-hard Hobbesian, I think most people will find themselves answering in agreement to much that he has to say. After all, even many of the founding fathers feared the impulses of the masses and sought refuge in a powerful central government to keep the monsters at bay. Here's a tip: keep short notes while you read. Don't get caught up in all the details, and you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Three essential hallmarks of the Hobbesian system are important: the war of each against all, the role of human rationality in ending this; the use of knowledge/science as a basis for societal engineering. His view of the state of nature--that time before government and the state existed--is unsurprising when one understands that he was born in the year of the erstwhile invasion by the Spanish Armada (1588) and lived through civil turmoil and revolution in England throughout his life.Hobbes begins with a view of human life that would be inconceivable to the Greeks--life in a state of nature, the time before government, laws, and the state existed. In this state, humans are equal. In terms of physical prowess, of course, some are stronger than others. However, the weakest, through guile, can still kill the strongest. In that sense, there is equality. Without the power of government to keep people in check, though, we find quarrels routinely breaking out. The motives are threefold: self-gain, safety, and reputation (or glory). The result is horrible, and here follows perhaps the single most well known statement penned by Hobbes: \\"Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in a condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. . . .In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"However, the fear and terror of the state of nature can be escaped. Humans are, after all, according to Hobbes, capable of reason. Individual reason leads people to realize that they must do something to escape \\". . .Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them.\\" Furthermore, human reason allows individuals to understand laws of nature. This is defined by Hobbes as \\". . .a Precept, or general Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same.\\" To preserve life, and the fruits of industry that might be gained by peace, human reason lets people realize that only by giving up some of their freedoms, liberties, rights in order to establish a system that will end perpetual war of each against all. The mechanism for this is the \\"social contract,\\" by which people in the state of nature covenant with one another to form a powerful government, so powerful that it can suppress individuals' efforts to seek self-advantage as under the state of nature. A \\"Leviathan\\" is needed.However, if the state ceases to protect people's lives, the contract can be voided; revolution is an acceptable option for the citizenry then. However, the price is terrible, for with the dissolution of the state, people are plunged back into the nightmare of the state of nature. They would have to re-enact a contract to escape the ravages of the perpetual war.Key points in Hobbes: the focus is on the individual rather than society, hence this is an individualistic system; human reason is considered to be central to attaining peace and harmony; humans can perceive the essence of natural laws through the powers of their reason; by contracting with one another, the people can control their destinies and produce an environment which they find more commodious for living fruitfully. An important early work in the development of Modern thinking and liberal political thought. A must read work for those interested in Western political philosophy."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was born in England, a country that endured great political turmoil during his life. Having lived through that, Hobbes' main aim was to inquire into the basis of order. The question he asked himself was \\"What kind of political authority will prevent the return of chaos?\\". And the answer to that question is in this book, \\"Leviathan\\" (1651).The Levianthan is the personification of total power, an authority without limits, created by men who realise that absolute power given to a powerfull ruler (or to an assembly) is their only way out of the dangers of the state of nature. The name that the author chose for his monarch is quite telling: the Leviathan is a sea monster that appears in the Bible and symbolizes power. This kind of monarch seems like an extreme solution for the problem of anarchy, but it is the only one that Hobbes found. Without the Leviathan, life is 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.'Of course, this book includes many more things than those I have already mentioned. For instance, it explains quite well Hobbes opinion regarding human nature (man is naturally a wolf to men), the state of nature (perpetual war of all against all), the origin of political institutions and the relationship between reason and force (pacts without swords are merely words), among other things.On the whole, I think this book is a classic of Political Philosophy, and I recommend it as such. Despite that, I think a word of caution is in order, so you will be prepared for what you will find when you tackle \\"Leviathan\\". Truth to be told, sometimes Hobbes' prose is too dry, and in some chapters you will need to plod through some rather arid pages. Moreover, this book isn't written in modern English, what makes it more difficult to understand. Those are the reasons why I give this book four stars instead of five...Notwithstanding that, I believe that \\"Leviathan\\" is well-worth the effort of reading it, simply because it has some interesting concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them. The only way to discuss in a level play field with someone who has totally different ideas is to understand his arguments thoroughly, even if his position seems completely strange to you. I invite you to do that with Hobbes, reading \\"Leviathan\\".Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Hobbes' Leviathan is a great work of literature and political philosophy, but unless you need it in its original, seventeenth century dialect, the edition published by Great Books in Philosophy series by Prometheus Books is not recommended. The language is very difficult to comprehend in this edition and there are no notes to help with interpretation. Five stars for Hobbes, but one star for this edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"It seems a little dishonest to me for Norton not to reveal on the cover of this book that it is an abridged version. In fact, the only way to know that is to read the footnote in the Table of Contents, or the preface.It happens that, in my view, the Leviathan can use the abridging, and it is very possibly that you think so too. But readers should be told that before they buy. So I am telling you.I'm a bit disappointed with the secondary materials, too, but not quite disappointed enough to grouse about it too much. Still, it seems like the editors could have made up for all those lost pages in the main text to get more ambitious in the secondary materials.I still give it four stars because I like the abridged version."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"For those who dislike the archaic spelling in Hobbes, this edition with modernized text and spelling is the one for them. The opening sentence suffices to show the difference. The following is the original text:\\"Concerning the Thoughts of man, I will consider them first Singly, and afterwards in Trayne, or dependence upon one another.\\" (With Singly and Trayne in italics)The modernized text in this edition is:\\"Concerning the thoughts of man, I will consider them first singly, and afterwards in train, or dependence upon one another.\\" (No italics)There is a decent introduction by Gaskin, a bibliography, an index and explanatory notes, and this edition is very competitively priced.As a student at Oxford I chose an optional paper \\"Political theory from Hobbes\\". It was \\"from Hobbes\\" because modern political philosophy begins with him. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not consider the origins of government. In Hobbes we find concepts that became standard in political thought: human nature, state of nature, social contract, absolute and limited government, civil disobedience, censorship, etc.Hobbes supposes that organized society is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\" with both a \\"right of nature\\" and \\"laws of nature\\", but Hobbes uses the terms in an idiosyncratic way. The \\"right of nature\\" is \\"the liberty each man has, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own life\\" and doing anything that is necessary to achieve this. In addition there are a number of \\"laws of nature\\". The first dictates that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and the second is that each person should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These (and other laws that follow from them) are found by reason and are utilitarian rather than prudential. Morality does not enter into it. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing the same is the best means of self-preservation, even though this is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Men have the power of reason that suggests possible advantages of co-operation but this is outweighed by instinct. Men are competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability, so no one person or group can impose his will on others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Hence men are driven to create government via a pact in which all give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Very importantly, Hobbes assigns absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government is unworkable, for men are too quarrelsome and selfish and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Hobbes was influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War in which he lived. Among the ten rights Hobbes awards the sovereign the sixth is the power of censorship of opinions he deems harmful to the state. Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it is a source of conflict. As for anybody seeking to preach a new religion, he should be treated as a criminal. Hobbes was not a religious man but he could not avoid discussing the role of religion in the age in which he lived.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men consent to an absolute ruler in order to better secure self-preservation. If a situation arises where the sovereign fails to achieve that then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes observes that a criminal going to his execution retains his natural right to resist, but he is not saying it is a \\"moral\\" right, and in fact the sovereign is right to execute him. On conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's natural right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of the state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand the sacrifice of my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government. Those who prefer the original to this modernized text have many choices, including the Macpherson edition."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Hobbes's Leviathan is of course a major and essential work of modern Western political philosophy. But it comes in many different editions, which have different strengths and weaknesses (and which omit or include the full text and other relevant works).It is not at all helpful that Amazon lumps the reviews of these different editions together. From this amalgam, you cannot determine which is the best edition for you. I agree with Greg Taylor that the best unabridged paperback editions are published by Cambridge U Press and Hackett. For me, Norton Critical editions contains a good abridged text with excellent supplementary readings. For rich scholars, Oxford U Press has just published the definitive critical edition, edited by Noel Malcolm. There are many other editions -- examine them carefully. (Among other things, some modernize spelling, others don't.)"},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"Hobbes' thesis that the natural state of man is chaos and war is the primary justification he provides for an all encompassing authority to be placed unalterably in the hands of the Sovereign, or Leviathan. What he neglects to address is the absolutely corrupting influence such power has on the all too human Kings, Queens, and legislative bodies which hold such power over their fellow creatures.There is a saying that if men were were angels we would not need government, or if that angels administered man's government then we would not need to worry as to constraining them. But neither of these delusions can be ever be achieved by fallible man, no matter how much certain individuals may otherwise hope. You cannot legislate morality and you cannot make men charitable by forcing them to give. And much to the annoyance of Plato, no amount of education or cultural refinement can immunize man to the ever present threats of avarice, arrogance, and blind ambition. There must be checks on this power if men are to retain their hard-fought liberty and if the ultimate power of the government is to maintain its rightful abode with the People.As we in America have learned, there is a concept of government much more attuned to the particulars of human nature than the false bravado of Leviathan. It is limited government, where every individual choose for himself what he thinks is best, to the degree that he does not infringe on the natural rights of his fellows. Freedom of oppression from the government is our nation's calling card, and it has empowered and enriched man to a degree never before imagined. It seems that man's natural state, when guaranteed certain inalienable rights, was far flung indeed from an interminable warfare on his neighbors.So, Hobbes had a lot to learn but perhaps not the opportunity to do so. However, I did enjoy and learn much from him in his thorough and unbiased defense of his monarchical position using the Scriptures. He has an immense mastery of them, and cuts through some of the more confusing points of contention between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. He even goes so far as to address the varying degrees of heaven, the existence (or not) of an everlasting Hell, and Baptism for the Dead. It provided me with an excellent base from which to further understand the faith of the early American colonists and the churches they established in the lead-up to the American Revolution.Still, this is one of the more difficult books on this subject I've yet to slog through and so be warned that you may want to start with some lighter tomes on this subject."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"It normally takes me 2 weeks to finish a book considering that life must be lived. For whatever reason, \\"Leviathan\\" took me nearly 2 months. I think I can attribute it mostly to the fact that what I expected to read was not what I did read. I expected \\"Leviathan\\" to be a secular treatise on government. Instead, \\"Leviathan\\" read as a Christian indicting the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Not that I have an issue with that, but I order my reading list in a special way and my mood was set on government not religion at the time.I have no authority or scholarship in regards to philosophy. I am simply an enthusiast. I had general knowledge of Thomas Hobbes prior to reading this book. Many scholars claim that Hobbes was a secular absolutist, materialist, agnostic, or perhaps an atheist. If they were reading \\"Leviathan\\" to gather this information, I do believe there would be a significant amount of proof to say otherwise.Leviathan is Hobbes' \\"Utopia.\\" It is indeed absolutist, but it is voluntary absolutism, and in no way secular. He refers to it as his Christian-Commonwealth numerous times. His knowledge and application of scripture is impeccable. I take no offense to Hobbes' vision, being an Anarcho-Capitalist-Voluntaryist-Minarchist-leaning Libertarian, because Hobbes' vision is voluntary for the most part. He is by no means a one-worlder. He believes that there should be multiple common-wealths and that they should form according to each common-wealths' desires. Enter his disdain for the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. He makes some incredible and withstanding accusations against the Church and its desire for world domination.Leviathan is a Christian-Commonwealth in which the people contract their governing to a King. A King who is chosen by them voluntarily. He makes some compelling arguments as to why there should be a monarch as opposed to a legislature. He believes a monarch would care for the people like his own and the legislature would simply sell the people out for self-aggrandizement. History has shown that tyranny is capable by any means of government though, especially by monarchy. He seems a bit dichotomous in his beliefs. On one hand, he believes that man can not be left too much liberty because man is always trying to supplant his neighbor for his own gain. On the other hand, his Christian-Commonwealth would essentially require that every man be a Christian and even the monarch be a Christian. Yet, if everyone lived by Christian ideals, namely the Golden Rule, then there would be no need for government or monarchs at all, hence full liberty which he finds to be dangerous.I was disappointed that two major issues of Leviathan were not discussed. First, sure the initial generation may voluntarily contract their rights to a monarch, but what about their children? Their children would now live under the authority of an individual with whom they never consented. Secondly, what about non-Christians? The monarch is a Christian. He would be the leader over both the State and the Church. In fact, according to Hobbes the State is the Church. What would be expected of or provided to non-Christians in a Christian State?I've definitely read worst than Hobbes. I've definitely read better than Hobbes. I give him proper respect for his writing style. It was incredibly unique and entertaining. As an ex-Catholic, I thoroughly enjoyed his connecting the Roman Catholic Church to the Heathen cults of the former empire. (My apologies to any Catholics reading this, I'm not trying to be incendiary, but honest). I did feel there was much lacking in respect to Leviathan, my whole purpose for reading. If you're looking for arguments against the Catholic Church (which could be used even today) then this would be a great read. If you're looking for a philosopher's vision of utopia and the machinations of government, this will probably bore you to tears."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"this book came quickly to my place and the book was great quality as well"},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"First a word about the edition that I read. It was the Oxford World's Classics paperback. It claims to have modernized the spelling. I don't know about you, but as far as I am concerned doth, hath, belongeth is not modern. It wouldn't have been very hard for them to change it to does, has and belongs. Many people complain about the way it was written, making it hard to read. I found that if you read the difficult parts aloud, as if you were giving a lecture, they are easier to understand the first time through. Definitely not for speed-readers.Hobbes was a remarkable man. He published Leviathan when he was in his early 60's. For someone of his age he was very much in tune with the science of his day. One can only speculate that if he were to have been born 400 years later, with modern science at hand, he would have been considered the greatest philosopher of all time.The first part of his book, \\"Of Man\\" goes about providing definitions of what must be virtually all of humankinds various behaviours and emotions. He also goes on to define what is basic human nature. It is here, without the benefit of modern science, where his philosophy, indeed the cornerstone of his philosophy, gets off on the wrong foot. Thanks to modern archaeology we know that humans are not solitary creatures by nature, but social animals.In the second part of his book \\"Of Commonwealth\\" he spells out why we form commonwealths, and how a commonwealth should run. Again he is very thorough in looking at all aspects of a government and what it needs to do. He defines the power of the sovereign, the making of laws, the consequences of breaking these laws, and where the sovereign gets authority to carry out the consequences. I felt that he gave the sovereign far too much power, and he is there, it would seem, for life. The people only make covenants between themselves that this person or peoples are to be sovereign. Once a sovereign is declared, there is no covenant, or constitution, between the people and the sovereign; the sovereign is given Carte Blanche powers. One must remember that this book was written while Hobbes was in \\"exile\\" in Paris during the English civil war and the subsequent government of Cromwell. And while he is careful to call the sovereign \\"a person or assembly of people\\" it is quite obvious that he prefers the singular.The third part of the book \\"Of a Christian Commonwealth\\" was for a large part just skimmed over by me. Some people suggest that Hobbes, because of some of the things he says in the first half of the book, was really an atheist. They say that he wrote this to fool the church to thinking otherwise of him. After skimming through this part I feel that Hobbes was more likely a reformer, someone who definitely believed in God but didn't agree with the way the church and the Pope were behaving back then. I myself am an atheist and cannot imagine writing so copiously on a subject that I do not believe in, never mind doing all of the Biblical research that Hobbes must have.The fourth part, and the conclusion really don't have much to say. He is busy blasting the Pope, the Catholic Church and Aristotle.All in all some good philosophical points. His definitions of free will and spirit I think should be more widely taught. The fact that this edition could have been modernized a bit more, as well as the last half of the book being pretty useless today, leads me to give it three stars."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"OK, first off, skip the ENTIRE BEGINNING SECTION of this book - it is perfectly pointless today. In it, Hobbes is basically trying to do away with the concept of an immortal soul, thereby creating an atheistic society that cares nothing for religious matters. Hobbes is NOT known for his Philosophy of Mind.What everyone remembers about Leviathan is Hobbes' terse, cynical, and on-the-money observation that life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" Of course, what he means by this is life in the State of Nature. In order to try to make life a little better, man comes together to form societies.So far, so good. What most people take exception to is the kind of Social Contract that Hobbes endorses. Hobbes says that a society should come together to form a Social Contract in which everyone is OBEY THE SOVEREIGN UNCONDITIONALLY NO MATTER WHAT. Here's the kicker, the sovereign or king himself exists OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND IS NOT BOUND BY IT. In other words, the sovereign can do whatever he likes and the people must obey his commands no matter how cruel or ridiculous.Now, Hobbes was really trying to be more reasonable than he sounds. He lived at a time when England had spent years torn apart by constant war. He was also a self-professed coward: \\"Fear and I were born twins.\\" Basically, what he wanted was an end to war at all costs. For him, that meant obeying a STRONG RULER - in his case, Oliver Cromwell. The second section is addressed to the people trying to make them understand why this is in their best interests.The last section is addressed to the sovereign himself. Yes, he says, you can be a tyrant and do anything you want, BUT that will only cause you more trouble than it's worth. I have some advice for you to follow. Hobbes then goes on to RECOMMEND ways in which the sovereign could be a good ruler.In the end, Hobbes thought he was being an eminently practical man. To him, the \\"natural rights theorists\\" would just be talking nonsense."},{"Title":"Leviathan or the Matter,Forme and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical Civil","review":"This book of Thomas Hobbes is surely a groundbreaking innovation in philosophy, especially political philosophy. It presents a comprehensive worldview based on mechanistic principles, and constructs a coherent theory on governance. Though I do not agree with his conclusion, the premises and arguments he uses is very useful and can give us tools and guidance for our own philosophical and political discourse. Only thing that prevents me from giving the book a higher rating is that Hobbes' language is extremely dry and boring, something characteristic of British philosophy. I found the same problem in reading John Locke and John Stuart Mill (who were both liberals and opposed to the ideas of Hobbes), the two philosophers of similar era to whom I have much admiration. It is hard to imagine that in a country that produced Shakespeare and Dickens must use such dreary language in philosophizing. My political science professor lectured that Hobbes' ideas were strongly influenced by Machiavelli, which I somewhat would agree.

But then it gets interest in as the whole rest of the book is about reconciling religion with government, saying that no man should be legally bound by the religious visions of another."},{"Title":"In the Shadow of the Gourd","review":"This book came to me as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows both me and the author. I met the author, Malcolm Glass, when we were students in college. Over the years Malcolm has sent me poems to commemorate events in my life - confirmation, ordination to the priesthood. Often I had looked for his name in anthologies. Now, at last, I find his published works.The author, Malcolm Glass, has been a teacher (at Austin Peay University, Clarkesville, Tennessee, since the 1960's) and poet (since at least the 1940's), husband, father, churchman, traveler.This book gave me a delightful reunion with Malcolm and an opportunity to catch up on what had been going on in his life - death of his father-in-law, Henry Jesse Davis (To the River), and recalling Aggie (Going Back) both of whom I had met.Remembering across the years and catching up brings us face-to-face with our own mortality and the transitoriness of events. But remembering &quot;In the Shadow of the Gourd&quot; (the title is from one of the poems about the true story of James Bartley who was actually swallowed by a whale, like Jonah, and survived) is to reconnect with life-changing events. In &quot;Witnessing&quot; we are shown the effects of horrific experiences witnessed by innocent bystanders. In &quot;Harris Tweed&quot; a grandfather is recalled when the author puts on the sport coat he inherited.In this remembering we find events transformed into the kind of images which shape us and define us throughout our lives. With &quot;In the Shadow of the Gourd&quot;, Malcolm Glass has done the work of a poet: to take ordinary events and lift them up to the level of art. There we may come to know ourselves as more than mere accidents of nature or pawns of those who might seem more powerful and more important than ourselves. In the art of the poet we are given our rightful place as participants in a larger life.In the tradition of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer prayers are offered for the dead, those who have been granted &quot;an entrance in to the land of light and joy, in the fellowship of [God's] saints&quot;. The work of the poet is to open for the living gates of a larger life in the fellowship of a vast communion of persons. Malcolm Glass has done this. Thank you, Malcolm."},{"Title":"Odyssey Fulfilled","review":"A few years ago, Alfonso Morales, professor at Los Angeles City College reviewed this book. He wrote in part:Odyssey Fulfilled concludes Roger R. Fern&aacute;ndez' autobiographical trilogy. In this work, the author hurls once more a challenge to explore the planet... and... sketches once again a pleasant painting of each region he visits and presents the culture through the keen eye of an attentive and fascinated traveler... He also splashes his work with quotations from writers who have left written opinions on the art of traveling, creating a sort of universal time frame where the future appears to be defined by the past. In this context, he painfully contemplates with a deeply felt sense of patriotism how the Twin Towers of New York, once marvels of engineering and dexterity, became on that infamous day of September 11, 2001, mausoleums of perfidy and tombs of innocent victims of terrorism.In this new work, Fern&aacute;ndez advises readers to elevate their sights. He considers traveling as an escape of enchantment as he shows relaxing in an undisturbed and sunny beach of Labadee in the Caribbean and his charming descriptions of the awe inspiring Sounds in New Zealand.For readers in love with nature and the desire to travel, Odyssey Fulfilled can very well be the enchanting book they are looking for. In it, they will perhaps appreciate the gift of evoking places, people and environments, from the idyllic pastoral calm of a fertile valley to the desolated panorama and the dreadful sounds of war. Nevertheless, an indescribable steam of charm and satisfaction seems to refresh and cheer the narration. But what thrills the reader's fancy, above all, are the detailed accounts of the author's trips throughout the world, which with enthusiasm and passion he takes delight in describing."},{"Title":"Focused Riding","review":"This book was a pleasure to read is the type of book for the good and keen equestrian.

He forms the character well with the setting. For example how she is just a teenage girl and changes at a rapid speed from her surroundings.

How would you react if you suddenly started believing, for no tangible reason, someone you had known your whole life was no longer that person? Finney handles this very well. And there is a clever scene near the end that no one has filmed, as far as I know, involving skeletons.The film that follows this most faithfully is the 50s version, no surprise, but with a different ending. I'm not sure if fans of the film will like or be disappointed with the novel's ending. But I won't ruin it.The 1978 version with Donald Sutherland is to me the best version, though it does not follow this novel hardly at all, just the basic premise."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"This is, arguably, Jack Finney's (1911-1995) best novel.

Surprisingly, the book's ending is more optimistic than the original movie's ending. Any movie fan will remember Kevin McCarthy looking into the camera and warning everyone about the Snatchers coming after them. Well, the book is different. Finney does a good job of keeping you reading with a first-person narrative style that is both enjoyable and entertaining. A good book to read for a few days. The plot, as most people know, is filled with paranoia and explores what really makes a human being a human being. Emotion is at the top of the list. I suggest you read the book and then rent one of the three movies made based on the book. The original 1950s movie is probably closest to the plot of the book. Have fun.

I read it on a whim, knowing the classic name, but having no idea what it was the book was about. I found a science-fiction horror story that has held up well over the years, playing on such basic human fears that it seems timeless. Beyond that, it's fun as you read to take note of how many more recent science fiction and horror stories have borrowed from, or clearly been influenced by, this classic. (I saw plenty of X-Files episodes in here).Jack Finney does a really nice job of conjuring fear in the reader solely through the use of straight-forward language and wording, describing feelings and situations to which any reader can relate. Very rarely does Finney resort to the use of a frantic description of action, or overblown drama in order to create a sense of fear. The result of his restrained descriptions is that much more effective because of the calmness with which he writes.Despite the fact that Finney doesn't pack in a slew of action and drama, the story keeps you turning the pages, anxious to find out what the protagonists will uncover next. Finney doles out the facts at a perfect pace to keep the story moving quickly.If you know the name of this book, but don't know what it's about, give it a read. You'll find a good story, written well and get to play the game of recognizing the inspiration for a lot of today's science fiction and horror.

Thanks to multiple movie adaptations, and the descriptive title, the storyline here is probably familiar to most. Strange aliens invade small town and slowly and systematically take over the bodies of the unsuspecting inhabitants. The invasion is methodical, deliberate, and non-violent. Our protagonist and his delicious love-interest trip across the invasion, and become mankind's last hope of resistance before a complete invasion of the world is inevitable.The overriding sense of suspicion, doubt and anxiety that was typical of Cold War fantasy literature pervades this book. Also, Finney, speaking in the first person through the voice of a Mill Valley family physician, wrote with a rye sense of humor. The plot itself is a bit absurd, from the improbable contained invasion of Marin County's jewel town to the ease with which our heroes turn back the invasion. It is hard to understand how our chief protagonist can remain such a horny SOB during civilization's darkest hour. There are gaps in the plot too - like what exactly happens to the 'old' human body when the alien duplicate body takes over?Be advised, the book bears little resemblance to the 'modern' movie version with Donald Sutherland. That makes reading the book more worthwhile. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"&quot;Pod people&quot; is now a part of our collective imagery, so I wanted to read the story that gave origin to it. How to describe the mixed feelings I had? Mr. Finney's writing is so dull, it made me at times want to put the book away. The characters behave pretty much as if they were in a 50's sitcom suddenly gone wrong (that corny). And yet...And yet the premise itself is able to stand out from all this hodgepodge. If, as me, you have seen the first two movie versions, forget about them. Finney's invaders have dark motives that place them apart from the &quot;absolute control&quot; freaks in those films. They are still vigent after all these years.Read it, and see for yourself why this tale has stuck around."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Has someone you know been acting strangely lately? Nothing you can put your finger on, just.... Maybe your husband's stopped yelling at the kids? Don't assume it's nothing. More than likely, his body's been replicated cell by cell, down to *almost* the last detail, as part of an attempt by extra-terrestrial pod creatures to take over the earth.Or maybe not. The point is, you've seen the movie, maybe even the *movies*--the original 1956 film (with Kevin McCarthy) was remade in both 1978 (with Donald Sutherland and Leonard Nimoy) and (less successfully) 1993. Now it's time to read the book.Jack Finney's classic science fiction novel, first published in 1954, is a fast-paced thriller that will keep you up reading late into the night. The prose is light; the plot is unbeatable. And you never know: just because you've seen the movies doesn't mean you know how the book's gonna end.P.S. Another must read is Finney's haunting novel Time and Again, a book that will have you believing that time travel is wholly possible.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"I wanted the original version and was a little disappointed to find out this wasn't it. According to the inside of the book the original was published in 1954 in a magazine, with an expanded edition following in 1955. This revised edition was published in 1978 (presumably to accompany the release of the 2nd movie version). I do wonder how much was really changed though. Aside from dates, references to 70's model cars and jogging, not much is there to distinguish from the 1950's.I've loved this story since seeing the 1956 film version as a kid. If you've seen that movie you'll find the feel of this book much the same. The only major differences come towards the end where we are given much more insight into the aliens and their motives, and a finish that is different from any of the theatrical versions.Easily a five star story aided much by Finney's conversational prose. If you liked any of the movie versions it's worth reading the book."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Dr Miles Bennell, a general practitioner in a quiet California town, notices a strange psychological epidemic. People begin believing that their loved ones aren't really their loved ones. And then he finds the seed pods...This is a brilliant suspense thriller from the 1950s. I listened to the audiobook performed by Kristoffer Tabori, published by Blackstone Audio [and available here under the \\"Audio CD\\" edition]. Tabori was the perfect narrator: he really made the story come alive. I couldn't put my mp3 player down! And to boot, Tabori's father directed the original film and the audiobook includes an interesting interview at the end with Tabori about his father's film.I listened to this during a business trip to Brazil and it was perfect escape listening. Only at one point did the characters make a ludicrous decision (like when people split up in horror movies); incidentally that part was cut from the original movie. And in this \\"updated\\" version, the date of the action is moved to the 1970s, even though it seems little else is updated, including the gender roles which feel very 1950s. The ending was a little quick; I had to listen to it twice to catch all that happened, and even so I have a couple of questions. But if you can handle that, What a ride! I loved this and immediately sent off for the 1950s movie. Highly recommended: the funnest audiobook I've listened to in months!Note on potentially objectionable content: a smattering of \\"light\\" profanity, 1950s gender roles, and it's Very Scary."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"This is a wonderfully inventive story that has spawned three films. Well written, the book tells the tale of a small town through the eyes of its young doctor, Miles Bennell. It seems the town is undergoing a drastic change which is as subtle as it is deadly. It seems that all the townspeople are not what they seem. They look the same. They sound the same. Their memories are intact. Still, they are just not the same.Those who have noticed this, suddenly end up retracting their concerns days later. Something is not right in the town of Mills Valley, and Dr, Bennell knows it. Those large seed pods that are suddenly showing up every where are at the root of it. Their unearthly presence is connected to the profound changes that the people of Mills Valley are undergoing, and Dr. Bennell will stop at nothing to save his beloved town and the world from the invasion of the body snatchers.This is a great story by a wonderfully inventive writer. Jack Finney is a masterful story teller. He expertly weaves a tale that will keep the reader riveted to the pages of this book. It is no wonder that four films based upon this book have been made, \\"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (1956), The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Body Snatchers (1994), and The Invasion (2007). All four are worth watching, although some are better than others."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"_Invasion of the Body Snatchers_, first published in 1954, is a bizarre science fiction novel by author Jack Finney (1911 - 1995) which recounts a strange story in which alien life-forms in the form of plant-like pods come down to earth and take over the bodies of people in a small town. Several important sub-themes run through this novel, including the theme of sexuality and paranoia expressed in the main character, a divorced doctor Miles Bennell. The book was written during a time of extreme paranoid in the United States resulting from the ensuing Cold War and as such this book may attempt to capture some of that paranoia in the story. The book shows a town completely overcome with alien beings taking over the bodies and minds of its denizens, a town in which isolationism and paranoia prevails. The book also features a frank discussion of sexuality with divorced characters being a rarity in the 1950s. Throughout the book one can feel the eerie atmosphere in which no one is as they seem and in which an entire town becomes overtaken by alien beings. The book also shows the limits of scientific knowledge, arguing that much occurs in the world which we cannot currently understand but which is quietly (or arrogantly!) dismissed by the scientific community and society at large. The book also shows the fear of people with nowhere to turn as they try to contact the president and \\"higher authorities\\" in Washington, D. C. only to be passed over as unimportant. The book also features a central theory concerning the origin of life on earth, in which pods from distant planets travel through space propelled by the force of light itself and make their way to earth. Once on earth, these parasitic pods develop the ability to mimic any life-form they find (and in particular the human race). In many ways, the alien invasion may be seen as a communist or collectivist conspiracy against the existing order, in which the perils of communism are taken up by the people at large.This story begins in the small town of Mill Valley, California with divorced doctor Miles Bennell and his initial encounter with Becky Driscoll (his girlfriend who also happens to be divorced). Becky tells Miles that her cousin Wilma has developed a most curious delusion in which she believes that her Uncle Ira is no longer himself but an imposter. However, when prompted Wilma is simply unable to provide any evidence to support this claim other than the fact that she believes he appears to be reciting memories by rote without any true feeling or emotion. Miles decides to consult a psychiatrist about the situation and thus contacts his friend Dr. Manfred (Mannie) Kaufman. Dr. Kaufman promises to examine Wilma the next day. The next day however, Miles finds more patients in his office claiming similar bizarre occurrences in which they believe their relatives, friends, or neighbors are not themselves but have been replaced by exact duplicate imposters. The story also involves the writer Jack Belicec and his wife Theodora who have found a mysterious body in their basement. However, this body appears to be a \\"blank\\" in that it has no fingerprints or features but appears to be slowly taking on the features of Jack. Thus, begins a disturbing tale in which the town is slowly overtaken by these mysterious doubles. Mannie will later come back to explain the origin and nature of delusions attempting to provide a scientific and \\"rationalist\\" explanation for the occurrences. Mannie argues that throughout history there have been occasional outbreaks of mass delusion and that this can be explained similarly. However, Miles and Jack do not buy into Mannie's interpretation of events and after perusing through Jack's collection of strange newspaper stories and re-examining certain evidence conclude that the body snatchers are real. The rest of the story features Miles, Jack, Becky, and Theodora trying to make their way through the town, as the paranoia sets in. The inhabitants of the town become increasingly uncaring and upkeep falls. Towards the end of the story, Miles and Becky set out to see Professor Budlong who offers an interpretation of events though he originally had held that the pods were from outer space. The story unravels in a most disturbing manner as Jack and Becky must ultimately face the entire town as their \\"enemies\\" knowing that they cannot fall asleep or else they will be overtaken by the body snatchers. Ultimately they must decide to fight against the body snatchers even though the supposed change is not felt, because once the change has occurred the important components of what makes one human (the ability to feel and have emotion) are gone.This book was subsequently made into a series of movies which attempted to express various aspects of the story and the paranoia involved. The story shows people attempting to survive in a world increasingly fraught with danger while outbreaks of mass delusion occur all around. As such, this novel is important for what it has to say about the modern world and American society during and following the Cold War. It is to be recommended not only as a good story but also as a tale that will make the reader think about the nature of delusion and reality itself as well as the world in which we live."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"It's no wonder this book is a classic. Even though it's a bit dated in terms of some specific content, it's still a taunt thriller filled with paranoia and suspense. The story takes place in Mill Valley, a quiet little town in northern California. Dr. Miles Bennell and his friend Becky stumble upon a sinister plot by aliens who are exactly duplicating the people in the town down to the smallest detail except they have no soul, no emotion. They begin to think they're part of a larger psychotic delusion but discover the truth. Running for their lives their situation seems hopeless. The attention to detail and character development is excellent and the dialog is just superb. Even if you're not a fan of science fiction this book is a page turner and must read. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"\\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" is the science fiction tale that has inspired at least three movies. It explores the classic paranoid thought that everybody else is not what they seem and takes it to the ultimate paranoid conclusion: they're all out to get you.Parts of the book have become a little dated (doctors make house calls, operators still get on the line with people making phone calls), but this is not science fiction that relies on gizmos and technology. This book is driven by the terror of friends and neighbors being replaced by emotionless pod people. I can think of very few science fiction novels from the 1950s that have held up this well.Fifty years later \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" is still a fast-paced, interesting read. And just so you know, none of the movies ends quite like the original story."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"This was first published as a short story in 1954 'Collier's' magazine, then expanded into a novel in 1955. This is the 1978 version. It was made into a film in 1956, 1978, and in 2007. A good story bears repeating, like those 'James Bond' films.Dr. Miles Bennell, M.D. practices in Mill Valley California. His father has a successful practice in this town. Late at night Becky Driscoll asks him to talk to her cousin Wilma, who believes her Uncle Ira is somehow \\"different\\". Becky was his teenage girlfriend. Miles was married and divorced at age 28. Doctor Miles can see nothing strange in retired Ira Lentz. But Wilma, a middle-aged spinster, is convinced he is an impostor. Dr. Miles tells Wilma it is impossible for two people to look exactly alike, even identical twins can be identified by close friends. Wilma's belief must be wrong. Wilma says the difference is in the emotions. Aunt Aleda has also changed. Dr. Miles suggests a psychiatrist.The next morning Dr. Miles has a patient who ways her husband was somehow different. Over the next couple of days five more patients arrive with the same complaint. He learns another doctor has patients with the same complaint. How can nine people suddenly and simultaneously acquire identical delusions? Then Dr. Miles makes a house call. There is a strange object on a table in the basement! [The title gives away the secret.] Even if you think you know how it turns out you'll still find this novel very interesting. You can compare this novel to the filmed versions. Chapter Seven has a lesson on mass hysteria, or the unreliability of eyewitnesses. (You may figure out the reasons behind this lecture!) Chapter Eight warns about believing in strange stories printed in a newspaper. [They had weekly tabloids in those days.]There are some false notes. People living in a rural area would likely have a dog; their keen sense of smell might detect differences in a person. People would have firearms handy. A small-town doctor who was divorced would be an oddity in 1955. Can a telephone call to Washington solve a local problem? One big problem is disposing of the bodies of the replaced people. That is always a problem in the real world. It would also be unusual for a doctor to have a separate office from his home in the 1950s. The most difficult problem is the physical impossibility of a vegetable to become an ambulatory animal. H.G. Wells' \\"War of the Worlds\\" had a better ending. This novel would be better if the aliens were damaged by the pollution in the air, water, and earth. \\"It's only a story.\\""},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"I have always said that the movie is never as good as the book, but I may make an exception here. Finney's story 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' has been a favorite for many years. Everyone knows the story: people in a small California town are not what they seem to be. People are being replaced by some type of alien that looks and acts just like the real thing. Finney's original story is still gripping, suspense-filled reading fun, and I enjoyed it a lot. The edition I read had many references to the year being 1976 and not in the 1950's (when it was actually written). I wondered if Finney doctored the book a bit to make it fit the 1978 remake. If so, I wish he hadn't. The atmosphere and feel of the book are all out of the 50's...the 70's references are out of place.In this case, I think the original 1956 film is slightly better. Some parts are different, many are similar, but the feel of the film probably made a better connection with film audiences of the 50's than the book did. I also think as far as the ending goes, less is better, which is what you get from the film. I thought the book explained a little too much, and for me, that took away part of the fun. Still, 'Invasion' the book still continues to be a science fiction favorite and deservedly so."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"This thrilling sci-fi book is full of suspense. The entire plot is eerie and once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down. There are pods and blanks and things that will boggle your mind. This book may even give you nightmares. You should really read this book. It's a page turner and great summer reading."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"This book was serialized in &quot;Collier's&quot; magazine in the 1950s, and for the six weeks or so that it ran many people could talk of nothing else. It was amazing. It was almost as big as the O.J. trial was in the '90s. I haven't read it in over 40 years, but thank goodness it introduced me to Jack Finney. You'll eat it up!"},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Well, it's a classic, and I love Jack Finney's Time novels, so I asked for it for Christmas. I suspect it's print on demand, because Chapter 13 was missing some pages and Chapter 14 started twice, but no matter. I enjoyed this as a slice of life in 1955, when it was written, although some of the non-feminist throwaway lines actually shocked me. We've come a long way since then. The novel is set in 1976, as imagined in 1955, which is fun. The concept is interesting, and the writing has enough tension and suspense to keep you reading.Clearly an early work, but I recommend it for sci-fi buffs, and people interested in American culture as a whole. Quick read (215 pages)."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"You might have seen any of the four films based on this book (if there are more than four, my bad). Just to clear anything up beforehand, the book is not only incredibly different from the most recent film, the version with Gabrielle Anwar, and the version with Donald Sutherland (still my favorite out of all the films, not counting the oldest, which I have yet to see), but I thought it was a surprisingly excellent thriller. I hear people mention the films all the time, but the book seems to be strangely overlooked.Enter Dr. Miles Bennell, whose old flame, Becky, walks into his office one day for a surprise \\"appointment\\" and instead tells Miles a strange story. One of Becky's family members claims that her uncle is not really her uncle. Miles goes to meet with the family and see if he can detect any difference, but thinks nothing of it. Later on, one person after another after another comes forward with the same story. These people say that their acquaintances and/or family members are not who they appear to be...I hate being spoiled on a story, and I also hate spoiling other readers, so let me just get down to what I thought about this read. Like I already said, this is an excellent thriller. Not only is it chilling at parts, but there is so much that the films (that I've seen, anyway) didn't include. It's one of those reads that I could have finished in one sitting simply because it's so interesting and surprising and disturbing as well.And, sitting here, writing this review, the only things I really want to mention are scenes that might spoil other readers, which I am not going to do. For some reason, this is one invasion story that doesn't get enough credit even though the movies based upon it get plenty. If anyone has ever wondered why the film from the 70's or the earliest film (I only know this because I've encountered so many who mention it) are held in such high regard, it's because both stem from a great story.Jack Finney's novel has chills and thrills. I found myself disturbed and curious and was very involved with the story from start to finish. Now, I did not read this particular edition, which I've heard other readers say they've had a few issues with. The edition I read is from the 70's, so you might want to be careful which edition you read. The only cons I can list about the book itself is that the characters don't always make the best decisions, and I felt like the ending was too abrupt and not as convincing as the author would have had the reader believe.All in all: I do feel like I've encountered a book I'd happily reread. Not only this, but I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the storyline. I'd prefer to give this one 4.5 stars, but, alas, this is impossible with Amazon, so 4 will have to suffice."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Invasion of the Body Snatchers / B002VACTHEI bought this audiobook on the recommendation of a friend and I'm still uncertain how to rate it, especially as I haven't rated the book text itself elsewhere. I'll try to address both here, the book content and the quality of the audio book.The audiobook itself is quite good. The narration is strong and does a lot to flesh out the narration voice -- indeed, I think the narrator manages to make an otherwise forgettable or even unlikeable character very sympathetic. The wry humor and deep weariness of the narrative voice comes through loud and clear, and it does a lot towards creating the atmosphere that this book is trying to evoke: when a major plot point is that the weary heroes cannot sleep or all will be lost, it's a plus to have a weary-sounding narrator. And it works very well as a whole.The book itself I'm less enthused over. I recognize that this is a book from the 1950s and was revolutionary in its own way, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it has aged well. There's some casual misogyny here that may be distracting to the reader, and the heroes don't always face their apocalypse very sensibly. Readers will figure out major plot points long before the characters do, which makes them sometimes seem willfully obtuse. (This is one of the unfortunate side-effects of modern readers being genre-savvy to this form of literature, I suppose.)Early in the stages of the apocalypse, the reasons given for why the heroes can't go to the authorities for help seem sort of flimsy, culminating at a point where they manage to call someone in Washington in order to register concern only to be talked out of it because, meh, it all seems kind of silly so nevermind. I get that this is supposed to be a commentary on the inefficient authorities against internal threats, but you'd think once you got through the phone lines, you'd at least TRY to register that stuff is about to go very, very badly.Overall, if you already know you enjoy this book, I think you'll be pleased with the audiobook version. If you've heard of the book because it was groundbreaking for its time, and if you don't mind some of the usual flaws of 1950s science fiction -- genre-ignorant characters and sometimes very slow pacing -- then you may well enjoy this book. I give it 3 stars for the text and 5 stars for the narration itself.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Well, now you've got to read the book.

All three are worth watching."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"3.5 out of 5 (spoiler alerts)As far as I am concerned, Campbell's \\"Who Goes There?\\" is a masterpiece of both suspense and logic. Though \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" takes the psychological element to a whole new level with theme of the imitation of society and its very intriguing anticommunist undertones (supposedly Finney did not intend any analogy), the story suffers from some very irritating and illogical scenes.One of them is extemely comic in its utter absurdity: the doctor sees a pod person developing and basically says \\"Here, guy, take this barbiturate so you can get your beauty sleep, while your distraught wife checks on the pod person once an hour throughout the night while it develops, so we can see who it turns into. If my theory is right it will turn into one of you. Call me in the morning.\\" And this the very night of the day when he had an impromptu meeting with three of his fellow doctors to discuss the strange imitator psychosis going around town.In another scene, he finds one developing into his girlfriend, but he is later convinced quite improbably, for a time, that it was just his imagination. (This is after seeing a fingerprintless pod person alongside several other witnesses.) In this and other scenes, the author's obsession with psychological discussion introduces contradictions and destroys the fourth wall, which diminishes any element of suspense.Overall, I did enjoy this book very mildly, and I think it is worth reading. But it also has other flaws.For one thing, unfortanately, this is the updated version from the '70s, rather than the original one from the '50s. Probably, there hasn't been too many changes: the names of cars and one rather random, glib, and bizzare reference to Roe vs. Wade are what I would guess.But there are also problems with the ending. Finney seems to steal his protagonists' salvation from the old short story \\"Time Needs a Skeleton.\\" Also, the upbeat ending feels a bit tacked on. From what I know of sci-fi history, I would say the editor of the original publication mag told the writer to give it a happy ending, and he was forced to comply. Not that I dislike happy endings, but I think the Donald Sutherland movie is a more consistant and more thought-provoking experience exactly because it doesn't have a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Pod people!

As it turns out what was originally thought to be a possible case of mass hysteria turns out to be an invasion of a sleepy town by pod-like aliens who then take over the populace's appearances and identities.Admittedly other reviewers summed this book up better than I, which I attribute partly to my not wanting to give any plot away (for those Amazonians that have not had the pleasure of reading this book yet), and partly because as one reviewer pointed out the alien invasion plot was hardly original even at the time of this title's publication. Writers of Finney's era seemed to thrive on metaphorically writing about the \\"red\\" threat of communism.Finney may not have been the first or last to write on the theme but he did an exceptional job re-visiting other author's alien plots and using his unique style and imagination to write perhaps the seminal novel on the subject. From the opening pages I was scared. Reading each paragraph with a mounting sense of dread as Finney did an excellent job pacing his novel.Certain scenes jumped out in this relatively thin tome(compared to some horror novels Body Snatchers is almost a novella with an economy of words to do the job of scaring readers) placed within the story for maximum effect. When Miles, and Jack discovered the \\"blank\\" slate of a body in Jack's basement I thought \\"oh sh*t\\" presumably as Finney intended I should.As stated this isn't longest horror novel ever and there was no need for it to have been. Finney uses the perfect amount of words to tell his open ended tale of alien takeover elegently and with such an influx of paranoia in the text I reflected upone completion \\"they sure don't write them like that anymore but I wish they did.\\"In summation a classic in the genre in the purest sense of the phrase."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"I had quite a good time with this novel. Even though there are now thousands of books about alien invasion, the plot of this one still remains original. Due to the nature of the aliens, which are indeed transmissible vegetable parasites (but I won't tell you more about them ;) ), the story does not contain the slightest violence: no serious fight, no bloody killing, no catastrophe. However, suspense, anxiety, mystery are at the rendezvous. Just imagine indeed what psychosis it would generate if there was a mortal epidemic of some sort in your immediate surrounding, epidemic that would pervert the mind. Think about the people you cross everyday, including your own family. Are they really safe? Can you trust them? Don't they plan to contaminate you? On the other hand, you can't eternally confine yourself at home. So, what can you do? It's exactly what the inhabitants of Mill Valley are confronted to, except that a very few of them will hazily suspect the nature of the epidemic; for the others, it will be too late. There are a lot of notable passages in this book. For instance, when Jack reads to Miles (the hero) and their wives his collection of newspaper clippings, all related to irrational events, it gives you the creeps, especially if you are still vividly aware of the context. It's crazy to see how this sequence adds to the malaise, even if the articles have nothing to do with their situation. Ahh, and the final face to face encounter in chapter 17 between Miles and the psychiatrist Mannie, then contaminated and no longer the same we knew at the beginning of the novel. I remember that fine piece of eloquence and philosophy: Miles still doesn't understand why the vegetables, the &quot;pollen&quot; in fact, came from so far away to poison terrestrial life and Mannie, softly, quietly, gives him a long but memorable speech in answer. I'd so much like to reproduce an extract of his words but late Mr Finney's editor would probably resent it -damn good old copyright ;) Beyond that, the author has a very good sense of humor. His character Jack Belicec is all but a self-caricature and he takes benefit of the opportunity to make self-publicity, his previous book &quot;Time and Again&quot; is even quoted! Don't worry, it spoils nothing. These were the positive points. Now, I confess 2 trifles prevents me from giving 5 stars. First, I think that sometimes Miles is too smart a hero. He figures things out a little too fast and unfortunately, I caught myself saying &quot;Mmm... he's too smart to be true.&quot; Second, Jack Finney's conception of man and woman relationship flirts a little with machismo, i.e the man is always acting and the woman is always screaming or crying, you known, that sort of thing. It's undoubtedly worthy of the 50's but this conception got old so badly that it has become a misconception so...

All three are worth watching."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Everyone knows about the movie adaptation of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" -- pod people, creepy takeover, lots of suspense. While the movie was good, the original novel is perhaps a more enjoyable story -- a creepy, tense novel that raises some intriguing questions about human nature.Dr. Miles Bennell receives an odd patient from his old ex-girlfriend Becky: Her cousin Wilma is making bizarre claims about her relatives. She claims that while they look, talk, dress and act just like Uncle Ira and Aunt Aleda, they are fakes. Miles talks with Wilma, but she doesn't show any typical signs of insanity. What's more, other people are insisting similar things about their friends and family -- that they seem just the same, but that they aren't themselves.Then things get more complicated. Miles's pal Jack and his wife Theodora have an \\"unfinished\\" person in their basement, a never-been-alive-and-not-living-now human being that is slowly turning into a duplicate of the real person. Growing out of alien pods that have migrated to our planet, the pod people are slowly and seductively working over the town -- and they will soon have the entire world.This now-classic SF book was published in the 1950s, before the advent of space opera and Star Wars. (It also has a noteworthy resemblance to Robert Heinlein's \\"Puppet Masters,\\" a similar book published four years before) Finney's book can be a bit dated in places -- for example the female characters are kind of wimpy -- they tend to get hysterical and follow the level-headed manly men. Fortunately these flaws are few and far between.The writing and dialogue are solid, not outstanding, but pretty good. It does raise some interesting questions about human nature: In one scene, Miles is offered a life without strife by the pod people, and quickly turns it around to reveal that not only would a world of pod people be doomed, but also would have no drive, no enjoyment, no real living as we know it. It would all be bland, with no suffering but also no pleasure. Finney's writing is probably at its peak there, especially given the cold, pleasant attitude of the pod people -- no mustache-twirling and cackling for these villains.As with many first-person narrators, Miles is not a fantastic character, but he does develop a certain strength and intelligence as the story goes on. Writer pal Jack is a bit more interesting -- I wonder if he was a sort of alter ego for Finney. Becky and Theodora have secondary roles, but are nevetherless fairly good. All other supporting characters, unfortunately, are pretty forgettable.Though the movie deviated strongly from the book, fans of that film might want to check the origjnal story out anyway. Interesting and pretty well-written, especially for fans of horror/SF."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"2004 marks the 50th anniversary of this classic science fiction novel's publication, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers remains firmly entrenched in pop culture and continues to exert a significant influence on the writers and filmmakers of today. Everyone has heard of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, no less than three film adaptations of the story have been produced, and the book itself remains in print and will surely remain so for the foreseeable future. What makes this story so popular? The answer to this question isn't so simple. While I think the novel is a thoroughly good, gripping read, there are a few elements of the plot and premise that I find fault with. In the grand scheme of things, these issues have little impact on the story, but I do believe that Finney's novel is not perfect.Of course, this is a story borne out of a culture of the 1950s seemingly obsessed (at least Hollywood was) with the idea of aliens coming to earth and, in most scenarios, arriving with hostile intentions. &quot;Aliens attack&quot; books and movies were a dime a dozen in those days, and most of them became variations on the same theme. The stories were new, but the ideas were well-established, going back at least as far as H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. Finney's premise was different than most, and it drew strength not only from its originality but from the political atmosphere of the time. America became quite paranoid in the decade after World War II; the Red Scare had many people observing their neighbors and associates and sometimes wondering if they might actually be Communists. America was preoccupied for some time with the dangers of an invisible, insidious threat within the nation's very midst. Invasion of the Body Snatchers played upon and drew from this type of internal self-doubt and paranoia, and I believe that is its true secret of success.Finney's &quot;aliens&quot; didn't blast down from the heavens and immediately begin attacking human beings; instead, they arrived silently and secretly - in the very midst of what was unassuming, small-town America, in the form of giant pods. Reports of these pod landings were reported but largely ignored, allowing the spores of alien life to begin their work in secret. The material inside the pods could completely replicate any life form, and thus was born the first &quot;changed&quot; human being. This &quot;new&quot; person looked and acted completely like the original and went about living that person's normal, every day life. The number of changed individuals quickly grew as each day passed. A few people began to sense that one or more of their friends or loved ones was somehow different, but it was all but impossible to prove such a thing to themselves, let alone others. Dr. Miles Bennell, the story's narrator, spoke to several such patients and dismissed their claims as some sort of psychological delusions - at first. His eyes were opened to the truth only when a friend chanced upon a developing replacement body in his home, and by this time virtually the whole town had been changed. Bennell and three other &quot;survivors&quot; were alone, trapped among friends who were no longer themselves, and their growing paranoia soon metastasized into true fright.What could be more unsettling than the fear that your neighbor, your co-worker, even your own spouse, parent, or child was no longer the person you had known all your life? Anyone and everyone was a potential threat, a secret agent conspiring with others to assimilate you, to rob you of everything you value most in life. External threats and the fears they invoke can be dealt with, set aside for short periods of time; nuclear attack is a horrifying nightmare, but it does not prevent you from leading your normal life in the present. The enemy within is always the most insidious threat, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the very embodiment of this most terrifying of fears."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is one of those novels that have become part of popular culture. This is due more to the fact that three movie adaptations have been filmed (by Don Siegel in 1956, Philip Kaufman in 1978, and Abel Ferrara in 1993), than it has to do with the overall quality of the novel itself. Surprisingly, given the B-movie theme, INVASION remains quite an entertaining read.The plot is far too well-known to bother repeating here. Suffice to say, people in a small town are being replaced with exact duplicates. Or are they? We all know the answer by now, but I won't ruin the surprise for those four people who don't know the ending.I think the reason this works so well is that the story never stops moving. It propels the characters along, not pausing for more than a cursory examination of their backgrounds. Which makes it ideal fodder for a movie. It reminds me of Stephen King's self-review of his novel THE RUNNING MAN. It may not be perfect, or subtle, but it MOVES.Granted, it is not perfect. Its examination of male/female relations seen slightly dated. The lead character makes conclusions that seem reasonable when you know the ending, but implausible when you don't.But the sense of paranoia is very real. The slow death of the town is eerie and palpable (I wouldn't be surprised if King has reread INVASION several times before penning his own ode to the death of a small town, SALEM'S LOT). And the ending actually is surprising, for people only familiar with the movies. All three movies have different endings, but the original is one that couldn't be explained to satisfaction on film. It would seem too abrupt. On the page, however, it is quite surprising. Even logical, which is a rare commodity for stories these days.INVASION is by no means a masterpiece of literature. But it is a fine example of pure storytelling."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"Most people know the movies based on this book: from the Kevin McCarthy version, to Donald Sutherland, to Gabrielle Anwar and Nicole Kidman, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is a good story for film. The original novel, while not everyone's cup of tea, is a more realistic look at what human beings would do if a silent invasion from outer space happened.(This edition is the 'updated' one, with the date allegedly 1976, although the world of the novel is straight 1950s, with weak women and conservative ideals.)The plot is simple: Dr. Miles Bennell practices in his hometown of Mill Valley, California. He becomes inundated, as other doctors in the area are, by patients claiming that their loved ones are somehow imposters...but the patients can't provide any concrete evidence. What's thought to be some sort of mass hysteria is actually quite different: when Miles' friend Jack and his wife Theodora find a strange body in their house, it becomes clear there's something extraordinary going on. Mill Valley has been invaded by 'pods', which replicate, then destroy, the inhabitants.There's a good slice of Cold War paranoia here; the 'pod people' claim that they are exactly like everyone else, but without the burden of emotion or ambition. One could say that the view of communism in this era, with its rejection of religion and what the West viewed as 'normal', as another way to describe these 'pod people'. Miles and his friends are struggling not just against a physical force, but an ideological one: Mill Valley is in a slow decay -- businesses close, the streets empty and dirty, the houses dilapidated. Unlike the film versions, the novel has a rather anticlimactic ending, which I won't spoil. Worth reading."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"The worst thing this book has going for it is that it has become such a fixture of popular culture people may feel they don't need to read it. This is a shame because it really is a great work of science-fiction/horror. One can debate the originality of the concept - it has been treated elsewhere, as in The Puppet Masters or \\"The Father-Thing,\\" yet this (I believe) is its most effective handling. This is, after all, the one with the \\"pod people.\\"Now the historicists (the goats) will say this book only matters in terms of cold war, red-scare hysteria. Not true. True, this book does have a 50's feel to it - in that the characters have an educated, witty, sensible, John Updikey feel to them. Yet, it is not a dated book. But the idea that this book can ONLY be read in terms of the red-menace is just wrong. In Danse Macabre, Jack Finney writes to Stephen King and tells him that there was no overt metaphor in the book. (King goes on to show how that Don Siegel--the director of the movie--did have a metaphor in mind, but critics got the opposite meaning.) The truth is that this story lends itself to such varying interpretations because THE FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IS SO DARNED SCARY. If this really happened, how could mankind defend itself?For those of you familiar with one or several movie version (and their knock-offs) you should still read the original book. (I believe it was originally titled The Body Snatchers.) You may be surprised at the differences between what you know and what you think you know. The ending may be quite different from what you were expecting. In any case, it will be time well-spent."},{"Title":"The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers","review":"I read this book in a single sitting, it was so good! True, I am a lover of science fiction, but Finney's sharp and precise writing skills really appealed to me. The book is quite different from the 1978 movie, but just as good. Two times whilst reading, my blood was chilled by the unnerving descriptions. When Finney writes, he really gets into character, and the result is amazng. You can actually feel the creeping horror and desperation of the characters, which only adds to the suspense and makes the ending all the more marvelous. A truly great classic!"},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"Charles Fillmore and the Unity movement which he co-founded has always urged individual thinking and stayed away from dogmatic beliefs, and as such, don't fit the definition or understanding of &quot;cult&quot;. However, his thinking is definitely non-traditional, and I don't recommend his books to fundamentalist, Biblical literalists.That said, this is definitely a book to read. It's not about material prosperity as such, but about over all prosperity in all areas of life. So if your primary aim to get filthy rich, this isn't for you. But if you are seeking a more fulfilling life, a greater understanding and closeness to the Great Power in our universe, and a mind-expanding, soul-enriching reading experience, I recommend this to you."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"I have read many books on Prosperity. This book pulled it together for me. I am on my 4th time reading it. Prosperity is about quality of life. Since reading this, my income and equity has exceeded in amounts to large to say.

At the end of each chapter are questions intended to help grasp the concepts. I found this to be helpful.

As an self-proclaimed spiritual seeker I found that this book is in line with other spiritual texts, that limitations, lack and scarcity, are created not outside of us but by our own self imposed restrictions and acceptence on what other people say we should have and what we cannot have. We are our own severest critic. We live in a world where rationality and logic are worshipped. If it does not have a scientific explanation...it's not real. Do yourself a favor, suspend this judgement and you will get the message of this book. The rest is up to you."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"According to Fillmore, the Divine is always ready to give. It has no choice in the matter; it must give, for that is its nature. It is ever the same, constant, abundant, freely circulating and available. Turn the great energy of your thinking toward \\"plenty:\\" ideas, and you will have plenty, regardless of what men about you are saying or doing. The Divine is persuaded and directed by intelligence. If you find yourself low of funds, Fillmore says, praise and bless whatever you have and imagine it growing larger. Talk only of prosperity and it will become your reality. Don't simply ask God for riches. Instead, like Solomon, the richest man of his age, ask for wisdom, for ideas. There is something very comforting and inspiring about Prosperity. It is the book to read when you feel overwhelmed by your financial problems, as it shows you that ultimately, the source of all wealth is immaterial.[...]"},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"I found this a good basic text for getting the spiritual and material aspects of enjoying abundance in a satisfying perspective."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"A must for anyone desiring to know and understand the pinciples of giving and receiving."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"This book speak the truth of truth's!

It's also a fascinating look at our beliefs about money and abundance and this will apply to most people, even today.Charles Fillmore was WAY ahead of this time on a number of things. Vegetarian before it was cool, etc. Even released this book without copyright, because he trusted he would be taken care of financially. A good number of lessons for everybody on the topics of trust and abundance.If you're into books like the Secret or biographies of successful and interesting people, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"I have now read all of Charles Fillmore's books and, hands down, this is his best work in my opinion. His thoughts flow from one idea to the next and his explanations are understandable (not the case with some of his other writings). Some of his language is dated, of course, but his thoughts are surprisingly modern.If you are familiar with some of the current prosperity teachers like Abraham (Money, and the Law of Attraction: Learning to Attract Wealth, Health, and Happiness[...]) then much of what Mr. Fillmore writes will feel amazingly similar; it is stunning to think he wrote this book nearly a century ago. He really was a mystic of sorts.The difference between Mr. Fillmore's book and today's prosperity teachers is that his offering is centered around the teachings of Jesus Christ (from a metaphysical and metaphorical, not a literal or historical, standpoint), rather than the more universal language of Abraham and others today.However, Mr. Fillmore began one of the most liberal churches in this country (Unity at [...]) and he is definitely not a biblical fundamentalist. So, if you what to gain a deeper understanding of the abundance and prosperity (in finances, health, relationships, etc.) in your life from a Christian oriented perspective, I highly recommend this book. I have read it once, and now I plan to go back through it with a highlighter. It is a book I expect to re-read many, many times.Mr. Fillmore's second best book, in my opinion, isJesus Christ Heals (Unity Classic Library). The biography of his lifeThe Spiritual Journey of Charles Fillmore: Discovering the Power Withinby Neal Vahle is also well worth reading."},{"Title":"Prosperity","review":"This is a short 12 chapter book that has done more to enlighten me to the true meaning of prosperity than ANY book I have ever read. The insight of Mr. Fillmore from 1932 to present is uncanny. I have a keen interest in Quantum Physics and Mr. Fillmore seems to have understood this science before its time.

It was loosely based upon the diary of Samuel Pepys, an English diarist who chronicled London life during the years of 1660-69, making observations about people and events with an amazing eye for the telling detail. Samuel Pepys described the great and the mundane, from concerts and dinners to the Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of 1666.Our Ducrot Pepys chronicled the adventures and misadventures of his righteous \\"sane wife\\" and his \\"other wife,\\" old West Point slang terms (pre West Point going co-ed in 1976)for roommates. As a member of the Class of 1944 that became the wartime emergency Class of June 1943, Ducrot Pepys eventually became \\"Mr. Yearling (West Point sophomore) Pepys,\\" then Cadet Pepys--Second Class (junior)\\" for five months, and finally \\"Cadet Pepys--First Class (senior)\\" for the remainder of his time at West Point. In all, 60 installments of the diary made it into print.In actuality, Ducrot Pepys was Ronan Calistus Grady, a cadet who grew up as a Navy junior (child of an active duty member of the U.S. Navy). \\"Grady,\\" as he was known to his friends, retired as an Army colonel, died in 1992, and is buried at West Point. He was awarded the Silver Star (for valor) and Purple Heart (for wounds) for WWII combat with the 17th Airborne Division, served in the old MAAG-RVN (military advisory assistance group in Viet Nam) as well as with MACV (Military Assistance Command-Viet Nam), and later spent time in South America. Although he is the main source of Ducrot Pepys, he was aided immeasurably in perpetrating the myth by classmate Lewis Frazer Webster, who drew a number of cartoons illustrating the foibles of Ducrot and his two roommates. Lewis, a WWII veteran of air combat, was killed in action as a lieutenant colonel in Korea on 8 January 1952 when, returning from flying his 98th combat mission of the war, he diverted to check out suspicious enemy activity on the ground.Some excerpts: Plebe Year. \\"Dropped my rifle at parade but with great presence of mind fell down after it.

Now, when I was a cadet, such things were not allowed. But times evidently have changed.\\"Just before Grady graduated, Roger Hilsman, cadet editor in chief of the POINTER, compiled The Collected Works of Ducrot Pepys, by Roman C. Grady, and had it published by the Moore Publishing Company, Inc., of Newburgh, NY, thus making Grady a latter-day Edgar Allen Poe. In late 1992, Hilsman acquired a mint condition copy and presented it to the West Point Museum in Grady's honor.Grady had agreed to revive Ducrot Pepys--most likely as an \\"old grad\\"--for the 50th Reunion of the Class of June 1943. Unfortunately, he died before he could accomplish the task. It is our double loss."},{"Title":"People of the deer (Seven Seas books)","review":"First published in 1947 and available in a wide variety of editions since then, Farley Mowat's first and most distant book is still remarkably readable in the world of the 21st century. It concerns one of the stranger human sagas of the last century, that of the discovery and destruction of a remote Inuit society, the Ihalmiut, in Canada's north. The setting of the book is far enough away in time for us to marvel at how little things have changed since. The contemptuous attitude of European man for the aborigine seems hardly to have altered over the years. We are still hard put to understand the needs of the first peoples and how to answer them.Farley Mowat has combined a fine sensitivity for the natural environment with a sharp eye for the details of man's place within it. It must be exceedingly rare in the history of anthropology that such an inexperienced investigator has taken such pains to get to the source of his information. Mowat lived among the Ihalmiut for over a year to write the book. During that time he witnessed the rapid deterioration of the small group which remained, and tried to examine the causes of their decline. With very deft prose for such a young writer, he points out the difference between the intentions and the actions of the European discoverers of The People (as they refer to themselves) and the consequences of such disparity. The Ihalmiut were exploited in much the same way as any other tribal band found wandering by the early explorers. However, as Mowat points out, this was an exceptional group which had survived the extreme rigours of a barren land (known to us simply as The Barrens) for so many generations, only to be felled by contact with the very race which might have provided them with so much assistance.The Ihalmiut are long gone from their homeland but their story serves to remind us of our often difficult relationship with the land and the people on it. Perhaps, as a race of city-dwellers, we need to consider our place in the natural environment more than ever. Mowat's work is a just accounting of where we stand in relationship to nature. Nor does he suggest that we should all go and live in the tundra. Yet People of the Deer is a source of considerable inspiration for those now ready to reflect on the unbalancing effect of contemporary values."},{"Title":"People of the deer (Seven Seas books)","review":"This book is magic.

We hear their tales of where they came from, how the animals were brought into the world by a woman, and how dangerous it is for men, both to their body and their soul, when they are all alone. Once there were thousands of them - sharing their tools, enjoying the raw meat of the kill, enjoying the happiness of never needing anything.Wonderful. Depressing. Sad. Lovely. Is there anything we can still do about this? Is there anything we can do for ourselves?"},{"Title":"People of the deer (Seven Seas books)","review":"Before reading this book, I would never have believed it would receive all 5 stars. However, it is truly beautifully written about the death of a people. The author - who lived with the tribe for 2 years to attempt to understand the people from their point of view - did an expert job of recanting what happened, how it happened. He makes a very determined attempt to see things differently than his point of view. My opinion is that he succeeds in doing so.Though a sociologist, the book is luridly written. It is easy for one to visualize what the writer is experiencing. In modern times, you'd expect such good writing from travel journalist/book writers. Here it is holey unexpected and appreciated.A wonderful book about the encroachment of modernization and it's mal-effects on an unsuspecting people.Finally, I always attempt to address the low star ratings in my own reviews. I'm not quite sure why someone would completely hate this book. The middle ratings appear to question the validity of the author's experience. While I am no expert on this topic, I would say that it might not matter if it's true. The message, particularly given it was written in 1947, is well conveyed. If you are an academic and hard-core sociologist, you might have an issue if there is some controversy surrounding the author's sincerity in methodology."},{"Title":"People of the deer (Seven Seas books)","review":"If you've read any of Farley Mowat's books, this one will excite you as much as any of the others.

It move within the people of the inuit. These inland eskimos are an indigeounous people whose population has been diminishing. The influence on the environment as well as the impact on the caribou herds has been putting these people at risk to where they now near extinction and a loss of their way of life.Beautifully written, the tundra and the barrens comes to life.A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"People of the deer (Seven Seas books)","review":"\\"People of the Deer\\" is apparently Farley Mowat's first book and one of his best. He lived for a year amongst the Ihalmiut, an Inuit people Mowat refers to as \\"People of the Deer\\" although they regarded themselves, as have many aborigonal people, as simple \\"The People.\\"They are people of the deer--caribou--because, unlike other Inuit groups they are not sea hunters but, instead predators of the migratory caribou herds. The herds have declined in numbers but not as much as the Ihalmiut. From a population high of around 7,000 they had, by Mowat's time, declined to only 40. Why? The impact of European Civilization is too simple of a generalization but, in the Ihalmiut, a people almost extinct, we see the fate of millions.Native Americans have little or no immunity to Old World diseases. You probably don't have to go much deeper than this. Sure there was alcohol and cultural deterioration but, first and foremost, there is disease. It wasn't deliberate but it came when the first white man and/or African stepped shore in the Americas. Probably the Inhalmiut were slightly luckier than many. Many tribes died out without a trace.

Some would argue, indeed, that Dylan is THE quissential cultural figure of the second half of the 20th century - recording undoubtedly some of the greatest albums ever put to tape, becoming, in the eyes of many, a composer for our times on par with Mozart and Beethoven, arguably the greatest, at the very least most infulential and far-reaching poet of the century, and mapping out emotional blueprints for an entire generation with songs like Blowin' In The Wind, The Times They Are A-Changin', Mr. Tambourine Man, Like A Rolling Stone, and Just Like A Woman. And, although he has since recorded albums every bit as good as his 60's highlights, - not least among them, his magnum opus Blood On The Tracks, and his 1998 Album of The Year, Time Out of Mind - his works from that time still stands as the absolute apex of a culture that was the most turbulent decade since the 20's. Rarely has an artist, at any time, been so in tune with the tenor of the times. This book chronicles Dylan's remarkable 60's period - from his, largely interpretative, debut album through his shocking move to country music with Nashville Skyline. It indeed has the &quot;stories behind every song&quot;, and it avoids stooping so low as to try and convey what the songs are &quot;about.&quot; Rather, this book, much more usefully, gives the background to the songs: how and when they came about, insight into the characters mentioned in them, and what woman, person, or particular muse the song may be referring to, or have been inspired by. There may not be a lot here that Dylanologist don't already know, but it is nevertheless a useful (not to mention beautiful - it's an immaculately laid-out book, with dozens of generous photographs peppered throughout), and nice to have a reference to all these early songs in one place. An absolutely essential book for Dylan fans."},{"Title":"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right -- Bob Dylan, the Early Years: The Stories Behind Every Song","review":"This was when Dylan was making groundbreaking music.

Graphic Novel: Meridian Magic - Book #2","review":"This is the second graphic novel in the W.I.T.C.H. series. It tells the same story as the third and fourth W.I.T.C.H. novels, Finding Meridian & The Fire of Friendship.In the first story, the guardians - Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin - learn that their math teacher, Mrs. Rudolph, is actually from Metamoor. Is she good or evil? Meanwhile Will is dealing with problems at home, as she suspects her recently divorced mother is dating one of her teachers, causing a strain in the mother-daughter relationship. As they continue to investigate the disappearance of their friend, Elyon, they search her house and discover it contains a portal to Metamoor. They travel there and find the city of Meridian, where Elyon is. When they refuse to join the side of Elyon, who has joined with Metamoor's evil ruler, Taranee is kidnapped and the other Guardians are forced to escape back to Earth without herIn the second story, the girls must carry on in Heatherfield while trying to come up with a plan to return to Meridian and rescue Taranee. There is tension as Cornelia blames Will for what happened to Taranee. Meanwhile Taranee is held in a magical prison where Elyon is deceiving her, making her believe her friends have forgotten her. When the other Guardians finally travel to Meridian, they discover new dangers in their search for Taranee.Readers of the W.I.T.C.H. novels are sure to love this graphic novel, which is just as good as the first graphic novel. I like the books, but I really love this comic version so much more. The art is really cute, and beautifully done, and I think the comic format is just so much better for telling this story. I can't wait until the next W.I.T.C.H. graphic novel is released, and I highly recommend this comic to all W.I.T.C.H fans."},{"Title":"W.I.T.C.H.

While they work out a plan, the group has created a living, breathing, thinking clone of Taranee. They decide to create one of each of them as they prepare to leave for Metamoor, but insecurities arise and Will's clone is left incomplete.

Graphic Novel: Meridian Magic - Book #2","review":"I had no idea what this book was about. Now of course I skim through comics if they're a bit boring, but this took me a while to figure out. I had to really read it. You can tell the Disney people are trying to get the money of manga-addicted tweens, but this art doesn't cut it. Sure it's adorable and I probably couldn't do better, but it looks like regular Disney drawings with bigger eyes. And the noses are weird, like pig noses. The baby in one of the drawings looks like an alien: please, Disney artists, don't draw any more W.I.T.C.H babies!!!! Overall, this book is O.K. I found that Will was too overdramatic--always fainting and going ballistic about leaving Taranee behind. Okay, I guess fainting all the time can suck, but really! You're not a soap opera star, kid. Manga purists would burn this in the bookstore, I bet. If you haven't read real Japanese manga, then this might be for you. If you have, then you're going to laugh at all the obvious rip-offs. I think I'll read the rest of the series, maybe I'll understand more. My fave characters are Irma and Will--but what kind of name is \\"Will\\" for a girl?? Also found Will too boy-crazy. Her astral drop was unbelievably stupid. I think Will should be smarter if she's the leader of the Veil Guardians or whatever. Anyway, it's a pretty good comic. Wouldn't recommend, but what the hey."},{"Title":"Reliquaries","review":"A RELIQUARY is a container for relics - the physical remains of saints, such as bones, pieces of clothing, or some object associated with saints or other religious figures. Photographer/performance artist Steven Arnold (1943-1994) was a genius at creating tableaux that were creations of pure fantasy, just happening to be centered around models. He was also a multi-media artist, spiritualist, gender bender, and creator of drawings, paintings sets for stage and film and wildly outrageous costumes.In this book of photographs all of these elements come into play. Using models in fanciful costumes Arnold created these images as a performance artist might create a live production, but Arnold froze them in time giving us this collection of winged creatures, spectacular props, and bizarre pantomimes of imagery only Steven Arnold could devise. There is a foreword by Ellen Burstyn who summarizes Arnold's work in the following way: 'STEVEN ARNOLD - Creator of these Baroque Tableaux is an artist who exercises his birthright, which is the expression of his own particularity of vision. A vision thrust forward by the agitation deep beneath the recesses of his chthonic cave. The cave ceiling lined with broken bits of reflecting devices in which we see new angles of men, of women, of glamour, angels, beauty, sex, fabrication, androgyny and exultation'. These reliquaries are created performances that are frozen on film for us - images of winged creatures, extravagant jewels, mythological echoes. For many these images are 'way over the top', but hat was Steven Arnold. Before his untimely death from AIDS, Arnold made his last request: that 100% of all proceeds from his work be utilized to assist other artists and photographers stricken with AIDS, struggling to complete their life's work.So now this collectable volume of his reliquaries is indeed a reliquary for the artist. It is unique, endlessly fascinating, an well worth researching the venues where it could be purchased.

They use the blue to seperate different senses or meanings for each word.There are more examples of how to use the words than I have seen in other dictionaries.The dual colour middle section consists of Useful sentenses, correspondance examples, e-mail examples and uses of the phone.

It is everything you could want in a French-English dictionary.It is big enough to be expansive in its survey of the language: which is important, both for reading literature (where there may be some words that are now rare) or current affairs (where there may be words that have only recently been coined).It gives plenty of examples of usage, so you can be more confident that your variation of what is provided makes sense and is good French.It warns you of common mistakes we each make in the other's language. Very helpful (and the kind of thing that turns people like me into the kind of people who would happily sit down and read the dictionary).It provides a variety of forms of the word (the noun, the verb, the adverb) formed off the same root, instead of assuming you will recognise them and use them correctly.If you love French, you are going to love this dictionary.

As a bilingual second generation Japanese, I know the difficulty of translating the essence of a culture into another, and still relay the message as it was intended. That is the art form of the translator, and very rarely do I feel the same sensation from reading the same material in a different language. Truly wonderful!"},{"Title":"Zen Fool Ryokan","review":"The title of this book is a bit misleading - this is not poetry of the &quot;holy fool&quot; type as one sees the holy fool in the Christian and Islamic traditions. Rather, this is poetry of a Zen monk who retained the playfulness of a child and who is reticent regarding his enlightenment. In fact, you may read far into the book before encountering poems that are unambiguously &quot;Zen&quot;.What truly sets this edition apart, however, is the afterward which includes memories of individuals who knew Ryokan. Even if the translation was mediocre, I would recommend the book for this alone. Luckily, the translation is satisfactory though not inspired.The poems themselves were written in Japanese and Chinese - in form, they are varied - as there is so much wonderful Zen haiku translated into English, this volume is a delightful counterpoint of other poetic forms."},{"Title":"Zen Fool Ryokan","review":"Well, there are a good number of books out now on the poetry of this gentle, eccentric, and talented Zen monk, each with their own particular strengths and weaknesses. So what about this one? First of all, this was clearly a labor of love; the authors have been moved and inspired deeply by Ryokan's art and life, and they hope to share what Ryokan has meant to them with English speakers--this aim informs the book with a warmth and immediacy consonant with Ryokan's own writings. On a more technical note, this book is rare in giving Ryokan's poems in Japanese script AND romanji transcription as well as in English translation--this is highly useful for those who may be somewhat conversant with the Japanese language and/or Literary Chinese but not fluent in the poetic idiom of Ryokan's time. I tend to think bilingual editions are a good idea anyway, especially for poetry, and that goes for this book definitely.I also liked the presentation of the poems in this book. One section just gives the poems one after the other like usual poetry anthologies, and this is fine and well, but other sections were more creative: one imbedded Ryokan's poems in a biography and general intro, one culled the translator's favorites, and one (particularly interesting to me in giving a glimpse of the social role of poetry in monastic life) demonstrated Ryokan in an extended poetic dialogue with his friend and disciple the nun Teishin. The poems themselves are deceptively simple like so much of Ryokan's work, filled with meditations on nature and his eremitic lifestyle with its little pleasures, frequently rephrasing Buddhist insights in an unpretentious and colloquial voice.The book does have its drawbacks, too, of course. Duly acknowledging the fact that translating from one's primary language into a second language is highly challenging (especially for poetry, in which so much depends upon rhythm, mood, connotation, and such), still that doesn't change the fact that the resulting translations here are somewhat flat and sometimes awkward. And accounting for \\"poetic license\\" in translating, still in a few poems the English seems to veer too far off from the original, or else over-interpret it. Finally, in the first pages there is some disturbing culturally-essentialist talk about how Ryokan reveals \\"The Japanese Mind\\" as if the Japanese were homogenous and imbued with one collective cultural identity. I don't think Ryokan would go for this. He'd be the first to admit he's a bit of an oddball (rather than a typical example of a given nationality, say). He seems more interested in revealing his own mind, and this mind of his speaks eloquently through his poetry to all of us with ears to hear, no matter where we may be.Of course without translation that voice won't carry far, and Kodama and Yanagishima are to be heartily thanked for doing their very best to share their enthusiasm for Ryokan with us. In my case at least, the enthusiasm was decidedly contagious."},{"Title":"The American Fur Trade of the Far West, Vol. 2","review":"The book describes everything about the furtrade in the American west.It describes the hunters and trappers,the history of the furtrade west from 1807 to 1843,the Santa Fe trade,how the western country looked like and the indians.It was very interesting because it described so much.It should have described the hunters equipment better."},{"Title":"The American Fur Trade of the Far West, Vol. 2","review":"The book describes everything about the furtrade in the American west.It describes the hunters and trappers,the history of the furtrade west from 1807 to 1843,the Santa Fe trade,how the western country looked like and the indians.It was very interesting because it described so much.It should have described the hunters equipment better."},{"Title":"America Pathways to the Present: Pathways to the Present","review":"The text is okay, but to really do a good job, you must a) read widely outside the text and b) give the students supplementary materials. For basic factual information, the text is largely acceptable. However, it is at times factuallly wrong, trying to claim in the early chapters that American Indian and African cultures were equally a part of the developing American legal system and culture--which is patently false.American legal ideas were almost exclusively derived from British law and the Bible, not only in the early colonies, some of which outright stated, \\"We have no king but Jesus.\\" but in the ideas of the CHRISTIAN Enlightenment, most particularly John Locke. Bsides the bible, the two most widely read writers prior to the Revolution were Locke and Blackstone, later on it was Locke and Montesquieu (checks and balances.)Addd The Heritage Guide to the Constitution, The Founder's Constitution and Mark Levin's Liberty and Tyranny to your study, background and supplementary information you give to your students. The text ignores the importance of The Federalist Papers, which are essential in understanding the development of the US Constitution.IF you really want to teach American History, don't rely predominately on the textbook, get the primary source information, there are plenty of websites out there, and Ashland University has a great series of workshops.

Mr. Pinck's account of his tour of duty spent in a Christian mission with an eccentric priest, a lovesick radioman and his savvy translator, is both humurous and literary. Through descriptive language and detailed sketches Pinck renders the harsh living conditions and genial, wine loving spirit of the Chinese people. While Pinck may read like Turgenev, one cannot ignore his own distinct style with which he captures the desolation and all too human trepidation of a young spy completely out on his own in a foreign land dealing with Japanese troops, unreliable agents, drunk Chinese generals, coy Chinese girls and by the book superior offiecers. Pinck has given us a true experience which displays the WWII generation's triumphant brand of American spirit, which at once possessed pragmatism, courage, humility and humor. A truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Journey to Peking: A Secret Agent in Wartime China","review":"We have all seen the James Bond films with the infamous agent mindlessly trudging around behind enemy lines, wooing women and slaughtering hordes of stereotypical bad guys. Mr. Pinck's novel is an intellectually stimulating story his experiances in wartime China, spent in a mission deep behind enemy lines. Although lacking in some of the glitz and glamour of the Ian Flemming's classic spy novels, his tale is equally intrigueing. With interesting characters such as his witty and cocksure cabbie in Peking to his radio operator's double agent girlfriend, the author, in beautiful prose, weaves and intiguing war story. Despite its lack of \\"shoot'em up\\" action, the story wonderfully portrays not only China and the interesting characters Mr. Pinck meets, but the beauty and wonder of this ancient land. The drunkness, sickness and heart break faced in the book are all pulled togather in this wonderful book.All in all this is a great read that will keep you spell bound to the end. This is truly one of the best cloak and dagger stories I have read in a long while."},{"Title":"Journey to Peking: A Secret Agent in Wartime China","review":"I cannot recommend enough Mr. Pinck's tale/memoir. Throughout my reading of this book I was constantly impressed with the clean, understated, wry writing style of Mr. Pinck.Every bit as engrossing and sincere as WWII memoirs such as Eugene Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed\\" (but askew and differing in the experiences retold), Pinck's book offers an endearing and unpretentious yarn set amidst the massive and convoluted backdrop of the China-India-Burma theater. The characters are painfully and believably real, with the story having no patina of time or nostalgic filtration.Anyone interested in the history of WWII, Asia, US Intelligence Services, or memoirs of colorful distinction will surely enjoy this very readable book by Dan Pinck.At the risk of sounding crass, this story would make for an excellent film."},{"Title":"Journey to Peking: A Secret Agent in Wartime China","review":"I picked up this book at my local library for no particular reason. I'd never read a war memoir before, but I had taught English in China. This was an extremely well written book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in China, WWII, the life of a spy, or a good story.I came in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Journey to Peking: A Secret Agent in Wartime China","review":"I was very excited to read this book on the plane to Beijing, but it was a big letdown. I have great respect for all who served the U.S. in the military, but as an exciting wartime spy book, Journey to Peking, is not very interesting. Also, the author portrays the Chinese he comes in contact with as shallow fools, and that got old for me real quick."},{"Title":"Beyond Acting White: Reframing the Debate on Black Student Achievement","review":"A researcher named John Ogbu theorized that Black American students don't excel in school because they find it a way of having their Blackness stripped. He also theorized that other Black students accuse strong Black students of \\"selling out\\" and explains why foreign Blacks seem to outperform native Blacks. This book chips away at some of his ideas. BUT KNOW THAT IT DOES NOT DETONATE THEM.This collection of researchers points to many things. Why do some Black students still excel despite the taunting? Why do some Black students cheer on other Blacks who perform well in school? Does Ogbu's theory fall flat if gender, immigration status, or type of school gets taken into account? Why do some Black students have an anti-school attitude and then revert away from it? Researchers find instances where West Indian and African American students motivate each other, rather than just assume the West Indian students will excel when the other group will not. A researcher notes that Black students say \\"acting white\\" is not about good grades, but about adopting Valley Girl dialects and white students' fashion styles.Every famous thinker has their ideas challenged. It happened to Freud, Catherine MacKinnon, Marx, W.E.B. DuBois, etc. This book points to ways in which Ogbu may have been incorrect, but it also never says he was entirely wrong. High-achieving students so say other Blacks think they \\"act white.\\" Black students interviewed in this book almost never say, \\"There is no such thing as 'acting white.'\\" No one ever denies that on average foreign Blacks seem to like school and excel at it better than longstanding Black Americans. This book never says or can prove that Ogbu was absolutely wrong.Like many anthologies, this book can seem uneven. I absolutely loved Prudence Carter's chapter \\"Intersecting Identities.\\" I thought the weakest chapter was \\"The Making of a 'Burden'\\" by Karolyn Tyson. This book only has seven body chapters. This can be seen as extensive, but it also felt kinda scant to me.At one point, the editors mentioned that Ogbu has passed away. However, I don't recall them ever saying if he was an African immgrant. Ogbu is not a typical name in the US. Did this scholar have direct African ancestry or was he an Afrocentric Black American who adopted an African name? Many position themselves as more \\"objective\\" or \\"scholarly\\" if they only mention a writer's words and not her or his identity. I still wonder if Ogbu thought, \\"Foreign Blacks differ from domestic ones. And I know because I am a foreign Black.\\" Or did he think, \\"Even as a foreign Black deemed 'smart' compared to native Blacks, I think it's funky and unjust how my group is positioned as 'better' than the other group.\\" I would have liked to know more about Ogbu's identity or biography."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I felt Christie really succeeded with this mystery. Her setting, ancient egypt, is delightfully rendered and her descriptions of life really serve to pull the reader into the story. Like her best novels, &quot;Death Comes as the End&quot; serves as a psychological study of her characters. If I have one complaint, it might be that it's not too hard to guess the murderer at the end. In any case the end is still chilling and well-done. Christie changed the ending for her editor and later wished she hadn't, but I find this mystery intriguing nonetheless."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I liked this unique Agatha Christie mystery set in Ancient Egypt, unlike all her other mysterious set in murderous bloodly modern England, and I even liked it without her omniprescent detectives Hercule Poirot &amp; Miss Marple. This book has an excellent plot and its depictions of family strife in Ancient Egypt sound just as real as they would today. The murder of family members in this book is enthralling as well, as it kept me on my toes, waiting to find out about who was the murderer of Imhotep's large family. The only fault that I can credit to this book is the rather obvious ending. There are not enough suspects and the ending, and, of course, the heroine (Renisenb) cannot be the culprit, that leaves practically two or three suspects to be the murderer. Even suspects that have been suspected for a long time are killed. In the end, it is rather obvious who the culprit is. I won't spoil it for you here but I'm pretty sure that whoever reads this book will find that the culprit is quite easy to guess."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I almost didn't read Death Comes as the End. I am always wary of historical fiction, and the idea of Agatha Christie writing about Ancient Egypt seemed absurd at first. But then after I had read more of her books and realized how much knowledge Ms. Christie had of archaeology, I figured I'd give it a shot. To my delight, the book gives one of the most lifelike depictions of life in ancient Egypt I've seen yet. The figures from ancient heiroglyphs seem to come alive, and the reader realizes that these people of antiquity were truly people. Best of all, the mystery in this book is very difficult to solve. I have a talent for seeing through mystery book plots, but this one completely stumped me. Death Comes as the End is one of those books you can't stop reading. The action doesn't stop for a second and the story is very fast-paced. I didn't put the book down until I had finished it...even ate while reading! I can't recommend this book more. Read Death Comes as the End if you love a good mystery and you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will be even more impressed at Agatha Christie's skill as an author after you read this book."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Among those 75 novels of Christie that I've read, this is surely my ALL TIME FAVORITE. The Egypt background was absolutely appealing. And the plot was engaging till the end. Even if you're such a big fan of Poirot and Miss Marple, don't you dare miss this one. It would bring you to such a different world, where the devil lies within the beauty."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I own each and every book written by Agatha Christie- this one happens to be one of my favourites..I thought that i'd guessed the murderer... was totally taken by surprise towards the end! Don't think twice before buying this book!"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Though different from other Agatha christie books, it is no less intriguing and clever. The ancient Egyptian setting provides a refreshing backdrop from the usual. There is no one detective such as Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot (for obvious reasons) but still is able to maintain a coherent story. This book is definitely worth reading!"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Agatha sets her murder in ancient Egypt in this original tale of a wealthy landlord's household.The unusual setting is the best feature of the book.An exciting psychological exposition of the characters but the end was disappointingly guessable. Nonetheless one of Dame Christie's best books."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This Agatha Christie mystery stands out, as it is set in ancient Egypt, far away in time and geography from St. Mary Mead and London. Many of the elements of a classic Christie are here, though: family conflicts, good vs. evil, and of course, murder and mystery! As usual, Christie presents us with a likeable protagonist who finds herself in a scary situation; she's unsure who to trust as events unfold.Christie was married to an archeologist (Max Mallowan)and part of this novel's charm is how she weaves her experiences in the Middle East into the story, just as she does with English life. Maybe the mystery itself is not Christie's strongest, but it is still effective and the unusual setting make up for anything the plot lacks. Therefore, it is deserving of five stars"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This book as well as &#34;Sparkling Cyanide &#34; looks like new and arrived on time . I am reading the book and it doesn't sound like Agatha's but is great, I can't wait to go back and end it.Very much engaging."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This different from most of Agatha Christie's mysteries. It starts off a little slow. It was worth it once the first murder occurs."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Death Comes As the End is not your average Agatha Christie novel. It isn't a detective or investigative novel and there isn't more than the slightly bit of sleuthing. It's more the type of mystery were you sit back and watch the story unfold with all the pieces of the puzzle readily available for you alone to discover and and decipher. Each person was suspected at least once and still found myself hugely surprised by the outcome. I was concerned that a Christie novel void of familiar characters set in ancient Egypt would be dry. I found that the characters, despite their somewhat hard to remember names, were very interesting. The Egyptian aspect of this book was lightly done, but for some minor customs it could have been set anywhere at any time. Dead Comes As the End was an excellent mystery."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I began this book, but found it slow going. I got as far as the first murder and was going to stop reading. Then I looked up the reviews here and saw the \\"fun\\" had just begun. Once it got going it was hard to put down.It was so different than the usual setting and cast of characters. I did not guess the bad guy at all, but found the end satisfying."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I thought I had read all the Agatha Christie mysteries many years ago, but DEATH COMES AS THE END seemed unfamiliar and I picked it up. It is an anomaly for Christie, a historical setting and characters, though as she says in an author's note, the plot could be set elsewhere in time and place but she was inspired by artifacts turned up in an Egyptian archeological dig in the early 1920's. In fact, I could easily see the story played out with similar characters in an English baronial manor house in the early 20th century. Or on a Texas ranch in a 1980's American television show.The plot is vintage Christie, with twists, turns and red herrings galore. It is mostly logical. It takes place in the household of an autocratic ancient Egyptian ka-priest, whose sons vie for power in the family's vast agricultural and commercial holdings. The delicate balance of family interrelationships is knocked off kilter when the widowed patriarch brings home a vixenish concubine, apparently an acceptable practice back when. The female characters range from witchy to ing&eacute;nue to matriarchal to unctuous servant. If they seem stereotypical some at least have a little psychological resonance and there are faint whiffs of English literary icons ranging from Lady MacBeth and Iago to Uriah Heep. It is refreshing to see the ing&eacute;nue itch for self possession and independence.A word about reading Christie again after at least 20 years: I was surprised at how \\"styleless\\" her writing style is. Fluent and efficient, yes. But no idiom to distinguish the narrative voice from American English. Perhaps I've been watching too many PBS versions of her work that I expected differently."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"At first it felt a bit strange reading a very British mystery set in ancient Egypt, but now I think that's part of it's charm (like going to the British Museum to see Egyptian artifacts).I enjoyed it just as much this time around as I did when I was a teenager, when it was one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"As with any murder mystery, one comes to expect death, but there is an awful lot of death in Agatha Christie's \\"Death Comes as the End\\" a murder mystery set in ancient Egypt. Fans of Christie's famous sleuths may be hesitant to read what might seem like such a bizarre departure from her ordinary works, but it is an interesting story with a very familiar closed-room sort of scenario. And given Christie's knowledge of the area and timeperiod, the setting and characters actually work, even if they do seem a little British at times.The ka-priest Imhotep was a father who ruled with an iron fist who never allowed his two older sons to take their rightful place as his associates and spoiled his younger son to the point of rottenness. There was constant discord in his household. His oldest son, Yahmose, was belittled and nagged by his wife for not standing up to his father. His second son, Sobek, seemed afraid of his father as well, but made attempts to put in his two cents as his wife argued with her sister-in-law. Imhotep's widowed daughter returns to this chaotic household hoping for peace, only to have her father blindside them all when he brings home a young, beautiful, and vain concubine, Nofret. The dislike is instantaneous and before too long, Nofret is dead, certainly killed by one of the family even if it looked like an accident. And when memebers of Imhotep's family are killed in mysterious ways, it seems as if Nofret's spirit is seeking its revenge, or that someone much closer to the family is letting their true nature be known.As with all of Christie's mysteries, \\"Death Comes as the End\\" moves at a brisk clip and but for a few details one might forget that it is set in ancient Egypt alltogether. Readers know that the killer must be a member of Imhotep's household, but with the vast amount of hatred that drives various motvies, readers will be kept guessing until the end."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This novel is a departure for Christie -- instead of the usual British cozy, it's a mystery set in ancient Egypt. But despite the exotic setting, many of the cozy elements are still there -- family discord, finger pointing, and bodies piling up like cordwood.In Thebes, around 2000 BC, Imhotep the wealthy Ka-priest is master of all he surveys -- or so he thinks. His three sons, one daughter and two daughters-in-law obey his commands, though not, in some cases, without some grumbling behind the scenes. All appears to be relatively well, at least on the surface, when Imhotep, long a widower, brings home a beautiful concubine, Nofret, and sets the cat amongst the pigeons. Nofret is arrogant and contemptuous of Imhotep's family, and Imhotep, besotted with his new plaything, takes her part. When she turns up dead at the bottom of a cliff, there's a general agreement by everyone but Imhotep that it's good riddance. But did she fall or was she pushed?Stressed by this new development, family members turn on each other, and their old servant Henet loudly proclaims her loyalty to first one and then the other, enjoying the fireworks that result. When more people in the household die, suspicions fall on first one person, then another. Through it all, Renisenb, Imhotep's beloved daughter, tries to find the culprit while preserving her own safety and sanity. Who can she trust?I found this a thoroughly satisfying mystery, written in a straightforward style but with enough red herrings to fill a fish barrel. I didn't guess the villain before the end, which made this a successful mystery for me. Fans of ancient Egypt will enjoy this, but it's suitable for anyone who loves a good mystery with lots of twists and turns. Vintage Christie, but a 4,000-year-old vintage that adds a bit of Middle Eastern spice."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This was a light and enjoyable read. However, it seemed to be populated by a cast of Englishmen who just happened to be living in Ancient Egypt. I feel that it could have been much more interesting if Ms. Christie had made the effort to create more believable characters."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This is one of my favourite Agatha Christie books, albeit lesser known for some reason.....If you like AC, you're sure to love this one!"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"this is the only Christie mystery not set in the present day.DEATH COMES AS THE END is set in ancient Egypt, a time and place that Christie was familiar with due to her husband, an Egyptologist. Each year Christie would accompany him to work on his latest 'dig'. As a result Christie had not only first hand knowledge of the period but also access to leading experts in the field.The story centers on Renisenb, a young widow who has returned to her father's house after the death of her husband. Just as she is settling into the household when her father returns from a business trip with a young concubine. The family is shocked and soon feel threatened by the newcomer. In typical Christie fashion a body soon appears, followed by another and then another.In may ways this is very much like a more familiar Christie story, the dysfunctional family (CROOKED HOUSE, 4:50 FROM PADDINGTON, POCKET FULL OF RYE). There is rather more romance than is usually found in Christie's mysteries. Renisenb's mourning and indecision between two suitors is more typical of the romances Christie wrote as Mary Westmacott. The characters do sound and act very much like Christie's usual mid twentieth century English middle class but since no one really knows just how the ancient Egyptian spoke or thought this characterization is as good as any.As is usual with a Christie the clues are all there for the reader to find, the ending is logical but in this one a bit predictable. It is not quite as good as many of her other novels but even a mediocre Christie is better than most writers best work."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I felt Christie really succeeded with this mystery. Her setting, ancient egypt, is delightfully rendered and her descriptions of life really serve to pull the reader into the story. Like her best novels, &quot;Death Comes as the End&quot; serves as a psychological study of her characters. If I have one complaint, it might be that it's not too hard to guess the murderer at the end. In any case the end is still chilling and well-done. Christie changed the ending for her editor and later wished she hadn't, but I find this mystery intriguing nonetheless."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"YOU KEEP GUESSING UP TO THE END. YOU CAN REALLY IMAGINE EGYPT AT THAT TIME BY HER DESCRIPTIONS. EXCELLENT BOOK!"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I love Agatha Christie mysteries as they are so very,very British.This books,set in Egypt is a point of departure for the author.I found it fascinating and an excellent introduction to Egyptology."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I read this book more than a year ago and it still comes back to haunt me on some lonely nights. More than any other Agatha Christie books I read (about 30), I would have to say this one is the darkest. Some harecters are so psychotic they could have belonged in a Stephen King novel. Setting the plot in the death worshiping land of ancient Egypt with its gods and tombs creates a sinister ambiance right of the bat with a strong sense of dark forboding, you just know something really bad is going to happen at any minute. Bottom line, this book transcends far beyond the typical murder mystery, even in dame Agatha's standards, making it a true gem of moderm fiction."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Death Comes As The End was an extremely well told story. It was so easy to get lost in the imagery and events that were taking place. The novel was fast paced and got straight to the point from the very beginning. I especially love the language, it's somewhat poetic. The depth of understanding of human relationships that is conveyed in the simple speech patterns of Christie's characters is almost incomprehensible. I thought I knew who the killer was, but truly I did not solve this mystery until the very end. I first read this book ten or more years ago when I was a teenager. I enjoyed Death Comes As The End today just as much, if not more than the first time I read it. I am not by any standards an avid mystery reader. I first selected this book because I was curious about Agatha Christie as an author and my interest was piqued at the possibility of reading about Egyptian characters. That said, this book is one that can be enjoyed by many readers, even quote, non-mystery readers. I could read this book again and again."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"One of Christie's best reads..the setting, plot and characters are truly amazing. I've read all of Christie's books- this one ranks among my top 10."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I reached the middle. I liked the setting in this book a lot more than Agatha Christie's usual modern era. The whole idea that the story situated in ancient Egypt gave me a sense that maybe the murderer wasn't mortal. For me, I was truely surprised at who the real culprit was. What I really enjoyed most about this story was that some characters stated interesting beliefs about human nature. The whole book to me seemed to be more than a mystery; it seemed to be a book of how certain people react to different situations, and how greed is evil. I absolutely enjoyed reading this book and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I read this book with reluctance at first, probably it being my first book by Agatha Christie, but it sure was a page turner. I don't know about how accurate this historical fiction really is with it's plot revolving around a widowed daughter from a broken family in Egypt. The family is close to crumbling with the father's sudden arrival of his concubine who is immediately rejected by the family and is left out in all their affairs, not that she really cared. But she's soon killed after the father, who's a burial priest, leaves for Upper Egypt on yet another financial concerning trip. Deaths soon start to occur, targetting mainly the direct members of the joined family, and Renisenb, the widowed daughter, is convinced that the source of evil is from her own house.Subplots are also added in this story such as Renisenb's dilemma of marrying again and the secret taking over of the family by her young step-brother.I recommend this book, as for once, it doesn't have her signature detectives like Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple, who were starting to get pretty predictable anyway and their absence allows a whole new perspective of the story."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"A change from English drawing-rooms and sleepy villages, this is a sterling mystery in its own right. The members of a prosperous family die off one by one.....while reading it, have plenty of lights on. Also rich with details of ancient Egyptian life. An excellent book."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I have read Agatha Christie books since I was a teenager, some I couldn't get interested in and some I could not put down. This is definitely one of the ones I couldn't put down. Mrs. Christie's description of the setting in ancient Egypt was fantastic and coupled with the multiple murders in the story -- I can't say enough about this book. It is a must read for every Christie fan."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This was not quite as good as when I first read it, but it is so unlike anything else of Christie's, that it holds a kind of fascination for that alone. So many people are killed, and all of them worthless. The killer has really run amok here. There is some philosophy in this book, as Christie writes from her mid-life years. On death, on womanhood, and personhood. The only book I can remember where she injected some sort of questioning on life. And I have read all of her novels, in chronological order. And yet the style - so, so simplistic, almost at a child's level."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Life on the estate of the ka-priest Imhotep doesn't seem to have changed at all in the eight years of Renisenb's marriage; returning to her father's house upon her husband's death, its stability comforts her, even though it isn't entirely peaceful. But how much of the impression of changelessness is wishful thinking?Her eldest brother, Yahmose, gentle, conscientious, reliable, is still henpecked by his strident wife Satipy, urging him to demand that Imhotep create a legal agreement giving Yahmose formal administrative status. The middle brother, Sobek, is a womanizer given to high living, who fancies himself a great man; his wife, Kait, may seem solid and stupid, but she's devoted to her children, and won't let him abandon their heritage however piqued he is with his father. Young Ipy, at sixteen, is no longer a pretty sight after being spoiled for so long.Then middle-aged Imhotep returns from a trip to Memphis and puts a cat among the pigeons: he introduces his new 19-year-old concubine, Nofret. She's unhappy at being tied to this fussy old tyrant on his backwater estate, after Memphis, but works to ensnare his affection - and facing the family's hostile reaction (except the amusement of Imhotep's aged mother, Esa), begins undermining them with him. (Christie gradually, skillfully illuminates Nofret's character; she's no cardboard evil temptress, and not really evil at all.)During another of Imhotep's trips, the cold war between Satipy, Kait, and Nofret comes to a head when Kait slaps Nofret - who then reports the truth and nothing but the truth in a letter to Imhotep, supported by testimony from the staff. Imhotep's reply falls like a boulder into a pool: Yahmose and Sobek are to be disinherited, while Imhotep will marry his concubine. But soon after the message arrives, Nofret is found dead, fallen from the cliff path near the tomb (the entire estate is an endowment, supporting the family in exchange for their maintenance of the tomb, hence Imhotep's job description as a ka-priest).This isn't a group of modern people set in an Egyptian background; the different culture is apparent. (Christie's 2nd husband, of course, was the archeologist Max Mallowan). The family (regardless of their suspicions) is content for this first death to pass as an accident, but as the death toll rises, some attribute it to Nofret's angry ghost while others, including Renisenb, wise old grandmother Esa, and the steward, Hori, look for a more immediate agent. (I believe I counted 8 deaths - I won't say if they were all murders - through the course of the book.)A novel in ancient Egypt, when well written, is always a pleasure, and Christie (particularly when not hogtied by formulae required by some of her more famous characters) is of course great at designing puzzles with human touches. The combination here is very good."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Agatha Christie has a complete change of pace as she takes the reader to ancient Egypt for this exciting tour de force. It might seem an unusual step for a writer who specialized in 20th century murder set in cozy English villages, but all the passions that lead to murder---jealousy, envy, greed, love, hate---are apparently timeless. Christie's research was painstaking and she is able to give us the exact details of this ancient life down to the type of food they ate and the type of clothes they wore. One of the most amazing things to me was that she was able to make these characters so realistic even though they are living in a time and under circumstances so foreign to the reader.The plot centers on multiple murders involving members of the family of Imhotep, a well-to-do religious leader in Thebes around 2000 BC.This novel is her most unique, but it has the same brilliant plotting and satisfying ending that all her others have."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"DEATH COMES AS THE END is a true Christie curiosity. Inspired by both her archeologist husband and then-recent archeological finds, Christie sets her tale of murder and mayhem in ancient Egypt. Even so, the story remains pure Christie: a long widowed landowner brings the beautiful young woman with whom he has fallen in love to his home--and she quickly upsets the household by manipulating a series of confrontations that so enrage her lover that he threatens to disinherit his children in her favor. Needless to say, murder is not far behind, and one death leads to another and another in what must be one of the highest body counts in any Christie novel.Although Christie spins her tale with considerable historical authority and aplomb, her extremely English tone of voice does not entirely suit her setting, and in this instance the solution to the crimes is actually on the obvious side. Ultimately, DEATH COMES AS THE END is more of an interesting experiment than it is a successful novel and cannot be ranked as among her most successful works--but it is expertly written, and established fans of her work will have a good time with it."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"And now for something completely different from Agatha Christie. A radical departure from the rest of her body of work, which were all set in what was (for her) a contemporary time period (between the 1930s to the 1960s), \\"Death Comes as the End\\" is set in Ancient Egypt in 2000BC. Christie's appreciation for Egyptian culture was due to her archeological husband, and the book's main conflict is based on real letters dating from the XI dynasty from a man called Heqanakhte to his family, complaining about their treatment of his concubine.After her husband's death Renisenb returns to her father's house, comforted by the familiarity of her childhood surroundings and the people she has known for years: her elderly father, her three older brothers, her bickering sister-in-laws, her mischievous grandmother, and the loyal family servants. Things seem very much the same as usual, with her brothers Yahmose, Sobek and Ipy feuding for their father's attention and their wives Satipy and Kait vying on their husbands and children's behalf.Away from these domestic affairs, Renisenb is happy to look out over the River Nile and enjoy the peace of the world laid out before her. But upheaval comes with the arrival of her father Imhotep and his new concubine, the beautiful and snake-like Nofret. Installing her in his household, Nofret instantly causes trouble amongst the family - jealousy, bitterness, suspicion and resentment follow in her wake as she effortlessly manipulates the household against each other and eventually organizes the disinheritance of Imhotep's three sons in her favor.It comes as little surprise then, when her body is found broken at the foot of a cliff. This would seem to be the end of the discordance in the house, but the body count is only just beginning! Renisenb is a helpless witness to the tragedies that unfold around her, unsure whether they are the work of Nofret's vengeful spirit or a flesh-and-blood murderer.Despite the exotic setting, one can't help but be amused at recognizing the unmistakable facets of a Christie mystery - though there isn't a quaint English village or a quirky detective in sight, there is a country house, a dysfunctional family, plenty of plot twists and red herrings, and a deep interest in human psychology. As it turns out, people who lived thousands of years ago are not drastically different from those who commit crimes today, and all the petty jealousies and familial squabbling found here could easily be transposed into any of her other novels with little need for alteration.Imhotep may be a ka-priest responsible for the funeral rites of the dead, but he's also a fussy old despot, feeling harassed and persecuted by his own family. Then there's the henpecked husband, the arrogant womanizer, the shrewish wife, the devoted mother, the ingratiating servant - anyone would feel right at home in any Christie mystery. Also notable is the fact that this is by no means a historical mystery. Though she has clearly taken pains to make it as authentic as possible, she avoids the usual trap of providing piles of expository information on the time period. You won't come away from this novel with a deeper understanding of Egyptian culture - this is a classic murder mystery, not an in-depth look at Ancient Egypt.Renisenb unfortunately is a little dry as a protagonist, and it is her love interest and her grandmother that do most of the sleuthing. In comparison, she is rather passive and seems to be just as concerned with her romantic subplot as she is with the very high death toll that surrounds her. Best described as a Christie curiosity, \\"Death Comes as the End\\" cannot be described as one of Christie's best - despite the exotic setting, it still manages to be rather formulaic with a solution that is brought about more by the process of elimination than actual detective work - but it is a fascinating change of pace for Christie aficionados."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Not to be macabre or morbid, but the Agatha Christie novels I enjoy most are the ones that really rack up the body count. It's not that I particularly enjoy murders, it's just that the Christie titles with lots of deaths in them have, to me, a slightly more engaging narrative than the ones where the people in them aren't dropping like flies. In other words, it's more fun when it's not just one death at the beginning followed by lots and lots of dense investigation. In novels like \\"Death Comes As The End\\" and (to name another multiple-death Christie title) \\"And Then There Were None\\", each individual death can't have TOO complicated a motive and method behind it because the book needs room to describe the motives and methods behind the other murders. This results in more drama and excitement (finding bodies IS dramatic) and less endless explanation.So, \\"Death Comes As the End\\" has the benefit of lots of drama and excitement, generated by all the poor victims strewn among its pages. And it also has the benefit of its unusual setting, ancient Egypt. The final benefit is a comfortable, familiar one: solid Agatha Christie characters and story telling (which I've always enjoyed even in the single-death titles). I really liked this book, a Christie title I somehow never got to in the past, and was glad I took a detour off the beaten track of recently-published mysteries and thrillers to give it a whirl."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This book allows Christie to draw on her considerable archaeological knowledge based on her experiences on digs with her archaeologist (second) husband. The setting is an intriguing change from her usual. However, I found the plotting in this one to be a little thin. I rarely figure out Christie's culprits in advance, but I saw right through this one. Read it for an interesting change of pace, but don't expect to be deceived."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This is not the book that Agatha Christie wrote. What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Bantam edition? There were already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the Signet, Berkley, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"It's wrong. The British accent in the Egyptian setting doesn't work. The story is long and tedious. The protagonist learns nothing during the entire book and in the end it all has to be explained to her, like a child. I am sorry I purchased this item, and the reviews I glanced at made it sound so intriguing. In fact, it is dull. I am a HUGE Christie fan, and I'd say she deserves a miss once in a while. This is a big miss."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I am not a fan of Agatha Christie, but I have read Death Comes As the End several times. Even though, by now, I remember who the murderer is, it is an enjoyable book for me. Perhaps, it's because it takes place in ancient Egypt. Just a family and murder. I wish she had written more fiction in this vein, but alas, this is the only one of hers that I know of."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"ever since i read and then there were none i have been looking for a non hercule poroit or miss mrple book that has the same genius. good read"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in my life. Gives a lot of background on Egypt enjoy"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"This is one of the best novels for Agatha. I'm very interested in Egyptology, and I was surprised that she also wrote a novel about a crime which happened in Ancient Egypt!The characters are: Esa, Henet, Hori, Imhotep (a wealthy priest-landowner), Ipy, Kait, Kameni, Khay, Divine Father Mersu, Montu, Nofret, Renisenb, Satipy, Sobek, Teti, and YahmoseIt is Ancient Egypt in 2000 BC, where death gives meaning to life. At the foot of a cliff lies the broken, twisted body of Nofret, concubine to a Ka-priest. Young, beautiful and venomous, most agree that she deserved to die like a snake.Yet Renisenb, the priest's daughter, believes that the woman's death was not fate, but murder. Increasingly, she becomes convinced that the source of evil lurks within her own father's household. Murders ensue; another falls off a cliff, one drowns, another is suffocated with linen, two are poisoned, and one person is killed by an arrow.Esa (Imhotep's mother) is an old lady, who has a good experience in life, and has a strong personality over Imhotep. She is brilliant, but commits a fatal mistake at the end! No wonder, didn't she say (Death comes at the end)?As usual, Agatha convinces us that someone has all the evidences that convict him/her. But someone else unexpected has the gut to commit all these serial crimes. Who is the criminal? I won't spoil it. Read the novel &amp; you'll be surprised at the end!"},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Death Comes as the End is the only foray of Christie's into ancient culture and history. Perhaps Christie knew that even with the best of intentions this idea did not work as well as her other plot ideas did.Christie has always had a fixed sense of her era--the background of it, the type of people living then, the way of life. This unique insight was always reflected into her novels as not only an outstanding set description, but a view to the way of life in bygone decades. However, in this mystery Christie does not have that cultural insight. Understandable, considering no one today ever lived in ancient Egypt and all we can know about it is found in stuffy volumes. Christie couldn't just sit back and observe people around her as she did for other novels. She had to make up the tiny details of life, and that is perhaps why this book has an undercurrent of artificiality.Not to say all of the book is bad. The people, the setting, and the backdrop for the! plot are mediocre, but the mystery side of it-- Christie's expertise wherever the setting may be-- is nicely done. Not the best, but okay. And so, all in all, Death Comes as the End remains a necessity for Christie collectors, but a superfluity for casual Christie readers."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I own pretty much all 70 - 80 of Agatha Christie's books, and this one is one of the best. Set in Egypt, this book brings myth to mystery. Of course, every one of her books is a treasure, and once you begin reading, she'll hook you too, and there will be no end to your facination with the world's best mystery writer."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"Another winner by Dame Agatha Christie...this was an exciting and unusual murder mystery. Set in ancient Egypt, a young Renisenb returns to her father's house, where she regathers with her family. Things seem different, and soon things seem deadly. From poison to strangling, This was definately a must read."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"The background takes us back 5000 years ago in Ancient Egypt, thus giving us a vivid picture of the culture, tradition and economy of the time.I regard it as not only a mystery, but also as a thriller. It is a must-read book for every Agatha Christie lover."},{"Title":"Death Comes As The End","review":"I own and have read, every single one of her 80+ books and short story collections, and this one, possibly her most unique, is her best.Set in Ancient Egypt, this is probably THE original historical crime novel. I can think of no other published before this. And none published after which equal it in it's brilliance. With this book, Agatha Christie outdoes more modern historical crime novelists such as Paul DOherty, Alys Clare, and Ellis Peters, with a single blow. She suceeds at everything she turned her hand to.Fuelled by extensive background knowledge and research, this books hits just the right tone in historical detail, and all of it rings true. (I dont know whether it is, and nor do i care. All i care about is the fact that it seems authentic.)This book retains all the things which make her modern fiction so good. The back-stabbing and terse depictions of family life, and the tensions and emotions which rise out of family, and love. (Often misguided, frequently adulterous). All her books are excellent at bringing out descriptions of families, and how the murder affects them. this one is no different. As well as that, there is a cracking plot, and some particularly bloodthristy murders to fit right in with the bloodthristy time period.The setting is evoked well, as is the time period. The book is suspenseful and thrilling. Also, a tiny bit frightening.I did not find the solution as easy to guess as other people appear to have. Mind you, i dont usually bother with trying to figure out who did it. Often, i get it right and find i have spoiled the book for myself. So i see no real point in bothering.) I found the resolution brilliant.The setting, the strong plot, the characters, the seething bitterness of the emotion, all serve to rank this as number one of all Agatha Christie's many novels."},{"Title":"The Wild Berry Book: Romance, Recipes and Remedies (Camp & Cottage Nature Collection)","review":"Having been a berry lover and berry picker since a young girl, I found this to be a very lovely and interesting book. Lovely for the beautiful pictures of so many berries. Interesting for the variety of berries pictured and described. There are so many berries I've seen and wondered about, not daring to pick and eat, or being aware they are edible, not knowing how they are to be eaten. Now I have a reference. The book is a feast for the eyes with lots of useful information. A good book for wanderers of the forest who come across these delicate fruits and wonder."},{"Title":"The Wild Berry Book: Romance, Recipes and Remedies (Camp & Cottage Nature Collection)","review":"The presented material of commonly found wild berries is done in summarized fashion, making this book an easy read. Plus it's all very inviting, rich with quotations, eye-catching color photos and wonderful illustrations, giving the book much appeal.Wild berries of merit are divided into three sections and those found in the first two chapters are described in a basic layout with: Introduction, Description &amp; Locality, Edibility &amp; Recipes, Etymology, History &amp; Folklore plus Reputed Medical Virtues. It also goes through various common names given to many wild berries. All of these details, which include some idea for bloom season and ripening season, are mostly provided for general idea, kept very basic. With even less information highlighted in the following chapter aptly labeled Minor Berries. Before the book ends it also furnishes a brief notation of fifteen poisonous berries, in common and Latin names but simply says to avoid them, giving no visual description beyond the four pictures, or any other useful clarifications for awareness. So the book is not very consistent with providing adequate information and a few times I had questions come to mind and where not being answered as I continued to read. For the more than thirty different berries found within, this book alone is not really well suited as a source for indentification.The many recipes supplied are quite interesting and most are vintage. One recipe that struck me as curious, found on page 32 was for a 17th Century Blackberry Wine, I also loved the author's trick for a Bloddy Mary drink on page 100, using juniper to get a flavor of gin without the alcohol. Not all recipes are very practical or necessarily healthy, calling for generous amounts of sugar, but there is at least something to experiment with. Recipes to be found range from jellies, jams, syrups, wines, drinks, pies, puddings, other desserts and more. Not much is provided for instructions on making remedies. Mainly just interesting American Indian medical folklore and comments on past usage and beliefs throughout history. A sample of the wild fruits highlighted in this book (in common name) range from strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, various raspberries, elderberry, bayberry, gooseberry, cranberry, currants, mulberry, mahonia berry, may apple, hawthorns, rosehips, sumac, saw palmetto, wintergreen, pokeberry, snowberry and many, many more.In addition to her wonderful introduction on the topic, the author does a lovely closing chapter to the book as well, telling more of her personal accounts, memories and opinions on the beneficial aspects of harvesting from the wild, which uniquely, is where an added touch of romance falls in. Certainly is great as casual reading for the experienced berry hunter and because of its good advice it's a decent introductory book for the beginner."},{"Title":"The Wild Berry Book: Romance, Recipes and Remedies (Camp & Cottage Nature Collection)","review":"If you are looking for a book to buy that has great color and depth in each picture and you really want to know what berries your about to pick if they are poison or not......this is the book to buy.....it's not like a lot of books that have pencil sketches of a berry...what a joke those are when so many berries look a like!

You won't be sorry!Thank you Lee's Books in St. Paul MN for such a beautiful book and fast order!"},{"Title":"Strange TV: Innovative Television Series from The Twilight Zone to The X-Files","review":"This book is a set of essays dedicated to thoughts about some of the surrealist and post-modernist elements in popular \\"strange\\" TV shows, from \\"The Twilight Zone\\" in the 1950's through \\"Twin Peaks\\" in the 80's and \\"The X-Files\\" in the 90's.It is an academically focused book with references, etc. However, if you like reading about how culture was shaped by television and vice versa, or if you wouldn't mind reading a little bit of critical thinking about some of your favorite pop-culture TV shows, this book is a good choice.It was a pleasant feeling to get the impression that the author enjoyed watching the shows as much as he liked expounding on his theories about them. The essays were humorous at times, and this tempered the academic tone that otherwise could have made \\"Strange TV\\" a very dry book."},{"Title":"Colonial Habits: Convents and the Spiritual Economy of Cuzco, Peru","review":"Katheryn Burns has written a great book. Her discussion of the spiritual economy is innovative and needs to be explored by more people. Burns uncovers a history that has been neglected by most historians but is integral to one's understanding of colonial Latin America. In short, this is must read for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Colonial Habits: Convents and the Spiritual Economy of Cuzco, Peru","review":"Colonial Habits analyzes the roles that convents played in Cuzco, Peru--and by extension, in Latin America in general--from the sixteenth century to the nineteenth century. Cuzco got its first convent, Santa Clara, in 1558, within a generation of Spanish conquest, and two more convents, Santa Catalina and Santa Teresa, in the seventeenth century. Burns argues that the convents, though walled off from the hustle and bustle of the city, played important roles in Cuzco's community life: first as environments in which the mestiza daughters of the conquerors could be educated, converted, and assimilated to Spanish colonial society; then as powerful landlords and lenders in mature colonial society; and always as power brokers in Cuzco's \\"spiritual economy,\\" dispensing both prayers and social capital to the families that patronized them. After independence, Cuzco's convents declined in size and importance as new secular schools and charities took on some of their earlier roles.One of the charming features of this book is that Burns discusses her research process as well as her conclusions: the types of documents she found, the nuns' interpretations of and responses to her research agenda, and the experience of returning daily to the locutario, the grille through which cloistered nuns communicated with the outside world. Burns's descriptions of the locutario, in particular, are wonderfully evocative. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Battle Pope","review":"This is really one of the best comics I've ever read.

Next to Achilles it was Ajaz who was the best of the Achean warriors, but Ajax was deeply flawed in that he was stubborn and egotistical. I think his intelligence is further called into question by the myth regarding his death, which is the subject of this play by Sophocles. After the death of Achilles it is decided his glorious armor, forged by Hephaestus, will be given to the worthiest of the chieftains. Ajax expects the prize to come to him, but instead the other chieftains vote to give it to \\"wily\\" Odysseus. The inference to be drawn is that craftiness and intelligence are to be prize more than brute strength, which is why I tend to identify Odysseus and Ajax with that distinction between brains and brawn. Enraged by this slight, Ajax decides to kill Odysseus and the other chieftains who have slighted him, but Athena clouds his sight and he thinks the camp's livestock are his intended victims. When he comes to his senses, butchering a sheep he thought was Odysseus, Ajax is humiliated to the point he chooses to kill himself.The issue central to the play \\"Ajax\\" is whether the title character should or should not be considered a true hero by the Greek audience attending the play. Homer, of course, has nothing to say regarding Ajax's fate in the \\"Iliad,\\" although in the \\"Odyssey\\" when Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax in the Underworld the dead hero refuses to speak and turns away. However, in his telling of the tale Sophocles adds an important element to the suicide of Ajax. In his first scene when he is discovered amongst the slaughtered livestock, Ajax realizes that his intentions were wrong and that what he has done will make him look ridiculous; he decides to kill himself, ignores the pleas of the chorus, says his farewells to his son and departs. However, in the next episode Ajax returns, apparently reconciled to life; instead of killing himself he will bury his unlucky sword and live a peaceful life. Then a messenger brings the warning of Calchas that Ajax must be kept out of the battle that day. The next thing we know Ajax is cursing the Atreidae and falling on his sword. The change is significant because it makes Ajax's suicide a more rational act. Instead of taking his life in the heat of his embarrassment over what he has done, Sophocles has the character changing his mind twice and ending his life in the grips of a cold hatred against the chieftains.This sets the stage for the debate amongst the chieftains regarding the burial of Ajax. When Teucer wants to bury the body he is forbidden to do so by Menelaus, who calls Ajax his murderer, focusing on the intentions behind his rampage. Agamemnon also forbids the burial, making an impassioned argument for the rule of law and warning against the reliance of the army upon the strength of a single man, whether he be Ajax or Achilles. Ironically (and we surely expect no less from Sophocles), it is Odysseus who makes the argument in favor of burial. For Odysseus the good outweighs the bad and it is not right to do a man injury when he is dead. This argument certainly echoes the moral at the end of the \\"Iliad\\" with regards to way Achilles treats the corpse of Hector. Certainly Ajax was a arrogant brute, obsessed with self-glorification and unfeeling towards his family and people. But when the Trojan army almost succeeded in burning the Achean ships, it was Ajax who stemmed their attack. For Odysseus, and for Sophocles, it is clear that such a man deserves to be considered a hero and demands an appropriate burial. \\"Ajax\\" is a minor play by Sophocles, relative to what little has survived of his work, but it does speak to one of the playwright central themes, which is to find that which is heroic in a tragic situation. Having found that spark in the life of Ajax, Sophocles seeks to redeem the tragic figure in this play."},{"Title":"Understanding X-Rays: A Synopsis of Radiology","review":"The book is not very visual except for the quiz at the end of five chapters. More radiograph figures adjacent to descriptions are needed. It doesn't help that the cost of the book was dropped by $17 after I bought it. Also there's no Index."},{"Title":"Green Roses","review":"(ending kind of given away)So I found out about Thomas Boggs through pure chance, and immediately wanted to read one of his books. Green Roses was cheaper than his other novel, Tokyo Vanilla, so I took a chance, and...Disappointment.The ending was very, very abrupt, and the entire novel is completely centric on the main character's feelings, as if his entire family didn't even exist. Tim (main character) also has some kind of...personality change...around the middle, which I'm sure was explained somewhere within the oh-so-complex storyline...Did I say 'complex'? I meant simple and there for a sole purpose; sex. There wasn't much emotional content unless you could read it from the physical description, which wouldn't have been a problem if the characters had about five times as much depth. I will say that the steamy scenes are moderately hot, but there isn't enough of a 'story' to balance it out. Green Roses, in my opinion, is borderlining on being smut.THAT would have been fine with me as well, but it didnt' begin like that at all. In fact, I was expecting it to be a great novel from the way the book began. Then it was just like Boggs decided to...stop. On the better hand, it's definitely fanfiction material, the kind of book that someone else could have really brought into a brilliant light.Yes, a light that would have focused more on the emotions of the other characters, maybe. Like how did Tim's mother feel when word was getting around camp that he was seeing a Japanese boy? Or Doug's (the 'friend') behavior around Tim after he started to hear the rumors? Or SATORU, MAYBE, AFTER HE DECIDED TO NEVER SEE TIM AGAIN?!Just a disappointing, depressing novel. Full of possibilities, but they all died when Boggs said 'nah...'. Good read if you want some quick smut and an ending that tried a little too hard to be 'tragic', bad read if you're looking for something to READ. If you can buy it cheap, give it a try, but be cautioned."},{"Title":"Persuasive Images: Posters of War and Revolution from the Hoover Institution Archives","review":"Persuasive Images is a visually stunning book.

Keith Wyatt, apart from being an outstanding guitar player, is an excellent blues guitar player too. When it comes to slide, he shows that he's brilliant in that too. This book is intended for those, who have an experience of playing blues guitar and want to get into slide. This book covers the subject very well (it's mostly BLUES slide book, but hey, it's what the slide is mostly good for), Keith shows you how to begin playing with slide (at first in standard tuning by the way), shows techniques and then he gets down to some pretty standard blues slide licks. I found this book to be very useful and don't consider that \\"Fretboard Roadmaps - Slide Guitar\\" is better simply, because like I said Keith is way better player, the feel, the tone, the licks, everything is better then in other book (I own both of them by the way). So if you are experienced in blues guitar and want to play blues slide, get this book, forget about Fretboard Roadmaps, which is kinda \\"slide in every style\\" book, with more open tunings explained frankly speaking, but with poor licks, poor sounding CD, and songs and licks repeated in several keys - gee, if you know how to play in any key, you'll be able to play same stuff almost in every key. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars, it's because it could be just a little bit more detailed with more exercises and licks. And those of you, who complain that no scales are given in this book, first learn how to play guitar generally and then get into slide."},{"Title":"Electric Slide Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"I found this to be a really good entry level instructional book/CD from an incredible blues and slide player, Keith Wyatt who teaches at Musician's Institute. It is only 35 pages long and so he touches on mostly playing in standard tuning and a bit in open E tuning, which is common for electric guitar. It also covers some blues basics, like what a 12 bar form it.Frankly, if you are already a good player who finally wants to delve into slide blues playing I would skip this book and find something a bit more intensive, or just go listen to the original songs.For those in the beginner and intermediate level who want to get their feet wet with slide gutiar without spending too much money on all sorts of DVD's this is a good place to start, as Keith talks about different slides, phrasing, clean tone and vibrato before he gets into the meat of the subject.I actually thought his Acoustic Slide Guitar book/CD was a better and more in depth intro to blues slide playing than this book, although most of that book covers open G tuning. It really translates either way to be honest: open G on acoustic is normally played open A on electric. Open D on acoustic is normally played open E on electric. So they end up being the same licks.Either way, slide playing is really fun, liberating, and a great skill to add to your bag of guitar tricks, even if you only end up adding it here and there to your own songs."},{"Title":"Electric Slide Guitar (The Ultimate Beginner Series)","review":"This book did not provide me with the information that I wanted. There were no scales given, just examples to play along with. For those looking to get into slide, I'd recommend Fretboard roadmaps, simply because it offers so much more, like scales, thorough explanations of examples and practice tracks to improvise with. Bottom line, skip this book and go straight for Fretboard roadmaps."},{"Title":"Corot in Italy: Open-Air Painting and the Classical-Landscape Tradition","review":"I can't praise this book enough. Corot's work in Italy are in my mind some of the greatest plein air painting ever done.Seeing his work compared to his contemporaries etc. is very interesting. One also appreciates the allure of the Italian landscape. Corot is sometimes viewed as the father of Impressionism(his later work). But I could look at these landscapes all day. His realism and fresh painting technique is really sumptuous, and it's a good thing he found his niche in painting rather late.Buy this book, you won't regret it if you love landscape."},{"Title":"Shaping globalization: Civil society, cultural power, and threefolding","review":"Nicanor Perlas prepared this book in time for the Millennium Forums around the UN in September 2000. His key is to consolidate the understanding of \\"culture\\" as a third co-equal dimension of society, alongside the more easily defined political and economic segments.His crucial revelation is how this cultural sector, though manipulated and diverted as much as possible by economic and political interests (I'll call it \\"buying lying and denying\\"), is still able to exert the greatest influence of the three, when properly worked with. Lincoln's assertion that \\"right makes might\\" falls into this category.As a historical note I would add that in the evolution of human consciousness we have reached the place where the old institutions of culture and values are no longer effective, and the effectiveness of culture as a guide to healthy societies depends on individual conscience. That is what Perlas himself has shown, as recognized by his being awarded the \\"Right Livelihood\\" Prize from Sweden, sometimes call \\"the alternative Nobel Prize.\\"Anyone who aspires to understand and to help improve society at any level will be inspired and empowered by the book."},{"Title":"The Minor Agreements in a Horizontal-Line Synopsis. (Studiorum Novi Testamenti Auxilia)","review":"This little book provides the raw material for evaluating the level of difficulty the \\"minor agreements\\" pose to the Synoptic Problem. The \\"minor agreements\\" refer to the places in the synoptic gospels where Matthew and Luke agree with each other against Mark. These data have been much fodder for those who reject the two-source (Mark and Q) hypothesis which has been prominent in the 20th century.The raw data is entirely in Greek and will be of very little use to non-Greek readers. The book contains only raw data, and no analysis, theories, or comments.The one weakness of the book is that it doesn't provide any notation regarding textual variation. A number of \\"minor agreements\\" may be dismissed on a text critical basis. Due to rampant harmonization between the gospels in the transmission of the text, some \\"agreements\\" may simply reflect textual corruption, and not agreements in the original text. Any serious analysis of the minor agreements has to involve serious text critical work.I think an earlier, more pricey book by Neirynk includes text critical information."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"Since his big brother had to do some summer reading - I ordered a few books for the little guy to keep up his skills. He read Superfudge a few months ago, so I charged him with reading Freckle Juice, all by himself. I told him that if he could answer 5 questions when he was done, that the last pudding pop was all his.Never one to back down from a challenge when a pudding pop is on the line, the little guy sat down on the family room floor and started reading. As I made dinner I could hear him howling with laughter as he read.He came running out and told me that \\"Andrew wanted freckles so he gave a nasty girl in his class 50 cents to buy a freckle juice formula. When he drank it he turned Green because it was so gross. Then he used a marker an put freckles all over himself, but his teacher gave him a secret formula to make them go away. I think it was just soap\\"He got his pudding pop - and I even threw in a lifesaver since I was so impressed as his ability to remember fine details from the book (he could list ALL of the ingredients in the freckle juice and remembered the names of every character in the book).Is there any great moral? In our house it's an important one - Don't blindly listen to some kid in your class. If he had read this before then we may not have suffered through the \\"Penny Incident\\" a few months ago.This is just a cute little book that 2nd-3rd graders can easily read by themselves.

There are 40 pages (7 of which are full page illustrations) There are more pages with half page illustrations. The book is entertaining. The particular book my kids read does not have color illustrations - the illustrations are in black and white, which my kids complained about. The story line is good. The moral of the story is \\"we all have things about ourselves we would like to change.\\" It's about self acceptance. My 5th grader read this book, but he wasn't particularly thrilled about it. My 3rd grader liked it much better. There are a lot of color descriptions in the book and it would probably be better served with color illustrations. That is why I reduced it 1 star. We compensated for this by drawing color pictures for the pages that had good color descriptions. This is a good story, I remember reading it in elementary school.

This was a really good book about a boy named Andrew who wanted Freckles. His classmate Sharon gave him a recipe for freckles. Will Sharon's recipe work? Will Andrew ever get his freckles? You'll have to read the book to find out!I recommend this book to 1st through 4th grade. For 1st graders, this is an easy way to start on a chapter book. For 4th graders, it is a nice short book that you can finish quickly. We thought that the jokes and humor in this book were appropriate for 1st through 4th graders. There are great vocabulary words in this book. This book also teaches a good lesson to it's readers. The moral of the story is, like yourself for you who you are, and to be yourself and not anyone else.We think this book could be improved by making Andrew less gullible. The recipe for freckle juice was also a little disgusting, so we thought we could change the ingredients. For 4th graders, we thought one more chapter would be necessary to develop the plot a little more.We hope you enjoy this book. Happy Reading!

It has been said, \\"You always want what you don't have.\\" This book takes place in a school setting where a boy named Andrew Marcus envies a boy named Nicky, who has freckles all over. A sneaky girl named Sharon, found out of Andrews longing of having Nicky's freckles and wrote up a secret recipe that will instantly give Andrew the freckles he always wanted. Eager to try the recipe out, Andrew is in his kitchen mixing this mysterious drink. Although the drink had a foul smell and yucky taste, Andrew gulped it down as fast as he could only to become very ill in just a matter of time. Mrs. Marcus comes home to find her son in her room sick to his stomach. Andrew regretted taking Sharon's recipe under consideration, and was determined to prove to Sharon that he indeed gained freckles. On the way to school Andrew marked his face with dots to convince Sharon that her recipe worked. When Andrew got to school, his sweet teacher introduced to him a magic freckle remover. When Nicky, the boy with freckles, saw that Andrew's marker freckles were removed he instantly wanted some of that magic freckle remover. Mrs. Kelly, the boys' school teacher, made both boys aware that they are much good looking just the way they are, Nicky with freckles, and Andrew without freckles.I loved this book, because as a future educator, this will be a good book to introduce to the class in the beginning of the year to make all students aware that everyone is unique and different and that everyone has a role in shaping the classroom community. There are so many morals of the story. You may even address social issues such as bullying like Sharon in the book."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"This thing won't let me edit my stars...but I meant to put 4!!My thoughts reading this to myself were that Freckle Juice is a fun early chapter book (which is why I originally gave it 5 stars).

The writing is fairly well-paced for young readers and the dialogue is decent.My thoughts reading it aloud to my children were that it could have been cut by half, my kids were bored and many sentences were cumbersome. It felt like there were many little add-ons that distracted my children instead of holding their attention.Yet my 7-year-old daughter approved it and we enjoyed the clever ending."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"I ordered this book because my son constantly checks it out of the library.

This is a must read book.Judy Blume has written many novels. Besides many number one bestsellers her work has been translated into twenty-something languages. Judy has inspired many young readers. She is hardworking and her work proves that."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"This book is a good first chapter book for 2nd graders. There are 40 pages (7 of which are full page illustrations) There are more pages with half page illustrations. The book is entertaining. The particular book my kids read does not have color illustrations - the illustrations are in black and white, which my kids complained about. The story line is good. The moral of the story is \\"we all have things about ourselves we would like to change.\\" It's about self acceptance. My 5th grader read this book, but he wasn't particularly thrilled about it. My 3rd grader liked it much better. There are a lot of color descriptions in the book and it would probably be better served with color illustrations. That is why I reduced it 1 star. We compensated for this by drawing color pictures for the pages that had good color descriptions. This is a good story, I remember reading it in elementary school. You don't forget this one soon for some reason, probably because it's one of the first chapter books kids read and, in my case, it was a leap above the \\"Pug, Jan, and Ted\\" of my younger days."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"This book is a great book that makes you think back to when you were a kid and the things that you envy of other students. It has been said, \\"You always want what you don't have.\\" This book takes place in a school setting where a boy named Andrew Marcus envies a boy named Nicky, who has freckles all over. A sneaky girl named Sharon, found out of Andrews longing of having Nicky's freckles and wrote up a secret recipe that will instantly give Andrew the freckles he always wanted. Eager to try the recipe out, Andrew is in his kitchen mixing this mysterious drink. Although the drink had a foul smell and yucky taste, Andrew gulped it down as fast as he could only to become very ill in just a matter of time. Mrs. Marcus comes home to find her son in her room sick to his stomach. Andrew regretted taking Sharon's recipe under consideration, and was determined to prove to Sharon that he indeed gained freckles. On the way to school Andrew marked his face with dots to convince Sharon that her recipe worked. When Andrew got to school, his sweet teacher introduced to him a magic freckle remover. When Nicky, the boy with freckles, saw that Andrew's marker freckles were removed he instantly wanted some of that magic freckle remover. Mrs. Kelly, the boys' school teacher, made both boys aware that they are much good looking just the way they are, Nicky with freckles, and Andrew without freckles.I loved this book, because as a future educator, this will be a good book to introduce to the class in the beginning of the year to make all students aware that everyone is unique and different and that everyone has a role in shaping the classroom community. There are so many morals of the story. You may even address social issues such as bullying like Sharon in the book."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"Cute book for my 8 yr old granddaughter.Very fast reading.Judy Blume is a great childrens writer.

No teacher would let a 2nd grader sit there with blue marker all over his face until 2 pm. For one thing, every adult in the building who saw the student would have commented and wondered why he had not been sent to the nurse. Even if that were not the case, teachers have to put the safety and health of students first, and magic marker all over the face is not healthy. Andrew would have been sent to the nurse to clean the marker off right away.Of course, that would not have been much of a story."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"I bought this book to read to my 5 year old son....was great short and he really enjoyed the story, however can read in one sitting wish was a little longer as now looking for a new small chapter book to read with him."},{"Title":"Freckle Juice","review":"This book is about a boy named Andrew and he really wants freckles.

Start with these stories--all quite different, all in their own way astonishing--then track down his wonderful novel,INSPIRED SLEEP, & you'll recall why you used to love reading so much.

Gilbert Byron grew up in Chestertown on the banks of the Chester River in Kent County on Maryland's Eastern Shore in the first decades of the 1900s. Now, that century is coming to a close. But, Gilbert Byron's books about this part of the world - insulated, isolated in another time -will live forever. This work is not just for children. Adults will enjoy it, too. My father was a friend of Gilbert's growing up. And I knew Gilbert Byron well as editor of the Kent County News. He kept writing to the end living in a cabin he built himself on San Domingo Creek near St. Michaels on the Eastern Shore. By the way, he also was instrumental in sending Harold Baines to the major leagues, thanks to Bill Veeck. But, that is another whole story. Enough. Read The Lord's Oysters. Read Chesapeake Duke and fall in love with Chesapeake Bay Retrievers. Read Mr. Byron's poetry, especially These Chesapeake Men.

Haven't made it yet, but still want to go."},{"Title":"The Lord's oysters","review":"Gilbert Byron's semi-autobiographical novel is backdropped in a small Maryland Eastern-Shore town that is based off of his hometown of Chestertown. It follows the son of a waterman,Noah Marlin, in his adventures on the tributaries of the Chespeake Bay in the pre World War I Twentieth Century. The tales are astecically pleasing while also surving a purpose, bringing about such chronoloically accurate issues such as race, technology and the industrial revolution as well as the changes that face the region.The author does a fantastic job of engulfing the reader in Noahs world while also being historically accurate and highly entertaining. I read this book in middle school and it has been my favorite novel ever since. I have read it three times, even as recent as this December and it keeps making me fall in love with it. Although Byron was a family friend and I grew up with the same experiences as Noah on Maryland's Eastern Shore, I believe this book transcends borders. Any young boy around 10-15 as well as any adult can benefit from reading this novel. It has great morals and lessons as well as causes the reader to think and form opinions. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested."},{"Title":"The Lord's oysters","review":"The book was in great shape and arrived promptly.

The book has been in print since 1957 and still offers the reader a flavor of life in rural America before World War I. Byron writes in the vernacular of a 9 or 10 year old and the book has been compared to Huckleberry Finn. It is an easy read,and the language is deceptively simple. Each chapter can stand alone as an independent short story, but collectively they provide and interesting view of an average family struggling to make do: &quot;We were poor and didn't know it.&quot;This modest book describes much more accurately the life and times that visitors to the Eastern Shore seek than do more commercially succesful writers such as Michiner and Barth."},{"Title":"In Light of Our Differences: How Diversity in Nature and Culture Makes Us Human","review":"The author makes a fascinating case for regarding linguistic diversity in the same way we treat biodiversity. The shrinkage of world languages and concomitant homogenization of global culture should be just as threatening to us as the more emotional response we have when facing the loss of a furry or feathered creature. In addition to being a painstakingly constructed argument, complete with a fascinating rehabilitation of the philosophy of William James, the book itself is extraordinarily well-written.

Although there is no doubt that Ms Wurts is an excellent writer, I found this book somewhat unoriginal. Both Taen and Jaric are represented as handicapped children who overcome their problems and find strength when confronted with their fates, which sounds like a typical children's fairy tale. For some reason, I find myself unable to relate to these characters. The rapid development of Emien, Taen's brother, becoming an &quot;evil&quot; character is also unrealistic. A further, rather disappointing surprise, is the fact that the Vaere is a computer, mixing fantasy with unimaginative science fiction (and I'm afraid I'm a fantasy fan). Compared to the Wars of Light and Shadow, Stormwarden remains in the shadow."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"This is a great time to be an audiobook reader! I've said often recently that I'm so pleased with Audible Frontiers for bringing us some older fantasy literature on audio, and this month their UK production team released Stormwarden, the first novel of Janny Wurts' The Cycle of Fire trilogy which was first published in 1984.Having greatly enjoyed Wurts' stand-alone novel To Ride Hell's Chasm, and knowing how several of my fellow FanLit reviewers feel about her The Wars of Light and Shadow saga, I've been waiting and hoping to find one of her epics on audio. So when Audible Frontiers UK released Stormwarden, I snapped it up within a few hours.Stormwarden is a coming-of-age story that focuses on three youth (Jaric, Emien, and Taen) who get caught up in a battle between kingdoms, sorcerers, demons, and aliens. There are some now-classic fantasy characters here -- scrawny orphan boy who gets a sword, white-bearded sorcerer who controls the weather, a beautiful enchantress with white hair and violet eyes, and a beautiful dreamweaver with black hair. (Someday I want to read about a middle-aged, overweight, brown-eyed sorceress with thin mousy hair... or maybe I don't.) But these characters are treated with respect by both author and audiobook reader (David Thorpe) who pack them full of vigor, drive, and both admirable and reprehensible character traits and emotions.There's plenty of the unexpected, too. For example, much of the story takes place at sea. Also, an alien endows humans with supernatural powers by injecting them with crystallized demons. For a coming-of-age story, the plot is refreshingly unpredictable and Stormwarden ends with an exciting action-packed climax -- a trademark Janny Wurts feature. The reader also gets a sense of Wurts' expertise in sailing, horsemanship, and other outdoor pursuits -- all of these elements feel real and this is something that sets this fantasy novel apart from most of its peers.The narrative style is more expository than is my preference, and sometimes it's wordy (for example, \\"cognizant of the fact that...\\" instead of \\"knowing...\\"), but it's full of passion and David Thorpe's perfect performance lends enthusiasm and verve, allowing Wurts' characters to live and to capture our hearts. I look forward to continuing their adventure in Keeper of the Keys, the next novel in The Cycle of Fire, soon to be released by Audible."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"I liked this A LOT, which is saying a lot for me reading any type of Sci-FI! A mesmerizing coming-of-age story with great atmoshpere and absorbing characters. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot moves along really well- not slow and staggering like so many other Sci-FI books I've tried but cannot finish. The I look forward to reading all of the Cycle Of Fire series now!"},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"An excellent novel about the coming of age of 3 children and their destinies. Although the plot is not entirely unique, Ms. Wurts has a knack of vividly portraying her characters that makes us love them. This is even more evident in her more recent series, the Wars of Light and Shadow. In any case, the adventures of Jaric and Taen inspire hope and keep us in suspense, and this remarkably talented author manages to create a world without too much of the dreary detail that encumbers many other epic fantasies. A fresh and vivid tale that inspires the imagination. (Ms. Wurts' apparent fondness of the ocean is rather a distinguishing trait of her works, don't you think?)."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"Excellent story about the Stormwarden who is falsely accused and arrested due to a plot of an arch rival. Interesting twist in the story. Anxious moments while the Stormwarden has to rely on the help of a almost useless boy and a young semi crippled girl, whilst facing so many enemies. When you reach the end you just have to rush off and find book 2, with out delay to find out what happens next. Very Compelling. Excellent writer."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"The Cycle of Fire is the coming of age story of three children, Taen and Emien the children of a fisherman who died at sea and Jaric Ivainson, an orphan and a scribe. These gifted children stand at the nexus of forces beyond their control. It is also the story of Vaere trained sorcerer, Anskiere, a master of wind and wave. Lastly it is the story of power struggles between human and human. Over all of this hangs the very real threat of conquest by the demons.STORMWARDEN begins the tale and deals primarily with Taen. She is lame from an accident and something of an outcast. When Anskiere is arrested for committing a crime against the people through the use of his powers, Emien is happy to see him go, but Taen remains faithful.And so begins the division between the two of them. For Taen it is the first step towards her destiny. For Emien it is the beginning of a long slide towards his.STORMWARDEN is a masterfully crafted tale of the trials and tribulations faced by the three children and the decisions they make. But more importantly it deals with the consequences of those decisions."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"This is the book that made Janny Wurts one of &quot;my&quot; authors.

I remember them as containing a good story in a believable world structure, if a bit too demon-ish at times (reminiscent of Tolkien).Well, upon this most current reading, I am noticing that the books are mostly narrative, with very little dialogue. So much is explained in narrative that I found myself glossing over large swaths of explanations until I could either get to the parts about Emien (none of the other characters engaged me emotionally, except perhaps the Captain-Kirk-like Kielmark), or until I reached a patch of dialogue. This made it an almost tedious read.I'm halfway through book 2, \\"Keeper of the Keys,\\" and I'm finding the same problem there. Too much narrative, not enough dialogue, not enough character development to really make me care. I may not bother finishing the series."},{"Title":"Stormwarden","review":"OK, I liked this book as well as the whole trilogy. The plot was solid (even if there was a little too much sailing), the characters were interesting, and the story moved along pretty good.

In Chapter 1, \\"What Is the Middle Game?,\\" he states: \\"The middle game is an arbitrary term applied to that portion of the game of chess following the opening and preceding the ending.\\" Middle game books are generally concerned with two topics: strategy and tactics. Horowitz's book is no exception. As noted by Nikolay Minev, \\"We have to seek help in knowledge of basic strategic and tactical possibilities. These are the stepping-stones that can be applied in specific situations, and indicate the direction for future plans of action.\\" Chapters 2 thru 11 deal with tactics. These ten chapters cover the following topics:Chapter 2: Middle Game Goal; The Pin; The Knight ForkChapter 3: Double Attack and Discovered AttackChapter 4: Discovered Check, Double Check, and the Overworked PieceChapter 5: Removal of a Guard, Queening Cobinations, and UnderpromotionChapter 6: X-Ray Attack and Trapped ManChapter 7: Vulnerable First Rank and InterferenceChapter 8: Surprise Mating Attacks and Combined OperationsChapter 9: Outcombining the Combiner and Sundry CombinationsChapter 10: More Sundry Combinations--Castling and ZugzwangChapter 11: Drawing Combinations--Perpetual Check and StalemateAn excellent follow-up to these chapters would be Irving Chernev & Fred Reinfeld'sWinning Chess, Fred Reinfeld's1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations, and Georges Renaud & Victor Kahn'sThe Art of Checkmate. If you prefer books in algebraic notation (eg., 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6, etc.), then read John Nunn'sLearn Chess Tacticsand/or Martin Weteschnik'sUnderstanding Chess Tactics. I would then recommend your reading Vladimir Vukovic'sArt of Attack in Chess. An excellent software program for honing your tactical skills is \\"Chessimo\\" (formerly known as the \\"Personal Chess Trainer\\"). A FREE trial version of this software can be downloaded from the Chessimo website.The next seven chapters focus on strategy. These chapters are as follows:Chapter 12: Strategy in the Middle Game--The CenterChapter 13: Better DevelopmentChapter 14: Advantage in SpaceChapter 15: King-side Attack; Queen-side Attack; King in the CenterChapter 16: The Minority AttackChapter 17: Weak Pawns and Strong SquaresChapter 18: Material Advantage and SundriesAn excellent follow-up to these chapters would be I.A. Horowitz and Geoffrey Mott-Smith'sPoint Count Chess, Ludek Pachman'sModern Chess Strategy, and Jeremy Silman'sHow to Reassess Your Chess(4th edition). I would also recommend your reading Hans Kmoch's \\"Pawn Power in Chess\\" and Andrew Soltis's \\"Pawn Structure Chess.\\"The following is a list of the books in this series:1. HOW TO WIN IN THE CHESS OPENINGS (199 pp.; copyright 1951)2. MODERN IDEAS IN THE CHESS OPENINGS (167 pp.; copyright 1953)3. HOW TO WIN IN THE MIDDLE GAME OF CHESS (199 pp.; copyright 1955)4. HOW TO WIN IN THE CHESS ENDINGS (234 pp.; copyright 1957)All of the books in this series were written for the novice. According to Horowitz, \\"the four [books in this series] constitute a fairly complete Short Course in Chess Play particularly adapted to the beginner who has learned how to make the moves and how to read [descriptive] notation but is groping for signposts in the vast range of chess knowledge.\\" All four of these books were published as a single volume in 1968:How to Win at Chess: A Complete Course(817 pp.).Conclusion: If you have never read a book on chess strategy and/or chess tactics and you don't mind descriptive notation (eg., 1. P-K4 P-K4 2. N-KB3 N-QB3 3. B-N5 P-QR3, etc.), then this is an excellent book to begin with. If you are not familiar with descriptive notation, then see the article on this topic at the Wikipedia website."},{"Title":"Strange Powers of Pets","review":"If you have lost a beloved pet, then this is the book that will help you through a difficult time.

It helped me through a very difficult time and it will help you too."},{"Title":"Great astronomers","review":"This book was written in 1895, the printed edition has 271 pages (and has illustrations, which the e-book doesn't). At the moment of writing the author was Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge. In this book the lives of 18 astronomers are discribed, some of them are known to everyone, but some are not so generally known. The book starts with an introduction of a few pages on the history of astronomy.A list of the astronomers featured in this book:PTOLEMY, COPERNICUS, TYCHO BRAHE, GALILEO, KEPLER, ISAAC NEWTON, FLAMSTEED, HALLEY, BRADLEY, WILLIAM HERSCHEL, LAPLACE, BRINKLEY, JOHN HERSCHEL, THE EARL OF ROSSE, AIRY, HAMILTON, LE VERRIER, ADAMS.To give an idea of the content and style of writing I copy the first two phrases of the first astronomer featured in this book, Ptolemy:The career of the famous man whose name stands at the head of thischapter is one of the most remarkable in the history of humanlearning. There may have been other discoverers who have done morefor science than ever Ptolemy accomplished, but there never has beenany other discoverer whose authority on the subject of the movementsof the heavenly bodies has held sway over the minds of men for solong a period as the fourteen centuries during which his opinionsreigned supreme.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of astronomy or science, and of course to everybody who is interested in any of the astronomers depicted in this book. I did find the manner in which this book was written quite dull and lifeless ('2-stars'), but because of the information it gives (worth '4-stars') I give it a '3-star' review."},{"Title":"Great astronomers","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

It explained the physics very well so that I was able to understand better such phenomena as the movements of heavenly bodies and the effects of their gravity however small, the precession of the equinoxes, the invention of the calculus. The discovery of Neptune was an amazing story. Knowledge was gradually accumulated over the centuries due to the hard work, dedication - often lifelong - and brilliance of these astronomers. Their biographies were most interesting as well.

This book which comes at the end of his many years of scientific study is a work of spiritual speculation. In it he develops a picture of the overall development of humanity in which the physical laws of entropy operate on the material realm but are compensated for spiritual laws, pointing in the direction of a higher moral order. His work in this sense resembles that of Teillhard du Chardin.Here is a pssage of Lecomte du Nuoy explaining his fundamental idea.\\"Things occur as if energetic order, the decline of which can be demonstrated statistically by the increase of entropy, were replaced by the evolution of organized beings, by an increasingly complex organization in a domain escaping statistical laws, the field of individual actions that do not depend on the principles we announced. The march of the material universe towards an inherent chaos, towards nothing, would therefore be compensated by the simultaneous progression of an imponderable universe, that of the spirit, whose order and perfection would stem from the ashes of the unorganized world'This is a profound, difficult work one require much thought to understand. My own sense however is that putting much time in this work will prove very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Human destiny (A Mentor book)","review":"Pierre Lecompte Du Nouy was, possibly, one of the greatest all round scientists of the 20th century and personified the description of \\"natural philosopher\\" in that he was, predominantly, a thinker.Prof. S Hawkin has said that scientists once knew quite a bit about everything, nowadays they are so specialised that soon we will have a scientist who knows everything about nothing!!!! Lecompte Du Nouy had learning in depth and breadth!In addition to this he was a man of faith,,, but a faith fed by reason,,, and \\"Human Destiny\\" explores not how the universe works, but the why it is.His style is part scientific report, part science teacher and can, because of this, seem ponderous and pedantic. But one has to bear in mind that he is aiming the volume at a non scientific readership, and a readership of an age where modern physics was still a largely unfathomable idea.I thoroughly recommend this book to all of open mind who wish to explore the possibility of something more than the materialistic world of today, scientists, theologians and laity alike.(PS. Lecompte Du Nouy follows this work up with \\"The Road to Reason\\" a major critique on the philosophical processes contained in \\"Human Destiny\\", well worth purchasing as a companion!)"},{"Title":"Human destiny (A Mentor book)","review":"A pesar de publicarse hace varias decadas, este libro muestra una actualidad sorprendente en donde demuestra cientificamente la existencia de Dios y la evolucion del Hombre hacia la perfeccion espiritual."},{"Title":"Butterfly (Observing Nature)","review":"My daughter is crazy about butterflies and learning about them. I've always loved them too so we are having fun reading about them. We have read many library books about butterflies and this is one of the best. Beautifully illustrated and informative, the book has fourteen, two-page sections plus a glossary and index. An alluring feature that should be in every book to test/improve reading comprehension is a review called \\"Life of a Butterfly\\" that uses a picture along with a word or group of words for children to remember the main point of each section they read. If they don't know the answer, they can go back to the appropriate section to find out.Here are the contents along with a brief summary of each section:1 WHAT IS A BUTTERFLY? (Butterflies are insects. The wings have patterns made of colored scales the size of dust.)2 BUTTERFLY OR MOTH? (Butterflies fly during day, have long thin feelers, are brightly-colored and close their wings when resting. Most moths fly at night, have hairlike or feathery feelers, thicker hairy bodies, and cannot close their wings.)3 HIBERNATION (Some butterflies sleep during the winter in a safe place for up to six months. Other butterflies hibernate in a shell-like chrysalis, and some fly to warmer areas.)4 MATING (Butterflies feed on nectar of flowers. When you see them, you know spring is here at last. After a few weeks, they are ready to mate.)5 THE EGGS (Laid on underside of leaves or are scattered as they fly, hundreds are laid and eggs may hatch in a few days.)6 THE EGGS HATCH (The caterpillars eat their way out of the tops of their eggs. They have eight pairs of legs, no wings, and large jaws for eating leaves.)7 GROWING UP (Caterpillars grow quickly so they have to shed their old skin which is called molting. When the caterpillar sheds its skin for the last time it becomes a pupa enclosed in a chrysalis.)8 THE CHRYSALIS (Hangs upside down to a plant. Metamorphosis occurs.)9 A NEW BUTTERFLY (The chrysalis opens in about two weeks. The butterfly emerges and crawls up onto the empty chrysalis to dry. After one hour the wings dry and the butterfly is ready to fly for the first time.)10 FEEDING (Butterflies have a special long tongue [probiscus] for sucking up nectar.)11 ESCAPING FROM DANGER (Butterflies are often eaten by birds. The peacock butterfly has patterns on its wings that look like eyes. They eye patterns look like the eyes of an owl which frightens away birds.

One day, a farm boy named Eargon, went to hunt in the Spine. He came back with a giant blue stone.

The problem I have with the series is that it is just too over the top. Ted Rockson is apparently able to do anything in these books and often does, to the point of absurdity. It seems that there seriously is only one man that can save america from the russians, ted rockson! The author of the novels seems to write it so that the only american in the novel that understands combat tactics is rockson, in the 1st chapter of the 1st book he pulls off some stuff that is so insanely over the top that it was real hard for me to continue reading. The author also goes to great lengths to insure that the hero of the story is also the most interesting character in the book, he has eyes of 2 different colors and a stripe of white hair down the middle of his regular black hair. Also the author for some reason thinks that 9mm is the coolest ammo in the world, often having the characters use their 9mm \\"liberators\\" for uses that the ammo is not designed or good for. The use of grenades by the characters is stupid also, one character is written as pulling the pins on 2 grenades and throwing them at helicopters. it should have been written as he attempted to pull the pin on a grenade with his teeth and yanked out 2 of his teeth and then the helicopter shot him for being an idiot. So if you want a book packed full of miracle shots, a godlike hero completely surrounded by a bumbling renegade american force that relies soley on him for ideas, and idiotically over the top action sequences, this book is for you. or your children, whatever. just don't buy it full price."},{"Title":"Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest","review":"These remarkable recordings by Peter Dennis deserve more recognition.This particular recording won a Parents Choice award but it's not mentioned here."},{"Title":"Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest","review":"I was very pleased at first to discover the hardback cover version.

Returning it would have been silly, especially since that involved additional S&H. I believe I have used this seller before with better results. This time was disappointing."},{"Title":"Rogue Herries (Herries chronicle)","review":"The Herries clan is covered by Walpole, focusing on Francis Herries, who has mood swings which one would treat with drugs today, but was let loose on the Lake District in the late 1700's. His estate, family, trials and tribulations make for an interesting novel.This was the first Walpole book I read, mostly because &quot;Rogue Herries&quot; was mentioned in Monty Python's Cheese Shop sketch. I was very happy with my decision to pick up the novel, however, as it made for an interesting period study of a desolate region of England. This is one of Walpole's series of novels featuring the Herries family."},{"Title":"Rogue Herries (Herries chronicle)","review":"This is the first volume in a series of four tracing the fictional Herries family over the period of time between the 18th and the 20th centuries. Francis Herries, called Rogue because of his wild behavior, brings his son David, his wife Margaret, and his mistress Alice Press (who is actually the family's governess) from London to the long-abandoned family estate in Cumberland County, England. Having married out of pity more than love and now growing tired of the demanding Alice, Herries lives a life of dissipation. Margaret dies, his children grow up and marry, and then he is introduced to Mirabell Starr, a beautiful woman who is living with gypsy thieves. They marry, but she is, ironically, as wild as the young Rogue Herries was, and she leaves him. He spends years searching Europe for her, and finally finds her and convinces her to return with him. She becomes pregnant and both she and Francis die on the day she delivers their newborn daughter. Walpole's high Romance is handsomely developed and he writes with great energy and imagination. The opening chapter captures the reader's interest completely, and the scene in which Herries is brought to Mirabell by the thieves is very good. It's the best of the Herries novels, and one of Walpole's most solid creations."},{"Title":"Rogue Herries (Herries chronicle)","review":"As mentioned in Monty Python's Cheese Shop skit \\"Well, I was, uh, sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through Rogue Herries by Hugh Walpole, and I suddenly came over all peckish.\\""},{"Title":"Two Guys Four Corners: Great Photographs, Great Times, and a Million Laughs","review":"Listeners of Don Imus already &quot;know&quot; about his photographic acumen, because he constantly brags about it. This lovely book is proof of his abilities. Those of us who can't visit the desert Southwest often will feel more than fulfilled by the variety of breathtaking photos that Don and Fred have compiled. I bought this book for my husband's Father's Day, and gave it early, because I didn't want to wait for his reaction (he loves it). My third grade daughter took it to school for show and tell because they had just studied the Mesa Verde, and she had never seen pictures so vivid. We warned her and her teacher SEVERAL times to cover the text. (The kids were blown away by the photographs, while being protected from the F-word.) Fred's rainbow and Don's slot canyons are so compelling they are hypnotic. I do not buy coffee table books, and Two Guys is not one of those. This collection transcends all &quot;genres.&quot"},{"Title":"Two Guys Four Corners: Great Photographs, Great Times, and a Million Laughs","review":"It's hard to look at these beautiful photographs and not read the captions, since the captions take up a whole page opposite the photo. I like both Don and Fred, think they're amusing fellows. I can't imagine why they didn't make the captions more entertaining or enlightening, instead of sophomoric or irrelevant. Who cares that Don went back to the truck for a pack of cigarettes while Fred took a photo? Does this enhance your enjoyment one iota? Bless the Wee One, this is a major disappointment. Almost but not quite worth it for the pictures, you won't want to leave this lying around on the coffee table when your in-laws or children are around. (Or anyone with an ounce of intelligence.)

How many times does the phrase &quot;fat tourists&quot; need to be said in order to make a point?(At least three in this book along with other derogatory mentions.)The text seems to be an afterthought and probably could have been omitted all together.

But for me, it was great. The best caption I've seen so far is the simple, &quot;We found Madonna's baby in here.&quot; You'll have to see the picture to understand.

I have always loved them!When I discovered this book, I was thrilled. The patterns and illustrations are gorgeous. Definitely a more contemporized country, which is more my style. The surprise came when I realized there were more craft projects than I had expected.There's some gorgeous patterns for quilted pet pillows, a variety of beautiful pillows and quilts, plus some cute garden accents to paint. Being a crafter, for longer than I can remember, it was abit of a surprise as I was expecting just quilting and sewing. But there are some cute craft ideas in this book, for instance a painted watering can with a flower and bees, a couple planters and a lampshade with leaves and acorns painted.My favorites are illustrated on the front cover, the 'Weather Outside' wallhanging, coordinating quilt and throw cushion, and even a pet cushion. My next favorite would be the 'summer' lap quilt and pillows, done in red, cream and navy stripes (like a basketweave pattern).If you're looking strictly for patchwork, or more traditional quilting, this book probably would disappoint. If you're more like me and enjoy a more contemporary version of country or americana, you'll truly enjoy the book. Just remember that about a third of the book has painting/crafting projects."},{"Title":"A Walk in the Park: Acadia's hiking guide","review":"We just returned from our first trip to Acadia and were lucky enough to have rented a place that kept a copy of this book for their guests. We made great use of it while we were there. It makes it much easier to decide where to hike and what kind of terrain will be encountered. We could have used a map to plan routes, but this book did it for us AND described WHY a hike was better in one direction versus the other. Things we never would have known just from a map. It made our hiking adventure much better planned. Had we known sooner, we probably would have bought a better trail map than the one the park issues. The maps in this book are adequate, but sometimes it was hard to tell where we were in relation to the rest of the park and a better park trail map would have solved that.

He has treated hundreds of men and women and has taught hundreds of physicians this exciting new field of medicine. He has been my teacher since 1997, and I have returned to several of his conferences because of his vast knowledge, high integrity and thorough understanding of his patients, of physiology and of hormone replacement therapy. As a Board Certified Anti-Aging Physician, I am pleased to recommend this book to men and women who want to understand the concepts of bio-identical hormone replacement better, and who worry about the misinformation, confusing information and biased information that is rampant in the medical literature which makes it difficult for even an experienced physician to say with certainty what all these results mean. This book will clarify for you what was confusing and cite many reference articles for you to follow up your further understanding.Why is there so much confusion out there about hormone replacement? To really grasp this, one must understand the political and profit motivations behind many of the studies, and understand the physiology of the endocrine system very well. Dr. Rouzier has such understanding and knowledge coupled with a tremendous sense of integrity, and a great compassion for people who want to feel well and want to learn how to take charge of their health.What more is there to say? He has a co-writer who has helped him to deliver a book that captures his great conversational style of instruction, is readily understandable, even to people who are not in the medical field. It also has an extensive bibliography for people who are in the medical field and want \\"proof\\". If you can't find the book here, look up Dr. Rouzier online."},{"Title":"Natural Hormone Replacement for Men and Women (How to Achieve Healthy Aging)","review":"In Natural Hormone Replacement Therapy for Men and Women: How to Achieve Healthy Aging, Dr. Neal Rouzier explores the experiences of his patients as they step from fatigue to fantastic.

The stories of his patients illustrate personal triumphs over the pitfalls of aging, while the studies from peer-reviewed medical journals give these personal testimonies confirmation.Read this book and find real answers rather than poor excuses like, \\"It's your age.\\" Your age is no excuse for poor health or constant fatigue.

Instead I found that our heroine is a woman, like a lot of us, who have a tendency in falling for the wrong man. Finally, after expressing the wrong sentiment in trying to break off a relationship, she's left both physically beaten and emotionally battered. She then decides to take off to a remote spot in Otnip, Colorado where she has promised herself a moratorium on any involvement with the male species. Starting up a business she could operate from home-- calling and checking on the elderly and homebound -- Miranda has successfully secluded herself with only one neighbor to contend with. Unfortunately that one neighbor, Billy Steadman, just happens to be a handsome devil with a charming way about him. Billy himself had chosen to isolate himself, after his loving wife had died nine years earlier. Now, after seeing Miranda, Billy was ready to reenter the world of the living, only Miranda was doing her best at keeping him out.Thinking originally that this would be more of a humorous chick-lit type, I was treated to a more poignant and thoughtful tale. Miranda, was a wounded soul, very cautious after failing at relationships with men. Over the phone, she could be more open, yet she still hid and held herself back. It took the combined efforts of some of her elderly clients and friends of Billy to finally bridge over the misconceptions that both held of one anther as they slowly (ever so slowly) came together. While I did find this an interesting and original plot - it's lack of action made it a much slower read than I would like. The originality of Miranda's business - touching base with the elderly - I found quite admirable though, so for those looking for something a little bit more original than the norm would enjoy this. --- Marilyn, Official Reviewer for www.historicalromancewriters.com ---"},{"Title":"Miranda Blue Calling","review":"I loved this book! The characters are engaging and charming. The love story unfolds subtly at first but becomes very involving as the story comes to its climax. I find myself thinking about the characters and wishing I could peek in at them again. I'm buying copies for my sisters and some friends. It's a great summer read!! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Miranda Blue Calling","review":"First take on Miranda Blue is a fun, breezy read with clever patter and quirky characters--not unlike a 1940's Cukor movie. Think Myrna Loy meets Melvyn Douglas out on the range. But within the Girl meets Boy, Girl Disses Boy, Girl Seeks Boy plot are some intriguing musings about the fundamentals. About escape and withdrawal, about ambivalance and bluster, and about the courage of becoming a grown up. Miranda is a sharp, smart, compelling charmer--who despite having more edge than a badlands butte has lived a largely passive life. Not that she hasn't been places and experienced things. But she is someone to whom things happen, the proximally worst being beaten by a thuggish boyfriend. To stop any more things from happening, Miranda retreats to the middle of nowhere Osnip, CO. And soon she finds herself with a suitor, in the form of her similarly smart, edgy, emotionally wounded and otherwise reclusive neighbor. This is familiar ground for Miranda--she's been found, she's being pursued, and she can both outwardly disdain and inwardly enjoy the more-than-neighborly interest that is routinely on her doorstep. This is an admittedly lean social-, not to say romantic, diet Miranda is on (interesting that her seeker is a gifted farmer, who attempts to woo her with food). And for a while the kabuki between Miranda and Billy (the farmer with flare) creates the teasing tension of all charged romances. But Billy knows he wants more, and dares to break through the banter barrier. (No small feat for a guy whose favored read is the Maltese Falcon, in which the hero recruits reason and rules to overcome his attraction to a homicidal hottie). Yet despite Billy's declarations, Miranda continues to balk, until at some point the anesethesia of her social isolation is no longer enough. The question is, is Miranda willing to assume the active tense? Is it enough for her to wait for a second chance, or will she instead make things happen? Get the book and find out. You may be gently surprised at who that blue girl resembles."},{"Title":"Miranda Blue Calling","review":"Miranda Blue, as quirky and engaging as her name suggests, spends her days as a telephone companion to the elderly and infirm. She keeps the details of each client on a series of index cards and knows the cares, concerns and interests of each one, providing them with friendship and intellectual stimulation while struggling valiantly to keep the details of her own personal life private. It's a job, and so much more, for which Miranda is perfectly suited. She cares about her clients and makes it a point to be there for them. It's also a business that allows her to be her own boss and live in the middle of nowhere.Now why, you might ask, would a young, attractive woman choose to remove herself from society and reside in the small Colorado town of Otnip (yeah, it's Pinto spelled backwards) away from all human contact except that which she has with her clients? Perhaps to escape from a know-it-all sister or recover from a string of failed relationships with bad boys, the most recent of which culminated in physical abuse. The thing is, while Miranda Blue is trying to get away from it all, her only neighbor, a sexy, single greenhouse farmer, is busy trying to get close to her.Billy --- a widower, grower of hydroponic tomatoes, teacher of meditation and keeper of fish --- has made a poor first impression on Miranda but a great impression on her dogs. Along with perpetuating his bad boy image by telling her that he grows marijuana, he has the misfortune to be hauled off by the police in front of Miranda's wide and wondering eyes. That's enough for her! No matter that he's the most interesting, attractive (and irritating) man she's seen in a while --- her resolution stands. No more bad boys!Billy is not taking no for an answer, though, and he'll do whatever it takes to get close to the intriguing and enchanting Miranda --- even if he has to resort to spying on her with a telescope, where he sees more than he intended, insinuating himself into her life and even using her dogs to get closer to her. When a woman like Miranda comes along, a man like Billy will do what it takes to win her heart.You'll enjoy getting to know Miranda and Billy and find yourself rooting for love to win out in the end as you turn the pages of MIRANDA BLUE CALLING. Michelle Curry Wright --- a native of Seattle, Washington and a current resident of Telluride, Colorado, where she lives with her husband Gary and daughter Celine --- brings us an agreeable cast of characters, a quirky heroine and a charming story of the irresistible power of love.--- Reviewed by Amie Taylor"},{"Title":"Miranda Blue Calling","review":"Six years as a Broadway icon for failure makes Miranda Blue wonder if she should leave Manhattan for her home town of San Francisco or her childhood vacation spot in Colorado. Her sister just back from India adds to Miranda's need to look within, but somewhere else. She realizes she has failed with men and failed with everything except the city transit system to include the ferry. Since San Francisco feels like the west coast equivalent of where she is now, Miranda decides to go rural, vowing no men as she relocates to Otnip, Colorado.Knowing she has a gift of gab, Miranda starts a telecommunication service for senior citizens. Her neighbor, Billy Steadman is a hunk, but his garden house efforts to reach her are rejected by Miranda who adheres to her no male pledge. Billy tries to get to her heart through her dogs and she cannot help but feed his fish. As the temptation of Billy rises, Miranda decides to ignore her resolution and take the plunge, but alas he has a secret and soon leaves without word ending their relationship before it can forge into anything permanent.MIRANDA BLUE CALLING is an engaging chick lit tale starring a delightful protagonist whose wit and observations keep the tale focused. Miranda is a terrific lead character while the somewhat enigmatic Bill is a steady counterbalance trying to break down her resistance using every trick in the book especially her canines and his fish. Fans of insightful character studies will want to call Miranda Blue as she struggles to do what is right for herself.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Basic Fluid Power","review":"I purchased a used book, it is in very good condition for the price.

The more I read, the prouder I am - and I'm late to the library, life itself having stood in my way these many years.This book is a must-read for anyone searching for those who truly paved the way for the country we know now as America - during dark days when it most assuredly meant your neck if you dared question the British Government of Control. It is a self-described testimonial to the Great Men of The American Revolution, and, perhaps even more importantly, the Pre-Revolutionists - who somehow have never seemed to take their rightful place in History's \\"Recognition of the Event\\" along with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and the rest - as they surely deserved.James Otis, in particular, stands apart, as by his natural gift for putting thought and feeling into words that others could relate to, was the actual \\"Catalyst\\" for the American Revolution; the man who, by his defiance of personal danger, blazed the trail for those who were inspired by him, such as John Adams, who was present in the courtroom during his daring exposure of the \\"Writs of Assistance\\" for what it was - the intrusion into the homes of the people without due cause. The oft-repeated phrases such as \\"A Man's Home is His Castle\\", (a direct reference to the King) \\"Taxation Without Representation\\" can be traced to the fountainhead of James Otis. (page 541 in \\"The Adams Jefferson Letters\\" , John Adams remarked: 'Samuel Adams contribution to the Revolution is beyond all calculations; I know of but one Superior to him and that was James Otis'. \\"I truly believe, after having read this much about him, that the only comprehensible reason for the lack of recognition afforded him might be - possibly - traced to the fact that he lost his mind, Victorian attitudes being what they were back then. There could have been several reasons for this medical condition; the violent attack he suffered at the hands of a mindless nondescript in the heat of the disputes; early Alzheimers, which was an unrecognized diagnosis at the time; the unimaginable stress he endured within the times in which he lived and during the dangerous Revolutionist protest he undertook to liberate the rest of us; or a chemical imbalance easily treated today with prescription drugs.God Bless Those Men, Every One. (I say this not so much as religious symbolism, of which they strove to moderate in their united stand for the principle of \\"The Separation of Church and State,\\" but as a tribute to a beloved Heritage; a beloved Tradition.) These simple truths, must endure through us to our \\"Posterity\\" as the precious rights they fought and gave their lives for, were willed to us - for if life not sacrificed on the field of battle, then through the selfless devotion they contributed to the developing and nurturing of the fledgling Constitution throughout their lives.And, in the immortal words of Abigail Adams - \\"Don't Forget The Ladies\\". Some of them sacrificed their entire lives too, living entirely through their husbands passionate work. The book pays homage to those that History chose not to afford nearly enough credit to, and perhaps, in the case of James Otis - that will, of necessity, have to change in time.Additional recommended books regarding American History:** \\"Miracle at Philadelphia\\" by Catherine Drinker Bowen** \\"Three men of Boston\\" by John r. galvin** \\"Jefferson\\" by Thomas Jefferson (Library of America)** \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" by David Hackett Fischer** \\"American Colonies\\" by Alan Taylor** \\"The First American\\" (Franklin) by H.W.

But this work, along with &quot;The Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot; and &quot;Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious&quot; are for all readers.

This books is no light reading, even for those accustomed to reading serious books. Freud's style presents no difficulties, but moral courage is needed. Nevertheless for those courageous enough there is also enormous entertainment here. Personally I find it extremely difficult to read it often. It's too dense and challenging. And much of it is also deeply flawed because the author was overly confident. Despite all this, this may well be the greatest book of the 20th century, and those who want to take the challenge ought to try it. My pragmatic advice is to skip the first chapter, which is a rather dated review of literature."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Most reviewers see the value of this great work, which lays out the dynamics of the unconscious mind. Others have a variety of misconceptions: first, he was not a cocaine addict. He misunderstood cocaine [as most people did] and, briefly, recommended it to others, including his fiancee. When his close friend died of it, Freud realized his error.Second, one reader states that you can't find &quot;measurements&quot; to prove anything about dreams. As one who has practiced in the field, I can say that the reader can measure the truth of Freud's theory by using it to understand him or herself, by analyzing one's own dreams.The dynamics of dreams are:first, dreams are phylogenetic, i.e., inherited as a species; they are not ontogenetic, i.e., created by environmental factors.R.E.M. studies have shown for fifty years that our eyes move rapidly while dreaming as is we were watching a film. However, all of the people in a dream are different fragments of ourselves, of our wishes, of our interests.Second: this phylogenetic inheritance includes an innate propensity to think in pictures. Moving up the scale of consciousness, in Ucs. [unconsciousness, thinking is mostly pictorial but sometimes verbal]; in Pcs. [preconsciousness, i.e., in daydreaming, thinking is pictorial and verbal and partly in our control]; in Cs. [consciousness, thinking is mostly verbal but partly pictorial].Dreams have two main dynamics: one, displacement [in which the mind protects itself by displacing the troubling thought with a symbol]; two, condensation [in which the mind places symbols on top of one another in layers in order to make the troubling thought hard to find].Schizophrenics are hard to understand because much of their thinking is dominated by displacement and condensation while they are awake. Their speech has numerous layers of symbols - condensation.In displacement, there is a manifest meaning [that which appears evident] and a latent meaning [that which one has to dig for by piercing the condensation of the displacements.Any thinker, who chooses to simply understand, should avoid preconceptions or anger or a need to disdain or to repress. He or she should merely use the dynamics of dreaming to unravel his or her own dreams and daydreams [which can be analyzed with the same dynamics, except it is much easier because condensation is not as severe].Freud was originally sceptical of his own insights and, as a result, he sat on this work for about a year, being reluctant to believe himself. He finally realized he was being defensive, that he was trying to repress disturbing truths about himself that were also true of us as a species.In analysis, the analyst doesn't speak much because the best person in a position to understand himself is the patient . . . just as the best person in a position to understand his/her dream is the dreamer. Further, an analyst doesn't talk because he wants the patient to speak until he/she finally understands him/herself. That takes time.It takes time for a person to crack the layers of condensation in his/her own thinking and to see all of the displacements.After 100 years, Freud's book remains one of the great gifts anyone ever gave men and women to understand themselves."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This is the book that started the revolution in our view of human psychology: it uncovered the (always disputed) existence of the unconscious mind as well as created an entirely new mode of thinking about the human psyche.Strangely enough, it is also a fun and very informative read: there are great case studies of patients, charming autobiographical asides, and a rigorous snapshot of the science of dreams at the time. It is also beautifully written: ironically, though never the recipient of the Nobel prize, Freud did win the Goethe prize in Germany for his writing style. As Walter Kaufman said so eloquently, with his rich ironies and attention to the individual, Freud offered a way to reintroduce poetry into science.Certainly, much of what Freud thought is now disputed and discredited. Like Copernicus, whose model of our solar system failed in many respects, Freud also made fundamental errors, in particular his notorious over-emphasis of sexuality and the phallus. But we do not blame Copernicus for not seeing what Kepler, Newton, and later Einstein discovered: we value him as a step towards the unknown, as a pioneer, however timid. Freud will come to be seen the same way, as the discoverer of the unconscious mind.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud's thesis, The Interpretation of Dreams, can be summed up as follows - all dreams are the mind's subconscious effort at wish fulfillment. For some dreams this is obvious - if you eat salty foods before going to bed, you may then dream that you are drinking water. This is a simple example of you wanting something and your subconscious trying to fulfill that wish. For most dreams, quite a bit more analysis is required to undercover what exactly you are wishing for, and Freud dedicates the bulk of his book to giving examples of such analysis. Freud argues that dreams are distorted because the upper layer of the mind is trying to censor what the lower layers of the mind are wishing for - usually out of embarrassment, guilt, etc. For example, I may be envious of my friend's success, so I will dream that my friend fails, but I am also embarrassed at wishing ill will on my friend, so the dream is distorted - perhaps the activity that he fails at will be obscure, twisted, strange, etc. Freud also makes the point that all dreams have their trigger in the preceding day's events, and once triggered the dream has access to all the experiences a person has gathered during his lifetime, as long as the experiences can be linked back somehow to the trigger event. Since the mind thinks in terms of symbols, the dreams must by analyzed by trying to understand how the various symbols can be translated into wishes, or the suppression of wishes. Thus the inner layers of the mind, or the Ego (prime desires), will generate a basic wish based on the experiences of the previous day. The Super Ego (refined sense of culture, guilt, morality, consciousness, etc.) then regulates the Ego's basic wish to fit within the mind's framework of right and wrong behavior. The greater the conflict between the Ego and Super Ego, the more distorted the dream becomes. All dreams are wish fulfillment, without exception.Freud successfully makes his point within the first 75 pages of the book - the remaining 400 pages are a dry, archaic, tiresome, and in my opinion are not worth the time to read. Much of the book is dedicated to analysis of the dreams of either Freud or Freud's patients. Since Freud lived in early twentieth century Germany, the dreams described are anachronisms and for the most part are irrelevant. Also, I think a lot of meaning is lost in the translation from German to English.Bottom line, Freud successfully explains the fundamental truth on dreams, put this pioneering analysis is archaic and difficult to read by today's standards. For the layman, I would look for something more current."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"This book changed my life in a profound way. Freud taught me that everything is connected. He used dreams to illustrate this. During the few weeks I was reading this book, I began looking at everything around me as possibly symbolic and/or connected.

Freud can teach you to see the meaning in your dreams, but these lessons apply to all of life.Freud also has such a disarming way of writing that I felt as if I knew the man as a friend once I was done reading."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Easy to read and perfectly inteligible for the averagenon-professional reader like me. This is the most important book written by Sigmund Freud and is in the Freudian tradition of writting some books which focus on difficult issues with a rather simple to understand language and fine style. The purpose of the author, in his own words, was to disturb the sleep of mankind.This is the kind of book that will help you a lot in understand the mechanisms behind one's dreams and all the relationship between what Freud calls your \\"waking life\\" and your \\"dream-life\\". Before going on interpreting a lot of his and his patients dreams, something that took a lot of personal sacrifice to someone so jealous of his private life as Freud, the author introduces us to the then (1899) accepted theories of dreams, which basically took the dreams as irrational and confuse manifstations that didn't have nothing to do with our real or waking life.The rationale Freud uses to demolish the anti-Freudian myths is powerful and convincing and he even suggests that reading the book will have some effect on our immediate dream life (it happened to me). Despite quite voluminous (700 pages) it deservs the attention and the effort of all of us who want to understand what dreams are all about. Here also, one reads the first paragraphs Freuds devotes to the Oedipus complex, and one has the opportunity to explore along with Freud the mechanisms of the UCS (unconscious) and of our Conscious activities, which some decades latter would lead to the concepts of Ego, Super-Ego and Id.As a trademark the text is always polemical, remembering this same quality one faces in Marxists texts."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Although Freud's ideas and psychoanalytic theory haven't fared that well in recent decades (Jung's views and reputation have actually done much better), there is no doubt that Freud's ideas were a major contribution to the understanding of human behavior and the mind and remain at least historically important today. Although perhaps superceded by the cognitive and neurobiological approaches that have developed in the last few decades, Freud was still a brilliant thinker who changed our undestanding of the mind for the better.For example, although his idea of the ego, super-ego, and id are now being supplanted by more physiological explanations (the limbic system of the brain being a very good analog to the id), nevertheless, basically what Freud was saying was that a shaping process goes on during early childhood that results in the formation of relatively enduring personality characteristics. There is no doubt that this developmental idea still has validity to this very day.However, while I certainly respect and admire many of the early psychologists, and they were great pioneers in many ways, and some of their ideas are still important, nevertheless, a lot of what they said has to be taken now with a considerable grain of salt, and the area of dream interpretation is one them. It doesn't mean that dreams are completely valueless, but they're of much less significance than has been claimed in the past. The most serious critique of the psycholanalytic (and others) view of dreams comes from recent research into the brain and neurobiology. The problem is that dreams are really not what people think at all most of the time--which is some sort of cyptic but profound message from the unconscious mind.For example, consider the question of why most dreams seem to consist of collections or sequences of difficult to interpret images, thoughts, and memories that seem to be combined or strung together in a not very logical and difficult to interpret fashion. The reason why, contrary to the popular belief that this reflects some profound and not easily discernible meaning, is that the order really is almost random, or is governed by very weak associational processes. The reason why this is, and why most dreams seem so puzzling and difficult to understand is that when you go to sleep, the memory areas of the brain located in the temporal cortex become more active through a process known as corticocipedal disinhibition, allowing memories, images, and thoughts to flood into consciousness willy-nilly. This is prevented or inhibited during normal waking, otherwise the flood of thoughts and images would interfere with normal memory retrieval and thinking processes.This is a little off the subject, but one area of pseudo or quasi-scientific theory and speculation that has been getting a lot of attention lately (and shows how much more sophisticated the more fantastically oriented or perhaps \\"mystically\\" oriented types in psychology are getting) is the idea that the brain is a \\"quantum computer\\" and uses quantum mechanical and even multi-dimensional spatial capabilities to do its work. At least one world-famous physicist and mathematician, Roger Penrose, has suggested it himself. (I critique Penrose's proposal on this in my Amazon review of his book, The Large, The Small, and the Human Brain).However, although a fascinating idea, there is still no real evidence that this is in fact the case. Neurobiologists have drawn analogies between devices like SQIDs (super-conducting quantum interference devices) and nerve cells, but this is reaching a bit.One main problem for me would be the noise factor. There is already a huge amount of random noise in the firings of nerves in the human brain and quantum mechanisms are far below the level of this noise. The brain seems to ignore the high noise level just fine and to operate pretty well despite it and so I don't see how quantum effects which would be far more subtle would have much of an effect.The other main problem is that the brain typically shows a huge amount of integration and convergence in its mechanisms, and phenomena at the level of quantum effects would probably just get lost in the overall convergence process or even the resting level of noise. Another way to think about it is how likely quantum effects are to manifest themselves at the molecular level, let alone the cellular level or the level of a neural circuit or the entire brain.So until there's some real evidence, I remain sceptical, and this is probably another \\"mystical\\" idea that will probably go the way of all the others.But anyway, getting back to the present book, that little digression was really by way of pointing out that unscientific speculation has been rife in psychology from its birth in the mid-19th century with thinkers such as Rudolph Lotze, Paul Brentano, Wilhelm Wundt, Johann Fechner, Hartmann and the Scottish faculty psychologists, Janet, Freud and the other psychoanalytic theorists, and many others. It's just getting harder for the layman to recognize this sort of thing when he sees it since their ideas are more and more taking on the language of physics and engineering and neurobiology. But that doesn't mean it's not the same old unfounded speculation and mystical nonsense."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"I just got my 2007 edition copy of \\"Interpretation of Dreams\\" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it.

She gives an insightful introduction to Freud that is well referenced. However, her style is absolutely monotonous and was far more difficult to complete than Freud's writing which was to follow. What Crick has done well with this version is that she has retained certain significant or vague tests in German (original) with their translations as parentheses, footnotes, or explantory notes. She has also added value to the version with an extensive package of explanatory notes after Freud's work. In addition, her translation of Freud's work \\"captures the lightness and pace of Freud's style, freed from the jargon and Victorian elaborations of James Strachey's famous version.\\"On Freud's work itself, The Interpretation of Dreams was a revoluationary paper of its time, discussing for the first time, concepts such as the Oedipus complex and the practice of psychoanalysis. Freud explores his personal life with this paper, enriching the reader with his self-analyses. However, I felt he over did the case studies, presenting several examples of a single concept, which was for me perhaps a little long-winded and tiring to read, especially if his first examples were good ones, and presented the concept/s acutely.The pace of the paper picks up at the start of each new concept and tends to wind down and even drag at the middle or end portions. Towards the end however, his pace dramatically picks up (and no, it's not a placebo effect), as he summarises and pulls all his concepts together in an attempt to hold on to the reader and deliver his final call to action. Overall this is an outstanding read that delivers esteemed perceptivity to the faculty of psychoanalysis, how we perceive and interpret the arts and literature, and on the variety of complex languages with which we do so.

But, his wish fulfillment theory of dreams is definitely wrong both concerning its origin and its consequences, as explained below.Freud began to interpret his patients' spontaneously reported dreams by likening them to daydreams and psychotic hallucinations. Everyone knows that daydreams are produced for fulfilling wishes in an imaginary way, and psychologists know that most psychotic hallucinations constitute imaginary fulfillments of wishes frustrated in the waking state. But, likening waking-state products to sleep-state products does not look realistic, because the waking state is a time for fulfilling wishes, whereas the sleep state is known to realize resting and self-restoration rather than realizing new successes and gains. So, Freud's first step in dream interpretation was most probably wrong.Nevertheless Freud became convinced that dreams meant wish fulfillments because of two dreams that he misinterpreted, as explained below.Pepi's dream: Medical student Pepi H. was late to wake up one morning, and the landlady called through the door: \\"Wake up, Herr Pepi! It's time to go to the hospital!\\" He dreamed that he was lying in bed in a room in the hospital, and there was a card over the bed on which was written: \\"Pepi H., medical student, age 22.\\" He went on sleeping, thinking that he was already in the hospital.It is evident that Pepi had, in the disabling state of half-sleep, the incompatible wishes of staying in bed and going to the hospital. Both of these wishes were fulfilled by the image of him in bed in the hospital. This cannot be considered a true dream because of several reasons: (1) Pepi was in a state between sleep and wakefulness; (2) both of his wishes belonged to the waking state instead of being activated in the sleep state; (3) his two wishes frustrated each other; and (4) therefore the image of him in bed in the hospital, which fulfilled both of his wishes in an imaginary way, looks more like a psychotic hallucination than a true dream.On the other hand, the image of the card on the bed, which was apparently produced after he fell asleep, can be considered a true dream element seeking to terminate the failure to go to the hospital by conveying the following message: \\"You are not a patient, and you are not a child; you are a medical student of age 22! So, get up and do what you have to do!\\" The last part of this message was only implied.We see that, after baselessly likening dreams to psychotic hallucinations, Freud had the bad luck of encountering a mental product that was half hallucination and half dream and took it for a true dream. Below is a dream that is similar to Pepi's dream.A man who had been driving all night was desperately trying to stay awake and to keep the car on the road, or rather to keep the road in front of the car, as he later remembered. The car jolted twice with no apparent reason, and he woke up in a cornfield. We understand that the image of the road in front of the car had become a hallucination caused by the wish and the failure to keep the road in front of the car in the disabling state of half-sleep. It is also possible that this hallucination was then replaced by a \\"sleep-preserving\\" dream when sleep prevailed. Thus, a hallucination was produced in the state of half-sleep and was then transformed into a dream when sleep took over, just like it happened to Pepi.Freud's dream \\"Irma's injection\\" (Freud 1900). This dream of Freud's about a hysterical patient of his gave to him the final conviction that dreams meant wish fulfillments. He had it 9 months before he delivered his lecture The Etiology of Hysteria, in which he exposed his seduction theory of hysteria, according to which this disorder is caused by sexual abuse suffered in childhood. This means that the thoughts expressed in this dream were produced in conformity with the seduction theory. But when he published the interpretation of this dream in his book on dreams, he had already switched to the fantasy theory of hysteria, which said that this disorder was caused by repressed unacceptable fantasies, or wishes, of sexual nature. Thus, the dream's thoughts were based on the seduction theory of hysteria, whereas its interpretation presented by Feud in his book was based on the fantasy theory. But despite this discrepancy, Freud produced an interpretation that is correct to a great extent. He misinterpreted only the part of the dream that explained the cause of hysteria and the part that said that hysteria was incurable, as shown below.The dream is about Freud's failure to cure his patient Irma. Many psychologists believe that Irma represented Freud's patient Emma Eckstein and others like her, whom he had failed to cure. Freud recognized correctly the subject of the dream as the presentation of several causes of his failure to cure Irma. For example, Irma did not cooperate with Freud and did not believe his interpretations, which must have been based on the seduction theory, and physicians ignorant of hysteria influenced the therapy negatively. Freud interpreted these parts of the dream correctly, including even the part that accused Freud of believing a physician's wrong diagnosis without examining the patient himself. He had to say, \\"the material was, one might say, impartial.\\" We can say that the dream expressed the truth, as it was known to the dreamer, as Jung believed. The accusations directed to the physicians were realistic external attributions of Freud's failure. Freud interpreted them as \\"revenge on other doctors\\" and \\"derision of physicians who are ignorant of hysteria.\\" The dream accused physicians of ignoring that hysteria was caused by sexual abuse, as explained below, whereas Freud implied that they ignored its cause explained by the fantasy theory.The dream explained the cause of her illness as sexual violation and declared that it was incurable because it was impossible to undo the violation. This is the part that Freud misinterpreted, knowingly or by mistake, which in reality carried the following message: \\"Physicians thought that hysteria could be cured by physical, physiological intervention, but this is absurd, because hysteria is caused by sexual violation which cannot be undone. You all directly know that your colleague who was staying with her gave her an injection. Injections of that sort should not be made so thoughtlessly. That was a dirty injection, and you know very well what it was.\\" The negative idea that hysteria could not be cured by physical/physiological intervention is expressed in the dream through an absurdity (this being one of the means of expressing negative ideas in dreams): Someone suggested in the dream that dysentery would intervene and Irma would be cured. This absurd thought exposed the physicians' ignorance, but also the fact that sexual violation could not be undone and therefore hysteria could not be cured. This dream shows clearly why Freud chose to lie about the cause of hysteria and switched from the seduction theory to the fantasy theory of it. Evidently, he had thought that the only means of curing hysterical patients was to deny that the sexual abuse had happened. That was the only means of \\"undoing\\" the abuse which was said by his dream to be impossible.Freud's overall interpretation of the dream was that it \\"represented a particular state of affairs as I should have wished it to be. Thus its content was the fulfillment of a wish and its motive was a wish.\\" So, Freud became convinced that dreams meant wish fulfillments by summarizing the meaning of Irma's dream taking into consideration only what he liked in the dream and ignoring, for example, the accusations directed to him by the dream and the fact the dream said that the real cause of hysteria was being sexually abused.Freud's final belief about the meaning of dreams is this: \\"A dream is a (disguised) fulfillment of a (suppressed or repressed) wish.\\"One of the arguments that Freud used to support his wish fulfillment theory was that the mind could do nothing but fulfilling wishes, and because realistic wish fulfillment was impossible during the sleep state, it was done in the form of perception. This argument is obviously wrong, because the mind does plenty of preparatory work before it can actually fulfill a wish, and much of such work can be non-pleasurable. Ignoring these facts, Freud interpreted everything in a dream as an actual wish fulfillment, as exemplified by his misinterpretation of his Irma dream, which presented, for example, several non-pleasurable causes of his failure to cure Irma. I have shown elsewhere that a complete dream contains three types of thought (expressed in Freud's terminology): the frustration of a wish, the causes of the frustration, and the means of fulfilling it. Irma dream was about Freud's failure to cure her but did not present a means of fulfilling it and said instead that curing her was impossible, this being his honest opinion.Freud's idea of the disguised fulfillment of suppressed or repressed wishes had one more source. He wrote in his letter of January 3, 1899 to Fliess: \\"I now understand why in spite of all my efforts I have not yet finished the dream book . . . . I shall be able to present the psychic process in dreams in such a way that it also includes the process in the formation of hysterical symptoms.\\" How Freud \\"discovered\\" that psychic process is explained below.Freud's friend Fliess claimed that hysteria could be cured by a surgical operation performed on the nose of the patient. Freud believed him, and Fliess performed an operation on Emma's nose on February 20, 1895. On March 6, 1895, a second operation was performed by another friend of Freud, and half-a-meter of gauze was removed from Emma's nose. The gauze had been accidentally left in by Fliess and had caused excessive bleeding that had nearly killed her. Nose-bleeding continued even after the second operation and was probably a consequence of the two operations. But Freud wrote to Fliess about Emma on May 4, 1896: \\"She became restless during the night because of an unconscious wish to entice me to go there, and since I did not come, she renewed the bleeding, as an unfailing means of rearousing my affection.\\" And he wrote to him on February 19, 1899: \\"It is not only dreams that are fulfillments of wishes, but hysterical attacks as well. This is true of hysterical symptoms, but it probably applies to every product of neurosis.\\"We see that Freud's wish fulfillment theory of dreams and symptoms was a consequence of baseless generalizations, misinterpretations of some dreams, invalid arguments, and the wrong and wishful interpretation of a physiological phenomenon. Thus, Freud's theory is untenable as far as its origin is concerned. It is equally without proof concerning its consequences, as explained below.Freud believed that every event that a dreamer could associate with the images of his or her dream in the waking state was part of the meaning of the dream. And he interpreted all that material as wish fulfillment by using devices such as displacement, inversion, and other types of disguising to make the dream fit his theory. It is evident that any event can be interpreted in any way one wishes by using such devices. Even this procedure shows that Fred's theory is wrong.Freud's theory is refuted also by the difficulty he experienced in explaining the emergence of anxiety in dreams and his total failure to interpret the so-called \\"incest dreams.\\" He wrote in a footnote added to a later edition of his book on dreams that anxiety was experienced in dreams by consciousness when an unacceptable wish was fulfilled without being sufficiently disguised. But if this were true, \\"incest dreams\\" interpreted as wish fulfillments would be dreams of highest anxiety, which is not the case. They are found revolting in the waking state by being interpreted wrongly as wish fulfillments. I explained elsewhere that \\"incest dreams\\" mean that sex partners must intimately know, love, and respect each other. The wish fulfillment theory has not been useful in psychotherapy either.However, to repeat, Freud's book must be read by anyone who studies dreams, because it contains about 220 dreams and valuable information about the dreamers' life experiences related to their dreams. The book also contains some of Freud's own dreams, of which the correct interpretations tell much about his life experiences and the true geneses of his theories. Moreover, the book exposes the importance of unconscious thinking, although Freud misinterpreted the contents of the unconscious and the aims of its products, as I further explained elsewhere.Cognitive-Behavioral Cybernetics of Symptoms, Dreams, Lateralization: Theory, Interpretation, TherapyTheory Construction and Testing in Physics and Psychology"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's &quot;Interprettation of Dreams&quot; has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of &quot;Love and Madness&quot;"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary.

There is a very common saying that the three most influential persons in the 20th century are: Karl Marx, for his book stirred up the world-wide communist revolution; Albert Einstein, for his General and Specific Theory of Relativity and his contribution to the nuclear weapon program of U.S., which changes the nature of war, good or bad; Sigmund Freud, for his theory attempted to reveal the true nature of human beings and denounce the absurdity in religion.The book is the ealiest publication of Freud. He suggested many revoluntionary theories, and the later theories he developed were fundamented on that . One of the most significant book of Freud, I can say.It deals with very normal but very difficult question: what is mind? Do we have completely control of our actions? Do we really know ourself? Then, it touches a philosophy problem: if we can't even control our actions, are we still responsible for every crime we commit? Is capital punishment correct? And then, if nobody actually has free-will, does what the heck is God doing on us? Does God exist? And it questions every piece of moral value of ours.As a philosophy student, I want to tell everybody that this book is as important as reading Bible if you have any certain desire of knowing what life is, and you are trying to figure out the true meaning of life, just like me, then you must read the book. Even though you disagree every single part of your dream might be concerned with sex, egoism, or violence, just don't afraid to read it if you are pretty determined that you are clean from that.Frued's Interpretation of Dreams is a logical explaination based on the symptoms on thousands of his cases. That is why the trueth-value is being doubted because it is still a pure hyponosis and you can't do any experiments to prove it; the scientist still can't understand the electrical function of our brains yet, and they don't know what experiment could they do to prove or disprove this theory.

Also, why do you forget your dreams soon after you wake up sometimes? Sigmund Freud answers that. Why does everything in your dream feel so real? Sigmund knows the answer to that too! Sigmund not only interprets dreams but he also explains such things as the psyche, psychology, psychoanalysis, psychosexuality, and the psychic apparatus, the Oedipus complex, and the Electra complex as well. According to Sigmund dreams aren't just stories made up while you sleep. Dreams are wish fulfillments; stuff you wish you could do while you are awake, or stuff you couldn't possibly do while you are awake. Every step you take, thing you do, and word you speak has an underlying, symbolic meaning (latent content in Freudian language), and interpreting that could quite possibly bridge the gap between consciousness and subconsciousness, resulting in a more meaningful life.

His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment.

In many ways, the book is the cover.I admire the heavy secondary research Freud put into his book. Keeping in mind Freud's ideas were gestating in the late 1800's, when there was none of the perfected scientific research and research methods that we have today. Like Darwin, Galileo, or Newton, Freud did so much with so little in the way of technological gizmos. This adds even a greater luster to his genius.However, there are two issues I have with Dr. Freud's methodology. First, his has a very odd universe of sampling, namely himself and his neurotic patients (136, 138). First of all, relying on his own dreams for analysis tends to make his research solipsistic, which is to say we may be looking more at Freud than his research and conclusions. Moreover, relying on neurotic patients does not yield statistically balanced data. His skewed sampling leads to a skewed conclusion.Secondly, Freud comes to the reductionist conclusion that all dreams are wish fulfillment. Keeping in mind the strange and limited universe of sampling, it is no wonder that Freud came to this rather odd conclusion. Part of the problem is that Freud completely ignored the creativity aspect of dreams. The classic example of the creativity in dreams is Elias Howe's invention of the sewing machine needle. He was an English inventor trying to invent the sewing machine. He had all the parts in place expect the needle, which was giving him problems. He fell asleep at his inventor's table and dreamt cannibals were chasing him, whose spears that had holes in the tops. He woke up and put the hole in the top of the machine needle, and presto! A new industry.I recognize that this book is an essential the historical literature of psychology. And I have no qualms about typical and ubiquitous Freudian sexology.

However it is different between the understanding and the assurance. I thought his assertion was false in spite of the logical coherence. All psychopathic phenomena derive from the suppression of the sexual desires! How foolish! For a rural young boy it seemed that &quot;Love&quot; by Standhal was more realistic. In a few weeks, I shut out the content of this book from my brain because I took it serious. This effect was too pessimistic to interpret the human being.This book shows two important results. At first, the psychopathic is understandable if the unconsciousness exists. At second, the neuroses disappear if the unconscious sexual desires are made conscious. These findings will help the understanding of the later psychoanalysis and psychiatry.As the unconsciousness is one of the most important discoveries in the 20th century, this book should be read."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Dreams are some of the most mysterious, most enchanting, and most sacred experiences in all of human existence--and yet they are also some of the most elusive, and so their meaning has been scrutinized by every culture of the human race, for thousands and thousands of years.In all of these inquiries, perhaps none has been more thorough, more scientific, and more systematic than Dr. Sigmund Freud's &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1900). In his book, Freud surveys the scientific research on dreams put forth so far (a remarkable achievement of scholarship in itself), and then puts forth his own theory of dreams.Dreams, Freud claims, are nothing more than a fulfillment of an unconscious wish. He supports his theory with analysis from a selection of actual dreams from his patients and from his own experience.Much of this book is entertaining and enlightening. Freud's good taste in literature is reflected in his own engaging style, and his sense of scholarly adventure is catching. Plus, he doesn't shy away from the big questions. How can we interpret dreams? How does a dream come about? What is the purpose of dreams? Why are all dreams wish fulfillments? What are the meaning of typical dreams, like losing teeth?--all these questions are tackled here. This is the book where Freud first puts forth his Oedipal theory.Freud's theory is always insightful, if not totally accurate. He seems to try too hard to make all the data jive with his &quot;wish-fulfillment&quot; theory, and when it doesn't, he resorts to ludicrous arguments reminiscent of Anselm's ontological catastrophe. For example, when a dream is clearly not a wish fulfillment, Freud asserts that it has actually fulfilled a wish--a wish that his theory is wrong. Poppycock.Despite these occasional stretches of reasonability, you'll come away from this book with a much greater understanding of the nature of dreams and the mental processes that bring dreams about. Highly recommended.This is a good intro to Freud; consider also &quot;Introductory Lectures on Psychoanaylsis.&quot;"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"It does not really matter whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud. What is important to acknowledge is that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Some of this revolution can be traced back to The Interpretation of Dreams, the turn of the century masterpiece that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Joyce Crick's groundbreaking new translation is based on the original text published in November 1899 and it is clearly a more readable and accurate picture of Freud's original work.It is apparent that Freud concentrates to a larger extent on the use of words in dreams and on the difficulty of deciphering them. Freud's ideas of dreams as wish-fulfillment, his ideas of the retelling of the dream as a continuation, as well as the dream's manifest and latent content, are covered much more clearly than in any of the later editions of the same text. The fact that Joyce Crick's translation is faster-moving and definitively lighter than previous versions enhances the understanding of the material and engages the reader. It established a sense of dialogue with the reader.While reading Joyce Crick's translation the author of the review remembered her first encounter with Freud's original German version Die Traumdeutung while she was an undergraduate student. The German version was definitely much more difficult to read and caused some confusion for the reader. The author valued Freud's elaboration on the symbols of dreams, but viewed the statement that all psychopathic phenomena derive from the suppression of sexual desires as difficult to comprehend (for an undergraduate student). However when comparing The Interpretation of Dreams with Freud's discussion of dreams in his work Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis it has to be pointed out that the latter is probably an easier way of gaining insight into his views about dreams. Dreams are covered in Part II of the Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis, which Freud delivered in two successive winter terms (running from October to March) in 1915-16 and 1916-17 at the University of Vienna. The new translation is targeted at the psychoanalytically minded postgraduate student or psychiatric registrar who had previous exposure and an understanding of basic concepts such as the preconscious, unconscious and conscious as well as the id, ego and superego. However some explanation about these concepts is provided at the end of the book.Freud's work on dreaming has recently regained interest because among many other opportunities, the ability to conduct studies in sleep laboratories and the neuropsychological assessment of brain-injured patients has assisted us in finding some scientific evidence for some of his theories. Neuroscience has proven that dreaming can be switched on or off by a neurochemical pathway whose main function is to &quot;instigate goal-seeking behaviors and an organism's appetitive interaction with the world&quot; (Panksepp, 1985, p. 273). This means that neuroscience has contributed to the evidence of a radical hypothesis that is more than 100 years old (i.e. that dreams are motivated phenomena, driven by our wishes and the dopamigergic mechanisms, the appetitive (i.e. libidinal) 'command system' of the brain (Panksepp, 1985, 1998)). The Interpretation of Dreams edited by Ritchie Robertson is meeting the challenge for psychoanalysis to refresh Freudian theory, &quot;which now has an unpalatable and distinctly post-Victorian flavor for many&quot; (Panksepp, 1999, p.35). It assists in moving psychoanalysis towards a modern and dynamic mode of thought that continues to be rejuvenated by the accumulating evidence in neuroscience, thus consolidating its presence in the twenty-first century.References Freud, S.

In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud may or may not have been a creative genius. Whatever else he was, however, he was enormously clever and remarkably well informed, with access to an astonishingly broad and diverse range of references. Moreover, he had an uncanny ability to pluck as needed from his well-stocked head a suitable allusion, concept, image, or idea to make whatever point he wanted to make. He was a prodigiously skillful ethnographer of the psyche, an activity that included the interpretation of dreams.Freud worked as one steeped in classical scholarship and also thoroughly knowledgeable in the science and practice of the medicine of his time. The latter body of knowledge included more scholarly material and sustained research concerning mental illness than many of us realize. Freud, moreover, was a capable practitioner who brought relief and even recovery to those suffering from a variety of neurotic symptoms, or so he reports, and I see no reason to doubt him, though he does seem unwaveringly committed to the notion that he's always right, a characteristic that might diminish his effectiveness just a bit.Nevertheless, I found The Interpretation of Dreams to be very disappointing. This may be due to the fact that my previous knowledge of Freud was limited to textbook accounts, which are often unreliable and seldom capable of capturing the genuinely brilliant insights of world-class scientists and scholars. Perhaps I was unprepared to appreciate Freud in anything stronger than a textbook distillation.I think, however, that there is a more serious problem, one that is intrinsic to Freud's work and pervasive in mainstream social and behavioral science even today. Freud was a functionalist. In this instance that means that once he concluded that all dreams were instances of wish-fulfillment, he unduly constrained his interpretations, and he made excruciatingly heavy demands on his interpretative powers. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to maintain the claim that all dreams functioned to serve this one end.By way of analogy, imagine that Freud was a contemporary ethnographer interested in the way schools work rather than what dreams mean. Imagine further that he proceeds from the assumption that all schools are organized in a merit-based way, producing young people who have been selected, sorted, educated, and allocated in accordance with their innate intelligence. There would be no surprise, then, when observing an elementary school classroom, his practiced eye and fine-tuned ear affirmed that assignment to ability groups was indeed made according to what Freud took to be intelligence. His meritocratic assumption seems correct.However, suppose another observer of the same classroom noted that there was also a very close connection between family income and ability group placement. This might be construed as suggesting that money brings advantages that may make affluent students seem smarter than they are, while the intelligence of students from families with little money is masked. Just like that, Freud's assumption that elementary schools function in a merit-based way is faced with a plausible alternative.At this point, Freud can either acknowledge that his functionalist deductions may have been wrong, or he can creatively argue that income is a good proxy for intelligence, say after the fashion of Herrnstein and Murray in their much celebrated and much maligned book The Bell Curve. Eventually, moreover, Freud will be forced to do the same kind of intellectual contortions with regard to race, gender, number of parents in the home, ethnicity, region of the country, urban or rural residence, and a whole host of other factors that are confounded with merit in the form of innate ability. Why should these seemingly extraneous factors serve as disguised indicators of brain power? Exactly the sort of conundrum that mainstream sociologists of education and educational psychologists find themselves facing today.Given Freud's demonstrated ability to come up with a seemingly endless collection of self-serving interpretations, however strained, stretched, and willfully contrived they may have been, he'd probably do quite well. The fact remains, however, that once he makes an all-embracing assumption -- that dreams function as wish-fulfillment, that schools function as meritocracies, that religion functions to assure social solidarity, ... -- he has boxed himself in. His interpretations have to serve the function he has assigned them. If his assumption was correct, it's all to the good, narrowing the scope of material with which he must deal. If he was wrong, however, he's in trouble.I found many of Freud's dream interpretations tortured, twisted, convoluted, wildly implausible, and unregulated in any way as to what constitutes suitable evidence. If Freud had been less clever and his cultivated intelligence had been less well stocked with variegated substance from every domain of knowledge imaginable, I think he would have been forced to concede that he was wrong. But Freud made what I take to be an erroneous assumption and then outsmarted himself, giving incorrect interpretations to dreams because of his initial dubious assumption as to the function of wish-fulfillment.Freud is to be commended for introducing extremely interesting and useful concepts such as censoring, resistance, over-determination, condensation, displacement, and dream work, and for helping us understand how these notions mediate the connections between the manifest and latent content of dreams. His bottomless grab bag of obscure references, abetted by his too-often stream-of-consciousness writing style, enabled him to make a case that all dreams function as wish-fulfillment. The case was often very weak, however, and his technique was inconsistent, sometimes using the dreams of psycho-neurotics and other times discounting them as aberrant. Truth be told, Freud's method of dream interpretation was constrained only by his unbridled functionalist cleverness.Yes, some dreams may function as wish-fulfillment, but it seems abundantly clear that many do not. Why Freud tied his brilliance to this dubious assumption escapes me. In any case, I give him credit for stubborn determination and boundless ingenuity."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Amazon and Pink Panda should both be ashamed of this 99 cent \\"edition\\", though in fairness, I suppose you get what you pay for, and I more or less assume the text is complete.

Don't; go here instead:The Interpretation of Dreams: The Complete and Definitive Text"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud was one of the first, and one of the most brilliant, psychologists to attempt a \`scientific' study of the mind. Freud attempted to explain and understand the dynamics of the psyche, not through mere casual observation or personal introspection, but through clinical experience. There are many scientists and philosophers, Karl Popper being the most famous, who have attacked Freud for being \`unscientific' in method and for failing the test of falsifiability in his conclusions.It must be admitted that any attempt to study the mind using the methods of objective science is going to run into some serious epistemological hurdles; hurdles that still have not been entirely overcome to this day. These epistemological questions are important questions and should be taken seriously. But in my opinion the people who are busy picking apart Freud's theories to see whether they are \`scientific', or whether they measure up to some preconceived notion of what a scientific theory should be, are asking the wrong questions. The question that should be asked is: have Freud's theories and writings increased our understanding of the nature and the dynamics of the human mind? The obvious answer to that question, in my opinion, is yes.The Interpretation of Dreams is Freud's attempt to understand the nature and dynamics of dreaming. We all take for granted the fact that we dream, but few of us ever truly begin to wonder at how strange a fact that is; and even of those of us who do only a few will go on and attempt to understand why we dream in any serious way. There were people who attempted to understand dreaming before Freud but Freud has come to tower above them in the same way that Adam Smith has come to tower above all the economists who came before him and probably for good reason.Freud puts forward some fairly counter-intuitive thesis in regard to dreaming. The first is that all dreaming is wish-fulfillment. This is the kind of claim that seems to fly in the face of empirical evidence, as well as our everyday understanding of the nature of dreams. I am not going to attempt to enter the debate in regard to whether Freud was right in this conclusion but it should be pointed out that this was a conclusion Freud was led to in his clinical experience, and the obvious objections to this theory (the existence of anxiety dreams for instance) were objections that Freud was well aware of and Freud deals with them directly in this book.The real meat of the book, in my opinion, is Freud's attempt to analyze the psychological processes that give rise to dreams. The fact that Freud begins with a counter-intuitive hypothesis, namely, that all dreams are wish-fulfillments, requires him to undertake the task of explaining how (and why) these wishes take the form of dreams as we know them. Dreams certainly do not appear to us to be wish-fulfillments. Freud has to explain why dreams do not appear on the surface to be wish-fulfillments and this requires him to work out a theory of psychic functioning which will adequately explain how dreams are formed.This ultimately is the reason why I say that Freud was one of the first to attempt a scientific study of the mind whether his theories measure up to the philosopher of science's standards or not. Freud's method is entirely different from the person who simply attempts to describe the nature of dreams by describing their pictorial form, their logical incongruities, etc. Freud puts forward an hypothesis and this hypothesis leads him to some new and startling conclusions about psychic functioning which would not be immediately obvious to a person merely engaged in casual introspection.In order to explain the form dreams take Freud first makes a distinction between the manifest and latent content of a dream. This is probably the central notion behind the whole book, and the reason, in Freud's opinion, that no one had succeeded in understanding dreams before him was because no one was able to make this distinction. Attempts to understand dreams before Freud focused all of their attention on a dream's manifest content. The latent content of a dream can only be discovered in the analytic situation by allowing the patient to free-associate in regard to different elements of the dream. Through this method one is able to discover the latent thoughts behind the creation of the dream.The dream is formed by a number of processes operating on these latent thoughts. One of the processes is condensation in which elements from the dream-thoughts are combined and condensed into a single manifest content. Another process is that of displacement in which psychic values are transferred between contents. The dream also has to deal with the problem of representability which Freud deals with extensively.There are a number of aspects of Freud's work which seem slightly primitive when reading him today. Freud was well aware that he was heading out into new territory and that many of his theories would have to be revised in the future as we learned more. But a person can still learn a great deal about the functioning of the psyche from reading this book, and not just about the formation of dreams. Freud's theory of dreams (as well as his theories on neurosis which are not dealt with directly in this book) required Freud to re-evaluate the nature of the human mind. He presents a new schematic of the mind and how it functions in the final chapter of the book. While some of this does seem slightly primitive today it cannot be denied that Freud's theories have profoundly altered our understanding of what it means to be human. No one who is interested in that question should skip this book (or Freud's other works)."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Freud believed that every dream would reveal itself as a psychological structure, full of latent significance, often beyond the accessibility of normal consciousness. It was in fact belief in this assumption about a hidden psychological structure that eventually led to the discovery of the unconscious and to the later mapping of the architecture of the mind.The discovery of the unconscious had monumental ripples across the intellectual landscape, especially in psychology and the aesthetic arts. It opened the gateways to the complexity of the mind and made it respectable to speak of the mind's hidden dimensions and their effects on both normal and abnormal psychological functioning.Here using subjects, with now famous pseudonyms, Feud describes how their \\"dream-content,\\" and the overt images of their dreams are in fact but the coded residue of latent thoughts and unresolved subconscious processing: Indeed, how they are little more than symbolic representations of deeply hidden ideas, feeling, and conflicts in these cases mostly of a sexual nature that have been unconsciously repressed, compressed, or suppressed beneath consciousness.The book demonstrates how dream content is deciphered under proper psychoanalytic techniques and conditions, and what those techniques and conditions should be. When the techniques are applied properly, the blocked content is gradually recovered, examined and made manifest to the patient under clinical control. The goal of the analysis is to allow this \\"recovery process\\" and the exposure to the patient of the blocked items - that is exposure to \\"what lies beneath consciousness\\" -- to give the patient relief from psychological stress, tension, and conflicts.Although many of Freud's theories have since come under careful scrutiny and sometimes withering criticism, \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" has remained one of his more enduing of his works. Because it is so cleanly written, as is true of all of Freud's works, and because it is Freud:Five Stars"},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"In a letter to his confidant and friend, Wilhelm Fleiss, the then middle aged neurologist, Sigmund Freud, was in the midst of researching and writing his beloved 'dream book'. He wrote the following:&quot;Now I have finished and am thinking about the dream book again. I have been looking into the literature and feel like a Celtic imp.&quot;Oh, how I am glad that no one, no one knows...&quot; No one suspects that the dream is not nonsense but wish fulfillment.&quot;Indeed, this is the premise of Freud's entire thesis: dreams are no more than repressed unconscious wishes, battling for expression and consummation.In his own words, Freud had 'dared' to rally against the 'objections of severe science, to take the part of the ancients and of superstition.' In 1900, the official year of the book's publication, its reception, despite its provoctive title, was tepid, and in the course of six years, only sold 351 copies. Freud never gave up hope, and 30 years later, in the preface of the third English edition, he wrote, &quot;It contains, even according to my present day judgement, the most valuable of all the discoveries it has been my good fortune to make. Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once a lifetime.' In present day, one can question any Freud scholar about ~The Interpretation of Dreams~ and they will say the same thing: the book contains everything that 'is' psychoanalysis.Anyone interested in the history of psychoanalysis and the mind of Sigmund Freud, reading this book is an absolute must. The reading runs along too, quite easily, as Freud was an excellent writer: his unique prose style even shines through some clumsy translations.If you are interested in the book's process of development, I would suggest reading ~The Complete Letters of Sigmund Freud and Wilhelm Fliess~; another gold mine for understanding the growth of psychoanalysis."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"Deified by secular academia in the 1960s, Sigmund Freud has become increasingly disparaged - despite the circumspectness of his arguments - and his popularity become increasingly eclipsed by his student Carl Jung. But for readers of James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (clearly a small group) Freud is an invaluable resource for understanding dream consciousness: Eg, Freud suggests crucial ideas of a \\"universal grammar\\" of dream-consciousness. (See also the linguistic works of Noam Chomsky, and Leonard Bernstein's video lecture The Unanswered Question.)1. NO-NOThe subconscious doesn't understand negatives - (\\"no, not, never\\") - instead perceiving them as affirmations. Like Molly Bloom's repetitive \\"Yes\\" as she drifts off into sleep at the conclusion of Ulysses, Freud posits there is no negation in sleep. Rather, negation can only be expressed by the subconscious as ideas inverted or otherwise made insensible. (Joyceans, see Joseph Campbell's appraisal of Picasso's handling of mythic imagery).2. OPPOSITESA vague idea may signify its opposite. Freud compares this to primitive proto-language etymology, in which either pole of an extreme is expressed by one and the same word. (Joyceans, see any page of Finnegans Wake and page 38 of Ulysses - \\"contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality\\").3. CONSUBSTANTIALITYConflation of ideas and persons is employed by the subconscious to short-circuit \\"inner censoring\\" and \\"prefrontal control\\". For example, supposedly-not-dreamed-about Mr A is indirectly indicated in a dream because Mr B appears in that dream wearing a hat usually associated with Mr A. (Joyceans, obviously this is the essence of Finnegans Wake.)Again, an invaluable resource for Joyceans.

His theories, particularly those of this volume, have become such an integral part of daily discourse that most people fail to even realize how much they buy into the psychobabble. However, Freud must be viewed as a philosopher, not as the scientist he believed he was. His conclusions are either backed by superficial research or, more commonly, no research at all, and this book's most famous theory, that of the Oediple Complex, is argued (poorly) through literary examples, not scientific ones. The fact is that Freud is simply following a long-standing METAPHYSICAL tradition of dream interpretation which goes all the way back to Ancient Greece and Biblical tribes. All he does is invent his own gods to send the messages. The underlying motives for the book are quite obvious, though often overlooked--this paranoid cocaine addict wished to deal with his own psychoses by projecting them onto everyone else. We laugh at comedians when they tell of common acts of stupidity, mainly because we are relieved that we're not the only ones who do such things. Similarly, Freud, who fell in love with his mother when he saw her naked at age 2, concluded that everyone must want to sleep with their mother, because to do otherwise would be to admit that he was mad, which indeed he was. This is not to say that the book should not be read, only that it should be read because of its influence, and not because its ideas have any validity whatsoever."},{"Title":"The interpretation of dreams","review":"For all those who need to get their baloney straight from the horse's mouth, this book is all the Freud you need to decide: visionary or fraud.

Certainly he'd never have argued that because a patient's stomach hurt during a painful recital of an early memory, this indigestible piece of emotional trauma was &quot;caused&quot; by the gastronomic rejection of a burnt piece of toast eaten just before the session. OF COURSE psychical activity has a physical substrate. And, perhaps, vice versa. What he'd have wanted to know was: in what psychological situation was all this embedded?One can't help but admire the boldness and honesty with which Freud presented his own dreams and associations. We might speculate in hindsight that Irma, the partially cured patient whom Freud tried to talk out of her hysteria, showed up in his dream with throat and stomach symptoms and an illness caused by a bad injection to protest the way he injected women with his sex-etiology theories, thereby in effect silencing their true voice; and smile at Freud's dream of an orator named Lecher, a dream he had shortly after accepting a position in which he did a lot of public speaking about psychology.But that we can speculate thus we owe largely to the techniques inspired by Freud himself.

After reading this book I have a renewed zeal to live life more fully as a Dad with my children. Gregory reminds us that our children are in fact not our children but God's. This book is a must read for anyone - especially for those having difficulty coping with the loss of a loved one. Gregory's story offers hope. Gregory didn't write this book...Gregory said yes to God to be the vessel for these words. I fell more in love with God as a result of reading this book. I also learned what a privilege it is to be a Dad and that our children our God's children....simply on loan to us; destined for eternity with God the Father in Heaven."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"To the believers and more importantly to the non-believers, all of whom bear their own burden of sufferings, Gregory Floyd (and his wife, Maureen) have opened a door to tremendous hope and consolation with their hearts overflowing with love, compassion and understanding. For everyone who has felt the lost of a loved one, this book speaks to the broken heart and allows the healing to begin. This is truly a father's love not only for his son but for his family and friends and now it reaches out to all of us. Not only do we see how a man loves his God, wife and children but how we should love these as well. I have also listened to the music composed and song by Mr. Floyd, &quot;Angel in Disguise&quot; and was equally moved and uplifted by the power of his words. I expected no less from his book and I was not disappointed."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"Gregory Floyd has done just what the title suggests. He has let us see and experience his journey through a parent's worst nightmare come true - the tragic death of their young son. This is no pie in the sky Christianity, but a journey through Hell on earth screaming for answers. You will be challenged right down to your socks in what you believe life is all about."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"I bought this book not for me, as such, but for my wife as I am not the one who really needs it as I am the one who is dying and I know, having suffered after my father's death, that grief can be a terrible thing. I came across this book having seen a rerun of an interview between the author and Mother Angelica of EWTN from the late 90s. I found Gregory Floyd very impressive indeed and took note of his book.Having read the book I can say that this is a wonderful contribution to the literature on bereavement. Whilst the book is dealing with how a father copes with the death of his son, the lessons to be got from the book, apply to any grief situation. In the early parts of the book we can see and feel Gregory Floyd literally oozing pain but yet not defeated, still retaining his faith in God. He, his wife and his family have the most extraordinary faith which made me feel ashamed of my own lack of depth - he learns to embrace the cross - he knows that the hope of seeing his son again does not take away from the fact that his grief must be worked through - the grief coupled with hope and joy belong together.In many ways Gregory and his family were very fortunate, not just because of their great faith but the fact that they belonged to a vibrant Catholic community of strong believers - undoubtedly this sharing of the burden by friends helped him through this dreadful crisis.Don't be surprised if in reading this you find yourself regularly in tears, we begin, as readers, to share the enormity of their cross and begin to share in the horror - this is testimony to Gregory's marvelous communication skills - he is an excellent writer. The great grace he received is the ability to see that in some way his enormous cross is in fact a great gift - this is in itself an extrordinary mystery. As someone who has suffered a lot and continues to suffer I too share that insight, knowing that by embracing the cross I am doing the will of the Father. Let me just quote a short piece to show how good Gregory's insight is:\\"The problem is that often people think the theological reasoons for hope displace the psychological reasons for grief. They do not. When a child dies, one grieves> One experiencess heaviness, pressure, desolation, loneliness, sadness, disruption in patterns of eating, sleeping and relating. One is exhausted emotionally and physcially. This does not mean one has no hope; it simply means one has an abundance of grief\\".Thank you Gregory for such a wonderful book. I am going to get some more copies of your book to give to friends and family because it is a valuable treasure."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"This is the hardest subject to have to talk about or help another/ loved one/parent with in this world. My family member lost their child and had a hard time understanding the most un-understandable thing in this human world. I gave this book to them and they read it immediately. They said of all the books and wisdom that was offered by others, this was the only one that helped them. It is referred to over and over again in those moments of sadness and sorrow. Thank you Mr Floyd and may I offer you my deepest sympathies at the lost of your precious son John Paul. I have also listened to your visit with Mother Angelica on Mother Angelica Live several years ago. I recommend this program to others in this situation/sorrows and it has been so inspirational and helped so many who have lost a child. Your stories are so beautifully expressed by the goodness of your own soul. Please write more books and or speak to this matter.

I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"This was a difficult book to read -- because it's difficult to read through tears. Reading this account of the death of six year old John Paul Floyd and the unveiling of the grief process for his father, mother, siblings, family and friends was sad but also uplifing as Gregory Floyd allows us to enter into his thoughts, his prayers, his anger, his questioning of God, his extreme love of God, his fire-tested faith in God, and ultimately his hope. This is an important book that should be read by all who have suffered the loss of a loved one -- and a book that should be read by all parents and grandparents. You will consider your children and your grandchildren in an entirely different light after reading this powerful book. Thank you, Gregory Flood, for sharing your pain and your hope with us. I am a better person for having read this book!"},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"This book is the attempt of one father to come to terms with the anguish, the heart-break, the devastation, and the questions that arise when tragedy strikes. Others books have attempted the same. The great English apologist C.S. Lewis wrote a book entitled The Problem of Pain, exploring these difficult questions. It is interesting to compare it with a book he wrote later, after his wife died of cancer. His A Grief Observed does not so much refute what he wrote earlier, but in many ways goes far beyond it.A theoretical and theological reflection of suffering is one thing. A first-hand personal account is another. A Grief Unveiled is of the second type. Not that theological and biblical reflection is absent. But this is the very personal and very moving account of how one father copes with the worst pain imaginable, moments after the event, hours after, days after, months after, and years after. What does the journey of grief look like from the inside? This volume is an unforgettable account of one long and painful trip through grief.For anyone who has experienced any comparable tragedy, the book will echo similar thoughts and emotions, and will bring forth many tears. The book does not over-sentimentalize, but neither does it over-spiritualize. It is brutally honest and totally real.Anyone who suffers will resonate with these moving chapters. Yet it is not just a book about sorrow, grief and pain. It is also a book about hope, joy and victory. It is the story of a radiant faith; a faith that takes a terrible hammering, but a faith the survives and grows and triumphs. But it is triumphant faith because it has as its object a triumphant God. Indeed, God is the real subject of this book in many ways. It is only because of the great love, grace and mercy of God that the Floyds can make it through the valley of the shadow of death.The opening chapters are the most painful. Descriptions of the accident. Cradling a dying boy. The nervous wait at the hospital. The bad news from the doctor. Watching a lifeless boy in a casket, bandages over the eyes, because the organs were donated. The burial. The days immediately thereafter.The grief seems unbearable. But with time comes some relief. The hole in the soul is always there. It will never disappear. But the intense pain and grief slowly, and surely, begin to subside. And through it all, one believer's relationship with his God is sorely tested, but in the end, vindicated. And with it comes the spiritual understanding that comes with the suffering, the realization that the God we serve is a suffering God.God the Father knows all about suffering. He too lost a son in tragic circumstances. And Mary, the mother of Jesus, also knows the heartbreak of losing a beloved son. But as Floyd makes quite clear, Good Friday is followed by Easter Sunday. John-Paul is not dead, but alive, waiting for the glorious reunion that will one day take place. The promise of the resurrection is the believer's hope. And the resurrection of Jesus is the guarantee that we too will one day be raised.But it works both ways, There can be no Easter without Calvary. Suffering is the path chosen by Christ, and it is the path his followers must also accept. The hard questions may never fully be answered. But the ultimate answer to the problem of suffering and evil is not a proposition but a person. Jesus, who is acquainted with grief and familiar with sorrow, is the only one who can offer comfort and hope to those who suffer.If God can take the most horrible and painful event in human history, the cross, and turn it into the most glorious and blessed of events, then there is hope for us as well. Suffering can be redeemed. It can make us more like the one who knows all about suffering.This book is a testament to the way the death of one man two thousand years ago becomes the basis of hope for everyone today. This powerful story will help those who are suffering to make it through. And it will help all of us to get our priorities a little more straight, and help us refocus our attention on what is truly important and of value in life."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"The specific circumstances of our son's death and his age were different than Mr. Floyd's child.

In it, a devout Catholic father graphically walks you through his family's experience of suddenly losing his seven year old son. It is heart wrenching, deeply moving, and beautifully inspirational. It's a relatively short book, and easy enough to read, but the average reader may be shocked by the extraordinary faith of the author and his family. It is loaded with solid orthodox Catholic teachings, without minimizing or taking away any of the real pain that they suffered. It is definitely one of the greatest pastoral resources I have ever encountered. Highly recommended for clergy, bereaved individuals and families, and support groups."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"This book brought healing to me that I could not imagine would ever come.

Still awaiting to hear from the medical examiner what caused her untimely death. She collapsed after a snow shoe trek at Environmental Camp in the White Mountains of NH.I have bought a number of books during these painful weeks, and this book was the only book that I felt I could have written - at least the first few chapters. It was like what we experienced was written down and black and white. He describes everything perfectly.I loved the book because it gave me great comfort that we WILL feel joy one day ... we don't know, nor can we even begin to think we will ever feel joy again.One of my favorite lines in the book was ...Our friends brought us God's presence and love. They did not solve our problems, as if grief were a problem to be solved. They did not dispense pious phrases. Our friends allowed us to be in as much pain as we were in and did not trivialize it by trying to move us beyond it ....Our friends, family, community, were a blessing from God during the darkest days of our lives and they continue to be.

His insights are for ALL Christians, and will benefit the non-Christian as well. Gregory shares poignantly about the world - wanting to provide only worldly comfort, some Christians who only wanted to offer &quot;spiritual&quot; consolation, and how the most precious who reached out to him and his family were those who BLENDED the heavenly and earthly realities. He gained insights into how all Christians are called, albeit in different ways, to bear their share of the suffering of Christ to ultimately experience the true JOY of Jesus. I can't say enough how every Christian will benefit from reading this book: it will help men to see the need to not be afraid to show their feelings (after all - &quot;Jesus wept&quot;), and will enable them (through reading of Gregory's many examples with helping his wife and children deal with the death of John Paul) better husbands, fathers, and spiritual heads of their households; it will speak to all of how to deal better with catastophic personal suffering, or improve their consolation and compassion on those around them who are in the throes of some form of suffering.

This book is the &quot;Schindler's List&quot; for marriage prep. Without it, &quot;For better or for worse&quot; is a glib statement, by two egotists who are unprepared when that &quot;worse&quot; (whatever it may be) inevitably rears its head. Because I'm reading it before my wedding, I have a firmer grasp (like cement) of the importance of the commitment, the experience of a family (albeit a large family), and confirmation of that ever-present presence of grace, God's grace, still flickering while nearly everything else is in shambles.While the story is agonizing to tell, Gregory Floyd handles such impossible material with grace. There's great potential for the book to be a dual threat: to be emotionally draining, and repetitive. Granted, it's both, but it's never boring. The book grabs you by the jugular and causes personal introspection to take over. I was reminded of how a child can have a dual personality, angelic wonder intermixed with a carnal longing for playtime and candy, all within a half-hour. I was encouraged by his friends and large family, and reminded of the blessings of what a family could mean. I was floored by the powerful words of wisdom of Fr. Philip Merdinger at the funeral mass, the stunning reassurance that where Johnny-Paul was, he would never want to leave. All this and I'm still not halfway through.Most people wouldn't consider getting a book like this until (God forbid) this sort of tragedy strikes home. Don't wait until then... you will not have the strength to read this. Don't be intimidated by the material... it's easy to read, it flows, it goes down easy (if easy is the best word). Though it all, my hope in families are invigorated, and my faith in God is reassured (like fire)."},{"Title":"A Grief Unveiled: One Father's Journey Through the Loss of a Child","review":"There are no words to describe what an amazing book this is.

His answer may be interesting not only to Mr Earley but to many readers of this well written and useful book. My friend permitted me to quote him and I do it with pleasure.'Hard to know where to begin to comment on the despicable Aldrich Ames. First, his actions. His was the particularly venemous form of treason that doesn't just expose hidden details of science or industry or political planning--which some rationalize as spreading necessary knowledge orimproving the prospects of peace. What he was doing, instead, was destroying the day to day work of his own colleagues and friends, murdering individuals as selectively as if he were aiming a gun at each of their heads, and clearly and directly diminishing the security of his own country (moreover, a democracy no more imperfect than any other). That he did sucha colossal thing simply for money suggests not just disloyalty but an extraordinary, almost inhuman, lack of conscience, decency or morals. In other words, a monster.By the way, I don't accept justification by comparison with similar revelations from the other side in the Cold War. There was not only the difference in regimes east and west, but especially in punishments. Certain execution (and punishment of families) cannot be compared with a few years in a Western prison.I suppose one could also comment on the degree of Ames's access. His job was somewhat similar to one I held a generation earlier, and I can testify that he knew, or could find out, just about everything we were doing clandestinely against our principal adversary. Seen from the point of view of the KGB as a counterintelligence organism, he was prettty close to perfectly placed.A fascinating aspect of the case is the blindness of CIA to this menace despite blatant signs. &quot;No man so blind as him who doesn't want to see&quot;--but in this case, &quot;seeing&quot; was the paid responsibility of many within CIA and the prime mission of some. That they failed, almost willfully, tells you all you need to know about the capacity of Americans in the field of counterintelligence. One old vet told a reporter, &quot;Thiscouldn't have happened in Bagley's time.&quot; Indeed, I would have forced their goddam noses down into the smell of treason that filled the air for nine years before Ames was finally caught--though maybe I wouldn't have succeeded any better than I did under somewhat similar circumstances in my own time (...).&quot;To this honest and professional comment, which I fully support, I'd only like to add that one crucial element is missing in Mr Earley's narration, and that is the fact, that Ames would probably be never identified as a spy if it were not for a Russian defector, who brought the final evidence to the otherwise dying investigation. So a proud CIA team featured on the photo should not actually be proud, but ashamed."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I cannot add very much that hasn't already been stated in these spaces. The reader, however, must remain aware that this book is very self-serving to Mr. Ames. Like John Walker, he finds excuses for his abominable actions by blaming others: the CIA, the federal bureaucracy, our &quot;consuming society,&quot; his wife, his mother-in-law, etc. The book, however, is very well written and informative. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Confessions of a Spy captured every aspect of the spy life of Aldrich Ames. It was fantastic. Even reading this in 7th grade, I had no problems understanding it. The book showed exactly what both sides were up to, and kept the pages turning. Outstanding."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"This is a great book if you want to know virually everything about Aldrich Ames and his vision of himself but BETRAYAL is an easier read. CONFESSIONS OF A SPY is something that you study. It seems to go on forever and Ames really enjoys having someone who hangs on his every word. Ames becomes the teacher and the author is the pupil. Ames really enjoys the dialogue but you may grow tired of it after a while."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Aldrich Ames' met with the author for several sittings after he was jailed and without the government's permission. That was just one more offense in a career of treason, drunkenness, slough and almost revolting passivity. Yet this man not only sent as many as 25 agents to their execution, he also spared no information to his KGB handlers. At times, he would be rooting for our side by day and by night he would have reversed and treacherously divulged everything he had previously learned.Of course the answer is how? Despite the agency's superiority in resources and technology, they retain a dangerous and imbecilic \\"he's one of us\\" mentality. Ames repeatedly failed to follow protocol. He was spending money like a madman and while there were a few who were convinced of his guilt, the amount of time and the ultimate leakage that occured with every day was shameful.Interestingly or not, the CIA has satellites that could zero in on Brezhnev as his dacha while he was being detained-but when it came down to getting the goods on Ames, they were more like the Keystone cops. Stealing trashcans, going door to door as salesmen, til someone called the cops and all of the vaudeville that one associates with those types of blunders. The book is far more flattering to the 'bureau,' who took full honors for the arrest even though there had been an agency team that had first fingered Ames and his wife.The underlying issue for me was a) how the nature of espionage seems to be more about getting moles than about truly gathering intelligence and b) the astonishing lack of effective ways to figure out if someone is working for the other side. All of which, indicts or acquits the nature of being human in a world of frightening homeland security and total information awareness. Getting the info is apparently easier than managing it and logically acting on behalf of the constitution- not an ideology. There has been nothing discovered that has solved that problem. I really enjoyed reading this book and having some insight into diplomacy and superpowers and flawed characters all over."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I was reading \\"See No Evil\\" by Robert Baer and he briefly mentioned Aldrich Ames and decided to read a book on him. While looking for books, I was pleasantly surprised to find one written by Pete Earley. I had read \\"The Hot House\\" a couple of years ago and found Earley to be a very clear and detailed writer. I really could not wait to receive the book. My expectations were high and they were met and exceeded. The book details Ames' life from birth, it details his parents, his entry into the CIA, and ultimately his betrayal of the country. The thing I love about Earley is that he leaves no loose ends. You're never left saying, \\"but what ever happened to...\\" or \\"I wonder who that is...\\". He's a very clear writer who introduces every subject in the book. He explains the facts sharply and thoroughly, and the pacing is perfect. Earley not only gives you the details, but draws you in with a story line that adds suspense. Earley is similar to other great non-fiction writers such as Stephen Ambrose, Jon Krakauer, Simon Winchester, Mark Bowden, or Kurt Eichenwald in that he takes a real event and tells it gripping way.On the negatives, there was not an index in my book which made it difficult at times. Also, Earley was not able to get interviews with everyone involved, in particular Ames' first wife, but at the time I'm sure not everyone wanted to participate with the media.The most important aspect of the book is that Aldrich Ames cooperated with Earley with face to face interviews while awaiting trial and later through letters. But Earley did not take everything Ames told him at face value, he is not lazy or sloppy, he fact checked and questioned everything. He even fact checked with Russian KGB which demonstrates how dedicated he was to the subject. Is it definitive? Definitely not because it came out so quickly after Ames arrest (before revelations of Robert Hanssen) but it is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Apparently this book by Pete Earley is the best of those written on Aldrich Ames because he had access to Ames while in prison, spoke to Ames' handlers, and the family members of the Russians who were executed due to Ames exposing their working for the United States. Greed is always there to raise its ugly head as Ames admits he betrayed America for the money. Ten Russian individuals were recalled to Russia and executed with a bullet to the back of the head due to their exposure by Aldrich Ames. After divorcing his first wife Ames married a materialistic foreigner from Colombia named Rosario who indulged herself in clothing, expensive dining, and an otherwise extravagant lifestyle. To me Ames' wife Rosario paints herself as a victim while previously enjoying the high-living lifestyle her husband's treachery made possible.Throughout the book author Earley provides the verbatim words of Ames regarding his treachery along with the views of former colleagues, high school students, and friends of Ames. Ames, himself, counters with the logic by asking how the Russians spying for the United States were any different than him spying for Russia.After spying for Russia for a period of nine years Ames had to realize his deception couldn't go on much longer. He began to entertain thoughts as to how he could terminate his relationship with the Russians and still maintain the monetary promises previously made to him without upsetting the Russians.Laxity in security makes it possible for men like Aldrich Ames, Jonathan Pollard, John Walker, and Robert Hanssen to get away with their illicit activities over long periods of time. Hopefully the lessons learned from these individuals can lead to a reduction in spying against the United States."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"At the time of this book's publication (1997), Earley was the only writer to interview Aldrich Ames, the CIA agent and KGB spy. Earley did more than 50 hours of interviews with Ames before the CIA got wind of things and whisked Ames off to federal prison. When I first started the book, I had barely heard of Aldrich Ames, so I suppose I was as open-minded as one can get. The results are less than revelatory--but that's not due to Pete Earley's writing.It's natural to want to know why someone would commit treason. Did Ames compromise more than 100 operations and turn over to the KGB twenty to twenty-five names of KGB agents who were working for the CIA and FBI because he no longer believed in the principles for which the CIA fought? Or, more accurately, because he believed the CIA no longer believed in them? He cites this in his interviews, but it feels perfunctory. Really, he did it for money. Initially he convinced himself he was desperate for cash due to his divorce from his first wife. He waltzed into the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C.--without even being recruited!--and started turning over information.Besides the damage he did to CIA operations, he was responsible for the executions of no less than ten Soviet men who were helping the CIA. (One other committed suicide.) Most often noted is General Dmitri Polyakov, who was a CIA spy for 18 years. He was already retired when Ames gave the KGB his name.Though hindsight is always 20/20 in these situations, it's hard to fathom how the CIA could have missed a mole in their ranks when twenty to twenty-five Soviet agents went missing in 1985 over a period of just a few months. Ames turned over the names of virtually every spy he knew about (he was rather high-ranking himself in the CIA, and had access to everything the CIA was running on the Soviets) and by the end of fall they had all disappeared. Only a few people in the CIA suspected Ames was the mole.Why? Though Ames (called \\"Rick\\" throughout most of the book) was a known lush, drinking in the CIA was part of its culture. In itself getting drunk at gatherings was not enough to point the finger at him. Additionally, a list of people who knew of at least one of the spies Ames had named was a total of 198 people. Mountains of paper had to be sifted through, financials had to be checked, and the team had to interview people on the list without raising suspicions they were looking for a mole.Mistakes were made, most notably by the FBI, who later took the vast majority of the credit for their role in catching Ames. Ames made no less than four drops right under the FBI's nose. It defies explanation.Yet Earley manages to play fair to all parties involved. As already pointed out, Ames's drinking was not enough for people to point the finger at him as the mole. And the CIA team was misled by an informant to believe that Rosario's (Ames's second wife) family was stinking rich, which explained the $540,000 house and a succession of three Jaguars, as well as $30,000 monthly credit card payments. But the mole hunting team kept digging, and eventually Sandy Grimes (one member of the team and the only one convinced Ames was the mole they were looking for) made the connection that he was working for the KGB. Reading the book, it's easy to see how they could miss this until she logged his deposits into her already-existing time table of his meetings with Soviet officials. Many of the deposits were made the day of the meetings or the day after.The book drags when Ames is quoted extensively, as he is in nearly every chapter. Giving every appearance of enjoying himself, he gives winding and self-serving explanations about why he turned over the names of the men who were later executed. He notes that these men were \\"not innocent\\" bystanders, but knew how the game was played. Jeanne Vertefuille--the lead investigator on the mole hunting team--counters this, saying, \\"Traitors are not all the same. Sure, some of the Russians we recruited were doing it for the money. Some of them were despicable characters. But others were not. We in the United States have so many outlets if we don't like what our government is doing . . . They didn't have these outlets, particularly Eastern Europeans who didn't like what the Soviets were doing to their countries. For many of them, espionage became a way of protesting the injustices they saw.\\"If you're looking for insight into why Ames did what he did, you'll find it here. But that is not the most enlightening part of this book. What is enlightening is the somewhat inside view you get into a pair of organizations that are imperfect and yet functional."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"This is the second \\"spy\\" story I've read. The other was a book about FBI agent turned spy, Robert Hanssen, called \\"Spy\\" by David Wise. Individually, (well-written by both authors)there are interesting things going on with these characters. For example, their methods of avoiding detection, of stealing material, of communicating with their \\"handlers\\", etc. And the way Pete Earley gained access to Ames for his interviews is just astounding. The small stories within the larger tale are fascinating. But it's the larger issue that's hard to understand. I wish I knew the word to describe how utterly ridiculous it seems that we, as a country, invest millions of dollars and people's lives spying on \\"them\\" while they spy on \\"us\\" and in the final analysis it all seems just so pointless. What is gained? There are individual acts of valor & courage, sacrifice & heroism -- but all that heartache seems to be in furtherance of ... what I wonder? Are these agencies really protecting our Constitution from enemies, \\"foreign & domestic.\\" In whose opinion are they enemies? Who decides who is an enemy? What defines \\"enemy\\"? As time marches on, it seems like the enemies today are not the enemies of tomorrow. Meanwhile, agents of the FBI, CIA, KGB, GRU, etc etc... are literally dying for an ideal that is so elusive. An ideal that may be only be related to the political aspirations of the powers that be! But anyway, a good book makes one think about these questions & this certainly was a good book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I have read everything I could in this genre on Ames, Hanssen, Walker, etc. The insider access to Ames provided some interesting insights, but what I enjoyed most was the author's use of counterbalancing quotes from various other characters (CIA colleagues, KGB handlers, friends, surviving family members of those whose deaths he caused). These help the reader stay focused on the actual damage Ames did, since he himself exhibits not one bit of remorse for sending 20+ people spying for the U.S. to their deaths. His rationale was if he hadn't exposed them, they could have exposed him. Although this was potentially true for a few of them, most would not have been in that position, and all Ames was gambling with was a prison sentence, while they were executed and dumped in an unmarked grave.Like all books of this era, some additional information has emerged in the almost 15 years since it was written, but this one holds up well."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"My first Pete Earley book. A page-turner. One can both hate the traitor and learn why the CIA is a useless, and perhaps dangerous, bureaucracy also worth despising."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I have glimpsed many a books on espionage. Most authors fail to deliver the edge or thrill that this author brings to his story. This tale plays out like a movie, yet seems to present credible information, unlike other pieces on Ames.Earley's strength is his ability to flesh out the most interesting aspects of the people he describes, and I think that is his strong point. The wealth of information in this book is impressive, even for a CIA work. No information has visibly been censored or excessively withheld from the reader. He really holds back no punches in offering the reader everything he could ever want to know about Ames' colleagues, his adversaries, his superiors, his handlers, his assets. The level of detail throughout the entire timeline of the book is impressive. Granted, he did spend years preparing this book.We get to see what Ames thought at each step he made, as well as the feelings of each of the major players involved. We begin with a typical bio of the main in question. We see a little of his career development, but most importantly as we near the middle, we start hearing Ames' justifications behind his actions; His disillusionment with the agency and its work. We see his earlier, more innocent cultivation of agents in New York. We see him continue to advance the ranks, despite all his adversity. All this while providing information to the Russians. For all the negatives floating around about Ames' career and incompetence, his story here reveal him as a cunning, sharp, and brilliant mind. One who thinks and plays the spy game well. One who is more than competent at analysis, dissection, and movement of information. He knows how the enemy thinks and gets in their head. Despite his incredibly unimpressive career start, he seemed to just get one lucky break after another in obtaining posts so assistive toward his espionage. He trips up so many times, but hever gets caught. He frequently worries for his safety, but discovers catastrophe to be diverted. Ames was the spy with nine lives.What I got out of this book, was perhaps the persuasion that all those involved were doing the right thing. Everyone has a unique justification for their deeds. Bureacrats have theirs, supervisors have theirs, defectors and agents have theirs, diplomats (important in the first half) have theirs. We see everyone's mode of thinking. We see sides to them we understand, agree with, and applaud. We see characteristics that just seem so human, we never would have expected from a biographical overview. This author brings us perhaps idealized personas, sets of characteristics we readers will enjoy, but perhaps not reflective of their real personalities. But atlas, this author has succeeded in his work and I can find almost no criticism for this book.We become introduced to an Ames we can identify with early on. We watch him grow and despair before finding hope and renewal his his new cause: The KGB. Ironically, right after he decides to betray his country, the agency throws one luscious job after another at him, eventually giving him some of the most powerful positions available within the SE Division. All this while his work goes unchecked, and no one remotely throws suspicion on him. Even when they do, he or outside causes remove these suspicions. He carefully and thoroughly launders his money, clearly contradicting the otherwise incompetence and carelessness exhibited at other times.He starts off as a perfectly innocent young agent. The world and his situation is totally out of his control. He uses the best of his abilities to work, but his environment is not friendly. Eventually his luck changes.What I take from this book is the incredible height of self-awareness which Ames posssesses for himself and his actions. He can justify every step he made. He understands his life throughly. And in a way, he himself brought us this book. This is his story.Having finished the book, I cannot tell what information background information came directly from Ames and what came from others. How do I know the reliablity of Ames' information? Anyone in his position has an incentive to tell a sellable story, and I do not understand journalism well enough to make this evaluation. I do say the information from here feels firsthand, fresh, and well-informed. Hardly the matter of hearsay.The author would have had to interview what seems like hundreds of people to obtain the breadth of information he does and to present it with the credibility that he does. It is notable how rarely the author admits his speculation on matters beyond his evidence. This man gives full names and exact dates as much as he can. Opposing views about grayed events are presented whenever possible, but Ames' own perspective always seems to receive the favor. In the end, we may be led to believe this author is Ames' propaganda piece; bashing the CIA of the 80s and justifying all of his deeds. The book seems to make his actions out to be morally fair based on the facts we see.We are painted a clear picture of espionage as Ames sees it, and as how many intelligence insiders see it: One where guilt and moral depravity remains relative at all times and truly hits no bounds. This is the product of the business and Ames declares this early on, with this philosophy driving every aspect of his life as soon as he set foot in the Directorate of Operations.So while we learn much about the operational history of Ames' actions and their context the latter part of the book, earlier on, we learn about what the spy world is like. We see how someone like Ames' is so appropriate and unsurprising in such a world.This book provides nearly encyclopedic catalogue of KGB officers, KGB agents, CIA agents, and CIA employees connected to Ames. Bit Early tells this information in juicy and exciting places. He does not spout wave after wave of facts like a drone. Instead, he gives dimension to every little story, no matter how relevent or irelevent to Ames. The background behind WHY certain actions are taken, WHY historical actions occured, and what little known details are involved are the flesh and blood of this book. As Ames' story unfolds, we learn in incremental development what role a certain agent or project had in the course of American/Russian espionage, and even the broad political world as well. We learn the fates of demised agents (often which are controversial and classified as well).In the earlier parts of the book, this author corrects many mistakes and misconceptions and misinformation that seems to run around Ames. Much of it was provided by the authorities and much of it also by sensationalist reporting.One standout aspect of this book is its discussion of other works pertaining to Ames. Since this man has interviewed directly with Ames for long periods, his perspective runs at odds with many other sources of information on Rick Ames. He points out these discrepencies and justifies his reporting as being more accurate. Having only read this source, I cannot yet determine this validity, but I do think this author has a leg up over the others, having invterviewed Ames himself."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Very interesting book, highly recommended for people that enjoy to learn more about non-fictional international intelligence affairs. Should also teach intelligence agencies how to prevent moles within their own organizations."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I read lots of non-fiction books on spying and this is my second on Aldrich Ames. It takes a different approach than the other book, concentrating more on Ames' life than his treason. Earley is a good writer."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"This is the only text I have read that provides a compelling and nuanced explanation of why Ames betrayed his country. The short answer is that he needed the money because he was living beyond his means. As a result of his work recruiting and handling spies he no longer believed it was wrong for a person to betray their country. Earley's well-written book explains how he arrived at that point. It also provides the reader with a credible look at what it is like to work for the CIA, and what it is like to work as a spy."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Due to techical difficulties at the time, I could only receive the cover without the text. Thanks anyway. Ron Miller"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Very well-written book. Even more interesting if you are interested in the American intelligence community and how things could go so wrong.

A real page turner, even if you know nothing of the CIA and could care less. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"I really enjoyed Pete Earley's book &quot;Hot House&quot; about Leavenworth Prison and this book is every bit as good.

The next book will be based on Dekov's memoirs."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"It would be a big mistake for me to say the wrong things about this book, as I have also suffered from a feeling that I know the truth about a few things, but that I could be locked up for saying anything. It was a bit crazy for Ames to see that the KGB would be willing to pay him for telling them the truth about what he knew, given the difficulties that would be involved in keeping a truthful relationship of that nature a secret. But as Nietzsche has observed, even the hollowest nut wants to be cracked. Spying has become a big business in our age of geopolitical dominance, and Ames was in a position to see what the most valuable secrets are. It is too late for me to negotiate with him for the contents of the sawdust file, a review of the treatment of a KGB official who wanted to provide information to the CIA which it didn't want so much that it rigged his lie detector tests so the results would show that he was lying even when he was telling the truth. I am inclined to believe that Ames felt that he was confronting something far more evil than his own acts when he read the case of Yuri Nosenko. In the realm of the greatest secrets, this case is mentioned on page 74 of Veil by Bob Woodward for being &quot;one of the great CIA crimes&quot; in the eyes of Stansfield Turner. William J. Casey &quot;thought it weird that Turner would dwell on&quot; the things covered by the report on the 1,277 days that Nosenko was kept in a cell &quot;as part of some smarmy chess game played by&quot; the agency which defines what covert intelligence really means for the United States. If you read the account of this incident by Aldrich Ames, I hope that you will feel the urge to liberate the knowledge which it contains."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"This review isn't at arm's length since I am mentioned in the book. Aldrich (we called him 'Rick') Ames and I grew up together and have been lifelong friends. I have read almost all the biographies of Ames and this is the ONLY one I know to be accurate. Pete Early is also the only one to actually interview Ames personally. This book avoids speculation and gets down to the true story. In addition to the 'what' it also explores the 'why'."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"This gives the best account of Ames' CIA career, particularly prior to the time he began to work for the Soviet Union, and corrects errors in several earlier books such as Wise's."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"It's a compulsively readable book about a man whose gravestone inscription should read &quot;My country for a rolex.&quot;"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Ames was unduly lucky to have not been \\"netted\\" much sooner. Mr. Earley gives us a very well written piece of work.Ames was certainly not Kim Philby or 007;but He did get away with His betrayal for some years,and that alone makes it worthy for any 20th Century Historian. The little tidbit of a quite 'hot potato'betrayal story on Henry Kissenger is worth the cost of the book alone.Earley is also fair to Ames'American employers at CIA who finally pinch \\"the mole\\"."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"The resourceful author was able to extract so much sensitive information from CIA and KGB that it is difficult to imagine how this information would not jeopardize the life of the spies still at large.

This book was obviously a little more intimate because it was mostly written based off of interviews with those who were directly involved with the case, as well as Ames himself. Definitely gives a very good play by play of the 9 years Ames spied for the KGB as he describes in his own words what made him do what he did, how he did it and how he went from rags to riches in what seemed like overnight. Aside from getting a good idea of how deplorable this man was the real individual you learn to despise in this whole dispicable story is his 2nd wife Rosario. Very easy to root against this woman as she comes off to be even more repulsive than Ames. Overall, some parts were a little slow but if you really want to know the actual story behind this countries most notorious and damaging spy I would say this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Spy","review":"Not one for long reviews, but this book was incredibly easy to read through and very well-written.

This was written well and very interesting."},{"Title":"The Dark Side: Thoughts on the Futility of Life from the Ancient Greeks to the Present","review":"Are you a dead serious pessimist or scowling nihilist? Here is a quotation book for you that is truly the \\"Book of Psalms and Proverbs\\" for the disciple of pessimism/nihilism. There are a lot of quotation books in the market aimed at the pessimist, cynic, and jaded individual, but this is the only book that really takes itself seriously. Most \\"pessimistic\\" quotation books do a decent job of compiling quotes, but they are too often presented in a light-hearted, apologetic, or tongue-in-cheek mood. Many of them are also too short with large typefaces and tend to rehash the same old cliched quotes. For examples, see 1)The Book of Poisonous Quotes, 2)Pessimisms: Famous (and Not So Famous) Observations, Quotations, Thoughts, and Ruminations on What to Expect When You're Expecting the Worst, 3)Are You a Miserable Old Bastard?, and 4)The Big Curmudgeon: 2,500 Outrageously Irreverent Quotations from World-Class Grumps and Cantankerous Commentators.I've read all of these and they are pretty much fluff compared to Alan R. Pratt's \\"The Dark Side.\\" It is lengthy (over 1,000 quotes), scholarly, expertly arranged with powerful commentary, and containing the darkest and bleakest quotations I've ever encountered. In addition, the book opens with a tour-de-force chapter introducing and justifying nihilism, followed by an interview with an anonymous nihilist, a college professor who states his case very passionately.This book is well-organized, arranged chronologically and subarranged by authors, effectively collating together excerpts from major figures like Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Twain, Nietzsche, Celine, Camus, etc. The editor and compiler, Pratt, provides his own unabashedly grim titles and compelling introductory remarks to the historical periods and figures. His chapter titles are stern but enticing and a good indicator of what you can expect the book to cover; essentially beginning with the Egyptians and ending with Samuel Beckett:1. Prehistory and the Preclassical: In the Beginning, Nothing2. Classical Greece: Cosmos or Chaos?3. The Hellenistic World: Back to a Dismal Future4. The Old Testament: The Lesson of Job5. The Romans: Bittersweet Memories Amid Amorphous Decay6. The Medieval World: Very Dark Ages, Indeed7. The Renaissance: The Rebirth of Angst8. Baroque Extravagance, Incredulity, and Pessimism9. The Enlightenment... Without Radiance10. Romanticism: A Quixotic Quest for Contentment in Confusion11. Realism, Decadence, and the Fin de Siecle: Is this all there is?12. The Condition Moderne and the Age of Anxiety13. Postmodernism: One Step BeyondUnlike so many other quote books, Pratt does not water down the severity of his topic with cute drawings, sarcastic commentary, or introductory chapters attempting to be humorous. Pratt is somber and devoutly nihilist without sounding pretentious or \\"emo\\". He actually writes really well: clear yet erudite, articulate yet blunt, and always convincing when he emphasizes the darker undercurrents of various historical periods.To better illustrate Pratt's aim with this book, I quote a paragraph from the preface:\\"Over a thousand excerpts representing nearly four hundred individuals from antiquity to the present, from the pre-Socratics to the current antifoundationalists, address mankind's contingent nature and cultivate the view that human existence is, at best, amusingly trivial or, more likely, horrifyingly meaningless. The remarks of this disparate group of artists, philosophers, skeptics, malcontents, and misanthropes range from maniacal celebration to contempt to expressions of abject resignation. The material is taken from speeches, poems, letters, novels, essays, anecdotes, dissertations, conversations, manifestos, and some general rantings. Although a select few of the individuals quoted eventually found some form of salvation or promise for existence, only their darkest thoughts are included here in an effort to maintain nihilistic purity.\\"Bottom line: This book is the finest compilation of its kind. Pratt does not follow the common formula in pessimistic quote books of being apologetic or facetious. There is a sullen mood and forceful austerity to the presentation that may strengthen the pessimist's conviction, or exacerbate depressive tendencies. I usually read a couple pages of quotes per day; anymore than that and the gloom could get overwhelming. Fair warning: anyone not inclined towards misanthropy and nihilism may find their hopes and ideals crushed by the quotes in this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Side: Thoughts on the Futility of Life from the Ancient Greeks to the Present","review":"If you are a nihilist or are just interested (or curious -I know I was) in nihilism then you should definately check out this book.

He had been betrayed, lied to and defrauded in his own life as I had been in mine. This book had given me strength despite the ills that befall every one us, not because it contains positive affirmations, but because it's a testimony to how dark life can really be and in what different hues and shades the darkness comes so that the sense of victimhood is removed and learning what obstacles we face can be fortifying. My friend read the book, enjoyed the many wise and dark quotations in it, and later after sharing with me his thoughts stole a picture from my home seeing how quick I am to give and forgive.However, that event was not depressing nor is the book under review here -- not in the least, except for this: the best of what's in it really lies all in the Greeks or in Chapter 2 and especially Chapter Three, \\"The Hellenistic World: Back to a Dismal Future\\" -- when it comes to addressing the real darkness: political destruction. Not that all the remaining quotations - particularly by Schopenhauer -- aren't sharp, incisive and deep. No.But there is no quotation that deals at all with the dismal world of destructive empire building, nation-destroying political manipulation, counter-intelligence, global warfare on innocent people. None at all! The Greek section or, specifically, Chapter Three alludes to these scenarios and represents all that might be said about them without directly resorting to modern quotations from Carroll Quigley and his book \\"Tragedy and Hope,\\" or quotations from David Rockefeller's memoir explicitly stating how much of a Communist he is.The darkness of this book is entirely a-political and that is the only depressing limitation I found with it because the absence of political awareness means it cannot possibly convey what it means to be totally aware of the dark side of life and its futility. The book then is still born of a child cleaving to his mother's breast, not ripped from the breast and then the skull smashed -- as in real political war.\\"We live not as we like, but as we can.\\" -- Andria, c. 300 B.C.

Granted, there isn't always much info on a given species, but that's to be expected; many of them haven't yet been studied.The book covers range, distribution, habitat, taxonomy, toxinology, and several other categories. There is a &quot;remarks&quot; section where various miscellanious tidbits go. It is here that info on captivity is provided, although that is not the focus, and remarks on captive care are limited. However, more than enough info on microhabitat is included to get a good start on captive husbandry.The book starts with a whale of an introduction; it runs 10 or 11 pages, and seems mostly focused on basic toxinology, which helps lay the groundwork for the more in depth information in the text.The book treats each of the genera of true vipers (Azemipinae, Causinae, Viperinae, Atheris, Bitis, so on).Those are divided into thier subgenera, wherein the species belonging to that subgenera are dealt with. Typically, the authors give an overview of the whole genus, and of the subgenra, discussing toxinology, morphology, range, etc. They then delve into more specific species info. Subspecies are covered within the species accounts.There are admittedly large stretches where info is scarce; it seems not much research has been done on some genera. However, this book contains what information there is (tons of it overall, espically on more studied species), and is well worth the price (although I wish they had a paperback edition!).The bibliography is great too, citing scientific journals and literature, and field studies directly (primary sources, yay!). Some of the sources cited are not in English, but I'm going to start tracking down and reading most of what is. This book is entirely worth the price,a nd is a must buy for anyone interested in true vipers. I just hope the authors A: update it as more info becomes available, and B: do something similar for pitvipers and/or elapids!

The details it goes into will shock you how someone took so long too write such a great book."},{"Title":"TRUE VIPERS","review":"Though I have not read the book, I know the author, Dr. Mallow, and I can say without a doubt that he knows his stuff.

Doc, if you're reading this, I just wanted to say &quot;hey&quot;."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"Speiser was one of the greatest experts on Semitic languages of the 20th century. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what the Hebrew really means. There is also a lot of helpful background material (though after nearly 40 years this is no longer up to date) and thoughtful analysis. Speiser was no fundamentalist, and was often prepared to say that the text is not to be taken literally, but he was less &quot;critical&quot; than many authors. He believed firmly in the Documentary Hypothesis, and each passage is carefully dissected into its J, E and P components, but this material can be ignored by anyone (including myself) who rejects that hypothesis. There is probably no single commentary that would suffice for a detailed study of Genesis, but this book should be one of the commentaries at hand for the serious student."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"Speiser is an expert linguist and critical scholar. Other reviews comment on his support of the documentary hypothesis, but that is practically universal amongst critical scholars. The question is just how much value one gets from that understanding when interpreting. Spesier belongs to that older school of critical scholarship that tends to believe that having identified source and redactional elements, one's work is done.Some current scholarship, on the other hand seems to take the view that you can dismiss such considerations and still deeply understand the text. Often either the full acceptance or the dismissal of form, source, and redaction criticism are done without serious consideration.What Speiser will do for the student of Genesis is point out clearly the more or less standard division of the sources. In many commentaries it is very difficult to tell what is what in source theory of the Pentateuch, and sometimes students dismiss as excessively complex or poorly supported something they have never really been able to see clearly portrayed. Speiser will help with that task.Speiser's volume is not my favorite Genesis commentary. I personally prefer von RadGenesis: A Commentary (Old Testament Library). While he also strongly supports the documentary hypothesis, he tends to build on the theological themes more effectively than does Speiser.I rate this as a good buy for a serious student of Genesis. Don't expect it to lead you directly to sermon points if you're a pastor. It's more for background study that will fuel your thinking and bear fruit later. A more directly theological commentary, such as von Rad, Waltke (Genesis: A Commentary), Brueggeman (Genesis: Interpretation : A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching (Interpretation, a Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching)), or even the shorter volume by Derek Kidner in the Tyndale Old Tesament Commentary series (Genesis (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)) will be better for Saturday night sermon prep!"},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"I am far from being a Bible scholar, but I found Speiser's commentary and his trasnlation informative and useful. He is a proponent of the source document theory, and faithfully incorporates this theory in his discussions. While decades have passed since its release, this book remains a valuable source of enlightenment for novices in Biblical studies."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"I find it helpful to have various references in my reading and study of the Bible. This is a good one to use."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"What a wonderful, remarkable book this is! In presenting this strangest book in the Bible, Speiser rises far above merely recounting (and very well, too) the results of centuries of source-criticism that finds not Moses as the author, but no less than 4 different authors, each with his (or her) own highly distinctive authorial personalities -- the Shakespearean J, the dream-mystic E, the \\"begat\\" ancestral-line archivist P, and the redactor(s) R. The translation is crystal clear and therefore even more enchanting than ever, with dazzling scholarship behind virtually every word choice made. Speiser establishes one of his central theses -- that J, E, P and R felt constrained by the sincerest promptings of faith and honor to give us the most authentic retelling of the ancient traditions they could, with the highest possible respect for their sources -- convincingly indeed. To cite a powerful example, Speiser argues that the rare reference to Abraham as \\"the Hebrew\\" must be derived from a non-Hebrew chronicle source (now long lost), and so stands as independent proof of that Patriarch's existence. Speiser knows and shares what a treasure trove of unimaginably ancient lore the Table of Nations is. He links the \\"sons of the gods/ daughters of men\\" memory with the Flood, which immediately follows it in the Genesis narrative, a connection I'd not seen before. But more than all these, he allows the magic of these ancient dawntime stories to shine with all the fresh glory of the rising sun. What a different world from ours emerges! The Serpent's trick in the Garden is more cunningly calculating than most will realize or remember. The very accessible Yahweh dines with Abraham with His two companions in a tent, and informally shares over luncheon that He will destroy Sodom. The blind, elderly Isaac sniffs the robe Jacob (in disguise) is wearing to make sure his blessing goes (he thinks) to Esau, whose aroma he compares to the wilderness and the hunt. Jacob enjoys the regular and enthusiastic favors of two wives in addition to their slaves, and one wife sells a night with him to the other wife for a day's gathering of mandrakes. Joseph forgives his brothers. The Patriarchs are shepherds. The consideration for the Covenant is mass circumcision, and the contract is sealed when Abraham walks between two butchered animals. The mysterious Melchizedek receives the Patriarch's tithe. Solemn oaths are taken by placing one's hand under the obligee's thigh. \\"Dynasty\\" set in the second and first millennia BC. A beautiful lost world, and a great read in Speiser's incomparable retelling. Get it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"E.A Speiser's contribution to the Anchor Bible Commentary is a classic in Biblical Studies and scholarship. This is perhaps one of the most often cited works on the Book of Genesis that is readily available to the general reader. It is scholarly, yet highly readable. Following the Critical tradition, yet it is also very reverential. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"Published in 1964, Speiser's commentary on Genesis exhibits the worst proclivities of modern Biblical scholarship. Speiser is enthralled with the documentary theory - the thesis that the Bible is redacted from several original sources commonly referred to as J, E, P, D, etc.... While I personally have no objection to this approach, Speiser seems content to try and identify which passages are from which sources and then move on to the next passage. Speiser spends so much time chopping up the text and parsing out the sources, that he tells you very little about the text itself. Speiser has no affinity for literary theory - how the telling of the story shapes it meaning - such has been demonstrated so magnificently by Robert Alter in his book, The Art of Biblical Narrative. Moreover, even much of the Higher Criticism theory that Speiser employs in his commentary has become outdated as scholars have refined the theory.There are many better commentaries on Genesis available and we can hope that one of these days Anchor Bible itself will publish one more enlightening than Spieser's."},{"Title":"Genesis: Introduction, Translation, and Notes (The Anchor Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"I've already reviewed this purchase for Amazon.

She takes you by the hand and shows you a \\"plan of attack\\" for drawing a picture -- breaking the picture down into elements and layers which you add one by one.The book explores several art themes: Landscapes, Animals, People, Still Life & Interiors and each theme has a \\"project\\" that you can do to explore the theme.Using her idea of \\"analyzing the line in human forms\\" I was able to start a sketch of my cat snickers -- by analyzing the lines around him and focusing on \\"the picture\\" as if I was looking through a viewfinder (another technique she shares) and began drawing a rough grid to start the drawing. I captured the curve of his spine and his rear paw before he got up -- and will return to the drawing when he returns again to this favorite sitting spot of his.This is an excellent introduction to drawing for the beginning artist. I plan to buy more books from this author. I feel like it was a \\"bit of grace\\" that this book \\"crossed my path\\" serendipitously at a local arts and craft store i frequent. Ms. Gair is truly a gifted art teacher that makes art simple and easy to do."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"This is a factual book in which a world that no longer exists becomes vividly real as seen through a provincial doctor's elderly patients recollections of their younger lives. My first introduction to this book came through my Japanese language teacher. Her physician is the son of the author. Each chapter covers the recollections of a single patient, so the book is very easily read in discreet portraits which together paint the overall picture. Dr Saga's patients tell their stories with such intimacy, warmth and frankness that you are drawn ever deeper into their world. All lived in and around Tsuchiura, a town on the edge of a large lake about 30 miles north of Tokyo. Many of the stories are of fishermen who made their living from the lake. There are also the merchants, gangsters and entertainers. Together, these people provide a real insight into the way people lived and worked in Japan before the rapid development of the latter half of the 20th century produced the comfortable lifestyles of today."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"One of the best books about pre-war Japan. Each story brings to life a different aspect of life, culture, and class as they existed before the war. If you've visited Japan, you'll have a hard time believing this kind of world ever existed. I guarantee you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"1st person accounts collected by a Tsuchiura doctor from elderly Japanese. Together, they piece together a quiltwork of Japanese society from the bottom on up. All, in pre-war Japan. Tsuchiura is just next door to Tsukuba, a modern science city and destination for many foreign researchers in Japan. As one such researcher, the book helped me understand some seemingly unexplainable remnants of old practices that still persist. I couldn't put the book down. The stories of lives jump out of the pages."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"A collection of interviews with people who tell stories of their lives in a small japanese village from about 1890 to 1930. Arranged by occupation, all are very interesting. One of the most intriguing aspects of the book is the commonality the stories share with my own American relatives (as to the hardships of farm life, what people did for fun, etc.). The book even occasionally slips into a \\"when I was a kid we had to walk two miles uphill in the snow\\" sort of mode, but this makes many of the stories all the more touching."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"This book is filled with priceless historic snapshots of real-life everyday drama that cannot be found in any textbook. From farmers, fishermen, and merchants to executioners and geishas who entertained kamikaze pilots in the last days of their lives, these simple, unadorned memories of ordinary smalltown Japanese people living in a previous era under circumstances that we in modern, high-tech times cannot imagine left me in awe of the power of the human body and spirit. A learning experience in culture and history that reinforces how valuable the memories of our own elders are."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"Intriguing, personal stories that illustrate pre-war Japan from the point of view of peasants and tradesmen. Illustrates the deep poverty that the vast majority lived under. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"The book offers a fascinating view of small town life near Tsuchiura, northeast of Tokyo, during the 1920s, through collected interviews of people who lived there. The interviews done by a doctor with a tape recorder captured memories of a wide range of people from shop keepers and craftsmen to geishas, farmers and fishermen. As a children's writer working on a book set at that time in Japan, I'm finding these stories to be a treasure trove of background information."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"If one desires to learn more about various aspects of small-town Japan during the early twentieth century, this is a definite buy.Every account given in the book is easy to read, interesting, and paints a vivid picture of how life was around a century ago. I found that I was wanting the book to be much longer as I learned so much from the stories and was thoroughly entertained. Subjects ranging from the work of a tofu-merchant to the rarity of shorts are covered so a wide range of information is available. Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"The simple premise and unassuming approach this book takes to gathering its many narratives led me to have low initial expectations. I was completely surprised by how vivid a picture each villager painted with their simple narratives. I was completely transported by the stories and the author's effortless presentation, and I discovered a Japan that I had never even known about, and that none of its celebrated storytellers ever related to Westerners like me.I finished the book while I was still in Japan. Ironically, being surrounded by modern Japan and modern Japanese actually made me feel more bereft at the end of the book. I was hopelessly nostalgic, and, as silly as this sounds, I wanted to go to Tsuchiura and hug every single one of the people in the book. It's not that they lived in a simpler time, nor do I have any Luddite filter preventing me from understanding the difficult, famished conditions in which they lived. But there is an ineffable quality of honesty, diligence, and character that all the interviewed villagers share, and I find myself longing for a time and a place that can so consistently mold such wonderful people."},{"Title":"Memories of Silk and Straw: A Self-Portrait of Small-Town Japan","review":"These are the stories of everyday people in a small town in Japan. The narratives are short, Studs Turkel style, stories of early 20th century Japan from interviews made 70 or so years later. The small town, just outside of Tokyo is large enough to have a department store (that closes for a month to auction off silk cocoons) a draper and separate areas for brothels and geisha. There is a lake, teeming with fish and a nearby air force training center.All interviewees agree that the area, now laced with superhighways and modern construction is not recognizable. No one is pining for \\"good old days\\".What is striking is the poverty and its signs such as stories of paying (or not paying) the rice rent, households without pans, the work and logistics of bathing, the acceptance of infanticide and so much more.Life is hard and most people work round the clock. The fishermen can always eat fish, but like almost everyone else has a life of continual work to make ends meet. Life as a geisha was not easy either. One former geisha's story of the kamikaze pilots was the most touching piece I've read on this topic.There is technical knowledge here, such as how to make a roof, how to pack eggs to get them to market, how to dye fabric and how to style hair.This book is beautifully laid out on a very nice grade of paper. While it would have changed the character of the book, the drawings are exquisite, and their level of detail begs for a larger format.Perhaps life in larger cities is much better in pre-war Japan. Novels such as those by Tanizaki do not hint of this life. InNaomi: A NovelJoji's mother lives in the countryside, and it's a pleasant visit and he even inherits some wealth from her. TheThe Makioka Sistersenjoy catching fireflies in the country. In Mishima'sThe Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea\\" the town is portrayed as prosperous, the protagonist's mother has a shop dealing in luxury goods. The grinding poverty in this book tells a very differnt story.I read this book in two sittings, but the better way is to savor it with two or three portraits a day."},{"Title":"Meditations of a Great Lakes Sailor","review":"I was sorry to reach the end of Meditations of a Great Lakes Sailor. I wanted to spend more time with this unruly rag-tag band of men bonding and brawling on an ore freighter. Rick Stevens, the main character, grows up a la Catcher in the Rye on the lakes. Aboard the B.F. Steadfast, which aptly describes both the boat and his own constitution, Rick observes the lives of his shipmates with a blend of curiosity, navet&eacute; and aloofness. In a hidden diary, he records conversations and antics without judgment. Mr. Graham's descriptions create three-dimensional characters, some larger than life, others rather repulsive, yet all enjoyable and interesting. Some even deserve their own book. At any rate, Meditations is a tribute to those living on the lakes."},{"Title":"Meditations of a Great Lakes Sailor","review":"for those of you who want a picture of life on an oar boat on the Great Lakes in the 1950's, this book is for you.

I view Meditations of a Great Lakes Sailor as a highly accurate, albeit fictional, account of what it was like to work on the Great Lakes at that time.

In the end, does it matter which man wins?In discovering an appreciation of the worthiness and intelligence of the average working man who might be unschooled and semi-illiterate, Rick decides to learn about the mysteries of the human mind by studying psychology and psychiatry.A well written novel."},{"Title":"The Peoples' Cook Book","review":"Excellent book on simple cooking from around the world.

Where else will you find a cook book with a burlap cover?"},{"Title":"The Peoples' Cook Book","review":"This was the first cookbook I bought when I went out on my own during the 1970s. It was not only a real cultural eye-opener, but chock full of sensible, tasty recipes from around the globe. This is peasant cooking at its unadulturated best. I loved and used it so much that my own copy has fallen completely apart. I would like to find another copy for my vegetarian son to use (though some of the recipes do have meat). This ia a gem of a cookbook for those who are culturally awake in its truest sense."},{"Title":"Dynamical Cognitive Science (Bradford Books)","review":"Dynamical systems is an approach to studying physical systems that change over time; in contrast to the field of statistics which deals primarily with stable-state properties of systems. It is clear that both human behavior and the brain are fundamentally dynamical in nature, but despite widespread acceptance of this idea, few cognitive scientists study the brain or behavior from a dynamical perspective. This book is an attempt to demonstrate the value of applying the techniques of dynamical systems to the study of cognition.The book is organized as a very high-level introduction to the tools and topics of dynamical systems, with simplified mathematics that are introduced gently. Unfortunately, perhaps due to its introductory nature, much of the book is spent introducing topics and surprisingly little space is given to the application of these ideas to cognitive science. Each topic (markov models, regressive processes, colored noise, chaotic systems, etc) is introduced with one to two chapters with examples from physics or other domains, followed by a comparatively short chapter on how it relates to human behavior. As a result, what is lost is the sense of how a dynamical systems approach could revolutionize the study of cognitive science. A more accurate title for this book would have been 'Introduction to dynamical systems for cognitive scientists'. This book will introduce you to the topics of dynamical systems, hint at how they apply to the study of cognition, but it will not make you an expert in the field, nor (unfortunately) will it impress you with the value of taking the time and effort to study the topics further."},{"Title":"Dynamical Cognitive Science (Bradford Books)","review":"As a student I find this book a terrific survey of possibilities. Frankly it has opened up whole realms of enquiry I hadn't considered previous to reading it. Ward admirably succeeds in covering an enormous breadth of ground in an accessible way. The book doesn't talk down to the reader or dumb down the subject, and while the treatment is a bit uneven in spots, I think the chief success of the book is how it supplies endless fascinating avenues for further discovery with encouragement to roll up your sleeves and get to it. If dynamical cognition is already your specialty, you may not get much new out of the book, but if the field is new to you, Dynamical Cognitive Science is that rare thing: a thoroughly readable introduction to the subject that, while it doesn't stint on the math, doesn't scare you away or bore you to tears either."},{"Title":"Dynamical Cognitive Science (Bradford Books)","review":"Enjoyed this book, it was not too difficult to read, it is an excellent copy. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"In 1969, Don Pendleton crashed into the literary scene with this novel which would become the first in a long line of books to follow--Don's legacy lives on today, with some 500 separate titles in print on the life and times of Mack Bolan! While probably one of the most mythical of heroes (and the first one to start the new action-adventure genre in literature) Don Pendleton's greatest feat was in what he had to say about the metaphysics of violence. Mack Bolan isn't some maniac... he is truly one of America's all-time heroes. And so is Don Pendleton. If you haven't read Don's &quot;original&quot; Executioner series, then you need to. As a published action-suspense author, I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"Mack Bolan is a US Army sergeant, and a sniper in the Vietnam war. In fact, he is so good at that, he has ended up with a nickname, 'The Executioner'.He is granted leave when it is discovered his father has killed his mother and sister, and then committed s*icide. His younger brother is still alive, so the army gives him a post at home, so he can be his guardian.The Executioner takes this familial loss, a little hard, and promptly sets out to live up to his namesake, methodically taking out the 5 mafioso involved, after acquiring the necessary gear.The police realise it is him, but aren't that keen to arrest someone doing their job for them.He boldy applies to join the Mafia, to learn more, telling them he knows who killed their guys, and getting some complimentary servicing, to boot.The action, and body count, escalates markedly from there. Everybody under the sun is after him, even the military.Bolan is an intelligent man, but sees the Mafia issue in black and white, they are evil, he is not, it is his job as a man of action to put them down.One character produces a surprise later on, as well.A couple of great lines Pendleton throws in, during a mafia conversation :\\"Didn't you know?\\" Turrin grunted. \\"He's the frackin' Phantom. The frackin' Phantom knows everything.\\"\\"I thought that was The Shadow,\\" Plassky mused.* * *Later on, Bolan is injured by ignoring Turrin's wife, who shoots him. He stumbles into a woman's home, who, luckily for him, helps him out, and he stays they for a couple of days, recovering. :\\"Honestly, that is the most ridiculous outfit. Who do you think you are--Captain Marvel?\\"All in all, a fine setup for further adventures."},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"This book, whose lead character is still going strong with no end in sight, started a revolution in paperback series publishing. Don Pendleton tapped into the psyche of an America coming to grips with increased violence in TV and movies and coupled it with the examination of the Mafia in Mario Puzo's Godfather. He came up with an action thriller that spawned both copycat Mafia series and a huge assortment of new action heroes. Basically the story of one man's vengeance taken to the ultimate extreme, we see Mack Bolan go after the local Mafia in order to avenge the death of his family-who ironically were not actually killed by the Mafia. The story of vengeance escalates until Bolan faces the man who he particularly blames for the deaths and comes away from the confrontation with a surprising revelation. This is truly an action-adventure classic."},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"the books the executioner series was a good buy for the price i paided. i would buy more executioner series from amazon."},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"One of the longest lasting action titles still around and still the best in my opinion.This book started it all and even to this more modern day of readers it's a great action packed reading experiance.Sure, it may show Bolan as a vigilante but the more you get into the book, and the series, it will also show his compassion, inner struggle with what he has chosen to do and so much that makes this character always interesting.If a reader can still find War Against the Mafia then I'd recommend it because it will still appeal to action lovers."},{"Title":"War Against the Mafia (Mack Bolan: the Executioner)","review":"I have read other books in the Exicutoiner books and this is prabably the best he has written.

I don't think this one is near as good as her other cookbooks. There are alot of recipes provided by friends and peers, and a few repeats from previous cookbooks. And seems like several are more exotic than her normal downhome type of things. I always liked Paula's older recipes cause chances are you already had most of the ingredients already in the pantry. I know it would be hard for her to keep coming up with original recipes given her schedule, but I'd give my eye teeth for another book of solely Paula and her family's recipes of good old southern cooking.If you watch Paula on tv and are looking for a good sampling of her work, pick up The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbookor Just Desserts and you'll turn to it time and time again. For true die-hard fans who already own the other three, you'll enjoy the intros and witty comments made by Paula throughout the book."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Paula's recipes are delicious but not for the diet conscious. Just because she uses some store bought ingredients does not detract from her creativity and makes the preparation a snap. She is the ultimate Southern cook with lots of butter and love in her recipes. I think this cookbook is one of her best. I really like the fact that I can save time by using already prepared ingredients and not lose any of the flavor when I cook. All her \\"store bought\\" ingredients can be found easily."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Let me say up front that I love Paula Deen and I have read and re-read her first two cookbooks many times. Many of the recipes I've tried from those books are outstanding. This book, however, takes a detour. As a starter, you will note that this is the first book Paula has written with somebody else. Although Paula's name is prominent on the cover to attract customers, there is actually a co-author. Second, the title is even more telling: Paula and Friends. When you get to the heart of the matter, this is not a Paula Deen cookbook; it's a collection of recipes from other people with Paula's name on the cover to sell books. Paula herself hints at this in the Introduction. She says her next book was coming due (multi-book contract I presume) so she was looking around for ideas and called a friend, who turned out to be the co-author. I get the impression Paula had to come up with a new book and didn't really have any new ideas after having already written three books.As for the recipes themselves, some are just reprints of previous Paula recipes in a new format. What Paula does in this book is organize recipes by the type of function you're having. She provides complete menus for different types of gatherings. So many of her recipes aren't really new. And like I said, most of the recipes in the book come from other people. Just from reading them, they look like decent recipes, but I'm not sure why this counts as a Paula Deen book. Unfortunately, this book seems more like merchandising than her earlier books. Maybe that is part and parcel of becoming a famous chef and cookbook author."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"What a WONDERFUL new book to add to our collections- THANK YOU Paula!First off, there are a couple of reviews thus far that are simply unfair. Paula Deen does NOT use Chick-Fil-A chicken in her recipes- she recommended picking some up for a TAILGATE party.........most people do that. Nothing unusual.And NO, she's not suggesting we eat this food everyday. Hope that clarifies for those who can't read.This book gives wonderful recipes for get togethers and those special times you want to put on a good feast for dear friends and family. These are warm, down home dishes that are sure to please.Reading this book is like being at one of her parties in person- JOB WELL DONE PAULA!PS- I just met Paula and Michael at a book signing for this book. She's incredibly friendly and beautiful to her fans. Meet her if you get the chance. She's worth standing in line for!!!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"First off, I love this book and I could go into the details of favorite recipes but I basically bought this book because:1. I love Paula's show on tv, have made some of those recipes and like her casual, chatty style. Good food, nice presentation.2. The book has menus and great recipes and the humorous writing of Paula herself. I really like cookbooks that contain slices of the cook's life, books which are as fun to read as to use. This one is. I love the Oatmeal cookies and her fried chicken is pure Southern cooking at its best. Nothing too fancy, just good, basic home cooking.NOW, HERE IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS BOOK:This is one time when Amazon's \\"Search Inside the Book\\" function really helps you figure out if this book is for you. It is about as close to going into a bookstore and looking through an actual book as you are going to get - at least, while still online.Take a look at the sample menus. Then take a look at the index, most (if not all) of which is featured in the \\"Search Inside the Book\\" function. That will give you a detailed list of recipes and menu ideas contained in this book. You'll also be able to look at the introduction and get a feel for Paula's writing and style. Reading this book is fun and when you are in the mood for cooking, these are some fine recipes!Personal tastes differ, of course, and what one person finds delicious, others may not. But I think you'll find this book will up your chances of pleasing friends and family with delicious food. Not only does the author have a popular tv show but she has run a food business for years, one that has been successful and at least one of her sons worked in restaurants and BOTH of them grew up cooking with her. This means you'll be cooking food that has a proven track record for appeal and popularity."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I'm surprised to read the few poor reviews here - I have all of Paula Deen's books, but I've gotten more 'everyday' recipes from this one than all of the others combined! I felt like I was sticking post-it notes to every other page!Yes, they're rich (it *is* Paula). Yes, she uses some convience foods (but just like the rest of us 'real-people' would - she's gone nowhere near Sandra Lee, thank goodness!). I love that she sets up menus and suggests appropriate occassions for these menus.Her best yet, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"This is my first Paula Deen book, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I have watched a number of her shows on Food Network, and the shows I have seen all have recipes that seem a tad fussy and over done. But the book had a number of recipes that were simple to make and had the clean, simple taste my husband and children enjoy.I love to cook, and I love cookbooks. I am always trying new things, or trying old things in new ways. Sometimes my family enjoys it, sometimes they just give me a look and eat a few bites to be nice. This cookbook takes me back to the down home southern cooking my husband knows and loves.The beer in the rear chicken was easy to prepare, and I really liked the flavor the beer infused into the chicken. There is a warm chicken salad casserole that my kids just gobbled up.The food isn't 'low fat' by any means. But on the weekend, when my husband, our four little boys and I are just hanging out, I really want something rich and satisfying-and this book delivers."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Quote from Andi in LA -\\"When I actually go through the trouble of inviting people over for a nice dinner, I want to take my time with more sophisticated recipes that look like I put time into them--in other words, no dishes that taste divine but look like \\"trailer tra* mush\\" when plated.\\" -end quote.What an awful thing to say and you call yourself a fan. Try serving your stuck up friends some fried chicken with slow cooked pinto beans & rice or some shrimp with grits. Believe me your dinner will be a hit.I would recommend this book to everyone. Sure, a lot of the dishes are high in fat but you don't need to eat this way everyday. I trust Paula. About a year or so ago I served her Sloppy Joe's (open faced) to a group of \\"upscale\\" friends and they're still talking about it. I have yet to prepare anything from this new book because I can't decide just yet. Nothing says \\"I love you and I'm so happy you're a part of my life\\" like a good ol' southern meal! Good job Paula Deen!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I have lots of cooking book and this one is really one of my favorites.

This book is a treasure of Southern Comfort presented in recipes that speak volumes about good taste and flavorful charm. The recipes are as entertaining as they aredo-able for the novice or expert. If you are looking for a recipe that is easy to use, clear in its format and suitable to catering to every taste and event, informal or formal...look no further. I live in California (Southern California, that is!)and I hail from one of the oldest Southern familys in America...I felt at ease with the recipes in this book, and at one with the author's unsurpassed sense that good company and good meals are the perfect combination for entertaining , whatever the reason may be!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"hi its me again my mom purches this book when it first came out. she knows how to cook and cooks diner every nite. she love to wach paula deen on the food channel one day on a saturday she saw this realy good thing that she saw there the next day she made it for us and it tasted soooooooooo good and another time she made a choclate chip pie it was so good too I recomed this toy for every parent who likes too cook and there kids like there food."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Paula Deen has never let me down on all of her delish meals!

Paula's cooking has a distinctive personality and taste where as her friends recipes you never know what you are going to end up with. Paula please stick with your recipes. I am from the south and that is the only cooking I have known and to put other recipes in your book in my opinion takes away from the character of the book."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"What a great book! The recipes are easy to follow and generally use \\"pantry friendly\\" ingredients. The finished dishes actually look like the pictures in the book -- and taste really good.\\""},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Paula Deen never disappoints. Once again her recipes are easy to follow home cooking. I love the fact that each chapter is written as an entire menu. You can just pick one and your entire meal is planned. I also love the stories that she tells even if you don't cook her book is well worth reading. I highly suggest this book. All of Paula's cookbooks are must have."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I'm a hack cook, my daughter is the actual \\"Chef\\" of the family, but Paula's recipes sure do make a man happy that was married to good ole southern girl most of his life. I would recommend this book to any gal wanting to fix \\"comfort food\\" for her man. You'll really gain points if he is from the south. Personally though, her original cookbook (no longer in production, though I believe some of the recipes are in the two-book collection she put out) is my favorite."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I like many have fallen under the Paula Dean-Food Network spell.

The Spicy Tomato Soup required double the amount of chili as called for; The All Day Mushrooms needed salt--not included in the recipe or instructions; The Chicken Divan was heavy, thick, too rich, too processed and too salty (I added no salt). The Marinated Tomatoes and Green Chili Corn Muffins were the only recipes that turned out perfectly according to the ingredients lists and instructions. Somebody failed to test these recipes properly before publication, or that is my best guess. I haven't bought any of her other books, but hold higher hopes for Paula without her friends."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Paula Deen is the best cook ever!!! Buy this book!!! You won't regret it!!! The only people who shouldn't buy this book are people who are on diets. Just a word of advice. But still, everyone else owes it to themselves to pick up this book."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I purchased this book, and I was extremely disappointed...It states to get a lot of already made foods, and also to use chik filet chicken in recipes...There are some recipes that can be found on the foodnetwork site...I don't really understand the idea behind the book...Save your monies people..."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I must start by saying that I am a major Paula fan--watch her every weekend, have all her books, and have tried many of her recipes with great outcome.While I understand Paula wanting to reach out beyond the down-home southern comfort food she is known for, the recipes in this book fall into two categories: 1) Pointless recipes for super-easy things that don't require an additonal cookbook purchase(like lemonade and pound cake with strawberries--duh?); and 2) Very un-Paula contemporary recipes I can only describe as being Rachael Ray-ish.Although meant \\"for company\\", the recipes in this book are definitely not something I'd make for guests. To be honest, I feel Paula recipes are best for everyday home cooking or cozy holiday meals with family. When I actually go through the trouble of inviting people over for a nice dinner, I want to take my time with more sophisticated recipes that look like I put time into them--in other words, no dishes that taste divine but look like \\"trailer tra* mush\\" when plated."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Practically speaking, if i ate like the way Paula Dean cooks, I'd be 500 lbs. I think it's unrealistic to promote this type of fat-laden cooking for every day given what we know about ways to keep healthy. I laugh at how much butter she adds to things and sure, it's going to taste good! Give me a chef who can create recipes that taste like they have lots of fat but don't. That person deserves the praise."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I really like all of Paula Deen's cookbooks, but I especially love this one. I've made several of the recipes (as I have out of all her cookbooks) and they're all *GREAT*!! Her recipes call for normal, everyday ingredients that most people either already have in their cabinet or know exactly where to find them at the grocery store. I also just love to sit down with this book and just *read* it...it's very entertaining...just like her show on the Food Network. I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I must concur with the previous reviewer that this book is more for diehard fans than anyone else. I went to a book signing and got to meet Paula (and her husband, Michael), so this is the primary reason I bought this book. Incidentally, if you ever get the chance to meet her, GO! She's a truly marvelous person and she has a gift of connecting with her audience! Some of the recipes I've tried are terrific...the Beer-in-the-Rear Chicken (which Paula has featured on her Food Network program awhile back), Vidalia Onion Corn Bread, and decadent Rum Cake were winners. I can't say that I'll try loads of the other recipes (but I AM eager to try a salmon dish that sounds excellent, indeed!). The best part of the book, for me at least, is Paula's chatty, warm narrative. She writes the way she speaks, and I love hearing the details of her catering business which begat The Lady and Sons Restaurant which begat her Food Network program. Although this book's format is more \\"uptown\\" than her others, I really prefer the spiral bound, since the book stays open more easily. For anyone wanting to try Paula's Southern, calorie-laced fare, I'd suggest \\"The Lady and Sons\\" and/or \\"The Lady and Sons too\\" cookbooks. They're \\"the real McCoy\\"; this one's for the mega-fans who wanna collect the entire set!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I was given this book for Christmas. I always try and make at least two or more recipes when I get a new cookbook. I am not a chef but I am a very good cook and can execute a fairly difficult recipe. I hate to burst everyone's bubble but this book contains recipes based on canned soups and when they are not the recipes are flavorless. I made the shrimp casserole, shrimp and grits and the oatmeal cookies. Nothing to write home about. I will say if you are a beginner this may be beneficial. A lot of hype."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"My new thing is to check out books from the library first, then buy. This technique has saved me hundreds of dollars. I'd take out a book I really wanted to buy, and after browsing, only liked a handful. Well, this cookbook was so incredible from start to finish, that I quickly returned it to the library and bought my own copy.I like Paula's approach of getting together some friends and swapping recipes - that's what real friends do!! And these recipes are so delicious, tempting and sinful. Most of them are easy to make for the semi-experienced cook and the rest take some time to prepare. Everyone will find something pleasing in this book. The stories really add a lovely charm that made this book quite warming to the heart.Thanks Paula, I've enjoyed all your other books as well as your show - and I highly recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"This is Paula Deen's first cookbook that gets the \\"star treatment\\" - nice hardcover, beautiful color photos of some of the mouth-watering menus, and a nice format. She has arrived! However, I don't think it is necessarily her best content-wise. Her previous books, the little paperback editions with the plastic ring binders, have far more recipes and feel more \\"intimate,\\" if there is such a thing with a cookbook! This book features sample party menus and have titles like \\"A Bridge Club Supper\\" and \\"A Georgia Bulldawg Parking Lot Tailgate.\\" Most of these feature a main entree, a few side dishes, an appetizer or two and a dessert. The chocolate sandwich cookies (on page 94) and the pimento cheese spread (page 40) are two recipes that are delicious and very easy to make. Some of the recipes, including the chocolate sandwich cookies, didn't originate with Paula and she says so in the introductions to the menus."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Some excellent recipes and thoughts for putting it all together.

Paula's food is not for those on a diet - but for those who love good food."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"If you watch the Food Network, then Paula Deen is no stranger to you. I remember never missing an episode of her show years ago before Paula became so popular. Now, she is everywhere...and deserves every minute of the exposure. Good for her! I still never miss a show; I even like the reruns on Sundays.Rightfully so, I had to have her cookbooks. Paula is a cook that everyday Americans can relate to. Remember cooking shows on PBS where the cooks always made food with ingredients that they probably never sold in your local supermarket, that is, if you could even afford them? The Food Network has changed that these days, and Paula is at the top of the list for wholesome foods that anyone can make.Her Living It Up Southern Style cookbook is a quick pick for a fast meal or for party planning. The recipes are easy to understand and easy to plan for. You probably have most of the ingredients already in your pantry. I like the layout of this cookbook too. There's not a lot of reading so the recipes don't get lost. They are also divided by occasion, so it's easy to find what you need if you are looking for suggestions.Best wishes! Best dishes! And definitely one of Paula's best too!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"I purchased this book at a book signing and was lucky enough to meet Paula Deen. Since then, I've tried several of the recipes in this book, and they've always been fantastic. One thing I've learned about a Paula Deen recipe is that you don't have to \\"test\\" it ahead of time--they always earn me rave reviews at family gatherings. If you aren't on a diet and enjoy cooking, you will certainly get a lot of use out of this cookbook, not to mention the fun of reading Paula's comments and introductions. As a side note: she's just as warm and funny in person!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"....just for the cooking of course! My husband melts over all the food I make for him using Paula's recipes! He is a better cook; he has that natural gift for cooking. Paula makes me look like I am gifted as well! She is not too complicated. It is not like Martha Stewart's cookbooks, which I like, but don't have time to search out all 25 ingredients she requires. Paula is simple, but brilliant! I highly recommend this cookbook!"},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Hello! I rarely write reviews of the products I purchase online. In fact this is my FIRST, lol! However, this book I feel deserves a write up and I hope it helps buyers out there~ I LOVED the book! I find the recipes well written and easy to follow. Not complicated to cook nor are the ingredients hard to find! MOST IMPORTANT, after making a few of the meals, THEY TASTE FABULOUS! That's what it's all about! The book is written in a very straight forward, down to earth manner with down home southern hospitality thrown in. I cook for a living. I am a foodie! I have over 300 cook books, (YES that other famous one with the peacock guy...) and like that one, this is also one of my favorites, right off the bat; I knew it before I even tried any of Ms Deen's WONDERFUL recipes! There are many \\"trade\\" secrets or cooking tips included, if you don't know them already! Many of the recipes are very unusual and unique; not found everywhere! (Now today, that's important with the slew of cookbooks out there!). I suggest you go out and buy this cookbook NOW, AT ONCE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED! You won't be disappointed in it, I feel!

But, being a Southerner, I'm disappointed that so many popular Southern food writers continue act like they're cooking in the 50s -- taking shortcuts with processed added foods. Lots of Southern writers have resurrected and refined our traditions -- especially in New Orleans and in \\"low country\\" cooking. Paula Deen and her bandwagon act like none of that has happened. It's time for Southern cooks to throw away their canned mushroom soup, instant puddings, and hot-rise cornbread mixes. And start making desserts that actually taste like something other than pure sweetness, i.e., stop using mind-numbing amounts of sugar. Lots of this stuff used to be considered truck stop food (I'm especially thinking of the desserts here); now, it's becoming known solely as Southern food."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"Recipes are easy and delicious.

Thanks.Janet Sue Terry author of \\"A Rich, Deliciously Satisfying, Collection of Breakfast Recipes\\"."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"\`Paula Deen & Friends' by, you guessed it, Paula Deen and \`Savannah Magazine' columnist, Martha Nesbit is Deen's fourth book, her first without the plastic many-fingered loose leaf format and her first for publisher Simon and Schuster. It is also the one with by far the largest \`As Seen On food Network' logo of all recent publications by that cable channel's culinary stars.I really sort of miss the plastic binding, although Ms. Deen and her Simon & Schuster handlers seem to have kept the price of this volume down in spite of the fully sewn binding. This format really seemed to match the \`church fund-raiser' flavor of her recipes.The premise of this book is Ms. Deen's statement that she loves to cook, and she loves to entertain, but she hates to plan parties. And, since she expects this attitude is not hers alone, she sets out to prepare for us 21 menus and their component recipes to relieve us of the task of putting together a lineup of dishes to fit these and similar occasions.The good news, and the bad news, is that these premises for parties are not your usual Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines Day, Easter, Fourth of July, occasions. There is at least one birthday menu and a New Years day menu, but all others are for events which you may never encounter, such as a bridge club supper, a tailgating party, a boss comes to dinner menu, a hunt (fox?) lunch in the field, a christening brunch, a Kentucky Derby party, and a christening brunch. Now obviously, a \`bridge club supper' can be adapted to any number of different sit down dinner occasions, especially since, like all of Deen's recipes, none of the ingredients are very pricy.One complaint I have about the recipes in the menus is that none of them are scaled for a large number of people and in parties where one may expect a large number of people, the recipes are not scaled to the same number of people. Thus, in the \`cooking shower', the Tomato Tarts makes 24 count, the shrimp and grits serves 4 as a main course, the fish serves four, the roasted new potatoes serves six to eight and the fresh fruit tart serves eight. I think it should not have been too difficult to scale all the recipes within a menu to the same number of people, and make that number appropriate to the type of occasion. On the other hand, each party menu includes six to eight dishes, which means that you can always leave one or two out if you are serving just four people. Similarly, this gives a nice variety to please a wide range of tastes if you are serving eight to twelve.Being a Mario Batali kind of cook, I am not especially fond of Martha Deen's brand of Southern recipes, as I always seem to find her dishes too sweet for my tastes. And, if I want to go ethnic, I always have my Pennsylvania Dutch style of sweet tooth cooking on which to fall. But I really happen to like her show on the Food Network and I think her style of cooking has a lot of appeal to a lot of people, and this book simply adds a new dimension of utility to her published recipes.Like all her earlier recipes, there are virtually no expensive ingredients used. The number of prepared foods in the recipes is relatively small and relatively unobjectionable. And, virtually all recipes are relatively straightforward, requiring few special appliances or techniques. There are some recipes that understandably do require a rather large number of ingredients, such as the recipe for gumbo. There are also some dessert recipes that are a bit involved, but most take all available shortcuts, such as the one for apple strudel. My Austro-Hungarian heritage forces me to point out that strudel dough is NOT the same as the Greek phylo dough used in Ms. Deen's recipe, but it will get the job done a lot more easily than a trip to Vienna for a crash course in strudel making. Note that the title of this book should make it clear that many of these recipes were created by Paula's friends and neighbors, to whom she gives ample credit in the Acknowledgments and headnotes.Part of the charm of a lot of cookbooks based on cooking in Italy, Provence, or Spain lies in the little stories that surround the recipes. It is easy to forget that just because Ms. Deen's terroir is close to home, she does not have some very heartwarming stories of her own.Paula Deen is your Down Home Savannah version of the more scholarly James Villas. And, it isn't exactly Martha Stewart either, but it's a darn good, darn cheap (far cheaper than Ina Garten's similar volume) bindle of suggestions for entertaining."},{"Title":"Paula Deen & Friends: Living It Up, Southern Style","review":"We received this book well within the time frame set by Amazon and are well pleased with it."},{"Title":"Bringing Textures to Life: Step-by-step Techniques for Rendering Exotic and Everyday Textures in Oil","review":"Before Modernism, oil painters were interested in developing their abilities to depict real or imagined images. In order to accomplish that goal, they needed 'technique'. Starting with the workshops of the Renaissance, young painters (e.g., Leonardo Da Vinci) learned how to represent the differing textures of objects (viz., silk fabric, satin, Persian carpets, shiny and dull metals, flowers, fruit ,vegetables, animal fur, human skin &amp; hair). Only after gaining such facility in their painting technique were they allowed to join the guild of professional artists in their community.In this book Joseph Sheppard shows how to paint the textures one sees. This liberates the artist who is willing to put forth the effort. Also, Joseph Sheppard painstakingly illustrates the steps one goes through in building an oil painting, from beginning to end. We see his accomplished paintings being built up layer by layer. He shows the importance of blending and how to attain sfumato. Note: I disagree with his insistance, in the book's introduction, on the use of toxic lead white (e.g., I have found that Old Holland titanium white is both more opaque and lean than lead white).Sheppard starts with thumbnail sketches on paper to develop and optimize his composition. We are shown the various sketches he makes to reach a successful composition.Using a toned canvas or panel, Sheppard begins the iterative painting process that follows upon the heals of laying in the drawing (i.e., with burnt umber and turpentine).Joseph shppard is a comsumate teacher. This book is holds great potential value for the serious oil painter who wants to develop his or her painting skills to a high level."},{"Title":"Bringing Textures to Life: Step-by-step Techniques for Rendering Exotic and Everyday Textures in Oil","review":"This is without a doubt the best book on the subject of illustrating textures and surfaces through paintings that I've come across. Sheppard is a master artist and he shares his methods and thinking in great detail. His compositions for this book are rather complex, a purposeful departure from some of his other books. These pieces were assembled to demonstrate techniques for an incredible range of natural and created textures from skin tones and hair; to flowers, fruits and vegetables; iridescent shells and feathers; fabrics, stone and ceramics, to wet and transparent objects - some 100 varied textures in all. When looking for a particular example, it's fairly simple to flip the pages or refer to the lists in the contents and index. He provides an average of 50 carefully explained and detailed photographs as each painting progresses from rough sketch to final realism. This is not an beginner's first guide to mixing colors, shading, and composition, but the topics are discussed relative to the particular pictures. Overall, it is an excellent guide for anyone who aspires to achieve greater realism in oil or acrylic paintings, and perhaps other media. The degree of skill that Sheppard demonstrates will not be attained without considerable experience. However, his illustrations are sufficiently detailed and plentiful that an observant artist should be able to grasp and apply his methods. I share the concerns of other reviewers who recommend substituting nontoxic replacements for for older lead and cadmium pigments, but must also admit that Sheppard's results are exceptional. Several of Sheppard's other books are also excellent. Those interested in portraits and figure drawing and painting may want to consider the following: How to Paint Like the Old Masters, Anatomy, and Drawing the Female Figure."},{"Title":"Bringing Textures to Life: Step-by-step Techniques for Rendering Exotic and Everyday Textures in Oil","review":"The reviewer no one is paying attention to is the more correct one. This book is full of small photos taken during the completion of larger works. Accompanying these photos are plenty of comments, but they are NOT detailed instruction or guidance that will help if you are learning - only generalizations, broad concepts, wishy washy artsy fluff. Don't buy this book to learn to paint shiny objects, fur, cloth or folds, or any other specific material or texture. On the other hand, if you like Joseph Sheppard's style of painting and you can learn to paint anything simply by looking at hundreds of 2-3 inch square photos... this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bringing Textures to Life: Step-by-step Techniques for Rendering Exotic and Everyday Textures in Oil","review":"This is a fantastic step by step guide in how to paint all sorts of textures in oil...You are shown the layout and the techniques used to create texture....A great reference book for any artist to have at hand in their studio."},{"Title":"Bringing Textures to Life: Step-by-step Techniques for Rendering Exotic and Everyday Textures in Oil","review":"Imagine taking a handful of very busy paintings.

Without a firm grasp of the fundamentals delved by Ashby, a reader could be very lost. This is a book you can read BEFORE an electronics course, to guide you through what could be a confusing maze. This book is not focused on design, but on a faster way to understand fundamentals in electronics by developing intuition and removing as much math jumble as possible. Included are chapters for dealing with EE management and other EE related companies.This book is also exceedingly helpful for those in a non-Engineering track electronics courses, who maybe overwhelmed by the depth and audacity of a non-Engineering text like Horowitz and Hill.Here are its key points:ProsVery easy to read, user friendly;Easy to comprehend;Key concepts summed as rules of thumb on a side bar [ I use all regularly since I graduated in 1980 to this very day];Superb editing, I noticed but one typo p. 166 \\"Let'ss\\";Helps EE students focus on the essentials of key fundamental component function;Broad audience, applicable to the technician level versus EE;Touchy feely chapter works in many fields beyond EE;Helpful tidbits in the EMI chapter were superb!ConsNot enough material to get a design together, some assumption one has tried design and knows some in-outs;Need examples of a \\"putting it all together\\" using rules in sample design problems;No surface mount tips for a book written for the 21st Century EE?No catalog of manufacturers for construction?No tips on free samples?No tips on free evaluation boards?In my view, the hallmark of a good electronics student is the capacity to design a working electronic device. True design skills gives students the insight to fix, alter, salvage or improve most anything made in electronics even if a student never ever builds a device from scratch ever, after graduation. However, the reverse is not true, a student raised on \\"fix-it\\" can not necessarily design.Comments:While praise is heaped on the LM324 as an historical op amp, I believe it was the LM741 that clearly made op amps the workhorse of analog design. Much has improved since in op amps, but understanding the 741 is to understand them all. The 324 was a popular chip due to single rail supply but the 741 set the specs to beat. No mention is made about the 555 timer, although one can always build a RC oscillator with just an op amp.The CD:The enclosed software is extremely useful, to me. However, its enclosed PCB123, a routing PC board designer, is more likely for EE 202 than 101. I think students need to learn to do layout by hand at least once, just as they need to know how to do math +/-*functions by hand even if they use a calculator throughout life.Filter Pro is also in the same vein, EE 202. Very useful software but not discussed much in the text. At least one type of each has to be designed by hand: hi, lo, bandpass, band reject from all passive, then to active, before contemplating automation.Conclusion:Although passive components and isolated op amp designs are less practical these days, it absolutely necessary to grasp the fundamentals of RLC to make any electronics as easy as 1-2-3, from Course 101 to 999. One must not be lost in details.Ergo: Crawl before walk, even if running is all we really do in the real world ;) we walk a lot too, and we can always crawl if we need to."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"This is a great book because the author is taking basic theory and providing the reader with some good intuitive tools to gain a foothold on how components work.Many textbook authors in the circuit analysis arena (or electrical engineering as a broader area) tend to do one of 3 things;a) Over explain a concept until the reader loses track of what he is doingb) Skip too many steps in showing the derivation of a formula or the solving of a problem.c) Place more emphasis on the mathematics associated with specific problem rather than the problems significance.The author clearly avoids these traps. His text is reminiscent of a bygone era where engineering books actually sought to explain concepts and their significance."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"This book is well written and relatively easy to understand for beginning students or those that would like to refresh their knowledge.

While (R1*R2/(R1+R2) is correct, (R1*R2*R3/(R1+R2+R3) is not. The first trick only works for 2 resistors, and the corresponding formulas for Capacitors in series and Inductors in parallel act the same way. Other than that, the book does and excellent job of explaining things. I would recommend this book to any college student who is struggling with Electrical Engineering 101 courses since it does such a good job of presenting the information in a clear way."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"This book is an easy read after you've gone through EE. Makes you see the forest from the trees. Spend so much time in early circuits classes just trying to figure out currents, gains and voltages that all I could do was the math (the trees).

Enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"The Author has done a great job. I am a non practicing EE. I found this book in a local bookstore when I was looking for a basic book for my son on electronics circuit for his school project. As Daniel Petersen has pointed out the only typo in this book is in page 31/32 where the formula is wrong for 3 resitors/inductors in parallel or 3 capacitors in series.I think the Title of the Book should be Electronics Circuits 101.

This book seemed to be the perfect supplement to the somewhat harder text books I have been given to study.The book opens very nicely, friendly and chatty. I did though expect the book to spell everything out, but it seems to make many of the same mistakes my lecturers made. In the opening pages it starts talking about RLC circuits without any explanation of what one is. The author seems to be falling for the same trap engineers always fall for; assuming laymen (normal people) understand what they're talking about when they use abbreviations or new terminology.I finally stopped reading and write and this review when I found a paragraph repeated twice on the same page. This book means well, but seems to full of oversights and poor editing leaving the reader somewhat disappointed by a book that promised not to be like their education up till now.I will now return to reading as this book does offer many good explanations and insights. I will adjust this review if the book manages to redeem itself."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"My background is Mechanical Engineering and I found this book to be extremely useful and interesting. I purchased this book in order to get a better understanding of the EE basics. Like most universities a ME takes a EE 101 course that is essentially a weed out course. The problem with a weed out course is that in the end you don't have a solid understanding of what the underlying basics are. If this sounds familiar, you should definitely buy this book.The author (Darren Ashby) addresses this concern. This book is full of schematics and there are often various relationships made between the Electrical/Mechanical disciplines which are very useful. This book also includes a useful CD-ROM that contains a \\"Rule of Thumb\\" reference guide, an \\"Equations Reference\\" guide as well as some other useful tools/calculators.Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"This is a funny and easy to understand and remember Electrical Book. I love it very much. For me the error equation is not important, the important things you have to try to derive the equation by yourself."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"This book seems to market itself as a refresher course for those who've taken a class (or perhaps more than one class) in EE, and are either working in the field or planning to be there soon, but have forgotten some of their fundamentals. While a book from this angle is quite appropriate and welcome--given that there doesn't seem to be any current authoritative volume intended for this purpose--this book falls rather short in providing what a real EE would need to know.Obviously, the things that any engineer needs to know will vary wildly depending on what work environment they're in, which is why most EE curriculums try to focus on the universal principles that apply to almost every possible application of electricity. However, the information in this book doesn't seem to satisfy what any working \\"engineer\\" must know. The book is, in fact, barely written at the technician level, and most technician-targeted books that I've seen are actually more advanced. A refresher course for full-fledged engineers would probably need some review of calculus and differential equations, a fair amount of electromagnetic theory, and at least some level of semiconductor theory at the materials level. All of these subjects are largely ignored by the book. Instead, the book explains things like what op amps do. It's difficult to imagine an actual analog engineer forgetting what an op amp is for; it's sort of akin to forgetting what addition and subtraction do. The book actually places mentions of SCRs and TRIACs in a section about \\"Things you probably haven't heard of\\", despite the fact that these types of thyristors are usually covered in community college classes.This places the book squarely in what appears to be a brand new category: Books for the person who took a single class in electronics 20 years ago, has forgotten all of it, and has just been hired as an EE. If you actually fit into this category, you might gain some benefit from this book. To be fair, the book really isn't bad or difficult at all; its coverage is just sorely lacking. Perhaps this is an indication of the times: Has the tech crash impelled so many people to leave the computer and electronics industries (at least in the USA) that books are now being made for engineers at this level? If so, this is at least good news for people who want new jobs. If you want something to soften the impact of more advanced textbooks, this book might help, but if you really want to understand electronics, don't rely on it."},{"Title":"Electrical Engineering 101: Everything You Should Have Learned in School but Probably Didn't","review":"I was hoping that this book would help me understand some of my sticking points a little better.

Both the reader reviews and my initial scan of the book made it look promising.But, after slogging through mis-spellings galore, an unclear writing style, sentences obviously missing key words, ambiguous sentences, etc, I gave up. After all, if I have to dig through the language to get to the message, I may as well go with a book that's deeper in the subject because I would get more information for the same effort.I place responsibility for the poor quality on the publisher and editor(s) more than on the author.

He would have done better to take a more professional tone and devote more space to showing electronics as understandable and exciting. His attempts at folksy humor and reliance on clich&eacute;s distract from what might be the basis of an interesting career. The last chapter portrays electrical engineering as work requiring survival skills, something to be endured, not loved.In his book Practical Electronics for Inventors Paul Scherz inspired me to become more involved in electronics. He provided just enough math to entice me to learn the calculus and matrices needed to understand circuits. Tony Kuphaldt's online Lessons in Electric Circuits had the same effect. It has some of the most helpful material available on electronics I have been able to find. And it is well written, respectful of its reader and the history of electronics, and free. By example he led me to use spreadsheets and the Spice simulator as a way of gaining even more understanding.As I read Electrical Engineering 101, I kept hoping I would find something useful before I got to the end.

Koontz has no ear there.The only remarkable thing in the book is the fact that there is not a canine there with a 150 IQ.Another favourable (or perhaps not so favourable) thing to say about this kingdom of boredom is lack of Dean's latest laughable flowery descriptions that take one character for fifteen pages to move from one room to another in a house.

For Frye shows up again, and again...each time angrier than the first, more bloodthirsty, desiring revenge and mayhem...Dean Koontz has written some incredible novels; &quot;Whispers&quot; is one of the best of them. With beautiful writing (the setting, Los Angeles and California, becomes an intricate part of the novel) and a suspenseful and engaging plot, it's not only one of Koontz's personal best, but one of the best suspense novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"As I thought Dean Koontz does it again. But...this time I could see the book so fully in my minds eye. I was a child of abuse, and the demon would haunt me over and over in my dreams long after the abuse stopped. So this book was so much more to me in many ways. Most of the time I stick to the Non Fiction works as I am always searching for answers, but became a Koontz fan years ago...and rightfully so. the demons in this book are demons I see in my mind...."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a great book to start with if you haven't read Koontz before. I think it's one of his best.You'll be scared out of your mind, you'll be imagining horrible things in your head, you won't be able to go to sleep &amp; you'll be looking around you in the pitch dark...all things that happen after you read a Koontz book. That's when you know it's GOOD."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I'm a Dean Koontz fan, but this novel was just disappointing! The plot was just too predictable and there were so much unnecessary sub stories. But I have to agree that this was an easy and enjoyable read for I was never bored and I never thought of putting the book down until I was tired. I totally recommend Watchers for those who want to try a Dean Koontz book and/or those who haven't read it yet. Watchers kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire book and I just couldn't put the book down whereas with Whispers, I'm just reading to finish this darn book so I can move on to the next. 3 stars for this book for it is too cliched and predictable, yet never boring to the point where I had to give up on it."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book was fast-paced, interesting, and suspenseful, but it's not memorable. In fact, I had to use amazon's &quot;look inside the book&quot; to read a few pages to be sure I had actually read this one.I remember this book being a page-turner; 3 stars for that. I don't remember the villain's intended victim at all; -2 stars for that. All in all, I'd call this a good light read--excellent for beaches, plane trips, car rides, or any occasion where you need a book that won't sap a lot of your energy (in terms of concentration; it's easy to stay focused on this one, but you won't find yourself re-reading lines to be sure you've gleaned every bit of juicy, glorious detail)."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Whispers is an awesome book! It was really hard for me to put down. I really enjoyed the characters in this story. Unlike many authors, Dean Koontz made the characters seem to be real people. This book has something for everyone: suspense, love, mystery, and horror. I have read several books by Koontz, and this is my favorite."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE NEGITVE PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK, AND COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, I LOVED IT. THIS WAS THE FIRST DEAN KOONTZ I HAVE READ, AND NOW I AM BUYING ANY DEAN KOONTZ BOOK I CAN FIND.THE CHARATERS ARE WELL FORMED, AND THOUGHT OF, YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH TONY AND HIS FROG TALKING. YOU WILL HATE BRUNO FRYE, AND YOU WILL LOVE THE ENDING I PROMISE.

As always, DK did not fail to please. \\"Whispers\\" is classic Koontz, characters so real that you feel that may have run into them at the local grocery store, villians so creepy and horrifying that you will be checking under your bed and in the closet before turning out the lights, and to my surprise, \\"Whispers\\" includes some racy love scenes, not characteristic of Dean's other work. Unlike so many Book Reviews which basically summarize the entire plot, I am not going to give anything away to spoil this read for those who have not experienced it. I can say that I am searching for one of the very rare hardcover editions of this book to add to my collection. Happy Reading and make sure you check the closets when you come home at night after a long day at work etc....... You never know what or who may be lurking there!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I've been a Koontz fan since I was a teenager, and this has been one of my standing favorites without fail. It's not as good as some of Koontz's later books (Midnight and Intensity are my absolute favorites), but it's still extremely entertaining, twisted, dark, weird, and suspenseful. As many others have pointed out, there is a LOT of gratuitous and unnecessary descriptions and dialogue, and the characters are very one-dimensional (the villain seems to be the only multi-faceted personality in the whole story). There's way too much talking overall. Basically, if you see a big paragraph, chances are you can skip right over it and you won't lose any of the story. Still, it's gritty, wicked fun to read."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Koontz definitely out did himself with this one. A little bit of creep to it. Enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I read this book years and years ago...and loved it! It was so different from anything Id read prior. Then, I loaned it to someone (damn you Carolyn! I KNOW you have it!). I have looked at yard sales, etc. and never found another copy...recieveing this book was a deja vu for me..I have read most all of his books...some get a lil far out there..but always imaginative and page turners.SOoOO now, Ive got a new copy..and my sister asked to borrow it...LOL...I think Ill just buy her a copy too..NO! You cannot borrow my book :-P"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I have noticed that Koontz's last few novels have sort of fell apart at the end. While the characters and the story are first rate, at the end the stories almost ended to fast leaving the reader to feel cheated. I decided to go back to the beginning and see what he classic novels are like.I must say this book started out as great as all of his novels. Great characters and a story that grips you from page one. The only negative thing that I could say about this novel is that the suspensful aspect of the story stops while the two main characters, Hillary and Tony fall in love. I think normally Koontz would have had them develop feeling for one another while the suspenseful stuff was happening around them. In this story, Bruno Frye who is the pyscho killer takes a break and so does the suspense while the Tony and Hillary fall in love. Once Tony and Hillary are a couple, Bruno reenters there life and then the nail biting suspense is back and the wave of excitement is there through the end of the novel. Safe to say this novel didn't fall apart at the end! In fact this end is certainly a strength of the novelOverall, this book is another homerun by Koontz. If you are a fan of Koontz you will love this novel. This is the novel that put Koontz on the map and read it and you will know why.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I just read Whispers, now reading The Bad Place in which THE SAME conversation of \\"we dont earn our daily bread by making love\\" with the two detectives is repeated in Whispers! Of course the characters names are different but the scene is similiar, the two detectives ending their talk with \\" youre worth a whole loaf, two croissants and a bran muffin\\". I know it doesnt take away from the story but since the two novels are years apart, and I am reading his novels in no particular order....just FOREVER ODD"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"The book arrived just as described although the shipping was a little slower than usual."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I read this novel when it came out in 1980, and Koontz had me from the moment at the beginning where Bruno Frye looks at an attractive and available woman, considers picking her up, but decides against it because \\"he just didn't kill redheads.\\" It lived up to that line, it seriously surprised me at least twice along the way (especially the character who was very angry at the crude job of embalming done on its corpse) and it was a thoroughly satisfying reread over the years.This was the first Koontz story I ever read, and I've been a fan ever since. I still consider it one of his best works. Great story, fine characters, very well written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"the book was in excellant condition my husband loved it thanks amazon for making it easy to find and easy check out"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"hard to find old school Dean Koontz! will love the book (once I finish Breathless!)"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, but, I have to ask, did Dean really write this? I found it to be very far removed from his usual writing. It was a very slow read and had pointless pages of useless information and nonsense. The last half of the book rolled a little easier, but I think that the ending finished a little abruptly (I think that he was in a hurry to finish it up). It was a good story, in general, but it could've been summed up in about 50 pages. It just didn't roll like Cold Fire or Dark Rivers of the Heart."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I'm pretty sure I've read this book before when I was a teenager. Parts of the novel, including the ending were too familiar for it to be fresh. Either that or this novel was too much like some of his other work, which is possible. My only complaint about Koontz is his tendency to be predictable. The heroes win and the evil is destroyed. In \\"Whispers\\", this is again the case. On the flipside, I love Koontz for his great characters and relationships between these characters. I feel more attached to Koontz's character then I do with other similar authors. In \\"Whispers\\", Koontz builds two great characters - Hillary the screenwriter, sweetheart and victim, Tony the cop and super nice guy.The plot is clever and has some nice twists. The protagonist is suitably evil and scary. This is not my favorite novel by Koontz (actually \\"Watchers\\" is my current favorite) but this is still a very good read."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"You know I am really dissapointed with this one! I think Dean Koonts is a great writer, but it is like he started this book without a deadline, and then ended it with one. The story line is really easy to figure out, after reading most of it. You really don't need the ending for this one. Anyways it is too far fetch and not a good read! I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Considering it was written in 1979, the book has a very intriguing and original plot. However, I wish it had a supernatural explanation instead of rational."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Easily the Worst book Dean Koontz has ever written. Read like a porn book. Trash, slow, boring, no humor, just plan sad that Dean went down the wrong road."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"A realistic look into the life of a battered woman, you'll be wishing the characters made different choices. However, their decisions are what make this story so true to life."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Koontz seldom dissapoints. I've finished Hideaway, Intensity, The Bad Place, The Funhouse, The Face Of Fear, The Door To December, and Whispers, and highly enjoyed every single one of them.Whispers is about a screenwriter living in LA named Hilary Thomas. As a child she lived in a dumpy, tiny apartment with her alcoholic, abusive parents and she's been living the life of a loner when a man named Bruno Frye, whom she met while doing research on vineyards for a script, is found hiding in her house. Well, turns out he's a bit of a nutcase. He pursues her with a knife and tries to rape her and she chases him off and calls the police. The police refuse to provide protection and he soon returns. This time, she kills him before he can rape her. Now, fast forward a few days and Bruno shows up in Hilary's house AGAIN. He's somehow returned from the dead....or has he?At first Bruno comes off as a stereotypical bad guy. But later on in the story, when you discover the truth about him and the horrible \\"whispers\\" that he hears upon awakening from nightmares, you may find yourself feeling some sympathy towards him and even the one who turned him into what he is today.I also have to say that, in the middle, one of the characters dies, and the scene literally moved me to tears. The story started to drag a bit after that, but it picked up the pace after awhile.Now I'm off to read Watchers and Lightning!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"In the interest of truth I should clarify that I'm not Koontz' biggest fan. While he clearly has talent as a writer, I often find the execution in his books sloppy, with plots that lose steam halfway through. I didn't realize when I bought Whispers that it was an early effort, but I will say that there's a freshness and consistency to it that I find missing in his later books.This said, I didn't find Whispers to be particularly frightening. I guessed the conclusion long before I had gotten to it and I never really had the sense that anything bad could happen to its protagonists. It may be that its plot has been stolen over time by lesser writers, but I never felt like there was very much at stake.Koontz does do a good job with his characters in this novel, rounding them out with a decent level of motivation and backstory. Unfortunately the dialogue itself can't keep pace, and still lends itself too easily to exposition about that motivation.This isn't enough of a book to convert a non-Koontz fan into a Koontz-fan, but if you already like his stuff, you may well find it appealing."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I cannot tell you how many times I've read this book. This is my absolute favorite book of all time! No matter how many times I read it, I see something new. And the author's description of food will leave you drooling!!!! I've had this book in two paperbacks (wore the first one out!) and hardcover. If you don't read any other Koontz book, try this one."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I have been an avid Koontz fan for about 13 years, and I have always loved his work. His style of writing is such that you are usually unable to put his books down. However, I found &quot;Whispers&quot; to be somewhat lacking. I believe that is because his writing is, as a rule, so masterful that I have come to expect so much from him. While &quot;Whispers does not, I believe,touch his normal writing, it is still well writen and very suspenseful. I continue to anxisouly await his next book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"i just recently finished readin this book, adn was amazed by how the story was relevant even now, thirty years after it was written! my favorite book of Koontz is tick-tock, but this book is right up there! a must read!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I haven't yet met a DK novel I didn't like, but this one is one is let down by the rather weak ending. It's certainly worth reading and I do recommend it - The story moved well, was developed in a masterful manner and was suspenseful enough, but don't be expecting a big reveal at the end - it's not there."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Whispers is an enjoyable novel, but I don't think Koontz felt comfortable enough with his writing to really unleash his imagination on us. Keep in mind, he wrote this in the 80s. It doesn't have the total weirdness his later books have, such as Fear Nothing, Seize the Night, Watchers, The Bad Place, etc.By the time he started writing those novels, I believe Koontz fully shared his imagination with us without holding back.The books I love by Koontz start off like a normal novel, and you think cool an interesting quazi-detective story with an odd character like Christopher Snow, but then it slowly spirals into utter weirdness with a dog that is more intelligent than humans, killer monkeys that hate humans, and time travel. This is the Koontz I love, and Whispers is not written by that Koontz. It is a good novel nonetheless.The main problem I have with Whispers is a story element that had nothing to do with anything. It is a big part of the novel, several chapters even, yet serves no purpose. The novel would have been better if this part was removed."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I like most of Dean Koontz's books however this is one of my favorites. It was a creepy thriller, that kept you on the edge of your seat and made you not want to put the book down. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a great book in my opinion all around. It delves into the human mind and physce and what we do to protect our selves from harsh stimuli to our minds. I don't like to explain the whole story out in a review because it takes away from the actual reading of the plot and book overall. Just get this book its a good read"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Although not a longtime fan of suspense, I've noticed Koontz's books around at the supermarkets and in the new paperback titles and decided to pick one up. Unlike many heavy writers of this #1 New York Times bestselling type, Koontz frequently uses literary devices and fantastic imagery in this book, which keeps me enthused and continues working my mind. Authors like Grisham or one of those types writes with a style devoid of imagery and metaphors and similies. However, he sometimes overplays this card and goes on and on about one particular thing, which kind of bores if the subject and its matter are kind of unrelated. The main characters, Hilary and Tony, are well enough developed for my liking. And I think a lot of writers and screenwriters are going in the way of underdeveloped characters in suspense, but in doing that losing our affection toward these people. Koontz, however, got me to care about them somewhat.Some of my pet peves about the story:\\"As if\\" (as in its simile sense) is used about a million times. This gets used way too often in many books and becomes highly repetive, oftentimes appearing more than once in a single sentence.There's a lot of underlying Freudian assumptions in here, a lot about the \\"unconscious\\" and \\"conscious\\" minds, which are pretty much outdated philosophies. Even Koontz himself admits that in his afterward.Overall, though, if you're looking for a book that takes about five days to read, contains a couple of sex scenes, and shows a lot of imagination with intriguing imagery, I suggest Whispers."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I just finished \\"Whispers\\" Dean Koontz and I was not disappointed. As with many of his other great books, he draws out characters who have gone through tough times both growing up and with relationships...some succeed, some do not. The relationship of Tony and Hilary is quick, and at times, in my opinion, unrealistic, but interesting nonetheless. Very creepy, very graphic, breathtaking. Also, Koontz delivers several political/social statements that I DO agree with (e.g., smaller government=more efficient government) and that is an element of Koontz fiction that I love. Anyway, if you're a big Dean Koontz fan such as I, then you don't want to skip over this book in your quest to read all his books."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a highly suspenseful book, written in clear, spare prose. It is an easy read and a definite page turner. It is a plot driven book, however, with little character development.The plot itself is simple. A beautiful screenwriter, Hilary Thomas, is confronted in her own home by an intruder named Bruno Frye. It seems that Mr. Frye has been stalking Ms. Thomas in the belief that Ms. Thomas is his long deceased mother, Katherine, who has ostensibly come back from the dead in order to kill him. He feels that he must kill her, before she kills him.Of course, Ms. Thomas has no clue as to why Frye has singled her out. She is aware only of his murderous intent, and she is afraid, very afraid. On Frye's first go around with Ms. Thomas, she survives. On the second go around, Frye does not. Thinking herself to be safe, as Frye has seemingly gone to his maker, she is shocked when he, yet again, confronts her with deadly intent.Why this is happening and how, will certainly keep the reader turning the pages. Some of it is predictable, but it, nonetheless, makes for an absorbing, easy read. This is one of the author's better, early efforts. Readers who enjoy suspenseful novels will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"The book Whispers written by Dean Coontz is a fiction book. This book is really exciting and not only is it a murder mystery but it is also a love story. One of the problems in this book is that Hilary Thomas is being attacked by this man Mr. Frye; she had met him on a business trip. Each time he returns for her she manages to get away until one time she thought she killed him, but as usual he always finds a way to come back to her. Will he ever stop until he finally kills her?Hilary Thomas has grown up with abusive alcoholic parents and once she was old enough she decided to beak away and start over with a new life. She becomes a successful movie writer. Hilary Thomas grew up always expecting something bad to happen. And when she thought finally things were turning out good, things suddenly changed. While Hilary wasn't home Mr. Frye, someone she had met on a business trip snuck into her house and when Hilary came home he attacked her, she was lucky enough to survive by scaring him away with her pistol, but he was soon to return. The next night he came back to her and when he came to her she was unprepared not expecting him to return to her so soon. But again growing up having to protect herself she stabbed him. She thought he had died. But a few nights later he comes back luckily for her the detective fellI really like the author Dean Coontz and his style of writing. This book was not one of my favorite written by him because the beginning starts out slow so it's hard to get into the book. But toward the end it starts to get really good. To read this book you have to have a lot of patience because it's really long but once you get into the book it's hard to put down"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I enjoyed this book. The storyline and the characters were great. However, I felt that the book wasn't complete...some things weren't cleared. As another reader said, Koontz should've added an epilogue to conclude. I still recommend this book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Alfred Hitchcock purportedly bought the film rights to Whispers, but died before being able to do anything with it. I find that story easy to believe, since I thought of Psycho the entire time I was reading it. Koontz set out to write a Freudian horror story, and succeeded.Hilary Thomas has a stalker who simply won't go away - even after she kills him. Is he undead? A ghost? Whatever he is, he's lethal. A cop assigned to the case helps her find out what's going on, so it can be brought to a halt.Koontz has played with the returning dead menace in other books, but this was the one in which he did it best, probably because it was fresh. The only flaw in the book is that several early scenes with the detective and his closest police buddy are essentially unnecessary, and go on too long. Aside from that, it's extremely cleverly plotted, with several surprising twists and turns along the way. The suspense is steady.There's a Canadian film version starring Victoria Tennant and Chris Sarandon that is pretty good, but the book is much more satisfying."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"From the copyright date (1980) I could tell that \\"Whispers\\" was one of Dean Koontz's earlier books. And it is notably different from his more recent ones.It is about a young woman named Hillary who has been abused as a child yet has made it big in life. Then, without warning, she is attacked by an acquaintance named Bruno in her own home on night. He tries to rape and murder her, but Hillary manages to get a gun on him, but then incredibly, she allows him to leave only to endure another attack by him that very morning. But then, she stabs him twice in the belly with a knife, after which, Bruno staggers away to die!Thinking that it's all over, Hillary gets involved in a corny and sappy romance with a police officer that wants to be an artist. Then, she encounters Bruno yet again! Has he actually come back from the dead?Then launches a frantic investigation into Bruno's past in order to explain these strange events and Bruno's motivations.Although parts of the book were truly chilling, other parts were totally sappy and corny which made me want to wretch, especially the love scenes! And there were a lot of events in the story that were totally ridiculous and appalling like Hillary just allowing Bruno to leave after attempting to rape and murder her! Who in their right mind would just allow someone that dangerous just walk out instead of popping him, preventing future attempts on not only on her life, but on others?And that conversation with a frog that the policeman, Tony, had while asking Hillary out was corny. He was no doubt trying to be charming, but I found it to be just stupid.I gave this book 3 out of 5 stars because there were a lot of stupid, ridiculous, and downright corny scenes like there are in almost all of Koontz's books. Many other scenes were unarguably terrifying, however. Indeed, the rape and murder scenes were truly graphic, even more so than in his other books I have read.But although the author obviously tries to make the reader feel sympathy for the murderous Bruno with stories of childhood abuse, my mind just could not get past his atrocious acts of rape and murder for me to do so. At best, I wound up feeling only apathy for him and looking forward to his death as being in the best interests for all concerned, including both Brunos.Overall, I found it to be an interesting read, but not the best."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"&quot;Whispers&quot; was a great book. Very mysterious. It kept you on your toes till the very end, guessing what the truth about Bruno Frye was. The characters are very intresting. They all lead such seperate lives..all so different from your own..but yet, you can still relate to each and every one. The book is very well written in that sense. I'd recommend this book to all types of people. I'm only 15 years old, but right after I read the book.. my mom (42 yrs) read it.. and she loved it just as much. Great book. Don't pass it by."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book couldn't be summed up into 1,000 wds. or less. It was, at times, extremely puzzling, boring, pointless, raw terror, corruptive, fulfilling. But yet, each sentence was causing me to feel as though I should be using a dictionary or re-reading the sentence to re-feel the moment. This is the one book about cops and robbers (kinda) that made me want to go on. The only thing that was dissapointing was the ending. Too cheesy, made me think of rainbows in the background. Not intirely the right ending but it was a nice try for all those who appreciate the damsel in distress act then having the Oprah Winfrey ending. Giant roaches are more Stephen King don't you agree?"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I thought this book would never end, the only thing I like was part of the ending, however at the same time other aspects of the ending were a let down, Could not stand the protagonists, half way through started rooting for the antagonist"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I am a great fan of Dean Koontz. I've read about a dozen of his books and intend to tackle all of them eventually. This work, however, is way too long. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through it. It is just too repetitive. Another thing about this book that is a little off-putting is that Koontz can't seem to make-up his mind if he's writing a suspense novel or soft-core porn. I'm not a prude - far from it, but this novel needs a picture of Fabio ripping a bodice on the cover."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"My first Dean Koontz book was Phantoms, which was absolutely the most terrifying book ever. I got hooked, and in time I read The Funhouse, The House of Thunder, Darkfall, The Vision, Watchers, and then Night Chills, but for a long time, Whispers sat on my shelf, and I finally decided to read it. I read it about four or five weeks ago, and right afterwards, I was shaken. However, in the weeks following until now, I have constantly been thinking back to it and shivering. I cannot understand why Dean Koontz is always immediately classified as a horror writer (the same goes for Stephen King). He has only written about three novels that could be classified under &quot;horror&quot;, and this is not one of them. In fact, this novel is one of the furthest things from horror; it is pure suspense and mystery. It is a novel about people. It is about people who are scared, who are in stressful situations, who are trying to know what is going on, and who are trying to keep themselves from being engulfed by all this stress. Not to spoil the book, but I thought that I should mention that the killer in the book is scared of the dark. Not just scared of it, either, but absolutely terrified. This is one of the things that gets to me the most about this book; since I am scared of the dark, I can relate to him, and even feel pity for him. The story that goes with this novel is astounding, and is truely a mystery. For a long time, Phantoms and Watchers were my favorite books by Mr. Koontz; now that I have thought about the situation more, I realize that Whispers is truely my favorite. I almost cried in some scenes, and almost screamed at others. Alltogether, however, I truely gasped at most of the scenes. Because of this book, I have a better reason to keep all the lights on in my room at night; otherwise, the room fills with all these strange whispers... That's all."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book took me two years to complete. And I only completed it because I always finish a book I start. The characters are very one dimesnsional and typical of Koontz's books. How many times will he use the successful but trouble past,lead woman character and the Tough but sympathetic and lonely detective???? How many??? The book is also very predictable. I knew the big secret a 1/4 of the way through and I never doubted that &quot;Everything will be o.k. at the end&quot;. The only highlight of this book is the villian's past which of course you only get a taste of at the very end of the novel. Other than that, you have no idea why he's doing what he's doing. Oh,, I forgot,, he's crazy and keeps returning. That's enough of an explanation.If you are a true Horror novel fan but new to koontz, please don't waste your time with this book. Also don't go by the ratings on this site. Apparantly his fans are blind to what's good and bad by him. Watchers and Phantoms are much better books but they give Whispers the same 4 or 5 star rating. Go Figure?"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"First of all I love Dean Koontz, and this was the first book of his I've read that really disappointed me. The story itself is really good, and could've been made very suspenseful, but Koontz got caught up in describing IN DETAIL so much just plain crap that I got lost. It took me a while to figure out what the book was even about while I was sifting through Hilary and Tony's (a police officer) background stories, and what a wonderful guy Tony is. Then it got good when Bruno (the bad guy) breaks into Hilary's house and tries to kill her. Then you have to sit through Tony checking her out and wanting to hold her while she's trying to give her statement to his partner. Blah blah blah. Then for some unknown reason he wastes several pages going into the details of Tony's partner's life which made me think it would become relevant later in the book but never did. Just wasted reading. Koontz goes waaaay to in detail on a case the two officers are working on, which, AGAIN, I think will come into play later in the book only to find out all the boring details were extremely unnecessary. THEN Koontz gets into a very graphic sex scene and I just couldn't help but think \\"When does the actual story start?\\" The book should've actually been half as long as it is. If that was the case it would've been a very good book because like I said, the storyline was good, it just took Koontz forever to get to it.All in all I'm not turned off of Koontz' books, because most of them are great, I would just skip this one if I could do it over."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"just when you think you're safe...this book keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing what's around the next corner. hilary thomas is a strong female character who takes care of herself, even when confronted with quite the adversary (and an interesting one). just when she thinks she's out of the woods, though, she finds that she's wrong. this is one of the most riveting of koontz's novels, in my opinion, because the reader is left not only wondering what will happen next but why it's happening. thankfully, the answers are there eventually."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"WHISPERS was a major breakthrough in Dean's career, and when you read the book, it's easy to see why. It's an excruciatingly suspenseful tale of a talented, yet troubled young screenwriter being stalked by a relentless psycho who has a rather unique background of his own (to put it lightly).But that's merely the surface story here. Koontz explores the serious theme of how childhood experiences can exert a powerful--if almost invisible--influence on an adult's life. It's a distinctly Freudian theory, and it's interesting to note that in interviews several years after he published this book, Dean criticizes his views as naive and uninformed.Nevertheless, whether you agree with the psychological theories or not, you can read and enjoy this book for what it is: a masterful example of the suspense tale executed by a truly brilliant author. I refer to this novel again and again as I publish my own suspense novels, for sheer inspiration!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a highly suspenseful book, written in clear, spare prose. It is an easy read and a definite page turner. It is a plot driven book, however, with little character development.The plot itself is simple. A beautiful screenwriter, Hilary Thomas, is confronted in her own home by an intruder named Bruno Frye. It seems that Mr. Frye has been stalking Ms. Thomas in the belief that Ms. Thomas is his long deceased mother, Katherine, who has ostensibly come back from the dead in order to kill him. He feels that he must kill her, before she kills him.Of course, Ms. Thomas has no clue as to why Frye has singled her out. She is aware only of his murderous intent, and she is afraid, very afraid. On Frye's first go around with Ms. Thomas, she survives. On the second go around, Frye does not. Thinking herself to be safe, as Frye has seemingly gone to his maker, she is shocked when he, yet again, confronts her with deadly intent.Why this is happening and how, will certainly keep the reader turning the pages. Some of it is predictable, but it, nonetheless, makes for an absorbing, easy read. This is one of the author's better, early efforts. Readers who enjoy suspenseful novels will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Dean Koontz wrote WHISPERS in 1980, and was his first large success. I enjoyed this novel overall, because it is highly suspensful serial killer story (especially toward the second half of the book). It is also very well written and I liked most of the major characters.Although enjoyable, WHISPERS isn't perfect. This is a very long book, almost twice as long as your average suspense novel. It tends to drag a bit at the beginning. There are also long dialogues between characters which seem more like disguised political commentary than real conversations.This is also the most sexually explicit novel by Koontz that I have ever read; I would not recommmend this novel to people who don't care for those types of scenes. There is a relatively graphic rape scene toward the end of the book that seems pretty gratuitous to me --it doesn't really serve to push the plot forward.This book, although very good, isn't nearly as great as Koontz' later stuff. If you want to begin reading Koontz, I would suggest starting with novels like WATCHERS, PHANTOMS, LIGHTNING, INTENSITY, or ODD THOMAS. Those are much better novels overall, and more representative of the great talent that Koontz possesses."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is the first book by Dean Koontz that I read, and even after finishing INTENSITY, MR. MURDER, HIDEAWAY, and THE EYES OF DARKNESS, it still ranks as my favorite. I am a bit of a skeptic when I read book reviews raving that the book is &quot;chilling&quot; or &quot;spine-tingling,&quot; but I can honestly claim that WHISPERS was both those things and more.The reason I appreciated WHISPERS so much is because of the incredibly well-crafted plot. As a mystery fan, I really enjoy reading a book that gives you an impossibly baffling plot twist and finally wraps up the entire story at the very end, tying up all the loose ends. Koontz shows himself to be not only a master storyteller but a super plotter. At first glance, this book may seem like another cheap, come-back-from-the-dead serial killer novel, but at the end, everything is explained logically and realistically, which makes it all the more shocking. But it isn't just the plot; there are genuinely horrifying moments and the climax is both suspenseful and disturbing. One of those books that makes you sit back after reading the last sentence and say, &quot;Wow.&quot;"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"The first book by Koontz that I read was Phantoms and since that I have read a number of his books and loved all of them (except \\"Midnight\\", which was decent but not great). My favorite was \\"Lightning\\", but \\"Whispers\\" is equally good, perhaps even better.Hollywood screenwriter marked by a traumatic childhood, Hilary Thomas (a typical Koontz character) gets attacked by a respected man, Bruno Frye. Hilary manages to kill him in self-defense, but realizes her problems aren't over when he attacks her again. Has he come back from the dead? Together with policeman Tony Clemenza (who would prefer being an artist instead of a police), she tries to find out what has happened. Soon, the fascinating story of the Frye family slowly unfolds.Like in Koontz other books, we get a psychological explanation to the behavior of our \\"heroes\\", but what is even more important in this book is that we get to explore the mind of the \\"villain\\", Bruno Frye. In for example Koontz' \\"Intensity\\", we get no explanation why the villain is behaving as he is, he is just sick (but it's a very good book too, and well described). It seems as if Koontz can make up the most fantastic story and make it sound totally logical.This book is not only very good entertainment reading but it also makes you think. I recommend it to everybody!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"(Unfortunately, I read Shattered first, which was not really so impressive for a new Koontz reader, but seemingly unique nonetheless.)I really enjoyed reading Whispers because of its great plot, genuinely unique but realistic at the same time. DK has an admirable writing style wherein he combines his thickening plot with lots of twists &amp; subplots without losing the main idea of the story---albeit, even complementing it &amp; adding more to the suspense. I also admire his narrative skill -- it made me feel like I was really there, experiencing every tremor of the earth, every whisper in the dark.His book is not solely for entertainment but one with values as well. After reading the book, I learned not to take everything in face value. Not everyone is beautiful &amp; not every beautiful creature is truly beautiful inside. Likewise, noone is truly, dark &amp; bad at heart. Somehow, somewhere, somebody turned them to be what they are right now. Last but not the least, there is always hope in life. If you were born poor &amp; dirty, you do not necessarily have to live &amp; die as such. Life has a lot to offer..whether you live in LA or elsewhere."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"My first Dean Koontz book was Phantoms, which was absolutely the most terrifying book ever. I got hooked, and in time I read The Funhouse, The House of Thunder, Darkfall, The Vision, Watchers, and then Night Chills, but for a long time, Whispers sat on my shelf, and I finally decided to read it. I read it about four or five weeks ago, and right afterwards, I was shaken. However, in the weeks following until now, I have constantly been thinking back to it and shivering. I cannot understand why Dean Koontz is always immediately classified as a horror writer (the same goes for Stephen King). He has only written about three novels that could be classified under &quot;horror&quot;, and this is not one of them. In fact, this novel is one of the furthest things from horror; it is pure suspense and mystery. It is a novel about people. It is about people who are scared, who are in stressful situations, who are trying to know what is going on, and who are trying to keep themselves from being engulfed by all this stress. Not to spoil the book, but I thought that I should mention that the killer in the book is scared of the dark. Not just scared of it, either, but absolutely terrified. This is one of the things that gets to me the most about this book; since I am scared of the dark, I can relate to him, and even feel pity for him. The story that goes with this novel is astounding, and is truely a mystery. For a long time, Phantoms and Watchers were my favorite books by Mr. Koontz; now that I have thought about the situation more, I realize that Whispers is truely my favorite. I almost cried in some scenes, and almost screamed at others. Alltogether, however, I truely gasped at most of the scenes. Because of this book, I have a better reason to keep all the lights on in my room at night; otherwise, the room fills with all these strange whispers... That's all."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This 500 page thriller kept me on edge for its entirety. When Hilary is brutally attacked by a seemingly psychotic madman, she is forced to defend herself which results in her attacker's death. How is it possible then that the same man is once again after her, more determined than ever to destroy her? What follows is both filled with mystery and intrigue, as well as extremely horrific scenes and imagery. Once again, Koontz fills this novel with both violent and sensual sex. He really has a way of arousing the senses, whether through pleasant emotions or outright creepy ones.The reason this book is better than the other Koontz books I've read is due its complexity. There's a lot more going on here than it may first appear and when all the separate threads start to come together, even if you once again know what's going on before the characters do, there's a high level of excitement and anticipation.\\"Whispers\\" is the 5th Koontz book I've read and although it is most definitely the best one so far, I still can't give it 5 out of 5 as there are flaws that stop it from reaching the upper echelons of horror / thriller literature. First of all there are quite a few occasions where the author apparently has some political stance that he wants to get out. Or perhaps it's just that he's studied a particular aspect of society in order to understand it better and now chooses to share that knowledge with the reader. It's interesting stuff, no doubt about it, but plays no part in the story itself. In fact, it only holds the story back from moving forward. Furthermore, there are some very strange decisions made by some of the main characters. There are times where the most obvious solutions to the mysteries involved are just screaming at them and yet they remain oblivious to them, preferring to look at things from a more supernatural point of view.The characters are generally well created, given enough background information to make the reader give a damn, yet their conversations are quite often rather contrived, particularly the banter between Hillary and Tony, which is entertainingly filled with wit and humour, and yet never seems like a conversation two people that have just met each other would have. But you will have a smile on your face regardless. To Koontz's credit, both Katherine and Bruno manage to demand some sympathy, even though their actions are unbelievably cruel and brutal.\\"Whispers\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable read despite its flaws and one that I recommend to Koontz fans or fans of tense, horrific thrillers. Once again, it's worth noting that there are some very graphically violent moments in this novel, so beware the faint of heart. I'm still looking for a Koontz masterpiece, but in the meantime, this passed away a few hours nicely."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I must say I've only read two Dean Koontz novels in my life. The first was Intensity, the second was Whispers. And it's like the same thing happened with both. I started to read the book but for some reason I found it somehow difficult to keep reading, like the book was too heavy, gave many turns and didn't push the plot forward. I stopped reading Intensity and later on I started it all over again and enjoyed it at the end. I had left Whispers behind and I decided to give it another try. I read it in four days, the last of which I stayed up till 2am. It was a great book. Not a horror novel but a very good psychological thriller which kept me guessing all the way. Koontz has created one of the most memorable villains. The reason why this one is so special is because it's not the typical EVIL character. You really get to symphatize with him more than once (something that did not happen with the character of Tony Clemenza which I didn't like and reason why I dont give the novel a higher rating). On the other hand is the victim, Hilary, a woman who has fought all her way up to the top and is scared that everything she has accomplished so far may crumble down any second. Despite the avalanche of words it IS possible to be caught inside a book like this. The final chapter is by far the best and keeps the suspense at its peak literaly until the last page (the novel does not have an epilogue). Things I didn't like, well, Clemenza's character and his relation with his partner Frank which has a dramatic change in just 2 days. Still a great read which stays with you long after closing the book. Me I'm about to read Fear Nothing and look forward to read other Koontz's."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This was the first book I read by Dean Koontz and my introduction to horror and suspense. I loved it when I was fourteen and enjoyed it as an adult. For those of you who haven't read this yet, it is a serial killer novel with a twista very clever and dark one. The only complaint I have with this story is the police department. You have the typical brute who believes the protagonist, Hillary Thomas, is making her story up to get their attention. And, the cop who plays Romeo and solves her case.

A villain is killed and then returns for revenge? I had never read anything like it before in my life!

If you want a REAL horror story try THE SEASON OF PASSAGE."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Although I've tried to enjoy Dean Koontz's works, I've always felt a certain drain on me when reading them. It's no doubt that the author has some level of staying power--or at least some prolific ability to turn out works at a continual, steady pace--but Koontz has always come across to me as rather unadventurous. He almost seems to deliberately take anticipated roads as if so doing is a twist of its own, or at least to save the reader for the real bangers down the road. Only, he never gives the payoff that he apparently tries to build up for. Such is the common pitfall of plot-driven novels.Though my main gripe has to do with the way most of his works incorporate a recurring theme of mere 'stark contrasts'. It's either black or it's white; the characters are either completely good, or completely bad. And in this, he tends to be a bit reluctant in being dynamic with his character development, unadventurous.Frey is evil, he's evil because he likes to rape and murder women; Thomas is good because she survives a bad background and becomes a success despite it. This is very day-and-night-style construction. At least if the reasons, for which these characters were made to be either sympathetic/unsympathetic, were a little more dynamic, then one might even think to over-look such a structure. Unfortunately, to play the 'I had abusive parents and 'causa that, I deserve your sympathy' card just makes the character cliche. Especially if it's what the characters have experienced that shape the character into what they ultimately become for the story.How the characters interact with one another is another example of the contrast syndrome. In one scene where Frank, the mean-cop, is attempted to be made into another sympathy character with the 'my first wife died and my second wife cruelly shafted me' card, the dialog in the jeep on the way home from the bar is an example of such. It's either 'yes, you'll find someone to love you' or it's, 'no, I'll never,' played back and forth in variations until Frank passes out. And in the scene where Tony and Hillary drive back from the restaurant and get into a discussion about Tony's paintings it's the same identical structure: 'Your artwork is wonderful and will get attention,' and, 'No, my artwork is not wonderful and it will not get attention'.There isn't much material available to flesh out characters or plot when the author limits themselves to just hopping from one end of the pole to the other. As Tony might agree, an artist can do more with a drawing by using black, white, and several shades of gray, too . . . without the gray, it makes for, quite literally, two dimensional characters in a two dimensional plot. If one reads a work by Stephen King, for instance, one can at least call the characters 'realistic' in their relations with the readers. The characters, just like real life people, can jump all over the place in terms of their out-look, thinking, etc. And as each one of us can get on someone's nerves at one moment, then garner affection the next, to accomplish this with a fictional character shows a good command by the author of the characters he creates.But I could hardly see Koontz making a version of Whispers where he gave Frey a true chance at being much more than Mr. Evil, and Thomas a true chance at being anything further than Mrs. Victim.Even though this is an older novel, even in 1980 Koontz had been writing for about ten years or more which, when thinking about it, makes me rather disappointed to understand that his skill had still not yet begun to bud."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book is another mediocre work from Koontz. I enjoy his writing style, but the plot is flat and the story is very predictable and ends abruptly (like most of his novels). My main complaint with the book though, is that the characters simply do not act like normal people would. Its not all bad though. The ideas about abuse and the mystery of Bruno Frye are quite interesting, but I can only recommend this book if you have enjoyed other Koontz novels."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I have to say that I am a great fan of horror books. Stephen King tops everyone else but that does not mean I do not read any other horror author. From Peter Straub to James Herbert to Dean Koontz I try to discover any author serving to the genre. I had read three books by Dean Koontz in the past. Watchers was very good (I wonder now after reading Whispers and Voice of the Night if Koontz was so drunken that he could write it) Then Lightning: his best book in my opinion. Then came Voice of the Night: It was not horrorful, it was non-senseful; it made no sense at all; no storyline, no aim, no scene, no action, no humour. Piece of dry paper work. But now Whispers tops everything else in being terrible. What a shame! How can a writer, trying to claim a share in the horror genre, write such a meaningless, pointless, childish and absurd book? OK SK writes bad books, Peter Straub writes bad books. But even they are worth something. However when Koontz writes bad, he writes deadpan bad, and makes one wonder how his books were published in the first place. But then who wrote Watchers and Ligtning? Maybe his \\"dark\\" twin, a twin like the one in \\"Whisper\\" God, this book is terrible! It is not even funny in terms of absurdity! It is rather an insult to the reader! Directly steer off it and run away as if the Devil is at your heels!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"this book is to my knowledge koontz masterpiece. that's right, i don't care for the guy. but i don't hate this. i accept the plot (for once), though simple it is. it is exposed ok. a woman is being attacked. noone (but one, koontz, please)believes her. the matter turns out to be graver than first thought. two details (the abuse, &quot;the whispers&quot;) are carried out good. but as always with koontz the story is merred by a disgusting sentimentality which is more likely to touch your stomach than your heart. lot of irrelevant stuff, especially about the police officer's partner. i've never found koontz' characters to be so sympathetic as people claim. if you manage to forget about your best friend during one lousy flight, you're worse than most."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is the worst book I have read in ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty...whatever-you-say years.

Koontz is so inadept in telling it I wanted to call him and tell how a good writing should be-- me, a housewife witha fourteen-year graduate of college...Skip this and read James Patterson. D. Koontz does not know how to write. It is that simple."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book. it got off to a slow start but once it picked up I was hooked. Its got some good twists and turns, something you expect from a Koontz book. My only problem with the read was some of the graphic sexual scenes and implied sex, I didn't feel it was all necessary and some parts made me feel that I needed to take a bath. However, I would recommend this."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Whispers catches your attention and makes you want to keep reading like most of Koontz's books. I couldn't wait til the next chance I had to read to see what happened. The only problem I had with this book is that when it came to the end, it just ended and I felt like it should have had at least another few pages of explanation. Other than that It was a very good read."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book was written in 1979, before Koontz got famous. In fact, it is pretty much the book that made him famous. Or as he puts it in the Afterword, \\"this is the book that saved me from a life of crime.\\" He argues that writing was his only skill, and if this had not sold . . .But it did. It's a tight psychological thriller that delivers the full complement of chills up the spine, and eventually offers a compassionate view of a horrible killer. Or as one of the main characters, Joshua the lawyer, put it: \\"i just wish all of the villains in this piece were thoroughly vile and despicable. It seems wrong, somehow, to feel so much sympathy for them.\\"This is a problem for real-life criminologists, too. I recently saw a TV special about \\"The Man Who Studies Murder.\\" In digging into murderers' stories, learning what twisted histories they had, how often they were themselves the victims of horrible abuse, it is easy to forget that they are still responsible for their reactions to that abuse and their dehumanizing of their victims. Lots of people had crappy childhoods, but not all of them became killers. Plenty become therapists or criminologists or perhaps even writers of psychological thrillers.This story is very good, but it is early Koontz. If you enjoy it, you will clearly want to read his more recent works. I'm giving this one five stars mostly because it is a deeply moving story of the psychological thriller type. Later Koontz was able to transcend genre categories and write stories more uniquely his own. He's definitely one of our handful of best writers."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I encourage those who feel Koontz has steered away from horror to read some of his old books, especially Whispers. This was a great book and is now my 2nd favorite Koontz novel (Watchers will always be my favorite). Whispers is an early Koontz horror novel and I know that he prefers terror to horror but I've got to tell you this book is scary enough to be placed into the horror genre. It works on all levels. Whispers scared me enough that I felt like I was being watched at night. I loved it! I love scary novels and this one certainly works! If you like being frightened like Stephen King used to do then try Whispers. It will creep you out without all the gross stuff. I have to say that the sex was shocking and the violence was much more than Koontz's later works so those who are easily disturbed or unable to handle a mature horror novel might want to read something like Lightning or The Face of Fear. I, for one, love the violence and enjoy having the crap scared out of me. I could not put this book down and had it with me everywhere I went. Do yourself a favor and have the living daylights scared out of you and read Whispers and hope you don't hear them late at night when you're asleep..."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Is Dean Koontz the best writer in the world? No way.Is he the best horror author? Certainly notIs he top 10 best writers? Nope, he isn'tDoes Dean Koontz write entertaining stories full of suspense, mystery, and other elements? Yes he does.Thats why i'm a fan...i want to be entertained by a story, nothing more and nothing less. Once again, Koontz has totally satasfied me with \\"Whispers\\".With the exception of \\"Life Expectancy\\" and \\"Velocity\\", i find Koontz older works to be just a little better than his recent stuff. In \\"Whispers\\", it is apparent that the writing is a little crisper, the character's are a little more realistic and developed. The mystery and possibilities are just a little more intriguing.This is a book that all fans of Koontz should read, for two reasons. One: it was his breakout book that accelerated his career and made him very succesful. Two: if you're a fan of Koontz, than you obviously enjoy suspense and mystery throughout a creepy story.This book is very suspenseful, very creepy, and keeps you guessing. I liked that it was a longer book for Koontz, as you can really dive into and get deeply involved in the characters and their lives.My only complaints (the reason i say 4 1/2 stars) is that once again a cop is a main character, which you find too often in a Koontz book in my opinion, and that the ending was wrapped up very quickly (although the ending was decent i thought)Almost always, Koontz satasfies me with his stories, but once in a while (like \\"Watchers\\", \\"The Bad Place\\" and \\"Lightning\\") he goes just a level further, and his already good books become something great. \\"Whispers\\" falls into the \\"great\\" category as far as i'm concerned, and is a worthwhile read for fans of horror and thrillers, and of course fans of Koontz."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Dean Koontz has done it again.I bought this in audio version. Could not stop listening to it. Nail biter. Humor excitement romance and heart ache all in one book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Dean Koontz has remained on the top ten list of my altime favorite authors, even while I am now finding new authors that are very strong in their own rights."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"If truth were to be told (which is rarely the case), even Dean himself might tell you he's never written another novel quite like Whispers. So many of his fans point to Watchers as his magnum opus--but I'm sorry, I can't do it. As undeniably great as Watchers is, Whispers is THE ONE that put Koontz on the map, and rightfully so.Through numerous pots of coffee, I voraciously consumed an enormous amount of this story during one sitting, simply because I was so terribly engrossed by it and nothing else seemed to matter. I can remember all too easily how gloriously disturbed I felt while reading it, and never again have I been so absurdly distracted by a mere story.If you want his scariest, I'd have to say Phantoms. If you want his most popular, go with Watchers.But if you're looking for his most horrifyingly suspenseful tale, with an insanely mind-blowing mystery buried in a beautiful plot, and with character depth measured only in fathoms...Whispers is The One."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I read this book not knowing a lot about Dean Koontz. This story is horrible. What I mean is the details of the story are horrible. The book is one of the best written stories I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. I was so intrigued by what was going on. I HAD to know what happened. I would try to explain to people the details of the story and most people looked at me like I was crazy and asked why I was reading the book. Even years later when I explain it to people they think it is messed up. But that's part of what made it so good. I couldn't stop thinking about it. And I was caught completely by surprise by several events in the book. I recommend this to anyone who isn't easily turned off by things. In the end it all makes sense. This is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This books is not the perfect novel, but it is pretty darn close. One particular shortcoming was that a character would be developed for no real purpose (that character's role ended up being minimal at best). Another issue I had with Whispers is that it seemed pretty predictable. I knew what the end results would be fairly early, and I like surprises. Shortcomings aside, this book gripped me and drew me in from the first page. I may have figured out early on where the story was going, but I was so into the book that I remained on the path to the final conclusion. The main characters are, for the most part, likable. Mr. Koontz's ability to delve into the mind of the psychopath is stunning, and chilling. So good is he, in fact, that when said baddie does his bad guy things, I felt the need to shower, as though I was there with him, helping. So while this novel remains rough around the edges, it is an easy and gripping read. My next book will be a Dean Koontz book as well, so I was obviously impressed."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This was the first of Dean Koontz books to read. I fell inlove with this author immediately. The numerous breaks I was forced to take just to get through. At times, just closing it and taking a breather. You're on the edge of your seat, or in my situation, my bed, sitting up with mouth open wanting to scream out myself. The female character becomes you and you're confused of who is whom and what is going and why. It's sad in the way of why people do horrible things to others, and when young enough, it alters your life forever. I've never been disappointed in one of his books yet. I've run out of room for the hardcover, so try to keep paperback. I will never turn these in to the used book place. They're keepers!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I read this book when it first came out back in the 80's and I loved it then....I found it again recently and actually didn't realize I had read it before, until I got through the first two chapters. I was as mesmerized as I was the first time I read it. It's well written, keeps you anxious to read more and quite hard to put down. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This was a truly great book. It is one of my favorites. I am 16 years old and I used to hate reading but now I am addicted to it and the book really inspired me to read more. The book has a very catching story and it was even better the second time I read it because you know the truth of what had been going on the whole time and it helps you understand and really get into the second time so I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is my (seventh?) Dean Koontz book that I have read, and I loved it. The suspense is chilling, the people are so realistic, and the psychology is astonishing. Like Watchers, Koontz shows us the opinions of both the good guys and the bad guys, showing us just what the BIG story is. Anyone who is a fan of Dean Koontz, don't ask questions about this book, just READ IT. The no-brainer(roboco@flash.net) who said that this book was boring, non-horrifying, and predictable, is full of it. Well, anyone who takes his review for granted, don't; he knows nothing. JUST READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I find it hard to just sit down and read and read .... and well read. I have to well it rarly happens so i can't explain it. I was a bit bored so i looked through my Mom's books and saw this. It looked interesting enough but once i started reading it i coulden't stop i read 200 pages in two days and then still coulden't put it down. I fiished reading it about 30 minutes ago. When i read the last words i just sat back in the colorful deck chair I was sitting and and said aloud.. wow. &lt;&lt;smile&gt;&gt; I highly recomend this book. This was the first Dean koontz book I have read, witch is understandable because i am only fifteen. I plan on reading as meny of his books as possable. It is great to sit out in the sun and read. Well i suggest that everyone reads this book it wad great trying to figure everything out what was happening and who would live or fall victum. I love his style of writing. And you were not sure if He really came back to life or if there ! was some explanition for it all. Well to find out if there was one or he was a walking zombie read the book. It was amazing to find out what those wisperings were and the crawling things were. It just makes you want to shudder and flail around as bruno did. It was just a great book you can't explain it all. so * * read it * * &lt;&lt;smile&gt;&gt;"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I absolutely loved this book. When I started reading it, It held my attention right away. Usually, I don't have a lot of time to read, but I made time to finish this book. Once the story started to unravel, I just had to find out what was up with this stalker and why he had such a fetish with people that looked like his mother. Once I'd finished it and the truth was revealed, I couldn't think of anything but \\"Oh. My. God.\\" It was just so good and original. It seems like it would start out as a super-natural story, but its not. It's not at all. It is a storyline that is destined to stay in your mind, and you'll want to read it again, I swear it."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I must say first that other than WHISPERS, I have only read 2 other books by Dean Koontz, but ever since the first one, I have been a fan! WHISPERS is truly a phenominal piece of art! This is what you're waiting your whole life to feel from a book. These characters become you and you them. Koontz pulls you right into the action, suspense, and relationships in this book. After reading about the first 10 pages, I put it away because it seemed less interesting than some of the others. However, 3 weeks later, I picked it up again and I finished it in a day's time! It was so fantastic that I couldn't put it down (literally)! I read it every chance I had. This is a great book for Koontz fans and if you have not read one of his books yet, this one will definitely get you hooked!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I'm usually a big Dean Koontz fan but lately I've been disappointed with some of his work. He seems to veer from some of the most imaginative, well-written suspense fiction around these days (False Memory) to hammy, predictable fudge that you'd expect from a 9th grader (From the Corner of his Eye). &quot;Whispers&quot; falls somewhere between the two and is certainly not one of his better works.The basic story is that Hilary Thomas, a screenwriter who survived a traumatic childhood at the hands of alocholic parents, is terrorised in her home by a vineyard owner who seems to think she is his mother reincarnated. Enter our police team, who come in the painfully cliched good cop-bad cop format. Bad cop thinks she's making it all up to get attention (and tells her as much) even though she has absolutely no reason to, while good cop not only believes her story, but fancies the pants off her to boot. Good cop-bad cop leave, only for the attacker to return to the house to finish off the job. However, Hilary is armed with a knife and fatally stabs him.Strange, then, that the very same person arrives in her house several nights later, determined to put her in an early grave. At this stage, Hilary has entered a relationship with Tony Clemenza (good cop) and together they set about unravelling the mystery of how Bruno Frye has apparently risen from the dead.Whispers is a story with promise, however, it is ruined by its cliched (and not very likeable) characters. Thomas is a complete sterotype- her way of dealing with her traumatic childhood is to ignore people. Clemenza and his partner are almost laughably predictable and Bruno Frye, the knife wielding, mentally unbalanced rapist-murderer, just doesn't seem to be bright enough to pull off a string of violent murders without anyone even noticing their similarities, let alone getting away with it.Another area where this book falls down is in its completely irrelevant and extraneous sub-plot involving a convicted rapist who has skipped parole and is offending again. It appears only to exist so that Koontz can kill off bad cop and let Hilary and Tony find comfort in eachother's arms.This isn't a terrible book, but there are some terrible parts in it (particularly the gag-inducing visit to an ex-drug dealer who now deisgns womens clothes and exhorts Tony to follow his dream of painting full time). The true weakness is that instead of writing three-dimensional, likeable characters, Koontz exaggerates their qualities (be they good or bad) so much that he ends up with a group of annoying charicatures on his hands. Not a good thing."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a horror/supernatural thriller that is an early work and it shows. I like the author but this book is incredibly violent, has mental illness galore, and tons of inflated monolog and dialog. An ok work to review for the fans, one to skip for the others."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"InElements of Fiction Writing - Conflict and Suspense, author James Scott Bell raves about Dean Koontz and Whispers in particular, namely for its attempted rape scene/chase through a house that goes on for 17 pages but doesn't feel like it. I never read Koontz in my life, nor was I planning to, but Bell's constant cheerleading of Koontz in his writing books convinced me to give him a try. I'm glad I did, but not for the reasons Bell or Koontz would like. At least now I can speak from experience why I don't like Koontz.The characters are cliche and dialogue often seems stilted. There's also no direct connection between one of the main characters and the others, but Koontz spends a long time with this old curmudgeonly lawyer before he ever has the guy hook up with the romantic leads, so his (many) solo chapters get boring fast, as they are mostly long paragraphs with little to no dialogue.The only black guy in the book is constantly referred to as \\"the black man\\" or \\"the black ex-con\\" even after he's given a name and purpose in the story (albeit a minor one). We only see him for a few pages, so do we really need more than one reference to him being black? I doubt we can forget what color his skin is in two pages, but Koontz seems to hold a low opinion of his reader's memory. Maybe it's not racist, but it's definitely lazy writing.The chapters are way too long (I found myself skipping over the endless boring parts like where he spends half a page describing a room where no action takes place). The paragraphs are also agonizingly long (some go on for nearly a page). And most of the book is made up of page after page of Koontz telling me what's going on (then editorializing on everything that's wrong with society in his author's voice, not the characters'). He's not doing his job by showing me what's happening through his characters actions, reactions, and dialogue. Hello! That's writing 101.The whole plot is stale and contrived. I had it more or less figured out as soon as the first twist came in. It's painfully obvious what's going on, but it's takes the characters a long time to figure it out, and then they're off jet-setting around trying to solve the mystery and in no danger for a long time as a result of being nowhere near the killer. Snooze!Some of the book is well-written (the aforementioned 17 page chase scene flies by, for example), but overall, Whispers is a bit painful and amateurish to read. I almost gave up on it but pushed through to the underwhelming conclusion. Not a great book. In his afterword, Koontz says his publisher rejected this novel upon him first submitting it, telling him he was \\"a mid-list suspense writer who had overreached.\\" And you know what? I agree with the publisher! 2.5 stars is the most I can rate this book."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I agree with the review from September '04. I read this book some time ago, but sheesh...it was excellent. The villian in that novel scared me. The real cause of the whispers...wait until you find that one out - you will not be disappointed.Koontz really hit a home run with this novel!Congrats on this book to Mr. Koontz."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Well what can I say about this book that will do it justice? For starters it has one of the best villians I've ever read about. Not only is he truly insane and sadistic but by the end you realize he is also a victim. You actually feel sorry for him.The other characters are very good also. All of them. Now that is rare, not to find one character in a book you do not like.Next is the story. It is simply just flat out a great story. Well told and well written. Add the top notch group of characters and you get one hell of a book.This is my third Koontz book and it is by far the best so far. Not that the others were bad, Shattered and Watchers, on the contrary they were very good also but not on par with this great novel. Quite simply this is a must read, PERIOD!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I can't lie--I found this book very enjoyable and interesting. It's an unique plotline: Hilary Thomas, a screenwriter living in L.A. is attacked in her Westwood home by a wealthy Napa valley landowner named Bruno Frye. She fends him off once, and kills him a second time...but to her horror, the supposedly dead and buried serial killer shows up in her home once more. In accordance with the Supreme Law of Thriller Novels, she naturally sets off on a quest to find out who Bruno Frye really is, and why he's (possibly) come back from the dead to kill her. The villian is the most complex character of the novel, and the characters' discovery of his childhood secrets is as suspenseful and entertaining as the action in the novel. Now for the bad part: Apart from the general plot, this novel is a painful cliche. The main character, Hilary Thomas, seems just too perfect. She's extremely rich, extremely succesful, and even an oscar-nominated screenwriter, and in addition to this she's breathtakingly beautiful, has a perfect body, is tough, witty, and naturally amazingly nice and down to earth. Her troubled background only adds an element of cheese to the story rather than giving her character depth, and her love interest, a handsome cop, is equally two-dimensional. In their investigation of Bruno Frye, they seem to get information way too easily and conveniently (for instance, they run into Frye's executor who just so happens to completely believe their story, and have a private jet which he of course can fly then around California with) and throughout the story they exchange enough witty dialogue to kill any too-serious reader. The biggest problem I had with this otherwise fine book was the sex. (...) Despite this, the book managed to hold enough of my interest to earn a 3 star rating.Bottom Line: Read it if you have some time to kill and would enjoy a good thriller, but don't waste your time otherwise. NOT FOR THE YOUNG OR THE SQUEAMISH."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Whispers was a real page-turner. The violence and sex were more vividly described than I like, but the story was great."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This book was excellent. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it done as soon as I started reading it. I would recommend this book to those who like suspense. A must read!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This was my first Koontz book. Any novel that makes you wonder, and even care, about what happens next is a good novel. I read far into the night with this one. A good plot, story, character development, and dialogue created the power this book has. A sequel might be cool, too."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I have to admit, this is the first Dean Koontz book I have read, thanks to my husband who recommended him. I was so taken in with his style of writing, the love scenes were so well described, it brought me back to when my husband and I first met. But enough of the mushy stuff... the story had wonderful twists in it that made my jaw drop. I wouldn't recommend it to those who are easily disturbed by morally unacceptable sexual behaviour, for example my mother could tell this book was extremely interesting to me, yet I won't lend it to her knowing well enough that she would think that some parts are dispicable. Although I expected more 'horror' than what this story contained, the shock value I got while discovering more about the characters as the story developed, was enough to send chills down my spine. Mr. Koontz does well in describing places, and actions just enough to let your imagination create the scene in your head, without using overly descriptive sentences. The story flows well and is not confusing at all unlike some 'investigating' type books I've read. I laughed at the sarcasm in the conversations between Hilary and Tony, and I even cried at one point in the story, that's how well attached I became to all the characters. I definately recommend Whispers. I'm now looking forward to reading my next DK book, Night Chills."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"I'm am a Koontz fan, but I have to say this wasn't my favourite book. My favourite books are the ones with weird and freaky story lines, I found this one a bit too \\"normal\\" for me. Not enough Sci-Fi I guess! However, I was glad I continued with the book because it was an overall good story. But still recommended!"},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"This is a very good book. More.

I see that after Whispers, Koontz then started putting his name on more of his works. After Whispers all his other novel's written under different names started to be republished with the Koontz label. Whispers has a great story, and one that keeps you guessing. I was always asking myself what and who is this killer that he is able to return from the dead. The villian is one of the most sinister and evil one I have come across in a long time. It seem like there are people out there with his thoughts. (Shivers going down my spine.) I loved the buildup to the end where we learn the secrets of Bruno the Killer. Read this X-file type novel."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"About 5 years ago I picked this book up for a nice enjoyable read. After 30 pages, I wasn't into it, and I didn't care. So, for the first time in my life, I put it down. I'm the kind of guy that finishes a book/movie no matter how bad it is. And yet, I put this down.Throughout the years, it bothered me that I never finished it. So, I returned to the book two weeks ago. Page my torturous page, I read on. Finally, at page 200, the story finally picked up. Why? The backstory was INCREDIBLY long. Lets just say, it's longest Prologue that I've ever read. Of course, he didn't call it a prologue, he called it &quot;Part 1.&quot;In Part 2, the story picks up at a nice pace and the mystery starts to get solved. It's a fun read, definitely not an amazing read. If you're going to read this book, expect a lot of sex, because even I was caught off guard by it. I usually don't mind, like Stephen King novels. But in this book, I really didn't care. I'm not sure if it was because I just wanted the story to keep going, or I didn't care too much for the characters. Not sure.The conclusion was interesting. Although not much came by surprise because the bad guy would tell you, then the good guys would find out. The ending was fun, I will give it that. Should have had an epilogue though. A story that long probably should have one.All in all, I would recommend the book. But the problem is getting past those 200 pages before you get into the story. That alone was a chore."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"All I can say about this book...This is the one that got me hooked on Koontz.

The creativity, the heart and wonderful story telling is his strong side, a pure natural talent that needs to continue. My books shelves are now filled with Mr.Koontz and it's definitely a good sight to behold.When Hilary Thomas is attacked by a huge man named Bruno Frye she fights back the best she can only to discover that he's no regular burglar. Bruno is a twisted and delusional man with a secret past that has somehow tangled Hilary with it. He is convinced that she is someone who means him harm even though she doesn't even know him. The mad tale of deception and fight of brawn against muscle begins. The entire tale was very entertaining and I feel that with time Koontz will really take his stories and master his delivery. The ending came a bit fast after such a build up but it was out fantastic. When Hilary thinks she has gotten rid of Bruno he comes back from another world, confusing her senses of reality and the thin line between life and death that somehow got crossed...- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Okay, I might be biased because this book has a special meaning for me. I first read it when I was twelve, and I snuggled under my bed covers with a torch 'til 13h00 pm in order to finish it. And then I couldn't sleep! So whenever I read &quot;Whispers&quot;, I get a creepy chill down my spine. Which might be considered weird bearing in mibd the logical conclusions at the end of the book.I have an intense phobia of cockroaches, and that scene in the book was probably what led to my intense feelings of horror and fear. Roaches aside, this is still a brilliant book, and years later, I still enjoy opening it's now tattered cover, and immersing myself in this novel."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"As an Orange County-based mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I have been impressed by the terrifying works of Dean Koontz for years. WHISPERS is one of his best books. In WHISPERS, Hilary Thomas, a Hollywood scriptwriter, finds herself once more haunted, as she was as a child. This book is frightening. It is Mr. Koontz at his best.In addition to being a mystery novelist, I also teach high school seniors. Every year, I notice Dean Koontz is the author most commonly selected by my students for their independent reading. Now that I have read this book, I am confident that WHISPERS will be among their most commonly selected Dean Koontz titles.WHISPERS is a wonderful, though chilling, work."},{"Title":"Whispers","review":"Make no mistake about it; &quot;Whispers&quot; has some very scary scenes that are the strength of this novel. It recounts the story of Hilary, a brilliant screenwriter who is just beginning to enjoy the fruits of financial success. She loves her beautiful home and garden, a sharp contrast to her poverty stricken unhappy childhood.Hilary returns to her home only to have a man to whom she is slightly acquainted leap out of the coat closet and brutally attack her. She is so shocked that Bruno Frye, a wealthy, urbane vineyard owner, is 1) in her house and 2) insanely enraged, that she is at first too stunned to react. Finally she recovers, finds her gun and scares him off temporarily. She calls the police who do not believe her. (Among other imprudent actions, she tidied up before placing the call.) The next night she barricades herself in her guest room and upon awakening, thinking all is well, cautiously emerges into the hall with a 4-inch knife in her hand. Bruno has again found entry into her house and is waiting outside the door. In a terrible battle she mortally wounds him. He is found, declared dead, has an autopsy, is embalmed and buried. --- And returns.The weakest part of the story is the blindness of the entire cast to consider the most obvious solution to the puzzle. In the first 100 pages, I kept waiting for someone to suggest a likely line of investigation, but waited in vain. This was the first of Mr. Koontz's books to be a resounding success, so perhaps the poor dialogue is something he mastered with more experience. But the story is too long and needs editing. The political views that crop up every chapter or so adds nothing to the novel's storyline and are an irritation.Mr. Koontz can set a scene that will spook you into next week.

The plot, the characters, the \\"gotcha\\" at the end. WOW!As I continue my reading my old Dean Koontz' faves, this one is a standout. It brings back memories (IBM Selectric II, Disco balls, pre-cell phone days) of a bygone era in my life.

The plot was good. The writing style was good. I especially loved it because there was nothing \\"magical\\"; everything had a logical explanation (even though sometimes you think it's magical until you find out the truths of how's and why's). The main character is attacked and it goes on from there. There are so many interesting twists and facts that fit together.

There's also a pretty chilling mystery going on about a dead guy coming back to life... or.... *does* he?This is a 501 page book and I got a little tired reading it. I think it could have been edited down so it wouldn't have gotten a little \\"draggy\\". It's well worth reading, though.I read the last pages of Whispers one night in bed > BIG MISTAKE!

In fact, after I started it I threw it aside, and wasn't going to read it at all. I thought it was going to be a scarey, stalker type story (which I HATE). I finally picked it up about 7 months later when I got really desperate!!! (No Koontz books left to read, and couldn't order any more for over a week!!!) It started getting really good only about 3 pages where I had left off! Needless to say, it was NOT your normal stalker story!!! It picked up with a more supernatural/sci-fi theme and took off from there! The plot in this one was right up there with the best! This was really great and typical Koontz after all! It did take a couple chapters to start getting good, which is NOT typical Koontz! Usually he grips you in the first couple pages! All through this book I kept saying &quot;What's going on here? What is he DOING???&quot; He was weaving a really unusual, strange, gripping storyline. This one is wonderfully imaginative and exciting. This IS typical Koontz (which as his fans know is exceptional)!!!!"},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"Although Freud didn't appear to ascribe to any religion, it sure looks like he did. I find little difference between the psychoanalysis he coined and ancient pagan religions of the past. This man either fully believes his own tomfoolery, or he noticed that others believed it and took advantage of them. I find extremely little worth in the 70 pages of this book. I do like his analysis of the life drive and death drive, but perhaps this is not unique to him. I once saw a quote regarding Freud, and it was something like, \\"What's new of his is not correct, and what's correct of his is not new.\\" Although he has a respectable background in medicine, he completely ruined it with his venture into psychoanalysis, no matter how well-intentioned it might have been. I truly wonder if his methods were able to help anybody overcome any mental illness, and I haven't done enough research on cases like \\"rat man\\" to see if his methods cured those poor individuals. I would devote more research to Freud, if I thought I'd find anything worthwile there. This appears to be just another instance of an intellectual using words that are unnecessarily big, hoping to appear useful to the public, leading followers that don't have a clue what they're talking about, and when they manage to find some consistency in their tossed-about words that might show even a hint of enlightenment, they take it as an indication that the whole body of work spawned from their leader is completely correct. I'm happy that Freud inspired Dali who inspired me, but from what this \\"Ego and the Id\\" sample of his work has shown me, Freud himself will NEVER inspire me. I think anyone who places any substantial amount of legitimacy to psychoanalysis should really be skeptical of their choice, and employ some common sense the next time they want to find out what makes someone tick."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"The book was delivered to me complete and in the condition that it was sold to me in. I would recommend and use this seller for future transactions."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"I greatly admire Freud, and I have greatly benefited from psychotherapy. But however great his ideas, his writing is ABYSMAL. He writes like a philosopher who has never met a patient. He'd rather write four pages of abstract theory than a single paragraph of concrete example.We all owe a mighty debt to those disciples who presented his work in a way that others could understand."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"Despite being a very small book, with good introduction and preface, this is not an easy book to read and in my opinion the more the reader is well acquainted with the evolution of Freud's terminology the better. In this regard The Interpretation of Dreams is a prior reading which will give substance for the later reading of The Ego and the Id.Some concepts already presented in earlier books are developed more soundly in this opus, despite some confusion between the terminology, a situation acknowledge by the editor and even by the author.The Ego and the Id was written in 1924 and, contrary to some earlier books by Freud which could be read by the lay person (\\" The Interpretation of Dreams\\" , \\"The Psychopathology of Every Day Life\\" , \\"Jokes and Their Relations with the Unconscious\\" , \\" Totem and Taboo\\" and many others), this one was not written for the non-scientific person, due to a lot of psychanalitical lingo he uses in the text and the difficulty faced in the conceptualization.Despite all this, I think it is an useful reading to everyone interested in the history and theory of psychanalisys. The figth between the Id (which equals the Unconscious plus some conscious departments), the Ego (mainly inputed by senses perception) and the Ideal Ego (or Super-ego), who represents a kind of moral agency who reviews and criticizes all the actions by the Ego, is of special beauty and are quintessential Freudian. A pretty much intereting reading for anyone interested in the history of psychanalisys and in concepts already of working value."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"Sigmund Freud is not known for his easy-to-read writing style. Those that translated Freud's works have recently been under fire for being misleading or inaccurate. When I set out to read this book, I felt it neccessary to make as many notes neccesary and to dig beneath and between to bring out what Freud really meant by \\"ego\\" and \\"id.\\" To my conclusion, the reason Freud is argued against so much is because of the confusion that surrounds his theories.The words \\"ego\\" and \\"id\\" are Greek, and we have carried them into the English language and then nominalized. By doing this our consciousness solidifies them as things within our brains. The word \\"ego\\" means \\"I\\" or \\"self\\". The word \\"id\\" means \\"non-I\\" or \\"non-self\\", or \\"it.\\" We dont say \\"the I\\" when we refer to ourselves. But so often we say \\"the ego\\" as if to refer to a specific part or thing of our minds.The other confusion that adds to nominalization is then believing the rest of the book is about things in space. Yet, Freud specifically says, \\"The state of things which we have been describing can be respresented diagramatically, though it must be remarked that the form chosen has no pretensions to any special applicability, but is mere intended to serve for purposes of exposition (p. 18).\\" What Freud is saying is that in order to communicate clearly what is happening in ones psyche, or mind, there needs to be a working model of the psyche.That is to say, a model meaning a diagram with its parts that do not act as the psyche itself (or of reality), but shows what the psyche consists of. He does this by discerning that which is \\"descriptive,\\" and that which is \\"dynamic.\\" The descriptive only describes through language or imaginative use, while dynamic is more at the process that actually occurs.Now the model Freud eventually used as a diagram is not a very good model. In fact it is a bit unwieldy and clumsy and in the end served little purpose (later in he updated the model in 'New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis', 1933). Because Freud is the first to devise the model, it is primitive and modifications would be neccessary. Actually Freud seemed to have modeled what looks to be an ill-defined organ giving way to the idea that it functions like a heart would. While reading the book, I chose not to use the model he drew, but rather found it useful to create my own based on his descriptions of where things are in relation to each other. This does not mean I believe the model is a literal drawing of my mind or anyone elses, but rather a means in which we understand how one part of the psyche works with another. Similarly is Neil Bohr's model of the atom. He did not draw what he actually saw, he created a model only for communication purposes. When a group understands the parts, and the relationship of those parts, then you create a vernacular, or as Freud called it, a \\"shibboleth of psycho-analysis.\\" Then we can clearly understand what we are talking about when referring to these parts.The book is only psychological in language, where Freud describes his theories of ego and id. He raises other aspects of the psyche that one may need to already understand, such as cathexis, the Oedipal complex, displacement, reaction formation and so forth. He sets out essentially how ego is created in relation to id, and by creating our ego we also create repression. It is sometimes misconstrued that ego is associated with egotistical, or egotism, or even conceit, however, Freud is aware that our ego is as much benevalent as malevalent.\\"The Ego and the Id\\" was written in 1923, so the language is sometimes archaic, even in the translated form. Its more popular to be adverse with Freud, usually due to the claims Freud made regarding childhood sexuality, and that all of his theories are based upon sexual experiences in our youth. I believe if one set that opinion aside and read as if you never heard of Freud, you might think differently. I found it useful while reading not only to understand the times Freud wrote in, but to also update the language in more modern terms. If ego does not suit you, choose another word, as long as the relationships and understanding of their functions remain constant. But what you call them may reveal that Freud really hit the mark in describing the functions and processes of our minds. When you observe as he did, you will discover how memories are repressed, what your consciousness holds, what you observe in your consciousness and what you are holding out on in your unconscious. How our ego's and super-ego's (ego-ideal) serve and protect, yet hinder potential. For me, updating the language allowed me to understand Freuds work much better than if I kept his work in the past and attempted to apply it to today. I dont feel that works for any author. It would be like knowing how to fix an Apple IIe and expecting to be able to fix a Macintosh G3 computer.Freud's \\"Ego and the Id\\" is a great book to begin to understand his theories. Its a small book (62 pages) and will create the foundation of understanding for any of his other works. Having a good working knowledge of this book will also aid you in reading other authors who discuss ego functions as well as your ability to discern how the word is used in relation to Freud's understanding."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"Id- Unconscious part of the mind which consists of natural instincts, urges, and drives that are repressed. It includes \\"internal events\\" which stem from the influence of heredity. Although the id is the cause of all activity, the thoughts are often unconscious and repressed. The id represents biological forces. It is also a constant in the personality as it is always present. The id is governed by the \\"pleasure principle\\", or the notion of hedonism (the seeking of pleasure).Ego- A defense mechanism that is partly conscious and contains the capacities to calculate, reason, and plan. As the Id relates to internal events, the Ego is occupied with the external world. Its task is to regulate and control the instincts provided by the id. However, in times of sleep, the ego detaches itself from the outside world and changes, its organization. The prime function of the ego is determined by the individuals experiences. The ego is the surface of the personality, the part you show the world. The ego is governed by the \\"reality principle ,\\" or a pragmatic approach to the world. For example, a child may want to snitch a cookie from the kitchen, but will not if a parent is present. Id desires are still present, but the ego realizes the consequences of brazen cookie theft.Super-ego- the connection between the id and ego. The super ego is the minds link to reality and society. It contains the influence of what is learned from other people. The super-ego, unlike the id, is not intuitive from birth, but acquired from childhood. Once established, one begins to feel guilt. The superego consists of two parts, the conscience and the ego-ideal. The conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder. The conscience decides what course of action one should take. The ego-ideal is an idealized view of one's self. Comparisons are made between the ego-ideal and one's actual behavior. Both parts of the super-ego develop with experience with others, or via social interactions. According to Freud, a strong super-ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id, while a weak super-ego gives in to the id's urgings. Further, the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low, respectively.The ID strives for the needs, wants desires; as the ID strives for pleasure it encounters experiences of frustration. The desires and needs of the ID do not get responded to as soon as the individual would like; in essence the reality of life; this results in the development of personality that governs orientation to reality. During early development of a person there are other influences as moral and ethical expectations of family and society. As the ID strives for gratification it encounters these moral and ethical expectations that tend to frustrate the ID; as a result of this the SUPER-EGO develops which represents the individuals moral orientation. Also known as the conscience. Family and society play an important role in defining for a person what these moral and ethical expectations include. Unresolved conflicts between ID-EGO-SUPER EGO can lead to fixation or blockage in development and can result in excessive dependence in manipulation. The resolution of each crisis depends on the interaction of the individual's characteristics and the support provided by the social environment.Quote from Dr Freud:\\"...the ego seeks to bring the influence of the external world to bear upon the id and its tendencies, and endeavours to substitute the reality principle for the pleasure principle which reigns unrestrictedly in the id. For the ego, perception plays the part which in the id falls to instinct. The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions. \\""},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"I am only a college student and read this book for my own enlightenment. I loved reading Freud's theories about the ego and the id. This book consists of a brief introduction of Frued and his life, then goes on to present his work. The terms are also explained very well throughout the book. I definitly recomend this to anyone who is trying to enlighten themselves, or anyone who is interested in Frued's work or psychology at all."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"This work presents one of Freud's major theoretical models for understanding human personality. The three- fold division into ego- id- super-ego in some sense parallels the three fold division in Plato's thought. For Freud the Id is the unconscious instinctual animal element in us. It is our ' drives our hungers our lusts, our sexual lust centrally. The ego is the social self, the construct with which we meet the world. It is our rational self, our self as we present ourselves to the world through. The superego is the conscience, the what we should be. For Freud it is the voice of others, and especially of our parents telling and teaching us the difference between right and wrong. As Freud understood these three aspects of self are in constant interaction, and the kind of personality we are is determined by which of these faculties is predominant.It is possible to regard this theory as insight and useful and draw conclusions from it.Or it is possible to simply put it aside as one more human construction aimed at understanding what must be understood in many different ways.The book is small but not easy to read. A great mind is at work making order out of the minds of all of us.

The text is clear and considering how much the world has changed it remains as useful as it always has been. I suppose that it is not an accident that his writings are the foundation of an entire discipline."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"reading Freud is a must for anyone who is interested in psychology or \\"psycho-analysis.\\" He is the founding father for modern psychology and \\"psycho-analysis\\" and has become a household name. He has made many other contributions: he coined the famous terms, ego, id, super-ego, \\"psycho-analysis,\\" unconscious, Oedipus Complex, reaction-formation, identification, free association, object-cathesis, etc. Although he is known to be extremely hard to understand I did not find this is so. This book does have a complex terminology but if you bookmark this page for the other reviewers great work on defining and getting at what Freud really means by the terms ego, id, and super-ego (ego-ideal) and do active reading (taking notes on the margins, underlining, and that type of stuff) its not as hard as everyone thinks. Take into account though, that Freud homophobic, sexist, anti-semetic, and was alive before many of the modern technological advances were made so brain study was unthinkable back then, and psychology was mainly sexual or childhood development theories used to explain parts of the brain and consciousness. Although Freud was wrong about alot of things and his method of free association was great for most of his patients (who volunteered to be studied by Freud) it takes too much time for people who dont want to be analyzed or who have trouble talking about their feelings. Even so, this is a great book and a must read plus its incredibly short. You also as someone else suggested might want to draw a new model of the brain since freud's one in this book does not include a lot of important details, check the new lectures book for an improved one."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"I will begin by echoing a number of other reviewers. This book is not intended for the lay person necessarily. It is not horribly difficult, it certainly can be read fruitfully by the modern lay person, but it would be extremely helpful to have a fairly solid background in Freudian terminology (cathexes, Oedipus complex, introjection, etc.). My own reading of the text suffered to some degree because Freud references a few essays in the work I had not read (his essays on melancholia and narcissism). The book is one of Freud's works on \\"metapsychology\\", which is simply the theory of the mind that Freud developed to make sense out of his clinical practice. In my opinion, Freud has a tendency to engage in wild speculation, especially in his metapsychology. That is certainly on display in this book, at least in places. I thought the first two chapters and the last chapter of the book were pretty good and had a lot of interesting insights. The third and fourth chapters, which were on the formation of the super-ego, and the two kinds of instincts (the sexual and death instincts) were more dense, and more speculative. Freud is at his best when he remains close to his clinical experience.Freud always raises interesting questions even when his answers seem unsatisfying for one reason or another. There are a number of questions that Freud is attempting to address in this book. What is the origin of the ego? How does the organism produce a distinct center of conscious activity which becomes identified with the \\"self\\"? How is the content of our ego enriched by our experiences? How does the ego mediate between reality and the id or instinctual impulses? How much of our mental life is conscious? How are biological instincts or drives made conscious? What process is necessary for them to become conscious? What are the nature of instincts? What do they want? Is the ego free, or is it the puppet of superior forces? How is the super-ego, or ego ideal formed? Why do we often judge ourselves in terms of values and ideals that we do not consciously endorse? Why do so many people carry around a constant sense of guilt despite the fact that they are outwardly moral people? Why is our own suffering often a mystery to us? Why is it so difficult to determine the causes of our suffering, and to remove them?I am not convinced that Freud offers fully satisfactory answers to any of these questions, but he deserves credit for raising them in a fairly profound way, and changing our view of human nature in the process. Freud's own view of human nature is pretty bleak. Freud expresses approval for a view expressed by Georg Groddeck who, Freud says, \\"is never tired of insisting that what we call our ego behaves essentially passively in life, and that...we are 'lived' by unknown and uncontrollable forces\\" (17). Later in the book Freud describes the ego as caught between the id and the super-ego. The ego has to defend itself against impulses from the id that it does not endorse, and a super-ego that condemns the ego as if it were responsible for the impulses of the id. Freud also undercuts the hope that many people have in moral striving. Most people want to become a better person. Freud argues that \\"the more a man controls his aggressiveness, the more intense becomes his ideal's inclination to aggressiveness against his ego\\" (56). The aggressive impulses that are successfully repressed only lend energy to the super-ego who uses that energy to attack the ego. In other words, the more moral we become, the more miserable we become. That is probably not an entirely accurate portrayal of Freud's view since he argues that psychoanalysis itself \\"is an instrument to enable the ego to achieve a progressive conquest of the id\\" (58). Clearly Freud was committed to reducing people's suffering. Still, I do not think anyone could accuse Freud of having an overly optimistic view. Whether it was a realistic view I will leave up the judgment of the reader.All in all, this is certainly a worthy read, especially if you are interested in Freud's metapsychology. However, if you are new to Freud, I would definitely recommend starting elsewhere. In terms of accessibility, interest, and brilliance, there are definitely other works in Freud's corpus that trump this work by a long shot."},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"This book was published in 1923. Freud stated in the Preface, \\"The present discussions are a further development of some trains of thought which I opened up inBeyond The Pleasure Principle (1922)... It is more in the nature of a synthesis than of a speculation and seems to have had an ambitious aim in view... In these pages things are touched on which have not yet been the subject of psycho-analytic consideration, and it has not been possible to avoid trenching upon some theories which have been put forward by non-analysts or by former analysts on their retreat from analysis.\\"Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"The division of the psychical into what is conscious and what is unconscious is the fundamental premise of psycho-analysis.\\"\\"In the present discussion, moreover, I am only putting forward a hypothesis; I have no proof to offer. It seems a plausible view that this displaceable and neutral energy, which is no doubt active both in the ego and in the id, proceeds from the narcissistic store of libido---that it is desexualized Eros.\\"\\"As the child was once under a compulsion to obey its parents, so the ego submits to the categorical imperative of its super-ego.\\"\\"One may go further and venture the hypothesis that a great part of the sense of guilt must normally remain unconscious, because the origin of conscience is intimately connected with the Oedipus complex, which belongs to the unconscious.\\"\\"Psycho-analysis is an instrument to enable the ego to achieve a progressive conquest of the id.\\""},{"Title":"The Ego and the Id","review":"Educational, deep and well written.

The other reviewers here are correct when they say that the book is of limited use for serious work, but then I have those books too, and they're about 900 pages long and weigh many pounds, and don't travel well. The treatment of carex or the sedges is limited as people have said, but carex has many species and a small book like this just isn't going to cut it, but as I said, professional level graminology books are going to weigh even more than your usual taxonomic book because just the grass family itself has about 14,000 species.The illustrations are well done, though, and there is some knowledge to be gleaned from the book. But use it as a stepping stone to other more advanced works on the grasses. The four volume work by the Smithsonian on the grasses of America is one of the big, weighty one that I was referring to, and that's worth acquiring if you're serious. These are large format volumes and very heavy, so the problem there is that they don't travel well.For helping you learn about the grasses, I would recommend you buy Agnes Chases's wonderful little book, A First Book of Grasses, to learn about them first. She takes a conceptual, top-down approach, teaching you the basic concepts of grass structure on which the keys are ultimately based, and after that, you can start using the keys with much more confidence. For example, starting from the premise that the grass spikelet is a reduced, leafy, flowering branch, she leads you from the most basic spikelets, such as those in Festuca, to the most modified or complex ones that show the greatest deviation from the basic spikelet plan. After reading her book through several times, I found I could identify many grasses to the genus level just by eyeballing them, and then I could drill down to the species from there.The bottom line is that becoming a good field graminologist is just something that takes special study and effort. I learned to be able to key out just about anything in the group in about a month of intensive study of the books, plus several hours a day working in the field. And by \\"the field,\\" I mean the sand lots near my house, and several local parks, and people's front yards. The nice thing about the grasses is that even an apparently dull, boring sand lot devoid of pretty flowers or trees can provide you with hours of fun trying to identify the grasses. It can be learned but it's something you'll probably need to allot some separate time to from the rest of your work and/or studies, but you can get a significant leg up on the topic just working around your own neighborhood."},{"Title":"Field Guide to the Grasses, Sedges, and Rushes of the United States","review":"I have owned this book for 10 years.

A good field guide would set up categories such as swamp grasses, meadow grasses and so on.A good field guide would also have more readily identifiable images. Some of the pictures were hardly distinguishable from others. Though a statement was made about where to find different species, one still needs a discernible eye to exempt one species over another.Lastly, there was not always a distinction made between common names and Latin taxonomic names. This can cause some confusion as some of these species have the same name and yet are visually very discrete from another with the same common name.

We are both vegetarians and, while not Indian, have had authentic Indian cooked food.The recipes are fairly well done, easy to follow, and obviously well tested. Unlike some cook books, the times are correct, the food tastes \\"right,\\" and the descriptions are accurate. It is well worth having this book as a good introduction to Indian style cooking. Try the Eggplant and Potato side dish (as a main course) over rice, it's wonderful!There are a few minor annoyances that cause me to only give four stars rather than five. First, the index is horrible. Looking up dishes by the Indian names is tedious as the book has been almost over Americanized. Second, with a title with the word \\"classic,\\" I am disappointed in the number of items that tell me to \\"buy this at the store/nobody makes these from scratch anymore/this is too complex, here is a simplified version\\" in this book. I appreciate the information, but I don't want the variation, at least not without the true recipe too. Third, even most of the side dishes will feed an army. Not being Indian, I would like even more information on meal planning than is given. If I made all the things suggested, we would be eating the same meal for a week straight!Finally, the book doesn't go into much detail about the different regions and I would prefer to have things divided into regions as well. Again, these are minor, and I recommend this book as a good first book, but the recipes are good, so give it a shot! Oh, there are some typos in the book too, and considering how long it has been in print, they should have been fixed long ago!"},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"I can imagine becoming a vegetarian for reasons of social conscience, but it hasn't happened yet. I do, however, have vegetarian friends who tolerate my lack of enlightenment, and I do sometimes cook for them. On such occasions, if I feel like challenging myself, this is the cookbook to which I turn for inspiration.Julie Sahni offers clear enough descriptions of the tasks involved in classic Indian cooking so that anyone who's a halfway good cook in any other style can easily produce something delicious from her recipes. I never follow recipes exactly except when I use this book; I've learned from trial and error that whatever Julie says is right. The lessons she offers in nutrition - balancing grains with lentils and other pulses; using spices to AID digestion; conserving nutrients in the cooking process - are invariably worth learning.The cookbook begins with eighty pages of descriptions of the basic ingredients of Indian vegetarian cooking, especially the spices and spice blends. Julie tells us which spices can be ground or purchased ground in advance without sacrificing flavor, and which cannot. Lots of recipes in the newspapers, for instance, call for \\"garam masala\\" as if there were only one blend of spices under that name. Julie offers five quite different blends of aromatic and piquant spices, all regional garam masalas, and tells us when each is appropriate.Some of the best recipes in the book are for pilafs and hearty stews. Then there are clear instrutions for making two dozen sorts of Indian breads and dumplings. Home-made chutneys, I can tell you, are way tastier than gunk from jars. Cauliflower stuffed with nuts and greens is one of my favorite showy dishes for company. How about 'tiny new potatoes smothered in fenugreek leaves?' She includes instructions for growing a pot of fenugreek from seeds. Cardamom ice cream and rose petal rice pudding are always show-stopper desserts. There are also ideas for whole menus - combinations of dishes both for aesthetic and nutritioal balance.I have half a dozen Indian cookbooks - gifts from friends mostly - but Julie Sahni's is the only one that's speckled with food stains and oil smudges. Honorable decorations for a cookbook, indicating frequent use."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This book has been in print since 1985 - proof enough that it's not just another vegetarian book or indian cookbook, but a particularly good one. The recipes are excellent - some of them intriguing; the introduction is thorough; the index is good; recipes sometimes include ingredients that can't be found outside India, for authenticity's sake, but alternatives are also suggested in most cases; and the writing style is clear.But I won't give it 5 stars. To me, a book is the responsibility not only of the author, but also the publisher. It's just not acceptable to leave errors in a 20-year-old book, such as the dish from Mysore that turns out to be from Bangalore, or a reference to Tanjore as the site of the Meenakshi temple (that left me wondering - did they get the temple wrong, or is the recipe from Madurai?). Also, if I'm going to pay for a hardcover edition, I expect it to be durable, not start falling apart at the (glued-together) seams the minute I start using it.Also, I agree with another reviewer that this book should have had a lot more on other grains, especially millet and sorghum which are very popular in India but almost never available in restaurants.And I might as well mention my pet peeve with both Sahni's books: why the distinction between side dishes and main dishes? I find it meaningless - it would have made more sense to put veg with veg, dal with dal, etc.Still, if you like Indian cooking and don't want to limit yourself to what your corner curry house can offer, and if you want to learn about a vegetarian tradition which is far and away the richest in the world, you will find this book very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This book is a MUST if you are interested in cooking authentic Indian vegetarian-one to one. I am not an Indian but an Indo-vegetarian, meaning I cook mostly Indian vegetarian food because I believe it is the best in the world. Almost everything I've made from this book has been AWESOME, from vegetable lentil curries of south India to paneer cheese dishes of north. This is the first book that taught me, correctly, the art of making dosa-the silky rice crepes of Madras and dokla, the feathery, lentil chiffon cakes of Gujrat. My Indian friends, who love my cooking, think I am some kind of a reincarnated Indian soul. All I do really is follow Julie Sahni's recipes. I own many Indian vegetarian cookbooks but hardly use them because none produce such great results, time after time. I think it is Julie Sahni's amazing knowledge of combining spices that make the dishes taste so extraordinary. I highly recommend this book. It is THE BEST."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"I must agree with the raves about the various dishes that the other reviewers have mentioned. I own several other Indian vegetarian cookbooks and I have found that this one is the best in its description of the spices and other ingredients that may be new to some people. I have no problem with the excellent quality of the recipes but beginners in Indian cuisine should not mistake this book as easy to master. Most of the recipes in this book are complex and mastering Indian cuisine requires a lot of experimentation with amounts of spices. There are few illustrations and no pictures of prepared food to help newer cooks. So the only downside to this great book is its lack of more complete instructions for beginners"},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"I'll preface by saying that my personal experience with Indian cuisine is limited to the great restaurants around the U.S. that I've dined in. I haven't had the pleasure of going to India, or of enjoying home-cooked Indian food here.On the other hand, I am an avid cook and have cooked professionally. One thing that all of my favorite cookbooks have in common is that they emphasize technique; another is that they link a cuisine to its culture. Using these books broadens my understanding of the technique of certain cuisines. Getting a feel for different cuisines' techniques and methods helps my overall ability to cook without recipes, and with confidence.Ms. Sahni's book here has been an excellent primer for me on Indian cooking techniques. The patterns of the recipes emerge. The bases, braises, masalas, and finishing perfumed butters and oils. Just as Italian cuisine has its 'hand' and approach, but also its regional variations, so does Julie Sahni introduce us to the same in Indian cuisine with this book.My only critique is that the book completely lacks photos, and drawings are nearly non-existent. While the recipes are thorough, sometimes desired texture is hard to gauge without some photos, especially with dishes that are unfamiliar from personal experience.Otherwise, it is one of my 'primer' cookbooks, and an educational and entertaining glimpse into regional Indian cultures -- through food."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"My first reaction to many of these recipes has been &quot;My god! Can you DO that with lentils/milk/yoghurt/vegetables?&quot;. But the answer is an unequivocal and delicious &quot;YES!&quot; There aren't tons of glossy colourful pictures smiling out at you (and pushing the price up), and this is a cookbook that has more recipes than you can shake a stick at, so it might be intimidating for some. But fear not. The recipes are well tested, the ingredients readily available, and the descriptions are well written and meaningful. This book has transformed my cooking and my kitchen, with recipes that are tasty, economical, and varied. If you are the least bit adventurous, try this book, I implore you."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This cookbook absolutely rocks. It is a 500 page tome of fantastic recipes. Its starts with a good explanation of ingredients, spice blends and builds a solid foundation of knowledge about Indian cooking. While some of the dinner recipes are complex, I could easily live off of the side dishes. Before this book, my experimentation with Indian food was hit or miss. Now I am always happy with the results.A must-have for vegetarians."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"Clear explanations of ingredients, techniques, and menus, in addition to a great variety of recipes give this volume distinction in its class. My first batch of idli (steamed lentil and rice dumplings) came out great. Not a book for beginners. If you're looking for glossy pages with color photos, don't look here. Also, if you're already familiar with the Indian names for some dishes, a dearth of cross-referencing in the index can make it difficult to find a particular recipe. On the other hand, if you want ideas from which to springboard into new areas of gastronomy, get this volume."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This is a super reference. From the fascinating description of her sister's wedding that another reviewer mentioned, Sahni goes on for 120 pages giving the basics of Indian vegetarian cooking...then on to the extensive recipes. My favorite so far has been gobhi masallam (stuffed cauliflower with tart tomato-coriander sauce). Even my husband who is dubious about cauliflower loved it! A sign for me that I must purchase a book is contining to check it out of the library for long periods of time...which I have and must get my own copy soon.This book plus her earlier volume &quot;Classic Indian Cooking&quot; make an excellent pair. Both have plenty of information but do not repeat each other much."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"Was initially skeptical of a cookbook that didn't have any pictures of the dish I was preparing, however, was pleasantly surprised to find that all of the recipes were easy to make and downright delicious! Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys cooking, wants to go vegetarian, and can withstand spice."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"There are two things that can be called \\"filthy\\" in a nice way - an unhittable baseball pitcher and a really well-used cookbook. This is the dirtiest cookbook that I own - meaning, of course, that I cook from it all the time. I have had this book for years, and there's hardly a page without a fragrant fingerprint, a few oily drips, a dusting of spice, or a folded tab. Not to mention the pencilled in comments. I am not Indian but I cook more Indian dishes than most of my Indian friends. I have a lot of cookbooks, and many of them are Indian, and I've collected a lot of recipes from friends and the Internet too. But I still reach for my Julie Sahni all the time. The recipes in this book are easy to follow and generally have excellent results - obviously well tested - and well tasted too! The only real complaint I have is that the index is nearly useless, since it doesn't include the Indian names for the dishes. After all these years, I know where to find Idli or rasam or shokhto - but don't expect to look them up in the index. Once you find what you're looking for, the recipes are wonderful."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This book is a must for anyone who wants to add a new dimension to their vegetarian cooking.

From the introduction's dazzling and sensuous description of a Hindu wedding feast to the detailed no-fault recipes for gems like 'Hearty Blue Mountain Cabbage and Tomato Stew' and 'Hot and Sour Garlic-Braised Eggplant', Julie Sahni has written a masterful cookbook. As a former student of Ms. Sahni's I can attest to her encyclopedic knowledge of Indian vegetarian cooking gleaned from her 23 years as a strict vegetarian. You will find no better, more comprehensive or delicious addition to your cookbook library."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This is my second favorite Indian cookbook (I think the best is by Yamuna Devi).

Get this book just for those, they are worth it."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This is one of the best vegetarian cookbooks ever (and thus an ideal gift for meatless friends). Sahni points out, quite persuasively, that vegetarian cuisine has unfairly gotten a bad rep from insipid California Lite health food style cooking. Indians have been vegetarian for millenia--time enough to forge a full-flavored, satisfying, nutritious solution for those hoping to eat healthier. Sahni's writing is direct, wise, and funny (&quot;This dish was a favorite of the British during their brief but memorable stay in my country...&quot;), and her wonderful chapter on ingredients alone conveys enough knowledge for the reader to cook without reading further. Sahni's cooking style is very &quot;down-home&quot;, and these recipes--neither stilted nor diluted for Westerners--are skillfully designed to help you to cook likewise."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"i bought this book for two reasons: it's by julie sahni and the title implied a balance between vegetables and grains. i had been wondering whether indians used grains other than rice and wheat, and hoped this cookbook would answer the question with recipes. unfortunately for me, out of what, 200+ recipes, there is only one that uses a whole grain other than wheat or rice. and to add insult, in the introductory paragraph, ms. sahni writes that the jains frequently use grains other than rice and wheat--then she gives ONE recipe for millet. incredibly frustrating. however, the good part of this book is that it is by julie sahni. there are recipes i will try, especially those that use pumpkin as a savory dish and not pie. i just can't say that i would recommend this book to anyone who already has a selection on indian cooking."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"It's easy to be a vegetarian in summer when there is a plethora of juicy tomatoes and fresh basil in the garden; but winter always presents a challenge. Julie Sahni brings a new dimension to root crops.

Hooray to Julie for giving us another great cookbook."},{"Title":"Classic Indian Vegetarian and Grain Cooking","review":"This is the best Indian Cookbook that I own (and I have several as my husband is South Indian). The author gives a complete explanation of all unfamiliar vegetables and spices. The recipes are relatively easy to follow, and she lets you know when you can use convenient U.S.-style prepared foods instead of doing everything from scratch. My Indian friends were amazed that I could invite them over for Idlis without 24 hours of preparation. The only problem is that recipes are indexed by her English translation of the Indian name, so if you want to make Idlis, you have to know that she calls it something like &quot;Bean and Rice Dumplings&quot;. I recommend this book, and wish she had a non-vegetarian version.

I was even able to enjoy saag paneer for the first time by using tofu in lieu of cheese. Ghee, milk, and cream can be replaced with vegetable oil or soy/rice milk.Almost every recipe I've tried has been a winner. There are several that I've made again and again, such as the saag paneer, roti, the black-lentil dal, the Tanjore three-bean salad, and the five-jewel creamed lentils.

This book has so many fabulous recipes that it is hard to know where to start! I bought this book because of the great reputation that the author has, but expected more of the same old Americanized recipes that we usually get with Indian cookbooks.

This book assumes the reader has a working understanding of microcontroller and DSP fundamentals and also a comprehension of programming methodologies. Although the book does discuss media processing systems in general, it often grounds the discussion in concrete examples, and uses the Blackfin processor family as a basis for examples and architectural discussion. An overview of the book follows by chapter:1. Embedded Media Processing - Introduces the concept of embedded media processing and describes how it presents new design challenges. There is an architectural discussion of the Blackfin processor that serves as a foundation for further discussions in the book.2. Memory Systems - Provides a combination of information and examples to shed some light on the wide array of current and upcoming memory technologies. Specifically, the book talks about what types of memory to use and how to connect them in a system.3. Direct Memory Access (DMA) - Describes DMA and relates why it is crucial in an embedded multimedia system. There are numerous examples of how the DMA controller can intelligently move data to save extra passes through the system.4. System Resource Partitioning and Code Optimization - This chapter focuses on processor architectural features that are crucial to understand when developing a complex multimedia system. These features include event generation and handling, instruction pipelines, native addressing modes, and specialized instructions. There are many compiler tips and tricks to make the process of porting existing C/C++ code to an embedded processor as painless as possible.5. Basics of Embedded Audio Processing - The starting point for any embedded system that requires audio processing. The basics of the human auditory system are presented along with sampling theory. Next the book describes how to connect your embedded processor to audio converters or other inputs and outputs. Discussions of audio building blocks, basic programming techniques, fundamental algorithms, and audio and speech compression standards are included.6. Basics of Embedded Image and Video Processing - The \\"need to know\\" video basics are here without getting bogged down by format variations, geographic differences, legacy formats, etc. There is a discussion of video sources and displays that include the basic processing steps in an image pipeline. The chapter includes an example video application - analysis and design.7. Media Processing Frameworks - Targets the problem of how to port media algorithms from larger processors where memory and bandwidth are \\"free\\" to embedded systems that don't have unlimited resources. Describes a variety of programming frameworks that allow you to optimize performance for a given application without needlessly increasing the complexity of the programming model. Benchmarking techniques are described that will help the reader adapt a framework to fit a target application.8. Power Management for Embedded Systems - Acquaints the reader with the many facets of power management on high-performance processors. Included is a detailed discussion of Dynamic Power Management, which is a suite of processor functionality that allows flexible voltage and frequency tuning to meet performance goals while maximizing power savings. Next voltage regulation is covered, starting with an overview of linear regulators and proceeding to step-down switching regulators. Included are recommendations for component selection to aid in circuit design.9. Application Examples - The final chapter picks a few key areas of media processing and delves into the details on the implementation of an algorithm, framework, or system. In doing so, the book leverages the knowledge base of the previous chapters with the intent of showing how the concepts tie together into coherent entities that you can apply to your own embedded media projects.The book includes a CD-ROM which contains VisualDSP++ Test Drive from Analog Devices. This is a fully functional 90-day trial of the VisualDSP++ 4.0 integrated development and debug environment for Blackfin processors. The book also has a companion website that has lots of useful information on embedded media processing includng notes, code examples, white papers, and updates made for the book's second printing.This book is well-illustrated, clear, and detailed in its coverage of this useful but not well understood topic. I highly recommend it to anyone anticipating building an embedded system in which the processing of audio, video, or image data shall occur."},{"Title":"Embedded Media Processing","review":"I bought this book a couple of years ago and only now got to it. First thing I noticed upon pulling it off the shelf was that it had been published by Newnes. Having bought and seen a number of books from this publisher, I don't consider them a decent outfit (they, CMP, and Wordware are the publishing houses whose imprint on a book, for me, means putting it back on the shelf w/o further ado; taught by a consistently disappointing experience, I never buy their books), so I wondered why I did buy this one. The subject is of interest to me, but still... well, I figured it and found it amazing: due to the color scheme of the covers, this book looks like an Intel Press book (Intel Press itself is nothing to write home about, but they certainly are better than Newnes by two orders of magnitude). I got confused! :-) You got me, friends.Moving on, to the book itself: it is totally what you'd expect from Newnes, and that is, it's superficial to the point of uselesness, BUT it is obviously designed to look solid -- and that is achieved by way of picking a \\"hot\\" topic and then mentioning all the correct matters in the table of contents and chapters. This is what you'd notice upon a quick perusal in the bookstore, so they made it look good so you'd buy it. But when you get to read it, all these nice and appropriate chapters turn out to be disjointed, chaotic, and superficial. As well, sometimes, even incorrect: for example it is claimed that the sampling rate must be equal to or higher than double the maximum frequency that is to be captured (Nyquist theorem). This is incorrect, equal won't do: it must be _more_ than twice, period. Small thing? Yes, it's nitpicking perhaps, but it's a very well-known thing, so how come the authors don't know?The book isn't well written either (which is quite in the Newnes style): this means that, while someone familiar with the subject matter will be able to figure out what the authors' verbal muddle means, a more innocent student will immediately be lost -- yet surely it's the newbie who's the target audience here. This is typical for Newnes/CMP and the like publishers, whose publishing process apparently consists in contracting some industry participant (ostensibly qualified by the fact of working in it), getting him to produce the required page count by the necessary date, and then printing the drivel as is, w/o any editing whatsoever.Bottom line: this shoddy book is produced with a complete lack of good faith; the only effort the publisher put in was to make it _look_ like it's interesting (including the visual resemblance to Intel Press books). It's a complete and utter waste of time, not recommended. Btw, it used to be noticeably cheaper than what I see on this page: did the prices go noticeably up recently? Anyway, it's worthless at any price."},{"Title":"Embedded Media Processing","review":"This book is not a dry technical manual.

Anyone trying to understand how the war came about would do much better to work through Fay than to depend on one of the easy-reading journalistic summaries that have come out recently."},{"Title":"The origins of the world war,","review":"This book is divided into two sections, &quot;Before Sarajevo&quot; and &quot;After Sarajevo&quot;. I recommend that the reader skip directly to &quot;After Sarajevo&quot;.

The same goes for the kaleidoscope of political personalities. Instead, he plods on with an analysis of each event's place in the larger picture, without enlightening his readers as to what the event was. Even key figures receive minimal mention. In the &quot;After Sarajevo&quot; volume, the pace and description pick up considerably. The Serbian plot against the Archduke is described in detail. The author is careful to illustrate that the Germans were far from solely to blame for the War. In fact, their attempts to restrain Austria are contrasted with the French encouragement of Russia.

We will start with Turkey Tandoori, curried potatoes, cayenne cauliflower, Mulligatawny Soup, Salmon madras, Cachumbar and mango lassi (to name a few.)The recipes very are easy to follow. They not only note the time it takes to prepare and cook (not very long for most of them) but also shows step by step instructions, in individual photographs, how to prepare the meals. What could be easier? Very easy to prepare dishes with spices you most likely already have in your cupboard. And they are delicious as well. I had no idea I could create this kind of taste. I had always made my lentils with a spanish touch. Now with a few changes in spices/herbs I can create a whole new flavor.

This book was given to me as a gift, and it actually got me cooking.I happen to love Indian culture and Indian food - and this book starts from the perspective of someone with the barest basics in regular Western cooking, and explains, usually in small words, with lots of pictures, how to make each recipe. Each recipe is accompanied by an image of the finished product, as well as the major intermediate steps - and you can actually get the outcome to look like the picture, and it tastes as good as it looks.My only criticism is that the preparation time estimates are a little low. If you are just learning the fundamentals of efficient cutting, slicing, grating and dicing, then you will probably consume almost double the estimated preparation time.

As a qualitative research moderator, I am often asked to facilitate meetings or retreats by clients who are unaware of the differences -- hence, my interest in this book. But, whether you are working for a small or large company and want to hold a retreat, or you are someone needing to actually facilitate such an event, this book is a wealth of information.

Authors Sheila Campbell and Merianne Liteman address medium- to larger-sized organizations in the for-profit, nonprofit and government fields. Campbell and Liteman offer both a \\"how to\\" for planning and conducting a retreat and a fine sampling of facilitated group activities for different kinds of retreats.The overall message is that the top decisionmaker should hold a retreat only for important purposes, he or she must be truly ready to hear divergent views and to be open to real change, including change not anticipated by the decisionmaker. CEOs, boards, division directors and other \\"head honchos\\" that are not ready to share control need not apply. For instance, Campbell and Liteman recommend confidential pre-retreat interviews conducted by the facilitator. One of their retreat design principles is that at least some of the participants should contribute to formulating the goals of the retreat. To do so, they believe it is essential for employees to feel safe to share their views in planning the retreat as well as at retreat. Thus, Campbell and Liteman call for anonymity and non-attribution of pre-retreat views and assurance of no negative actions for expressing views candidly during the retreat.A key strength of the book is the attention to pre-retreat and post-retreat concerns. Pre-retreat matters extend well beyond choosing the meeting facility and menu [although their retreat logistics chapter is first rate] to the more important question: \\"Why have a retreat?\\" Campbell and Liteman specify nine reasons to hold a retreat and ten reasons not to hold a retreat. Both lists are enlightening and are foundational to further pre-retreat work.A retreat is not a conference and not a regular meeting. Campbell and Liteman believe a retreat is best served \\"off-site,\\" that is, at a location away from the workplace. They do cover the challenges of time and money in choosing an appropriate facility, and the discussion reinforces two more of their principles of retreat planning - designing a retreat to result in action for change and ensuring whatever happens at the retreat relates to the day-to-day work of the organization.Other pre-retreat elements are: setting the goals, deciding on the format, and inviting people; defining the roles of convener, facilitator, administrator, participants (and non-participants); and a review of fixed-format retreat designs (such as Future Search, Ropes courses, and Appreciative Inquiry). Campbell and Liteman do a fine job discussing the tension between having a small enough group for good interaction and the group being large enough to be inclusive of the key players. In particular, they offer eight common criteria for how to choose participants. I think the criteria are especially helpful as an organization thinks of board-staff concerns, clients or customer involvement in a retreat, and inter-organizational issues.A logical, but often overlooked, planning proviso is to design the retreat backwards-What is the outcome you seek? Instead of holding a retreat because its done annually, or because someone likes a particular format, or to \\"boost morale,\\" Campbell and Liteman forcefully highlight the need to have retreats only for special purposes, and to work from the question \\"How will the day-to-day workplace be different following the retreat?\\"The structure of the book opens with coverage of the why, goal-setting, logistics planning and role of leaders at the broadest view of a retreat. From there, most of the guide is devoted to facilitator assistance. Campbell and Liteman cover design issues ranging from pre-retreat work for participants to having \\"unprogrammed time\\" as an essential part of a successful retreat. They offer tips on ground rules, giving feedback to the group, and decisionmaking. For in-retreat concerns, general facilitator principles are leavened with brief guidance on how to respond to over a dozen glitches (such as repetitive discussions, disruption by a participant, a participant walking out, or a senior manager violating the ground rules).A large section of the book identifies activities appropriate for four kinds of retreats: a) strategic planning, b) culture change, c) relationship-building and teamwork, and d) creativity and innovation. Each activity offers a clear description, steps and facilitator notes. Equally valuable are accompanying sidebar notes on the experiential elements, set-up, special supplies and degree of facilitator experience to conduct the activity effectively (easy, moderately easy, or only for experienced/specialized training). While retreat facilitators will probably eat up this part of the book, I hope they don't overlook the earlier \\"menu-setting\\" essentials of effective retreats.Campbell and Liteman know that typically the worst part of a retreat is....after the retreat. Does the great thinking from the retreat get lost in the daily grind or new crises? Do non-participants not support the outcome? While a retreat's impact depends on organizational norms outside of any retreat's reach, Campbell and Liteman nicely select a few post-retreat points. In brief: announce the outcomes to everyone affected, not just the participants; move briskly into the actions steps identified at the retreat; and avoid a letdown by offering a memento, having periodic updates, or celebrating milestones. They highlight \\"critical leadership actions\\" for retreat follow-up.Campbell and Liteman know that retreats have a purpose within the larger context of an organization. They provide a fine guide the knits together the earliest hints of whether to hold a retreat to effective planning to post-retreat steps to offer the best possible assurance that the change initiated by the retreat is converted into a better organization. The book is a must-have for both the senior management and for internal and external facilitators.

The activities contained in this book are intelligent and fun, unlike several others I've read. I highly recommend this book for the activities section alone -- and if you do want to do a full retreat, it will prove even more valuable. Also, the sections on pre-interviewing participants and retreat design components were very helpful, and I am putting them to good use.I also like &quot;101 Games for Trainers&quot; by Bob Pike, and &quot;Games That Teach Teams&quot; by Steve Sugar.

Others in my company have had the same experience, so there wasn't much enthusiasm for the idea of having one.But after I shared with them some of the authors' ideas, they were convinced, as I was, that we could follow Campbell and Liteman's guidelines and actually hold a retreat that would help the company become more focused and improve our operations.The book is full of engaging stories about what can go wrong when a retreat is poorly planned or facilitated, and, in contrast, how to go about planing and leading a retreat that will succeed and make things better.I found the book well-written and easy to read, and I learned how details ranging from whom you invite to the kind of facility you use and how key executives -- including me -- behave before, during, and after the retreat can affect its success. The authors made me aware of many things I hadn't thought about that now I'll keep in mind.You may think that a book about retreats is just for your HR folks. Not so for this book.

It seems the authors anticipated every question a person might have and provided guidance."},{"Title":"Hounded (Animaniacs)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite childhood books--and I have so many that it takes a real winner to stand out near the top of the heap. This one is not even so much memorable for the fact that it stars the Animaniacs, or for its simple (yet awesome) story, but for its absolutely delightful illustrations. The drawings of the five dogs that the Warner brothers (and sister) care for are inspirational and have a quality of design to them that most 'kiddie' books lack.The dogs are a basically well-mannered little black Scottie, a spunky and mischievous fawn-colored Pug, a very large and energetic Shepherd-like male whom somewhat resembles Buttons from the series, a small/medium-sized liver-colored mix (perhaps Labrador Retriever/scenthound/terrier?), and a lovely butterscotch-colored female Saluki (the only girl of the group, once more...hmm, of whom does she remind me?) These members of the canine quintet are basically nameless, but I have called them Jake, Monroe, Brom, Mungo, and Ilsa, respectively, for a long time. The names Boopsie and Pickles are actually revealed near the end, but we don't know which two they're supposed to be...I'm guessing my Ilsa and Mungo, based upon the picture. However, I'm going with those simply being nicknames, because mine fit much better! That's how fun the pictures are--these nameless dog characters seem to have such great personalities that it leads you to want to flesh them out yourself! It's a shame that they were not featured in the cartoon series itself.I love this Golden 'Look-Look' Book. Others, such as the Anastasia \\"How To Behave Like a Princess\\" book, also feature such wonderful, creative illustrations as well as very entertaining text, and are highly recommended. (Coincidentally, that one also includes a picture of a pretty Saluki dog, which pleases me personally.) So sad that the days of being able to buy books like these from stores like Bradlees are gone!"},{"Title":"Michelin Battle of Normandy Map No.102","review":"I found this map to be a priceless aid in the study of the invasion when used in conjuction with books and outlines on the various battles. The stories of individual actions found in historic writings come alive when followed with this map. It clearly shows dates and locations of advances of the Allied Forces and shows Normany the way it was in 1944.

The map is very detailed and was excellent for planning the trip before arriving in France. However, after driving in Normandy, I was startled that I could actually depend on this map for navigation! Even though it is a map from the 40's, many things have not changed in Normandy! While some cemetaries that were identified on the maps are no longer US cemetaries (for example, we exhumed our dead from a current German cemetary and reburied them in the US cemetary near Omaha beach), practically every other feature identified on the map is accurate. These include the memorial markers, gun batteries, parachute drop zones and even the towns which had a lot of battle damage.

And no need to post responses to this review, whining about the evils of illegal sharing/copying. I just don't care.

You have to tone your ears and start from the very beginning and continue on step by step. Also, you can play the CD's in you car over and over which will shoot it into your brain. Let's face it this is best way to get it into your head.Forget about all the baloney said about teaching you the informal spanish because this course teaches you everything informal and formal. This course has a \\"get involved and answer questions in spanish\\" type of format. This method is little bit different then \\"Behind the Wheel Spanish\\" which for the most part does not get you involved in answering questions.What I hate about this product is the price for the CDs. The Download is a good price, but when you order the CDs then it becomes expense. This is where \\"Behind the Wheel Spanish\\" has them beat. I can get Behind the Wheel Spanish\\" CDs Level 1,2,3 for about $100 dollars with tons of learning.LSLC is still better than all the other courses because it has a better method for learning Spanish. It will get you involved and the other CD course don't.Now, let me say something about downloading, to play the download in my car I have convert the MP3 file to a uncompressed audio file and burn it to a CD, (Some new car can play a compressed MP3 CD but you still have make the CD).This is a pain in the a_ _ because we are talking a lot of CDs and a lot of time I don't have."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"This is Ellen's husband.I'm on lesson 6.

Adios!"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I have spent probably a thousand dollars on courses like Pimsleur (I went through all three levels; heavy on pounding stuff into your head, but not enough vocabulary to write home about), Auralog computer-based Spanish(boring and tends to crash the computer), and \\"Behind the Wheel Spanish\\" (inconsistent -- way too slow, then way too fast) in my attempt to learn Spanish. What a waste! Everything I wanted was in \\"Learning Spanish Like Crazy.\\" I only wish I'd found it first.The lessons are, like Pimsleur, structured to pound stuff into your head so you won't forget it as soon as you learn it. But LSLC differs from Pimsleur in several key ways.1. There's enough vocabulary to choke a mule -- and that's good thing.2. Every verb is fully conjugated in each lesson, so you recognize the patterns and start \\"absorbing\\" them faster...but it's done in a conversational style so you barely realize \\"hey, I'm conjugating a verb\\" and you don't get grossed out by the fact that you're learning grammar.3. Brief explanations are given on things that are complicated or irregular so you understand why you are doing what you're doing, instead of learning by rote. (Adult learners need to understand why, trust me.)4. It moves along at a good pace. It's taken me 10 days to get to Lesson 13 and I've enjoyed every lesson. Lesson 13 introduces the student to reflexive verbs (and you know it because they tell you, \\"today we're doing reflexive verbs.\\" Pimsleur never tells you what you're doing -- which is fine if you're a kid, but boring and confusing if you're over the age of 40!)5. Best of all, it isn't boring. There are plenty of reasons to pay attention when attempting to learn a language, but it's easier to say than to do with some courses. LSLC makes it easy to pay attention because there's always something going on.6. Lessons are logically laid out, with specific groups of related words in each lesson so you can absorb them all; with Pimsleur the words sometimes seem chosen at random and the conversations change ideas from sentence to sentence.Again, I'm only on Lesson 13, but I like what I'm doing and my vocabulary has increased drastically; I know words for day-to-day functions that Pimsleur never covered although we take such words for granted in English. I've already purchased LSLC level 2. This is great! Highly recommended to anybody who wants to really learn and understand Spanish."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I bought the product last year and have completed all of the lessons. Trust me - I agree with several of the other reviewers that it is really a great tool - if not the best that I've come across for dealing with everyday conversation. Being a very skeptical person with stuff like this, I admit that this is the only audio course that I have bought, and honestly don't think I'll purchase others. I did a lot of research before I tried the LSLC Level 1 system.I live in Trinidad and Tobago (unlike any of the other reviewers that I have seen so far). TnT is located just 9km (about 5-6 miles) off of the coast of Venezuela, and 99.5% of the population here knows just a handful of Spanish words. After taking a course at the Venezuelan Embassy here for two years, I still found it quite difficult to understand them when they spoke - especially among themselves! I can read and write it quite well, but still had great difficulty understanding the natives. After studying the first maybe 14 lessons, I visited some friends of mine over there in December, and to my surprise I understood them a heck of a lot more. By the way, these folks speak much faster than Mexicans and Colombians in normal conversation - particularly those from the Eastern part of the country, so most of you have virtually no stress, since most Americans interact with Mexicans or Puerto Ricans. Try conversing with someone from Guiria, Venezuela too see what I'm talking about! The Mexicans I have interacted with speak very clearly compared to most Venezuelans - and the accent is easier to understand. Of course the LSLC instructors were quite easy to understand, and YEAH - it's a CD, so you don't have to ask them to say something again!I would recommend the course for anyone, but would like to sort of categorize it (hope it helps somewhat):- Beginners: You need some good reference material and a tutor to work with, alongside the course. The course is not ALL! 501 Spanish Verbs by Christopher Kendris, and Dorothy Richmond's 'Practice Makes Perfect' series of workbooks - these are GREAT! A good dictionary such as the Oxford Spanish Dictionary is a must. NOT a pocket dictionary - at least not for serious learners. The Oxford is bulky, but it contains many idiomatic explanations and context-based translations for virtually all the words it contains, along with explanations of the nuances of using certain words - again, in context. Regional differences are well-covered in this dictionary. There is no dictionary out there that comes close - although the latest Collin's tries really hard. I have lots of reference books, but I have found these outstanding in building stuff clearly so one could understand without boring drills.- Intermediate: I think the best way to treat this is to relate my own experience. This course helped me to fill the gaps in my understanding of certain annoying things that you don't see in texts and that are not found in other audio courses - stuff like '&iquest;Como?' meaning 'What was that?' or 'What did you say?' in English, clearly explained. Before, I used to say '&iquest;Qu&eacute;?' and any native speaker would look at me kind of funny, but I never knew my (potentially rude) error until I used the course material in Nivel 1. You can find yourself in some embarassing positions if stuff like that is missed in your speech. I did learn a lot of new stuff with the course as well, such as a few idiomatic expressions that you can't really translate directly. And yes - your accent becomes really HOT! My friends told me they were amazed at how I sounded when I visited. Of course I felt great, even though I knew that I still have much more work to do.- Advanced: Heck, you don't really need this stuff - this is for newbies and the peeps like me who are still striving toward fluency! Anyway, I think that even advanced non-native speakers may pick up something small in here, maybe as revision or something.Dive in, folks. For those of you who have used the more antiquated products that focus on mainland (Spain) Spanish, you'll really appreciate this stuff. The use of different people from at least two countries really helps you differentiate the accents. Remember, my problem was lack of listening skill (and still is to a great extent), so that's how I addressed it. LSLC allows you to attack both speaking and listening at the same time, so if they're your squeeze, get the course. The FSI material included is wonderful for rigorous reinforcement, but it's not as much fun as the LSLC. It's actually quite mechanical, BUT has serious material, so it should be used too.Hey, a tip I have tried is to buy some music in at least one genre that you really love, performed strictly in Spanish, and listen to it over and over. You will be amazed at how well your listening will improve and you'll be checking that dictionary pretty often too. I have several albums that I listen to, and I tell you - they've helped plenty. This also seems to reinforce your ability to hear words slumped together as individual or logical groups, and at least for me, allows you to start to figure out missed or unclear words based on the other words around them.Now handle yuh scene!Sweet TnT!!"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"This was actually the first learning spanish course that I bought.I remember on the webpage for LSLC,the owner says that if his friends would teach on the cd's,that he would show the best method for learning,that he has found.For anyone who has done pimsleur,it is pretty obvious that this is the method that he chose to use.So I went through level 1 of lslc really easy,but then from there I struggled.I just felt like there was just to much information per each lesson.However,I kept reading about how great and easy pimsleur spanish is,etc etc.So after I struggled but made it to lesson 5 on lslc, I decided to buy pimsleur 1,to see what the big deal was.Wow,what a difference.With pimsleur,you only learn about 4-6 words per lesson.However there are 2 special things about the words you learn.1.After you learn the couple of words,you use them many times over and over,and in many different combinations.So if you learn:I have,you have,and,but,1,2,3..the lesson would look like this:I have one.You have three.I have two,but you have one.I have one and two,but you have three ETC.2.You use the words frequently for the next 2-4 lessons.And each time you learn a couple more words,you use the words in various combinations,with words from the previous lesson(s).So if in the next lessons you learn:I want,you want,dollars..You would say phrases like:I have 2 but I want 3.I have 3,do you want 1.I have 2,but I want 3,and you want 1 ETC ETC ETC.With pimsleur everything is just so simple,.I have been doing 2 lessons a day with no problems.I have only had to review one lesson twice,and I am almost done with pimsleur 1(30 lessons).As a reviewer said on here,you probably learn more in 30 lessons of lslc than you do in 3 times the lessons and time of pimsleur.But that is where the problem is,the lslc team has crammed so much info per lesson,that I had to review some of the lessons 7-8 times to get it down greatly.After reviewing the text for the lessons,some times they conjugate 3-4 verbs,plus teaches some nouns and other stuff.The only other problem I have is that they have decided to put info in the lessons by grammer patters(ar verbs in these lessons , er verbs in these lessons,possesive nouns in these lessons etc.)Once again unlike pimsleur that rolls on smoothly lesson to lesson,with LSLC you learn how to talk about possesive pronouns,and then in the next lesson your learning how to start a conversation,and then in the next your learning how to conjugate ir verbs ETC.So you kind of start learning one thing, then start learning another thing ETC ETC.Also,unlike pimsleur where you may use a word20-30 times or more, you sometimes only use a word 2-3 times with lslc.So why am I giving 4 stars?Well because despite it not being as easy and natural as pimsleur,everything else is great.The voice and sound clarity is top notch.You learn the grammer rules easily,and some good patterns of the language(for instance in lesson 1 you learn how to conjugate regular AR verbs,and just by learning the unconjugated verbs,with a little thinking,you could conjugate them).Plus,While it can be just to much at times,there is alot of words and information to learn.From reviewing the text(which is also a great benefit,you get the text for them words you are just not sure of)I can see it teaches alot of everything verbs, lots of nouns ETC.Plus,as promised,you get to learn all the informal phrases and the tu conjugation of each verb.If I was the driving force behind LSLC,I would make each 1 30 minute lesson into 3 or 4 shorter lessons.This way it would be alot easier to learn and absorb the info,and they could still get away with cramming tons of information in 15 hours.One more thing.Besides pimsleur and fsi spanish(and its variations),I dont think that there is any program out there that teaches anywhere near what this one will(And I have rocketspanish,synergyspanish and a few other products).So in a nutshell,this product is great,but it is difficult to try to learn that much in 30 minutes,and without repeating the words alot.I still recommend you buy it,just wanted to give an honest opinion."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I think someone who really is looking for fluency should do both the Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy Spanish programs. My reasons are that since I live in Mexico I can attest to the practically of Pimsuer in formal more educated settings with Spanish speakers. To say that Pimsleur teaches \\"archaic\\" Spanish is nonsense. However, it does teach a more formal Spanish that is spoken in educated crowds. When you hit the streets of Mexico and try to speak with kids, teenagers, and local store employees Pimsleur tends to fail you. That's where LSLC comes in and rescues you. You need both! You need to know the formal more educated Spanish as well as the street Spanish. It is not necessary to mean-mouth Pimsleur in order to point out the benefits of LSLC.Doug BowerYou Can Learn Spanish No Matter Your Age or Disposition"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"In addition to the skill of speaking Spanish, the LSLC has helped me to truly THINK in Spanish and more importantly, helped me develop the skill to LISTEN in Spanish.The native speakers used from different Latin American countries results in an excellent way to experience the different regional accents (e.g. the first lesson has the article \\"I\\" and in the practice conversations you hear both the \\"yo\\" sound and \\"joe\\" sound used).In my business travel to Central and South America, I'm amazed with each month's travels, how much more I'm picking up onand understanding from the conversations taking place.I've been studying Spanish approx. 8 months now and had no previous language studies. I first completed Spanish for Gringos and then Level 1 of Pimsleur. The LSLC is trulymy favorite and the interactive challanges are highly addictive (my 11 yr. old daughter has learned quickly that she better be quick to the car CD or it's \\"Lecciones en espa&ntilde;ol para ella)!I can attest that I speak more fluent and free-flowing Spanish, than my coworkers who took at least two (some three) years of Spanish in high school. In addition, with the audio format (rather than PC or Class format) every minute I devote to my studies is spent studying (i.e. the only wasted time is the time it takes to press \\"play\\" on my iPod or CD player).I'm convinced that if I had taken a traditional class first, there is no possible way I would have progressed as quickly.I have conversations in Spanish while waiting in rush-hour, in lobbies waiting for appointments, weekends at the coffe shop, etc.. whenever it's convenient for ME.In addition, the LSLC Level 1 course has a whole community of learners behind it to add to a deeper immersion in learning the language.

I am currently working on Level 2 of LSLC.I am 68 and have moved recently to Central America. I am still learning Spanish and will be for several years--languages are complex and robust.

I have struggled with both Spanish and French since taking the languages in high School and college.Without mentioning any names, I have tried most of the other big name Spanish courses. I found this method not only to be the easiest method for learning Spanish but also the most fun.In my opinion the course's strongest point is that it actually helps you develop a near perfect accent, as one reviewer already mentioned.I know exactly what he means when he says that your accent will be so good that natives won't know if you're completely fluent in Spanish or not.I have also learned a lot of vocabulary words with Learning Spanish Like Crazy. But I did find that it was necessary to buy a couple of books to help me with increasing my vocabulary. The two that I recommend are Easy Spanish Phrase Book and 1001 MostUseful Spanish words.I bought both books at a used bookstore for about 50 cents a piece. You can however by them here Amazon for about $1 for each book. The two books are only about 50 pages, but they will really teach you the vocabulary that you need to communicate Latin Amerincans.I guess my only complaint is that the narrator of the course is not a native English speaker. So at sometimes I had to listen to the recording more than once to understand his English. But on the positive side since the narrator was a native Latino, he was able to do the narrative in Spanish more and more as the course progress into the later lessons. If he had been an American he would not have been able to do the narrative in Spanish or he would not have been able to do it with a true Latin American accent And since he was a native Latino he was able to explain a lot of the nuances about Latin American Spanish that only a native would have knowledge of.If you use Learning Spanish Like Crazy with Easy Spanish Phrase Bookand 1001 Most Useful Spanish words, you will learn Spanish like crazy(for lack of a better term).

Overall I felt Pimsleur was better for the true beginner because it has a great way for you to memorize words and they go through alot of them fairly quickly without overwhelming you. I feel that this program will be too much for some starting from scratch. Others may not have a problem. I suppose it all depends how well you learn. But because Pimsleur teaches you so many words it lacked the time to teach you all the different ways to say them. And thats where this program shines. It uses the same approach as Pimsleur, but stays with a word until you understand all the variations fully. Once you have a grasp on the language, this tape will be much easier to memorize and they do a great job explaining WHY you say the word a certain way. My only gripe is some of the noun choices. I cant imagine a scenerio where I would be on vacation in a Spanish speaking country and have to argue over whos pillow cases they belong to. I realize that the point is not to teach you how to say \\"pillow case\\" but to teach you the different ways to ask and respond when talking about a object in fem or masc form. But still, a better choice of nouns to learn wouldve been more satisfactory. There are a few in the program I found useless, but there are also many that will help a traveler. Its a small complaint, so pay it little attention.

I have tried some tapes, cds, and the Pimsleur program (TOO SLOW) and books, all to minor improvement.This course is PERFECT for me! This past weekend I plowed through 12 lessons, picking up all these little rules that I missed along the way. I can go through each lesson in sequence and not feel like I'm rehashing too much, while still reinforcing previous lessons that just roll off the tongue! I think of the hundreds/thousands of dollars I have spent over 20 years and wish I had this program available to me years ago.Meanwhile, I just ordered Vol. 2 -- between these two volumes and the FSI materials (definitely worth buying w/ Amazon benefits), I only have myself to blame, but one week later, I'm feeling confident I'll get through this program!Addendum (later): I finished the cd set and feel even stronger about the quality of this program. The last 10 lessons go deeper and quickly reinforce lessons from earlier and get a lot more vocabulary quickly than other programs. The vocabulary and the rapid pace of getting different verb conjugations make this an outstanding program. After finishing the first set, I was so excited to keep the progress I picked up Nivel Dos (Level 2) immediately and kept right on rolling!"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"Were it not for the rave reviews on Amazon I would have ignored this product. The official web-site is identical to every other gimmicky marketing page, complete with too-good-to-be-true testimonies and corny sloganeering. Nevertheless, I had great success learning basic conversational German with Pimsleur and certainly would have enjoyed learning Latin American Spanish through the same method.For those not familiar with the Pimsleur method, here's a quick run-down: the learner uses audio CD's to engage in mock conversation with a native speaker. You learn your second language like a child learns his first, by mimicking proper accent, acquiring grammar through conversation practice, and learning useful phrases to help you function. This is opposed to classroom language learning, where you often listen to a non-native speaker, study grammar rules out of a dull book, engage in little if any conversation, and memorize lists of vocab.Learning Spanish Like Crazy certainly copies Pimsleur in many regards. After all, LSLC is also audio-based and teaches through mock conversation. The huge difference between the two is the amount of material covered. Pimsleur aims to make you proficient in essentials, LSLC aims to expose you to a vast array of topics regardless of their immediate practicality. It's a simple matter of wide versus deep, quantity versus quality. Personally I would far prefer the latter.How does this play out practically? I walked into Pimsleur German I and LSLC I with roughly the same amount of knowledge of each language. In both cases I listened to each lesson two or three times. I have both German-speaking and Spanish-speaking friends and believe me when I say I felt far more comfortable conversing with the former. Indeed, were I dropped off in Berlin right now I could function confidently at a very basic level in German society---getting around, ordering food, making purchases, handling money, meeting people, etc. Were I dropped off in Mexico city after using LSLC, the same would definitely not be true. But don't take my word for it. Buy LSLC and, despite the breadth of the material, see how much you find useful or can recall during conversation.Specifically:1. Poor memory scheduling / formattingIt's charitable that I write \\"poor\\" because LSLC arguably has no memory scheduling. As opposed to Pimsleur, which constantly reviews vocab and phrases at an appropriate rate to move them from short-term to long-term memory, LSLC will literally introduce you to a word or phrase, repeat it a few times that lesson, and that's the last you'll hear of it. Grammar is approached similarly: instead of smoothly integrating new grammar topics into future conversation, most grammar is attacked in \\"blocks\\": today we're learning X. Now we're done. Today we're learning Y. Now we're done. A structured approach to grammar isn't necessarily bad, but, as others have pointed out, LSLC's heavy topical focus removes the challenge of real conversation and replaces it with repetition in many instances.2. Little explanation of grammarThis is another one that baffles me. Supposedly LSLC does a great job of explaining new grammatical rules, rather than just throwing you in head first and hoping you figure it out after listening to it enough times. (Which is something Pimsleur could improve upon.) This is true in maybe the first six lessons, after that I heard little if any explanation of the grammar. Perhaps the most brutal indictment is lesson 13, where you receive no instruction on how to modify a type of verb that has no English counterpart. Fortunately they told me this lesson focuses on reflexive verbs, that way I could simply look it up online instead of wasting even more time repeating the same lesson.3. Irrelevant topicsThis is without a doubt the most frustrating aspect of LSLC. It's one thing to struggle through a poorly formatted program if you know you're still going to walk away with some useful phrases for conversation or activity. Its another thing to walk away with phrases that have little or no value in most conversations that a novice will encounter, even with close friends. Whereas I could be learning how to invite others to dinner and order food, I'm instead learning \\"the dog eats in the hallway\\" and \\"the pillowcase is on the dryer.\\" Oh, but it gets better. In lesson 13 you will learn invaluable phrases like, \\"After I wake up, I shave my face\\" and \\"My father doesn't brush his teeth every day.\\" Exactly what I wanted to say to that cute Latina girl! (For those of you who have read the LSLC web site, you know what I'm poking fun at.)Lesson 13 also begins a series of lessons that sound like they were recorded in someone's basement. (Notice that I keep coming back to this lesson---believe me, I was tempted to chuck the CD into oncoming traffic.) Nevertheless, I pushed on, finally reaching the halfway point and deciding to quit with little regret---namely because they were still teaching me useless phrases. (\\"You always dance in the club!\\" No, I always dance with my cat in the hallway! Fortunately I know how to tell you that!)Despite my disappointment with LSLC, it does have a few strong points. First, the actor / actress are actually quite engaging and seem to enjoy what they're doing, which makes it more fun for you. Second, a transcript of each lesson is found on an extra CD. I badly wish Pimsleur would do this for those of us who can't tell exactly what is being said or want to learn the spelling. Finally, LSLC is more easily affordable compared to Pimsleur, though using eBay the difference is lessened substantially.Since it's not that expensive, I would recommend LSLC for someone who already knows basic functional Spanish and wants to increase their vocabulary, get some conversation practice, and develop a Latin American accent. But for anyone looking for a solid foundation to practical, conversational Spanish (businessmen, students, travelers) this is at best just one component of a much more robust Spanish education."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I have used the Learning Spanish Like Crazy (Volume 1) and it is awesome! The teaching method used in LSLC is exactly what I was looking for.- The CDs in this volume were used to teach and speak the vocubulary and grammar and then apply all of it thru a dialogue.- I also like how each lesson is always building upon the previous lessons.- Along with the CDs there are audio transcripts (both english & spanish translations).- In addition, explanations are given thru out the lessons on why we are learning and saying it this way.- In these lessons I have learned the formal and informal ways on how to speak and ask questions in spanish.- Most important - every lesson is always teaching a new concept, which makes it very challenging but also consistent.- Since I was so happy with this product - I have already purchased Volume 2 thru the original manufacturer ([...])."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"My Fiance is from Argentina & speaks fluent spanish & italian.

They nearly ALL stop with a review up until lesson 13. I find that very interesting because something happens at lesson 13.The first 12 lessons are good, not great. I have a background in basic Spanish and thus I understood why things were conjugated the way they were. There are NO explanations provided on the cd so it is essentially rote memorization. BUT, at lesson 13, the instructor on the cd changes and the tempo and difficulty increases dramatically. In fact, even with listening to lesson 13 five times with the dialogue PRINTED off, I still could not follow along. This is because they begin speaking so fast and are using irregular verbs.Bottom line: This product is good for lessons 1-12 but is abysmal after that.

I have been using it for about 2 months along with Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish book. I go to a Spanish discussion group with 2 English speaking friends and 2 native Spanish speakers from Guatemala. I finally was brave enough to read a couple of paragraphs from a book we were discussing (hadn't said more than \\"mucho gusto\\" before that). Everyone was amazed with my accent and pronunciation. (the Guatemalans were wanting a good laugh is why they asked me to read! Ha!) It made me feel great. I am still not able to understand a great deal of what is being said (have to get used to the way people slur their words in real life), but I am getting better all the time. I don't think you will be disappointed if you purchase this course if you are really serious about learning to speak Spanish. Also the company has sent me so much extra information by email, I can barely keep up with it all. Really a great deal."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"A good quickie course in learning basic conversational Spanish - andunlike Pimsleur, they put in some explanation of the language syntax andstructure which is good for adults because it gives you a better mentalpicture of what's going on in the language.The CD's came in like-new condition - I have had no problem at all withthem."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy is the best language audio CD set on the market. I own most of the other high-quality language learning systems: books, audio, and software. I studied Spanish for years in school and found occasions to speak it regularly in my communities, growing up in NY and living in TX and CA.I speak Spanish reasonably well now. Whenever I travel to a Spanish-speaking country on vacation or business, I still spend a few weeks reviewing my Pimsleur and LSLC CDs to brush up, listening as I commute to work.Patrick Jackson's method stands on the shoulders of the Pimsleur method. He has crafted a language training series that is modern, lively, and fun to use. The conversational method pioneered by Pimsleur is much more entertaining and effective method than the rote drill methods used in systems like the Foreign Service Institute (FSI).Even if you are proficient in basic conversation, you will find the first level series useful. The early lessons are basic, but the later lessons in this level ramp up quickly, mixing tenses and vocabulary in a mode similar to natural conversation. Like the Pimsleur method, which scientifically measures the human ability to remember, language patterns and vocabulary are constantly reinforced throughout the course. You don't forget what you learned in the beginning of the course. You use the skills and vocabulary throughout the course.I was a little wary of the cartoon cover art and marketing style of the website. Given the expense of the series, I was concerned about quality, but the reviews and endorsements sounded credible. LSLC offers a money-back guarantee, personally guaranteed by Patrick Jackson in my correspondence with him. When I discovered a defective CD in my pack, he replaced the entire set immediately.If you choose to get on the email list, you will receive regular bonus packs of interesting language resources and entertaining, highly informative letters from Patrick as he travels abroad, featuring subtle aspects of the Spanish language, particularly as it is spoken in Central and South America.I own level one and two. I wish LSLC would produce a level three. The current, two LSLC levels span all the concepts and material in the three-level Pimsleur set, so you get very good value purchasing LSLC.I found the LSLC series to be qualitatively better than the Pimsleur series, which is getting a bit out-of-date. LSLC is more systematic and thorough than Pimsleur in presenting concepts and reinforcing learning.LSLC is particularly strong in teaching verb tenses and building proficiency in using mixed verb tenses in conversation. The lessons on subjunctive tenses are the best I have found in any language learning system of this type. Those lessons were very helpful to me in developing more proficiency in using this subtle aspect of the Spanish language."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I have been teaching all levels of Spanish for nearly 20 years. This is one of the best products that I have seen for those trying to perfect their Spanish. It does an excellent job of cycling vocabulary and grammar in sentences that you repeat - similar to the Pimsleur method, but more challenging and varied. If you have an minimal idea of the Spanish grammar ahead of time, this program could definitely improve the speaking and listening skills of the user. I was so impressed with the program that I purchased levels I, II and III for my own private use with my own kids in the car. Levels II and III are also excellent and drill almost ever verb tense and many grammatical constructions in the language. I did order level II from the Learning like Crazy website and their service was excellent."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy Level 1 is designed for beginners who have already had some basic exposure to simple pronunciation (vowels and consonants) Starting Level 1 already having studied basic pronunciation will be a great benefit. The grammar isn't explained either, so knowing some grammar in advance, at least beginning level grammar basics, is also recommended, so you don't get overwhelmed. Learning Like Crazy Level 1 is great for getting used to the syntax of Spanish as well as seeing how the grammar you've learned is put into actual use. It is also beneficial for developing basic aural skills, building basic vocabulary, practicing simple verb conjugations, and macro-pronunciation (longer sentence structures). This is not a stand-alone program. Rather it works best if used in conjunction with a more comprehensive program, course or textbook."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I started with Pimsleur which moved at a slower pace and taught basic tourist Spanish (very formal).

Probably useful if you're taking a Spanish class, but for a traveler this is next to useless and really, really boring. I don't imagine I will ever need to say, \\"Yes, I see the red cars.\\" Ever. Also, focusing on the familiar form of Spanish seems like a bad strategy. If you're just learning the language, how likely are you to be talking to people you know well enough to use the familiar form of address? The first CD was unplayable; and while I knew enough Spanish to skip it, I just found the subsequent lessons to be boring and not all that useful.

I have had 2 years of high school Spanish, 12 weeks of an immersion course and 2 weeks of immersion in living with a Mexican family in Cuernavaca. I have learned more with these CDs than I thought was possible. Please read Anna's review and ditto from me.\\"As the editor of the Learning Spanish Products Reviews (LearningSpanishProductsReviews) site, one of my responsibilities is to review Spanish courses that are listed on Amazon. I am also a native Spanish speaker from Argentina and a professional private Spanish instructor.I have recommended this course to at least a dozen of my private students. I had recommended it to a married couple that has studied Spanish for years and was finding it easy to read and write in Spanish and even understand the novelas, but was having difficulty speaking it. After several weeks of daily practice with this course, they are speaking Spanish much better and with a lot more confidence.As several reviewers have pointed out, this course uses a teaching method that makes it possible for the student to really get a true Latin American Spanish accent. As a Spanish instructor I am very tolerant of students that have poor pronunciation or bad accents in Spanish. But as a native Spanish speaker, I can tell you that there is nothing more annoying than someone that has taken the time to learn proper Spanish vocabulary and grammar but has neglected to learn the proper pronunciation and accent. If you fall into that category, please give this course a try so you can get your Latin American Spanish accent right.The sound quality of the lessons is also excellent. And to develop proper pronunciation and accent, you really need good sound quality like this course has. I was also impressed with the amount of content that the course covers.As a native Spanish speaker, I can say that this course comes closer than other courses in teaching Latin American Spanish that is for everyday conversation, and teaching the Spanish that Latin Americans actually speak. Although I have not personally experienced them, one of my students told me that the course also includes a live weekly group class by telephone with a native instructor from Costa Rica. The students on the group class call and speak in Spanish to each other and the instructor in Spanish.Without a doubt, this is the best course for learning true Latin American conversational Spanish. And also the best for refining a proper sounding Latin American accent.\\""},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I began listening to LSLC I a couple of years ago, and ended up buying LSLC II as well. The structure of the lessons is excellent, each lesson starting with a fast conversation in Spanish you probably won't understand any of at first, and spending the entire lesson explaining the conversation and drilling.The speakers aren't just flatly saying their lines in monotone, they really act out the phrases so you can get a good sense of the connotations involved. The method doesn't have any written materials, which is actually a great strength if you want to learn in your car or at the gym.Some of the strengths include:1) Portability of the lessons (no workbook needed)2) Concentration on spoken Spanish from Latin America (not literary Spanish)3) Enthusiastic speakers4) High quality sound productionI also highly recommend LSLC II because it gives a great introduction to the subjunctive mood. If you do purchase either set, make sure you get on the email list - it provides free lessons as well. To be fair, the method is complementary to writing and grammar exercises (many of which you can find on the internet), and won't take you to fluency in every area. Still, it's a great foundation for actually speaking in Spanish.I've listened to at least five other Spanish audio programs (most of which are extremely boring), and I don't think there's another program out there like this.Que disfruten las lecciones!"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"If you are serious about learning Spanish, and don't want to sign up for a live course, then probably you are trying to choose between Learning Spanish like Crazy and Pimsleur. Or possibly Rosetta Stone, which I don't have experience with. Shorter courses, such as Living Language or Penton Overseas Learn in Your Car are useful to an extent, but you won't really learn the language from them.On the surface, Learning like Crazy follows the Pimsleur method. Namely, you are given a sentence in English, with a pause so that you can repeat it in Spanish, then you are given the correct version in Spanish with another pause to repeat the corrected version. And then maybe another repetition.This is a slow process, but nothing else works to really master the language. (To repeat, I don't really have experience with Rosetta Stone.)Beyond the surface level, though, Learning Like Crazy is structured differently from Pimsleur. It is more like a combination of Pimsleur and the traditional academic course, or the Living Language courses. (The best of these, in my opinion, is the Living Language All Audio course). If you watch a student of the traditional approach speaking, you can observe his mental process. First, he needs to find the right words. Then find the right grammatical structure. Then put it all together like doing an algebra problem. Doing this, you can often learn to speak correctly most of the time, but you will not sound natural. When one really knows a language, sentences do not come into the mind one word at a time. In my opinion, the basic unit of language is not the word but the sentence. Or at least the short phrase.Grammar should not like a set of traffic rules which one carefully observes in order to avoid getting a ticket. Grammar needs to be understood at an instinctive level (which native speakers often can't even explain), so that a grammatical sentence simply sounds natural and an ungrammatical one sounds wrong. (Which is not to say that one needs to have perfect grammar all the time. But one needs to know the way people actually speak.)Pimsleur and Learning Like Crazy teach not by presenting words and rules, but by having the students learn model sentences. And it's important to learn these model sentences really well. One needs to not just repeat the sounds, but to make the sentence one's own, so that one says it and really means it. This is why I disagree with the idea of going on to the next lesson as soon as one has mastered about 80% of the current one. In fact, I think it's important to use the pause button on one's CD player and repeat some particular sentences five or six times, until one has really got them down and they come out smoothly. (Because some of the patterns in Spanish are so different from English, some Spanish sentences are real brain twisters if not tongue twisters.)In going through Pimsleur, one has a very natural feeling, as though the sentences one is learning were part of a conversation one might actually have when visiting a Spanish speaking country as a tourist or on business. This in my opinion makes it much easier to really make these sentences one's own. Doing so is also helped by the fact that the intonation and rhythm are very much that or natural Spanish. (Notice how almost metronomic the rhythm of Spanish sentences often is, as you can verify by tapping your finger along with the words.) If you are making the right sounds, but what you are saying doesn't really sound like a Spanish speaker talking, then it will be harder to really learn the sentence.In Learning Like Crazy, on the other hand, I am very aware that I am going through a set of grammar exercises. And many of the sentences are things that I would never have any occasion to say to anyone. Things like, \\"After I wake up, I wash my face.\\" Or, \\"Every week, I go in the bank.\\" Or \\"Where did I work five years ago?\\" Of course the point is not that I expect the course to give me actual sentences that I will use in real life. The sentences are only a means for learning vocabulary and grammar. But nonetheless, in my opinion, it's important to thoroughly learn the model sentences. Because that's the way the mind learns the essential patterns. And it's much easier for me to learn a sentence when I can imagine myself saying it to someone.In the first ten lessons or so Pimsleur teaches only the \\"I\\" and \\"You\\" forms of verbs. Plus the present tense of \\"to be\\" (is/am/are, which in Spanish is five verb forms rather than three). These are the verb forms which one would most often use at first when visiting a foreign country, or in a business environment. (\\"Do you understand English? I don't speak Spanish. I am an American, are you Bolivean?\\") Then later on, it's only one more step to learn the other present tense forms. On the other hand, when Learning Like Crazy introduces a new verb, right away they throw all five verb forms at your (and in later lessons, some past tense forms as well). It's a bit much to absorb right away.The advantages of Pimsleur are that it's really slow and really thorough. The main disadvantage is also that it's really slow, and when one finishes all 90 lessons, one still has a somewhat small (although very useful) vocabulary. Learning Like Crazy moves at a much faster pace. At the end of the first thirty lessons of Pimsleur, one is just getting an introduction to certain past tense forms. But by about lesson fifteen, Learning Like Crazy has already taught all three of the common forms of the past tense.But as some people have commented here, for some students Learning Like Crazy may be a bit too fast.Another disadvantage of Pimsleur, as several reviewers have mentioned, is that the vocabulary and sentence patterns are somewhat formal, even when using the informal form (\\"tu\\" form) of the verb. Formal language like this would be appropriate in business or when visiting a Spanish-speaking country as a tourist. It is a little less appropriate if one is learning Spanish because one is living in a place where Spanish is spoken a whole lot (such as California). But in any case, any CD course is only a brief introduction to the language."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I have also done the major Spanish courses including Pimsleur Spanish and Rosetta Stone. Learning Spanish Like Crazy is a quich and easy method to learn Spanish. And it covers a great deal more vocabulary than Pimsleur. If I compare level 1 one of LSLC with Pimsluer Spanish it also seems that LSLC covers a lot more grammar concepts as well. Unfortunately, the people at LSLC have only finished one Level of the course. So until they have completed 3 or more levels, I cannot say which is the better of the two courses.One clear advantage that Pimsluer has it that the Pimsleur course is on its second or third revision. So they had time to find out what people did and did not like about the course and then re-record the course and get all the kinks out and make improvements.But a big plus about LSLC is that they use a learning method that helps an English speaker acquire an almost perfect Latin American accent. When people hear you speak, they will actually think that you know more Spanish than you actually do because your accent will be almost perfect. On the other hand, I am not sure if having people think you know more Spanish than you actually do is a plus or a negative.Even if you have completed all three levels of Pimsleur Spanish, I would still recommend LSLC because there is so much vocabulary and grammar that LSLC covers and Pimsleur doesn't, and vice versa. In fact, I wrote a review on Pimsleur Spanish One and compared it to some of the other leading Spanish courses and I mentioned that if you are really serious about learning how to speaking this wonderful language, then it is not a matter of \\"either ... or.\\" You really need to study with all of the major Spanish courses including FSI Spanish. That's if you can put up with FSI's tedious teaching method.I don't think it makes sense to try to compare LSLC with Rosetta Stone Spanish. Rosetta Stone spanish is an indispensable complimentary course that can be used to supplement your learning with LSLC, Pimsluer and any other big league Spanish course.I actually bought LSLC on the web site before it was made available here at Amazon. So I got the FSI Spanish courses on CD along with the LSLC CDs and live weekly Spanish tele-classes taught by a native Colombian woman. But I had to pay more at the LSLC site for the LSLC CD course in order to get the FSI Spanish CD courses. But if you are not going to take advantage of the live tele-classes and the FSI courses then save yourself some money and buy LSLC here at Amazon. To sum it all up about this course, as they say on the LSLC site \\"you won't be disappointed.\\""},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"This product has alot of potential. It starts out great, gradually taking the learner through the basics of the present tense. However, once lesson thirteen is reached the course suddenly bombards you with too much information at once. Sometimes a lesson needs to be repeated three or four times or more before you can move on. As others have mentioned, it tries to copy Pimsleur in many ways. The problem is that LSLC simply seems to copy Pimsleur's format without actually grasping and utilizing the methedology. For instance, at the end of some of LSLC's lessons they tell tell you to move on to the next lesson if eighty percent of questions have been answered correctly. This they have borrowed from Pimsleur. The problem is that with Pimsleur one can feel confident moving on because the material will be covered again and again ingraining itself in one's memory for a long time to come, and with virtually no effort; whereas with LSLC, one can almost be certain that most things in each lesson will not be covered again at all, and others may be mentioned again only briefly. This goes for grammatical concepts as well as vocabulary. All that being said, however, LSLC is still a valuable resource for the spanish learner if it is incorporated as one tool among many. For instance, if you were to follow a study plan similar to the one provided below, they would be sure to make great, and long lasting, progress in the language:1. Go through Pimsleur Spanish 12. Go through Michel Thomas Basic Spanish (8 CD set)3. Go through Pimsleur Spanish 2 (begin at the same time as step 2)4. Go through Michel Thomas Advanced5. Go through Pimsleur Spanish 3 (begin at same time as step 4)6. Repeat step 47. Go through LSLC 18. Repeat step 49. Go through LSLC 210. Repeat step 411. Go through Assimil Spanish (the old without toil if possible but the new with ease is ok too)12. Watch as much television and as many movies in spanish as possible and read everything that is of interest (the fun part)If you were to follow these steps more or less over the course of a year or so an advanced level of fluency would be inevitable.In closing, LSLC is an excellent resource for the intermediate student of spanish, that is, someone with basic understanding of spanish grammar and vocabulary, and if used in conjunction with other resources it can be an invaluable tool. Under these circumstances, I wholeheartedly recommend the product! By the way, I am in no way affiliated with any of the products or manufacturers mentioned in this review."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I'm just about to move on to Level 2 and can say I'm a fan. There's still a ways to go but I'm catching a surprising amount of overheard conversations and Spanish TV. This approach works. I even recently caught much of the gist of a video of a Cuban-American speaking. And Cuban Spanish is spoken at warp speed. :)While I recommend the course, there are a couple of cautions I think.- It is a \\"fast\\" course.Meaning, I tried the \\"light\\" edition of Pimsleur and was bored out of my mind in two lessons. To be fair, I have some previous background in Spanish though it was more the \\"where's the bathroom\\" level. LLC moves. For someone with no background at all, this maybe could be frustrating.But the point is to repeat until you reach at least 80% proficiency with the lesson. Sometimes this can be tedious and boring. I ended up moving on to the next lesson and at least just listening. Just to do something different. Then back up and make another pass. It's working for me.If you're feeling uncertain, buy the \\"light\\" editions of LLC (Learning Spanish Like Crazy Light (Spanish Edition)for example) and a similar of Pimsleur (and others if you want). Try them out before buying the full course or courses.- You need more than this.This is not a flaw of the LLC course. This is reality. You will need some written materials to work with also. Obviously, you need a Spanish-English dictionary (I like:Oxford Spanish Dictionarybut, also good are the Ultralingua products for computers, iPhones, and the like).(Tip: a lot of people start Spanish but give up, so used bookstores are overflowing with dictionaries, reference materials, and such.)I also suggest children's books. No, really. You're just starting out, keep it simple. Though I did buy the first Harry Potter book in Spanish. Haven't got to it just yet but will before long. Amazon has tons and you can search and sort by the age level.Spanish newspapers are online like pretty much all newspapers are now. Also if you live in an area (as I do in Texas) where there are large Spanish speaking populations, you can find the printed copies pretty easily.And you can probably find at least one Spanish language TV station around. Telenovelas (soap operas) are, by the way, easier to understand than the news. At least I think so.You have to attack things from several angles. Not just one. I was slogging through a news report about the space shuttle (dictionary at hand) when I connected something in LLC with the written page. It was one of those, \\"oh THAT'S what they're doing\\" moments.You may want to considerMadrigal's Magic Key to Spanish: A Creative and Proven Approach. You might be surprised how much you already know and how many words are similar across the languages. Such as:What's \\"doctor\\" in Spanish? It's \\"doctor\\".What's \\"need\\" in Spanish? It's \\"necesitar\\" which is very close to our \\"necessary\\" eh?What's \\"I need a doctor\\"? It's \\"necesito un doctor\\".Madrigal's work covers tons of words that are essentially the same or very close in both languages. Very useful.- It's a bit uneven.Meaning, for example, the speakers change throughout the course. While this exposes you to variations you're going to encounter in the real world, it's irritating at times when you're learning. Such as, there is one female speaker they used that swallows her \\"s\\" sounds too much. I have read that this is common in a number of Spanish dialects in conversational speech but can be annoying when you're trying to learn. I went in circles with indirect pronouns for a while because I was having trouble teasing out \\"los\\" from \\"lo\\" and such things. This is one of those times you need more than just the LLC course. I had to look up indirect pronouns and see what was supposed to be said then repeat the lesson a couple of times before I started hearing it.LLC isn't perfect but it is very good. It's worth the sporadic nuisances in my opinion.Some positives I like:- Emphasis on Latin American SpanishMy goal doesn't include travel to Spain. I want to talk to my neighbors (in one case, literally my neighbors as in next door). Too many courses teach \\"Castilian\\" Spanish. This has always struck me as being about as useful as teaching \\"thee\\" and \\"thou\\" in English. Okay, that has its place (and, by the way, you're wrong... I'm serious, I was wrong too) but the point here is conversational Latin American Spanish. Not a dialect of Spain that's considered \\"proper Spanish\\".- Real world examples.LLC does this very well. The model words are useful. You learn things such as \\"what time are we getting up in the morning?\\", \\"I have to wash the dishes\\", \\"it was raining yesterday\\". This is why I'm starting to actually catch on with overheard conversations. Not yet always, not yet all the way through, but the LLC course covers material you're going to hear and use all the time.Overall, I find it better than my college courses (or what I recall of them given Reagan was in office then). And, honestly, better than group classes with Berlitz (I only took the first years ago). True, classes with instructors are more interactive and you can ask questions but, also, the instructor has to divide their time between students. Private tutoring or a \\"total immersion\\" course would be really good but we're talking major dollars.Finally, I gave the course four stars because of the sometimes uneven quality of the speakers and audio. It's not terrible but there is room for improvement on the part of LLC. But I bought Levels 1 & 2 together (getting the discount) and don't have any regrets. It's a good course and it's working."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"Yes, this is a Pimsleur rip off. I own this (Volume 1 and 2), Pimsleur 1-3, and rosetta stone 1-2. Even the first track sounds like they were listening to the Pimsleur lessons while they were making the CDs :)Pimisleur is good IF.... Pimsleur teaches a more formal spanish. The Spanish that tends to be spoken in Spain. Hence the references to Casteyano as the 'dialect' in the Pimsleur series. It is still a great series, and will teach the subject well, and you will get the formality needed if you want to sound 1/2 educated.LSLC teaches you \\"street\\" spanish. In my point of view, I want to use Spanish as a healthcare provider. Therefore, I find Pimsleur and LSLC equally beneficial. Pimsleur provides an educated base so you can talk with other academics if need be, and LSLC provides a good base for communicating effectively with the patient pool in North America. (Rosetta Stone rocks too).Therefore, I would not suggest one over the other. Pimsleur teaches properness and formality, LSLC teaches laymans spanish.It seems, overall that LSLC goes a bit more in depth... the narrator begins with verb/adjective forms...So, if your learning Spanish to go to Spain, get Pimsleur's set, if you're learning Spanish to talk with most spanish speaking NORTH Americans, get LSLC (rosetta stone has a version for spain and a version for latin america)... if you're taking it as a student or academic or health proffessional, and want to be able to properly speak 'the king's' spanish, as well as communicate effectively (and not get corrected, since there are subtle differences) here in the US, get both, (and rosetta stone).Overall, they're effective and cost less than taking a college level course... or if you've just got too much $$$ burning holes in your pocket, get them and take a college course, or two :)"},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I give this product 2 stars simply because it dosen't deliver what it claims but this is a decent product for learning \\"basic\\" Spanish. You will not come off anywhere near fluency. It does get you talking basic sentences though. The highlight of this product is that you can get the FSI program for a very cheap price. There is no magic in learning a foreign language to a proficient degree of fluency. The author claimed that you would learn the \\"real Spanish that Latin Americans speak\\". I thought that the site looked like an infomercial. If it seems too good to be true then it probably is too good to be true. I was disappointed when I finished. I mastered each level and probably still could not hold a meaningful (spontaneous) conversation with a 5 year old. It is however better than most but not the best out there. Better than Pimsleur because of the price not because of the content. I do recommend you get the product to take advantage of FSI because that is what you will learn Spanish like crazy with (great marketing). Use FSI as your base study and supplement with Learning Spanish like crazy. With learning Spanish like crazy alone you will not learn Spanish like crazy unless you are a complete beginner hoping to get to a basic level. Overall decent product."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I treated myself to the download of this product from LSLC's website on Christmas Day 2004 after having worked my way through the major language learning programmes (including all 4 levels of Pimsleur - 1,2,3&Plus; - I bought them all!) I don't have a natural language learning ability, but the elements of grammar that completely threw me before on the other Spanish courses have now become clear. Yes, I do have to work at it (daily), but at last, I believe that with sustained effort I can achieve fluency. This programme was written with English speakers in mind. They know when we English speakers are going to struggle with the material and, accordingly, they certainly go over it enough times for me to \\"get it\\" without being overly repitious and boring. The most important thing for me is that Learning Spanish Like Crazy has helped restore my confidence. I will be travelling to Guatemala very soon before finally taking up residence in my beloved Spain. My only hope is that LSLC will continue the good work and bring out more advanced courses. I for one will be renewing my subscription to LSLC through their website pronto. If you want to learn Spanish, I recommend you buy this programme, you won't be disappointed.Re-review 29 July 2006. I was simply blown-away by the product. However, I recommend you not to buy LSLC until all the various parts of LSLC have been completed. Patrick Jackson at LSLC has made very many promises about when Part 2 will be released - none of which so far have been honoured. Yes, I did like all the bonuses given with this product but it was the LSLC course that I wanted most. There cannot be an excuse for taking years before part 2 is released. Very, very disappointing indeed.

But what separates this one from the rest is the focus on conversational Spanish. I don't mind learning traveler's Spanish. And I think that it is good to know traveler's Spanish but there are so many courses to choose from for learning traveler's Spanish. But this is the only course that I have found that teaches familiar style Spanish. That's what I like most about this method.Another great thing about the course is that you learn lots of useful vocabulary. Not vocabulary that you can use only at the airport on in a restaurant. But Spanish that I can put to use with my native Spanish speaking friends. By the way, I started with Pimsleur Spanish and after finishing all 3 levels I did not learn enough vocabulary from Pimsleur to hold a conversation with a 3 year old. From Pimsleur, I did learn how to order a generic beer and maybe 2 verb tenses in Spanish but not much more. With this method I learned enough vocabulary to become conversational. When I say \\"conversational\\" what I mean is that I can hold a meaningful conversation in Spanish. Something that you will not be able to accomplish if you use Pimsleur by itself.I used to have a Mexican girlfriend who did not speak English and there is no way possible that I would have been able to hold a conversation with her without the Spanish that I learned in this course.As one reviewer already pointed out, Pimsleur will not teach you how to understand regular Spanish speaking folks. Pimsleur will help you understand the Spanish speaking waiter or hotel clerk in the tourist section of a Spanish speaking country provided that the waiter or hotel clerk deliberately speaks extra slow to you. But after using Pimsleur and speaking to regular Latino folks you will not have a clue what they are saying to you. I understand that some people are not looking to learn this language to communicate with regular Latino folks and may only have plans to use Spanish to speak to hotel and restaurant workers in a tourist resort in Latin America.I am not saying that after you use this course you will be able to understand everything native speakers say to you, but I will say that this course will help you understand the Spanish of regular Latino folks better than any other method.The guy who said that the female voice was not good is apparently using the old version of the course which is not even sold any longer. I have the latest version of the course and the female speaker is the same instructor who used to teach their weekly teleclass. A very pleasant Mexican woman with excellent pronunciation. I still own the older version of the course and I did notice that in the older version of the course, the previous speaker appeared a little timid for lack of a better word.If you want to learn how to speak Spanish in order to communicate with regular Latino folks, this is the best that I have found.Here's my list of my favorite 7 products for learning Spanish that I think will help anyone who wants to learn or improve their Spanish. As you can see from many of my recommendations, I enjoy reading stories in Spanish because I believe reading stories really make the language stick in your head.1.Easy Spanish Reader w/CD-ROM: A Three-Part Text for Beginning Students (Easy Reader Series)I enjoy learning Spanish by reading because I believe reading helps make the language stick. Make sure that you get the version of this book that comes with the additional CD which contains recordings of passages from the book so that you can download them to your Ipod or mp3 player and improve your ability to understand the language when you hear someone speak it.2.Spanish Stories / Cuentos Espa&ntilde;oles (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Spanish Edition)This is my second favorite Spanish reader.3.Short Stories in Spanish: New Penguin Parallel Text (New Penguin Parallel Texts) (Spanish and English Edition)Another great book for anyone who likes to learn the language by reading.4.First Spanish Reader: A Beginner's Dual-Language Book (Beginners' Guides) (English and Spanish Edition)A very popular book for learning the language by reading that I also enjoyed immensely.5.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This fun and interactive software has been a tremendous help for me in allowing me to now master what was once the most hardest part of learning Spansih for me (learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs).6.Spanish for Reading: A Self-Instructional CourseThis book has done wonders to help my Spanish reading comprehension.7.Correct Your Spanish Blunders: How to Avoid 99% of the Common Mistakes Made by Learners of SpanishIf you are studying Spanish on your own and not with the help of a Spanish instructor, I strongly recommend that you get a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I'm giving this 5 stars not because it's perfect, but because when I compare it to the alternatives, Pimsleur, Michel Thomas, and Rosetta Stone, I have a clear preference for this one.There are two reasons why I prefer this one to Pimsleur. First, unless one is a business traveler, the content in LSLC is more appropriate to casual conversation. They stress the familiar verb forms, the vocabularly is more informal, and the situations presented are not business meetings and business lunches.The other reason is that they introduce past tense conjugation much earlier than Pimsleur. This has always been a frustration for me, because most casual conversation consists of events that have already happened (\\"What did you do this weekend?\\"... \\"I went to the movies\\", etc). But packages like Pimsleur stress the present tense conjugations almost exclusively for far too long in the series. The way LSLC mixes in past tense conjugations is far preferable.My main complaint of LSLC is that the conversations that open each lesson become too difficult too quickly; not the vocabulary, but the speed at which they're speaking, and the lack of clarity in their enunciation. Basically, they're speaking quickly and slurring together words just like a native speaker would in casual conversation, but for a beginner attempting to learn the language, it's impossible to follow without reading along with the text.And a minor nitpick is that the speakers in Pimsleur actually sound like voice actors, so they seem personable and somewhat enjoyable to listen to; on the other hand, the vocal talent here sounds comparatively unprofessional and a bit dry and cold. But still, I'd have to recommend LSLC on the basis of its content, despite the lack of polish."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"This is a good, thorough and in depth product..... but, it doesnt build off each lesson consistently throughout the program. They teach on one subject in lesson 6 and you dont hear it again until lesson 25. By then, you already forgot it. I think the best way to ,have something stick is to hear a bit of it in each lesson or at least every other lesson, but not 6 or 8 lessons down the road (when you forgot it) Its like learning a math formula in one day and not seeing it again until 60 days. 9 times out of 10 you don't even remember that formula. Theres not enough consistent reviewing of previous material in each lesson to come.Other than that, it definitely covers a lot of material and points out great cultural aspects in relation to word usage."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"In terms of content, I'd rate this product a 4. It does a good job of covering all the key grammatical points. Between LSLC 1 and 2 (total of about 35 cds), it covers about the same amount of material as LIYCS (11 cd's) and more material than BTWS 1. Key difference is that w/ the greater number of hours, it'll go into greater details through drills than LIYCS or BTWS and it seems more interactive helping u to remember stuff more. That said, for every hour of lessons, it covers much less vocab than the other two products. I've finished studying LIYCS and BTWS and this course is better. However, it provides no background on grammar so once it starts conjugating verbs, u don't really know why it was conjugated and stuff so can be confusing for total novice. The transcripts don't have any info on grammar either, unlike the other two products. The online grammar page is pretty thin and incomplete.Though can get a great deal on publisher's site with LSLC 1 and 2 plus 5 hrs of bonus lessons and FSI 3 and 4 for about $170, the product that u'll download is kinda crippled. They'll bait u w/ mp3 samples that are 192 kbps. When you actually order, the files for LSLC1 and 2 and bonuses range from 96 kbps at 22 kHz for entire LSLC 2, to some 112 kbps and a few 128 kbps at 22 kHz for LSLC 1. People here on amazon say the audio quality sounds great. To me, audio quality in BTWS and LIYCS sounded much clearer than LSLC. LSLC sounds like clear AM radio...with that hollow hissing sound when u turn up the volume...kinda hard to explain. BTWS and LIYCSsound like professionally recorded CD's. The free FSI 3 and 4 are 128 kbps at 44 kHz. The bonus video lessons downloads look like the 1.5x2\\" boxes u'd see w/ video quality worse than youtube. PDF of dialogs are about 10-12 pages per lesson, making them around 350-400 pages in total. They could have easily single spaced the pdf of transcripts to save us some paper from printing.Price wise, this product too expensive. It'd be more fair if both LSLC 1 and 2 w/ cd's were $200 total. Also, the website does itself a disservice w/ all that propoganda which makes it look like an informercial. For all the people whose pictures appears raving about it, it would seem as if their online forum would be vibrant and active. In reality, it's pretty empty with a few posters here and there. The reviews on amazing are waaay too glowing for this product, making me doubt their authenticity. However, the Free FSI 3 and 4 make LSLC worth it.5/24 addendum:In terms of equivalence:For FSI Spanish series, there is the Programmatic series and the Basic series.-FSI programmatic 1 and 2 by LSLC is a distinct course.-FSI basic (barrons and platiquemos) are a distinct course. Platiquemous divides the Basic in half so there's a total of 8 lessons from the original 4 lessons. Barrons has the first two lessons, which equals platiquemous' first 4 lessons.FSI Programmatic 1 + 2 = FSI Basic 1+2+3+4LSLC's bonus FSI 3 and 4 download are different from FSI programmatic...and don't follow their programattic 1 and 2 series..In terms of order of courses with increasing difficulty:Barron's FSI Basic 1 = plaquetimos 1/2 --> Barron's FSI 2 = plaquetimos 3/4 --> plaquetimos 5/6 = LSLC's FSI 3--> plaquetimos 7/8 = LSLC's FSI 4Because barron's only provides the first basic 1 and 2, that's why some posters have mentioned that u'd need to get the programattic II from LSLC to get the free FSI 3 and 4, or you could by plaquetimos.LSLC Spoken Spanish 1 and 2 are distinct from FSI but use same approach to teaching. LSLC's SS 2 covers up to subjunctive, which is in FSI 3. I haven't personally seen the programattic series."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I have used several means and methods attempting to learn Spanish over the last 10 years.

The pacing of the audio can be a little slow at times, but for someone who's learning Spanish for the first time it works quite well. I wouldn't recommend this as the sole Spanish program for a first time speaker, but it works well as a supplement.As a bonus, the company who produced it regularly sends out bonus audios and videos with additional lessons. Though the CDs only contain 30 lessons in volume one, we've received almost 30 bonus lessons accessible on the web."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"I felt like I should review this because as others have observed there are obviously a lot of fake reviews touting the amazing things it will do. The fact is, this product has HUGELY helped my spanish fluency. I went through Pimsleur from the local library, and that is a great program as well. I will probably do Rosetta Stone after. I have done level 1 and am finishing level 2 and also went through Barrons' Learning Medical Spanish program. This is great on verb tenses. It is a bit, but not overly predictable. Pimsleur has more inherent review, so the stuff you learn is maybe better stuck in your head. The amount of material in this far exceeds Pimsleur, and I have learned lots of verb tenses and structures. I can now speak and be understood fairly well. I have seen claims that you will be fluent and understand rapid speaking natives, and while this definitely gets you closer, I don't know when I will be able to understand rapid speakers (even with listening to TV for practice)... I think that just takes time. Fluency just takes practice and time. So, it's a great product, but its not going to make you beautiful, intelligent, or anything else magical despite some of its claims."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). This course is my favorite Spanish course and I have tried nearly all of them. What I like most about this course is that it focuses on conversational Spanish that you can use with Spanish speaking friends and Spanish speaking family members such as in-laws (or in my case future in-laws).There are other courses that are designed to teach tourist Spanish such as Pimsleur. And if your reason for learning to Spanish is to just learn enough to be able to say a few canned phrases to taxi drivers, hotel clerks, airport personnel, waiters, etc., on your next vacation then you may want to search elsewhere. The purpose of this course is to give you the tools so that you can confidently communicate in any situation you may found yourself in, as a person who has to communicate with Spanish speakers on a normal, everyday basis as opposed to someone who only has to communicate with Spanish speakers on a vacation trip.In my case, I am engaged to a native Spanish speaker from Venezuela who does speak some English but she is lot more comfortable speaking Spanish. So I have to be able to confidently communicate with her and my future in-laws in Spanish on any given topic. And this series (level 1 and 2) has given me that confidence.I also have several Spanish speaking friends who happen to be very close friends. They speak formal English just as well as I do. But when we are watching a ball game or having a cookout, they prefer to speak informal everyday Spanish. And this course has helped me more than any other course when it comes to communicating with regular Spanish speaking folks in informal, everyday situations.Another great feature of this course is that it is designed for the learner who hopes to one day achieve complete fluency. This is the only course that I have found that was designed for that purpose. The others courses that I have used such as Rossetta Stone only taught Spanish that was incredibly basic.This method will also help improve pronunciation. Not to the point where someone would confuse you for a native Spanish speaker, but your pronunciation will be good enough so that native Spanish speakers constantly compliment you on your Spanish pronunciation. I have finished both levels of this course and will be buying level 3 when it is released.And besides constantly being complimented on my pronunciation, native Spanish speakers also compliment me on my grammar. From using this series I am able to communicate in verb tenses that students of other self-study Spanish courses would not be able to.The Spanish bonuses that you get with this course from getting on their newsletter are awesome. Nearly every week the Founder of the method sends emails that teach colloquial Spanish and other tips and information about Spanish language, culture and life as an American in a Spanish speaking country. You would never find any of these extras in another Spanish course. In fact, just to learn the everyday vocabulary words that he teaches in his email messages, you would definitely have to move to a Spanish speaking country.So the pluses are as follows:1. Teaches familiar conversational Spanish as opposed to formal or tourist Spanish2. Designed for the learner who desires to someday achieve complete fluency3. This course goes way beyond the basics of Spanish4. Will help you develop a nearly perfect accent5. You are exposed to verb tenses and vocabulary words that you are not exposed to in other Spanish courses6. Lots of learning Spanish bonuses are included at their site to help you learn everyday or colloquial SpanishSo what are the minuses:1. They keep the learners or the students of this course waiting unreasonably long for the next level of the course to be released2. I would like to see more review material in the course. A great deal of Spanish is covered. At times, it can be overwhelming. You can somehow compensate for this inefficiency in the course by going back and reviewing previous lessons in the course. But this method would have been more effective if some type of review system had already been incorporated in the method. I hope they take this into consideration if they ever re-do the whole course and come out with a new version of it.To sum it all it up, if your desire to learn Spanish is to communicate with Spanish speakers on a more intimate basis and not a formal basis, and if you expect to one day become fluent in Spanish, this is a must-have Spanish course.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasant to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish.

Why spend nearly 500 dollars on an incomplete course when for around 200 (if you get the downloadable versions) you can get levels 1 and 2 of Learning Spanish Like Crazy and have a much more complete knowledge of the language.What's also nice is grammar for this course is done so in a natural way instead of being forced to look at verb charts, etc. In addition, this is a very interactive course that forces you to speak and be interactive and does so in an engaging and non tedious way. If you wish to be a good Spanish speaker then you must SPEAK all the time while you are learning and not simply be writing or clicking a mouse.The only possible downside to this course is it is all audio, which is convenient and relaxing for learning on the go, but doesn't teach spelling. To remedy this I would suggest downloading the PDF files available online for each lesson to familiarize yourself with the spelling of the language which you will learn quickly due to this being a very phonetic language.If you are extremely ungifted at language learning then Pimsleur may be a good place to start instead as it spoon feeds you the language very slowly and drills you relentlessly in a relatively pain free way. With Pimsleur, however, you will never progress to the more advanced level that this course provides."},{"Title":"Learning Spanish Like Crazy: Spoken Spanish, Vol. 1 (2 volume set)","review":"LSLC is a great product and works for me.

It's ok to be friends with white people.Peter-I like it when Libby's father wanted to give Sanatuwa land so he could stay with them. It showed that he was generous and thankful to him for saving his daughter.Jack-It was exciting and scary when the soldiers captured Libby with Fawn's family.Darlene-It was a great story. I learned that the Potawatomi had to travel a long ways when they were forced from their homes. One soldier said 'Indians should be free just like he was' and he let them go.Michelle-It was an exciting story to read. I felt sad that the Potawatomi were forced off their land.Gabrielle-It was exciting when the girl was getting dragged from that soldier. I didn't like the soldiers and felt angry at them.Frankie-I learned that the Potawatomi got kicked off the land. The white men brought smallpox disease and whiskey to the Indians and tricked them into signing treaties and giving away their land for a little money.Danielle-I liked learning about what happened to the Potawatomi Indians.Mandi-I liked the part where Sanatuwa brought Libby back to her parents.Joseph-I just liked the book because I love reading books."},{"Title":"Night of the Full Moon","review":"Up to Gloria Whelan's standard.

Agents study every letter from a publisher to see who actually handled a writer's manuscript. If they don't understand why it went to that editor instead of where it was sent, they ask. That's the kind of esoteric knowledge Mr. Herman delivers into your hands.Knowing an editor's specialty areas by reading Writer's Guide practically rolls out the red carpet for the writers I represent. It gives me the facts I need on the editors I want and provides experienced wisdom besides.Other directories repeat or simply rearrange what the publisher spokesman offers to say. Quite often that information came from someone in marketing, someone more interested in selling books to you than BUYING books from you, not an editor. Reading their &quot;press release&quot; entries to discover what they really mean is almost an art form. Mr. Herman's book reveals his professional opinion, giving a profound weight to every entry. Best of all, the editors names are in the index so I can look them up when (90% of the time) they E-Me back with nothing but their name in the letter.The only complaint I have with Writer's Guide is that it only deals with the upper echelon of publishers."},{"Title":"Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents, 1999-2000 (CD-ROM) : Who They Are!

John Kenneth Galbraith has been an economist with first-hand experience in a lot of areas: Canadian Scotch farmers, the big stock market crash, wage and price controls, post-war economic assessment of strategic bombing, post-war aid, Keynesian stimulation of economic demand, the political views of businessmen, but people who read this book are most likely to notice how fond he is of economic programs which benefit the less fortunate at the expense of those who are most comfortable with things as they are. Though published in 1994, this book praises Social Security as a miraculously successful program passed in 1935, based initially on benefits \\"at distinctly modest, even primitive levels, old age pensions\\" (p. 93), though opponents might complain. \\"An Ohio Chamber of Commerce official of strong historical bent found that similar measures had brought the fall of Rome.\\" (p. 94). Ohio??? The state and the United States are still evenly divided on which way to head politically when economic matters are paramount, but any benefit that does not increase to reflect increases in salary levels is likely to seem primitive in this century.I once studied antitrust laws for a few years, with excellent instruction from some of the top professors, but it is not surprising that this knowledge rarely brings me riches or even meaningful employment since conflicts of interest can be a bar to active involvement. As a legal topic, it is like trying to apply philosophy to promote freedom. As Galbraith puts it,\\"For liberals in this time the antitrust laws were a comprehensive economic therapy. Given any evident misuse of market power, more broadly any defective economic performance, the answer was clear: enforce the antitrust laws. This, then and later, became, on frequent occasion, the ready recourse of the devoid liberal mind.\\" (p. 48).\\"These were not repealed; they were simply not enforced. This was, save by the lawyers involved, one of the less noticed developments of the Reagan years.\\" (p. 49).Galbraith's memory of the Reagan years must have been fresh when he wrote of that triumph for the view that \\"The domestic threat was the federal government, and specifically its power of taxation as this might be used on behalf of those outside the favored community.\\" (p. 211). The surprising thing about A JOURNEY THROUGH ECONOMIC TIME by John Kenneth Galbraith is how often he can identify policies which have changed drastically in the last century. (Surtax rates went up to 65 percent on incomes over $1,000,000 in 1918. (p. 26)). Some steps even thwarted the rich hoards of previously inflated currencies.\\"The obvious solution was to diminish the regular currency outstanding by requiring the exchange of the existing notes for a smaller but functionally effective number. This, with characteristic pragmatism, the French did in the early months after the war. It had the further practical effect of denying to erstwhile black-market operators and those who had enjoyed special privileges under the collaborationist Vichy government any continuing advantage from their previous political reward; it was not wise to confess guilt by bringing in a currency hoard for exchange.\\" (p. 143).World War II was unusual in that the economics of warfare had been refined to produce as much wealth as possible for the middle class in America, as young economists who had been working in the New Deal were sure to appreciate. Galbraith was sure that his efforts controlling wages and prices had resulted in the greatest possible expansion of production.\\"As the demands of war procurement converged on the economy, there were two possible designs for enhancing return, for increasing profits. One was to raise prices; the other was to expand production. The price controls and associated wage restraints made the increase of production the only available course. Profit maximization, not a subordinate goal in wartime, was served horizontally by more production, not vertically by higher prices. Though not greatly noticed at the time, the price and wage controls had a strongly functional role in expanding wartime production.\\" (pp. 117-118).I can remember when people who did not have oil wells complained that the only way to get rich was to have an oil well, because a depletion allowance in the income tax system allowed oil well owners to keep more of the money they made. The top tax rate was over 90 percent during World War II, after having been cut by President Hoover to avoid a depression:\\"A taxpayer with an income of $5,000, a very comfortable return in those days, had his or her tax cut by two-thirds. It went from $16.88 to $5.63. Someone with $10,000, roughly the equivalent of $100,000 today, saw his tax go from $120 down to $65.\\" (p. 78).The federal budget was a few billion then. The previous war had been a significant expense, and John Kenneth Galbraith waits until Chapter 4 of this book to join with John Maynard Keynes (THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE PEACE) in an attempt to show that political views which settled in the minds of the negotiators of the Peace Treaty at the end of the Great War of 1914-1918 were an economic catastrophe. Money works best when people spend it for things they need, and most unpredictably when it is borrowed in dire distress and never repaid. \\"President Calvin Coolidge was adamant in expressing the reputable economic mood of the time: \`They hired the money, didn't they?' \\" (p. 32).\\"Besides destroying a political and economic structure that had long been in place, the war reshaped for all ensuing time the relationship between nations great and small, rich and impoverished. . . . The First World War was, indeed, rightly called the Great War; World War II was its last battle.\\" (p. 10)."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Economic Time: A Firsthand View","review":"After the first world war the old world order begin to collapse.The great powers were no longer real great powers and then a new world order begin to form.This book gives you a realistic point of view about the whole economic events after WW1 till the end of communism.Reading this book also teaches the close contact between economy and the future of earth by showing us the collapsing empires,ideas and utopias because of economy."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Economic Time: A Firsthand View","review":"Like everyone else in these days of financial alarm, I've been reading books on economics. Unfortunately much of what has been issued recently (e.g.,Panic!by Michael Lewis) appears hastily thrown together to make a quick buck, so I've turned instead to the books already on my shelf. I don't seem to have finished \\"A Journey Through Economic Time\\" when I obtained it in the '90s, and on my second attempt through, the reason became obvious.Why is is that members of certain professions seem unable to write in clear, plain and precise English? Economists, music critics, psychologists and other such quacks must all take some sort of blood oath never to write coherently, and I am flabbergasted at the accolades the late Professor Galbraith has received over the years. I suppose I could describe struggling through Professor Galbraith's turgid prose as tedious, but it's far worse than that; it's frequently painful, and I offer a few sentences as examples.\\"Even by conservatives monopoly could not systematically be defended.\\"[pg.48]Forget for the moment that in English, the adverb goes after the verb. (Galbraith doesn't write in English, so I guess the standard rules don't apply to him.) Isn't the syntax that sentence of which all wrong? (Whups! Now I'm doing it!) Here are others:\\"I here, on occasion, retrieve what I've said before.\\" [pg.52]Do I have to explain to you why \\"on occasion\\" makes no sense and is completely superfluous in that sentence? Even if the offending prepositional phrase were removed, \\"I here retrieve what I've said before,\\" would be awful. A normal person (of average intelligence or higher) would simply write, \\"As I've said before,\\" but that would be too simple for Professor Galbraith.\\"In Germany this commitment to rigorously orthodox finance was to extend into the 1930s under Chancellor Heinrich Br&uuml;ning and make even more painful the Great Depression.\\" [pg.52]\\"There is a larger point here: no more than would President George Bush sixty years later did President Hoover like a depression or recession.\\" [pg.80]\\"They had developed new national accounts -- National Income and Gross National Product, present and potential -- and thus shown what war production was possible.\\" [136]\\"That the individual in the market system so pursues self-interest the classically devout conservative must, in all faith, concede.\\" [pg.203]\\"The recollection of the Reagan presidency would not have been of its last seven fat years.\\" [pg.235]Despite its topic, this is not a difficult book. Instead, it is a painful book to read, as such awkward syntax assails the retina and makes the optic nerve nervous. Why did the late Professor Galbraith write such tortured prose? I offer the following speculation:1.) Galbraith was never able to completely abandon his native Scots farm dialect.2.) That's what passes for English among economists.3.) Galbraith actually did know English, but he chose to write in a pseudo-Elizabethan style so as to lend his books an intellectual cachet -- to try and fancy-up the language by making it awkward.I suspect this last to be accurate. By 1994, the ever-changing winds of economic thought had shifted away from his baroque advocacy of wage-and-price controls and gasoline rationing in the 1970s [pg. 193], and Galbraith was thus held in low esteem even by such liberal economists as Paul Krugman, who dismissed him as a \\"policy entrepreneur\\" and \\"media personality.\\" Attempting to write in the style of Beowulf was, I believe, Galbraith's way of trying to strike a loftier intellectual pose. (Another reviewer here called Galbraith's prose \\"elegant.\\")Even worse than the graceless syntax is how Professor Galbraith casually rewrites history if it suits his thesis that he was always right, and everything that the Republicans ever did was catastrophic to the commonweal. As everyone knows, the double-digit inflation of the late 1970s was stopped dead when Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker put a stranglehold on the money supply by raising the prime rate. But in Galbraith's version, it was instead the mischief of the Reagan administration: \\"More general in its effect was what the new administration did as to monetary policy. The latter [the later what?] . . . was tightened rigorously in 1981 and 1982.\\" [pg.216] But Volker (whose name is never mentioned) was appointed by President Carter (in August, 1979), so how was the Reagan administration responsible? Galbraith seems not to have been concerned about inflation, and he states preposterously, \\"There are also the large number living on Social Security or pensions . . . . Inflation is then less of a threat to the many with fixed incomes.\\" [pg. 237]Economists are the high priests of Mammon, and every one of them I've read is every bit as dogmatic as any of the sacred clergy. Galbraith was no exception, and he wrote no better than the laissez-faire zealots."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Economic Time: A Firsthand View","review":"&quot;On page 191 appaernetly he feels it was the &quot;perverse genius&quot; of Richard Nixon to make Americans distrust government through such actions as Watergate.&quot; Stacy Redding ..........actually i have heard several peaople atribute watergate to being a plot &quot;to make Americans distrust government.&quot; ...And it was also one of the most influencual impacts of water gate...

JKG then fastforwards over the next 8 pages to WW1. For the first half of half of the rest of the book JKG indecisively meanders between a left leaning history, mostly of the US, and his own personal experiences in government jobs and at various schools. By the second half of the book he has apparently made up his mind it is to be a story about the underprivileged and their holier than thou defenders, most notably JKG himself, against the evil ambitions of the comfortable class. An example on page 174 of a conspiracy of the comfortable class to keep the poor down with a tax cut rather than increased social spending consisted in part of the members of the State Department having a \\"Galbraith Early Warning System\\" to warn other members of the comfortable class cabal of the times when JKG was returning from India to save the country from the tax cut. On page 191 apparently he feels it was the \\"perverse genius\\" of Richard Nixon to make Americans distrust government through such actions as Watergate. The writing is unclear and confusing throughout the entire book. For example, does JKG really believe that Watergate was a plot by Nixon to get Joe Sixpack to distrust government, or does JKG just have extreme difficulty stringing a few words together into a coherent whole? I still do not know.When I began reading this I tried to think of a more pathetic attempt at a book on economics that I read in my life. After many remembrances of the many economic books that I have read I was able to think of one in which I only made it through a few chapters. In it some author I do not recall the name of used long term technical analysis to predict a global depression in the late 1980s through the 1990s. Several more chapters into the Galbraith book I changed my mind, this was worse than the book by the false profit of doom.While I feel that most economics books are woefully lacking in statistics this has to be the worse of the lot. In the rare event that there is a statistic it is more of an inept and incomplete attempt to convince the reader of something than provide actual information.On the positive side, in my exhaustive search throughout this entire tome (it is not really all that long-it just feels that way) I was able to find a single quasi interesting albeit incomplete sentence on income distribution on page 134.With writing like this how does Harvard do so well in the rankings?"},{"Title":"Magritte","review":"The catalogue for a comprehensive exhibition at the Jeu de Paume in Paris held in 2003, this book is a very good, well-documented, well-illustrated study of this ubiquitous Belgian artist who has inspired so many contemporary artists and publicists.

In 1985, as the Soviet Union was quickly approaching its high water, mark he threw caution to the wind and began a tumultuous journey that would take him through the badlands of the Iron Curtain. Plunging up the freezing Rhine in his ocean going tri-hulled yacht, wintering in Germany, and losing his American crew of two to homesickness and better job opportunities were bad enough for this one legged sailor, but Jones had an objective that he wouldn't put aside lightly. He took on a fresh crew of one, a young German boy, and set off to conquer the Danube and Eastern Europe as the first person to transnavigate Europe in an ocean going tri-hull. The Improbable Voyage is a thought provoking perspective of Central and Eastern Europe at the height of the cold war. It highlights Europe's divisiveness during this time from one of Europe's major arteries, the Danube. It is realism at its best from the heart of a spirited traveler."},{"Title":"The improbable voyage of the yacht Outward Leg into, through, and out of the heart of Europe","review":"Tristan's stories are sometimes a stretch of the imagination to visualize for some modern day river adventurers.

This story inspires one to take the same path on the Rhein/Danube voyage which is no longer quite so improbable because of the finished canal between the rivers, and the governments are not so harsh as they were in Tristan's time. This is a refreshing change from the historical/cultural books about central and eastern Europe, which are usually written by literary academics traveling under more probable circumstances, i.e. someone else tends to the details that Jones was forced to handle without large disposable funds."},{"Title":"Discover Nova Scotia Lighthouses","review":"One of the most descriptive books I've read on lighthouses.

It's relatively short and it brought some of the forts to life for me as I could see the action unfolding from the book.

We had a European hake in Marsaxloxx and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy.

However, with her former lover somewhere south of the equator, Chloe finds the charming Terry quite attractive and ponders a fling with him. Several observers watch her flirt outrageously with Terry, but the affair ends before it starts when he calmly mentions his artist spouse Heather; Chloe rejects the idea as not worth the complication.Chloe must have had a prophecy because not long afterward, someone murders Terry. Besides Heather as a suspect, Chloe is also considered a strong person of interest by Detective Flynn. Unable to sit idly by as a prime candidate and especially when Terry's estranged brother Fred arrives from Ohio planning to prove his sister-in-law, whom he never met, killed his sibling, Chloe begins investigating. She quickly learns how the brothers had a falling out over April Matasky twenty years ago and follows up by digging deeper into the suddenly caring Fred.The who-done-it is a well written combination amateur sleuth (in some ways competing sleuths between Fred and Chloe) and police procedural.

The particular lives - Antony, Paul of Thebes, Hilarion, Malchus, Martin of Tours and Benedict - are chosen as representatives of particular monastic styles from the early hermits to the monastic community, as generally envisioned today. The choice is also driven by the fact that the lives were written in Latin, which is the interest of Latin scholar and translator, Carolinne White.In her introduction, she discusses the issues of proper translation, the types of monasticism, the milieu of their lives, and the styles of the authors, the likes of Sts. Athanasius and Jerome, Sulpicius Severus and Gregory the Great. To put things in context, she also provides a brief introduction to each biography.For the Christian, however, the value of the book is the witness to the lives themselves. They are inspirational, if not almost unbelievable; so far are God's work through them so different than our own modern experience and subconsciously accepted empiricism. These are struggles with visible demons, not only seen by them, but also seen or felt by those around them. These are struggles with pagans and with heretics who mean to torture and kill them. These are struggles with the envious, who want a prophetic relationship with God without making the sacrifice.

In any story that has a plot, there has to be a problem that needs to be resolved. Therefore, it makes the story interesting when the hero gets into a fix and finds some way out of it only to be involved in another dilemma. If this were not to occur, then you would have a meaningless story and the plot would not exist. I would say that your best bet would be to buy an 'adult film' if you want no plot, but then again most of them have plots nowadays. So I suppose you would be out of luck in that department.If you have not watched or read any of InuYasha from the beginning of the series then you probably would be pretty lost by reading this book, but that's no reason to rate it as 'bad.' Not knowing the background of a story could easily ruin it for you. I have to say that I do not quite understand the comment about feeling like a monkey with AIDS???????? I guess I must be missing something here! Oh, and by the way, sitcoms are only funny when you understand the punch line being given. For example, if the funny situation or joke is about a famous person with a distinctive quirk and you know next to nothing about that person you will probably not laugh over the joke.Personally I really enjoyed watching and reading this movie. It has a whole lot of action that really gets you involved with the story. The characters bring in that extra ingredient of diversity because they all have individual personalities that work very well together. There is also some good humor in the story as well as the inevitable romance (or mushy parts). This is the kind of story I could read and watch over and over again and it would still bring a smile to my face.

The book is written by George Marlin, a long-time player in Republican Party and Conservative Party circles in New York. Marlin ran for mayor of New York City on the Conservative Party line in 1993 when Rudy Giuliani defeated David Dinkins (he got 1% of the vote).In New York State, cross-party endorsements are permitted in tabulating election returns: this enables candidates from the two major parties to accumulate additional votes on smaller party lines. This gives parties like the Conservative Party important leverage, since their philosophical strengths can be translated into votes on Election Day that can reward or punish politicians (usually Republican) who veer too far off course. The New York State Conservative Party also holds the distinction of electing one of its own, James Buckley (William's F.'s brother), to the United States Senate in 1970, defeating both the Republican and Democratic nominees in a three-way race. Prior to the formation of the Conservative Party in 1962, both the Democrats AND Republicans running statewide and locally courted the Liberal Party line and endorsement. It was this influence on the GOP by the state Liberal Party and New York's liberal establishment that so infuriated local conservatives, who were fed up with the big spending policies of Nelson Rockefeller and later, John Lindsay.Marlin's book is a fascinating grassroots look at the Conservative Party from an individual who was one of the young foot soldiers in the late 1960's (you can read about Marlin literally getting \\"roughed up\\" while working on William F. Buckley's campaign to unseat Mayor John Lindsay in 1965). The book has meticulous detail and recollection of specific events, times, and places. Marlin liberally (!) quotes from many Conservative Party veterans and current members, including Mike Long, the current chairman of the party. The result is an in-depth look not only at the building and evolution of a small band of committed, principled individuals looking to \\"make their mark\\" but also a very good historical review of New York State politics from the 1950's onward.Marlin's background as an investment banker and finance professional is clearly evident when discussing the many budgetary gimmicks and debt-accumulating policies that both New York City and New York State have engaged in these many decades. Whereas New York City had its baptism of fire in the fiscal crisis of 1975, the state government -- with larger resources (read: tax revenues) at its command -- has been able to delay and postpone the day of reckoning. Judging by the recent political fiscal mismanagement up in Albany, it appears that New York State -- like California in 2003 -- may finally be about hit the brick wall like her largest city did three decades earlier.\\"Fighting The Good Fight\\" excels in a way that other books on the conservative movement do not. Marlin spends less time discussing philosophy and the national conservative movement than he does in paying attention to the Little Guys (and Gals) who made the New York State Conservative Party what it is today. In every chapter it seems like Marlin has gone out of his way to mention some loyal party volunteers who ran for office to keep the Conservative line active in some off-year elections, or volunteers who spent long hours working on nominating petitions, or locals who lent the party funds to meet expenses. Unlike the state Liberal Party, which could count on well-heeled financial and political elites to generously drop money into their lap, the Conservative Party had to rely mostly on small contributions from many people at the grassroots. Only in later years did the Conservative Party have any benefactors of any great social or financial standing, and even then they paled in comparison to the resources that their opponents could bank on.Along with \\"Actions Speak Louder\\" by J. Daniel Mahoney (one of the 1962 founders of the New York State Conservative Party) and \\"The Unmaking Of A Mayor\\" by William F. Buckley, this is one of the must-read books in the trilogy of New York State conservative politics. Those books are important, but since they stop in the 1960's, to get a multi-decade look at the Conservative Party and New York State politics, \\"Fighting The Good Fight\\" is essential reading. If you are not a Republican or conservative, it will still offer an interesting and fascinating look at decades of New York State politics, and in particular, the fiscal follies and budget gimmicks that have plagued New York (both the city and state).In 1962, when the Conservative Party was formed, New York State had the largest population in the country. It had the largest electoral base for presidential elections. Ten years later, California surpassed New York in population. Today, Texas and Florida have surpassed New York, which is down to 4th overall in the rankings. The loss of power and prestige for a state whose population has not grown at all in four decades is frightening. If New York City and New York State are to reverse the voting done by citizen's feet, they would do well to listen to the political prescriptions offered by George Marlin and the New York State Conservative Party."},{"Title":"Fighting the Good Fight: A History of the New York Conservative Party","review":"While this new work has obvious resonance for persons of a Conservative political persusion, its appeal should transcend the National Review readership.George Marlin -- best known as the Conservative alternative to Giuliani and Dinkins in 1993 -- presents a fascinating chronicle of the unexpected rise of the Conservative movement in one of the nation's most avowedly liberal states. In the process, he provides an engaging -- albeit uni-dimensional -- history of New York politics over the past 40 years.Marlin's book -- in concert with other political works on the period -- will help future generations to understand Conservatives' formidable electoral clout in the second half of the 20th Century, even in formerly liberal, urban bastions in the Northeast. A standout work in this genre is Samuel G. Freeman's &quot;The Inheritance,&quot; published about six years ago (though regrettably out of print the last time I checked).I did downgrade Marlin's book by one notch because of a higher-than-acceptable quotient of typographical errors, especially disappointing for a Christian Brothers-educated scholar.

Sagreras Guitar Lessons: Books 1-3 (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"Having blundered through a number of guitar methods in my time (Sor, Aguado, Guiliani, etc.), I can attest to the soundness of the Sagreras' lessons. The lessons are truly progressive, and musical ideas are pursued in a manner so logically and palpably coherent that even the beginning (or self-taught) guitarist can follow them without recourse to outside guidance.Of critical importance, the Sagreras' lessons plunge the guitarist into the higher positions at an early stage, and points are hammered home in subsequent studies so that a perfectly comfortable familiarity is developed.Most of the studies have a singular beauty such that the guitarist feels compelled to continue practicing and polishing them long after they have been first successfully completed.Finally, I find the lessons so beautifully compiled and thought-out, that they successfully address technical deficiencies made evident in other more challenging studies written by Sor, and Aguado; it's easier to work-up to Sor via Sagreras than its contrary.

I am a guitar tutor and recommend it to those of my students who want to learn classical guitar.Its main strength is the large body of carefully graded music.It assumes no prior guitar knowledge (eg, Ex.1 is the 6 open strings, focussing just on right hand).There is no tablature, but I think that's appropriate for learning classical guitar music. However it could do with an introduction explaining how to read the sheet music. If you can't read music, you would do well to get someone to help you as you get started on this book. There are detailed symbols for strings and fingerings, but again they may be confusing for a beginner guitarist.

The Columbia educated runaway from San Antonio eventually wrote the original treatment (not the screenplay) for &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;. (I believe it was his sister, Francis, who actually co-wrote the screenplay with her husband, Albert Hackett.) Before that, he had served in both World Wars, his experience in the first, aboard the sunken destroyer U.S.S. Chauncey, having formed the basis for &quot;Delilah&quot;, published in January, 1941 to good reviews and high sales among men bound for the Navy. He was married to Olivia DeHavilland for five years, from 1947-1952, before a stormy divorce. That, a harsh experience in World War II, and bitter disillusionment toward Hollywood's insistence on artistic control of screenwriters, led him at the age of 55 to retire to obscurity in Richmond where he eventually died on October 20, 1991 in what once was the Confederate Soldiers' Convalescent Hospital; he was 93. According to the strangest preface ever composed, in the 1965 re-print of &quot;Delilah&quot;, despite writing incessantly and finishing the second half of &quot;Delilah&quot;, &quot;but not quite&quot;, it would likely never be published. (And, indeed, neither it nor his other two incomplete manuscripts, ever have been. The published part ends at the declaration of war by the United States on Germany in April, 1917.) In 1965, Goodrich said: &quot;If I cannot get back to [the second half of &quot;Delilah&quot;] and complete it, I shall probably burn it. I live under pressure.&quot; There is more to the book than meets the eye, it being helpful to know some detailed history of the world wars to get the best from it. (Remembering when this book was published, note how Goodrich refers in hostile terms to the Japanese Fleet, an ally in World War I.) Worth a read, especially if you are interested in warships at sea and the first or second world wars. Also check out the glowing review given the book by W.J. Cash, (! author of &quot;The Mind of the South&quot;, published in February, 1941), at the very beginning of his commencement address to the University of Texas graduating class on June 2, 1941, (reprinted in &quot;W.J. Cash: Southern Prophet&quot;, by Joseph L. Morrison, Knopf, 1967, p. 295). (Cash died strangely a month later in Mexico City and &quot;Delilah&quot; was the last book known to have been read by him.) &quot;Delilah&quot; is a strange, ghostly ride with meandering, gothic prose (or &quot;Henry Jamesian&quot; as one contemporary reviewer put it in 1941), supplying an ample feeling of an oily cacophony of machinery fused with sweat and boiling anger characteristic among sardine-like submariners cramped at sea for weeks; the whole effect is somehow worth it in the end and one questions whether &quot;Delilah&quot; is a ship, a destructive woman, or a violent, crowded age. Read the preface to the 1965 edition slowly, once before and once after reading this curious book. Then, as Goodrich said of his writing, &quot;put it away in the icebox and let it cool awhile&quot;, take it out and read parts of &quot;Delilah&quot; again."},{"Title":"Delilah","review":"Does not rate a 10 only because the 2nd half of the novel was never published.

Some of the account, when not much was going on in Phillipines (where the Delilah was), were not overly exciting, but the book in its last 70 pages or so is unputdownable. A unique and vital book, and lives up to Good Reading's tout of it as the \\"One of the most powerful American sea Stories since Moby Dick.\\""},{"Title":"Delilah","review":"This book's problem is that the central characters -- enlisted sailors in the US Navy aboard a 1917-era destroyer in the Philippines -- are brutal, ignorant, selfish, stupid men who fight and fight endlessly in bar-room brawls, engine-room brawls, etc., and it is impossible to care about them. Goodrich had the makings of a great story here -- a story like Huckleberry Finn, or the Odyssey, of men wandering by water in an alien land, tropical, hot, confusing -- and he so buries it with brainless brawling that it is lost. A key example: he has a naval landing-party, in search of hidden weapons for a nascent rebellion, proceeding along an underground river, in deep darkness in a cavern, into the unknown -- and what is the central incident in this? Greedy stupid sailors arguing over a chunk of chewing tobacco.His central \\"thoughtful\\" character, a sailor named Warrington, reports aboard Delilah with his standard sea-bag -- basically a big duffel-bag -- and we are told a little later that he is so obsessed with the life of the mind that in packing it, he left out all of his required uniforms and clothes, and filled it with books -- a fact supposedly not apparent to the crew until after he is aboard and has put the books in his locker, whereupon he is assigned new clothes and his pay docked to cover the cost. But wait a moment: anyone who has had to move a bunch of books in a bag, as I have, knows instantly two things. First, they are much, much heavier than clothes, so lifting and carrying such a large bag so full of books as to displace ALL the clothes would be very difficult, and thus very obvious to anyone watching him struggle aboard. Second, books are rectangular: their corners poke-out all around the soft cloth bag, revealing instantly that books, not clothes, are inside. You simply cannot hoist a sea-bag of books on your shoulder the way you can a sea-bag full of clothes: the weight is too great and the sharp corners cut into your muscles.When we are not being bored to death with pointless brawls, we get a lot of uninteresting philosophizing, or long digressions into side-issues. A coded telegram arrives that will send the ship on a radically different goal, and pages and pages go by before we are told, almost as an aside, what the telegrammed-orders were. This may be how sailors, rather than officers, experience life aboard ship, but to play-down these directives in this fashion is like playing-down the actions of the Gods in Homer. It is a mistake. There is some good stuff in here, but it is buried under too much that isn't worth anything.The 1965 Time Reading Program Special Edition of Delilah includes an Editor's Preface in which the author, Goodrich, explains why he never finished part 2 of this novel, nor any other book. Goodrich, who before going to college had been a sailor in the Pre-World War I US Navy, and in World War I, spent the 1920s and 1930s writing part 1, which he published in 1941 just as World War II was starting. He returned to Naval service, this time as an officer, and fought throughout World War II.His World War II experience is what derailed his writing -- but not because of shell-shock or war damage. In his own words: \\"The Second World War was a traumatic experience for me. ... I was first astonished and then troubled by a fundamental change in the men I found there compared with the kind of men I knew in Delilah. The change was so deep and so remarkable that it has made the men of Delilah obsolete.\\"Goodrich is correct: his characters are obsolete. The same reasons that caused him to abandon part 2 of the novel are reasons why we should abandon part 1. A good novel could be written about such characters -- in fact, one was: The Sand Pebbles. That novel covers the same time-period, the same Navy, the same beat-up kind of ship in the same kind of foreign land (China in the 1930s), but with far greater human understanding.In the same 1965 Time edition is an introduction by US Navy Capt. Edward Beach, author of Run Silent, Run Deep. He too sees change in the sailors of 1965 versus 1917: \\"Most of Delilah's crew would not have known what to do with a family [a wife and children back in the US] if they had one, whereas in today's Navy most of them would be doing their best to maintain a normal family relationship .... Better educated, possessed of higher personal standards, today's destroyer crew has nevertheless one great point of similarity with those rough and ready crews of [Goodrich's Delilah]: integrity.\\"Goodrich continues: \\"I came to know it was not a passing change. I saw it again in the Korean War. And my urge, literally my obsession, is to find out why this change has come about.\\"Goodrich never did figure out an answer, but I suggest it is the following. Up until the 1880s, the US Navy was essentially a corps of officers, but not a corps of sailors. Sailors were recruited from the merchant ships when war arose. Warships were basically the same technology as merchant ships, only with rows of cannons added aboard alongside the broadsides. But in the 1880s, we began to develop all-steel warships with mounted gun-turrets on the main decks. Naval ships diverged from merchant ships so much so that they no longer could be effectively manned by crews recruited on short notice. The US Navy in the Spanish-American war (1898 period) possessed the first real corps of career military sailors -- which Teddy Roosevelt took advantage of in creating and manning the Great White Fleet that sailed around the world in 1907-1909.But in those days before long-range aircraft, the only way to get men from the far-flung ships back to the US was by sea. It cost time and money. The Navy would do it for officers, but not for sailors. And thus being a professional career US Navy sailor meant a life away from the US for many years. Under such conditions, maintaining family back in the US was impossible. So the US Navy attracted as its professional sailors men who had no great desire to maintain a family, or plan to return to a life in the US. The kind of personality who would find this life attractive are the kind of men Goodrich served with. They are the kind he portrays.In World War II, a vast flood of men came into the US Navy to be sailors, men who had no intention of making the Navy their career. And after the war, commercial air-travel, and military long-range cargo and manpower aircraft, developed. Now it was no longer just the officers who could get back home again fairly frequently -- the sailors could too. Moreover, our presence in China ended with the communist victory in 1949; the Philippines became independent in 1946; Japan achieved renewed independence in 1950. No longer were American naval ships involved in maintaining overseas possessions across islands and up rivers. Simultaneously, the conditions that called-forth men like Delilah's crew (long years of isolation from home, due to lack of air-travel) disappeared, and the duties of such men in foreign lands (policing the US territory the Philippines across thousands of islands, and up the rivers of China to protect places of interest) also disappeared.This is why Delilah's men became \\"obsolete.\\" Perhaps Goodrich was too close to the events as they happened to realize their significance, but he ought to have."},{"Title":"Delilah","review":"This book won a Pulizter back in, I guess, the 20's.

It lacks scholarship."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"This book should be on your short list of &quot;must-read&quot; material.Russell Jacoby's willingness to think critically and his trust that his audience is willing to do the same inevitably result in the finest cultural and intellectual criticism available in the United States.This book is no exception and is an important read for anyone who wonders if there's a better way available to our society. Before we can answer that question, the dead wood of the last century must be cleared away.Jacoby does so by pointing out how thoroughly enervated left/liberal political and social thought has become. Jacoby's conclusion is frightening in its implications -- leftists and liberals have essentially given up on the complex task of forging a new, better future for all.In place of that utopian impulse, leftists and liberals have substituted cynicism, academic careerism and outright moral defeat. No longer certain that they can change the world, they seem intent on obscuring their total surrender to the existing sociopolitical milieu.Jacoby's book is brief, but does a great job of documenting this shift in liberal/leftist thought from ardent desire to improve society to abject acceptance of what exists. Western societies need people who are willing to think on a grand scale about how the lives of people living in those societies can be improved. What the liberal/left now offers is an incoherent insistence that nothing can be improved, that all is simply rhetorical strategies designed to perpetuate systems of dominance and subjugation.The society that is currently emerging from the turmoil of technological ferment desperately needs moral, political and intellectual leadership informed by a vision of a better future. In its current incarnation, left/liberal thought is incapable of providing that vision.The frightening thing is that this tradition is probably the only one capable of conceiving and implementing social change that would make the new technology serve us rather than the other way around. Jacoby's book is a tough-minded call to arms for those of us who aren't ready to give up on humanity and don't believe that the market place is a mechanism that necessarily best adjudicates complex social interactions and promotes the values of a humane society -- equality, justice, peace and prosperity."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Politics, as Russell Jacoby observes, has become boring. Hardly anyone talks about political ideas anymore. Where there is little talk, there is even less action. I have long believed that an effective left needs some kind of positive vision for the future. Changing society takes enormous energy and requires something more than a belief that a change &quot;is the right thing to do,&quot; or that &quot;it might do some good.&quot; This attitude leads to sporadic and half hearted efforts while those convinced they are creating a new world are capable of sustaining their passion over a lifetime while inspiring others along the way.Nevertheless, a recognition of the left's loss of faith in its ability to create a better world has been missing, curiously so since such hopes have nourished it for over two centuries. For years I could find no mention of it anywhere. So my heart was ineffably gladdened when I stumbled onto The End of Utopia, a superlative work that focuses on this issue.Russell Jacoby is a highly respected intellectual historian who made a splash a decade ago with the excellent and well received The Last Intellectuals. He is a brilliant writer with a biting wit, one of those rare people who can make the discussion of even the dullest writers interesting. His excoriation of current leftist theory is great fun. In a review in Dissent Magazine, George Scialabba commented that Jacoby is &quot;a cultural hygeinist, scouring verbal plaque and conceptual decay with his high-powered electric-sarcastic drill.&quot;Jacoby's thesis is that the left needs to be open to the possibility of utopian thinking. By utopian, Jacoby isn't referring to an attempt to create a perfect world, but that we can hope &quot;that the future could fundamentally surpass the present.&quot; His primary focus is the botch that contemporary leftist theory has become without it.He is perhaps best when reviewing multiculturism. While agreeing with the basic premise that we need to be more inclusive of racial and ethnic groups, he derides multiculturism's pretenses of radicalism. He points out that we are becoming more culturally uniform, not diverse. Everyone buys the same goods, looks at the same TV shows and movies, &quot;pursue the same activities and have the same desires -- more or less -- for success.&quot; There is, moreover, no vision inherent in multiculturism. Its efforts are primarily directed toward getting its people more power with everyone wanting &quot;a bigger piece of the same action,&quot; suggesting &quot;patronage more than revolution,&quot; leading people to specialize &quot;in marginalization to up their market value.&quot; The radical pretenses of multiculturism &quot;might be characterized as jargon attached to an air compressor.&quot; Ultimately, it assumes that the future will be like the present, only with more options.Jacoby is also deeply concerned with the left's abandonment of universal values in favor of the local and particular, the tendency to aestheticize reality and the inability to make moral judgments. This avowed relativism often makes it difficult for the left to say anything significant. Denying the objectivity of truth, leftist theorists never get to the fundamental question of &quot;what is and what should be.&quot; In short, the left never gets around to describing what sort of future we should be trying to create.No reviewer questions Jacoby's brilliance as an intellectual historian, or his astuteness in revealing inane writing, excessive theorizing and self-promotion. Still, few are receptive to promoting an openness to utopian theory either. The most common criticism hurled at Jacoby comes from the McCarthy era, when being a good intellectual required fervent anti-communism which often equated communism with whatever was going on in Nazi Germany.Yet, if there is any lesson to be gained from the great villains of the Twentieth Century, it would have to be that it is not wise to give absolute power to a single ruler, that democratic checks and balances are sound politics. The cold war engendered a herculean effort to equate totalitarianism with utopian ideas. Jacoby walks us through the history of the cold war's blackening of utopian theory, rightly observing that any connection with Nazi Germany is highly tenous and that the Stalinist moment was an aberration when viewed in the entirety of utopian ideas. Certainly, there should be little difficulty for future utopians to heed the dangers of omnipotent dicatators. It's hard to imagine any group, on the left at least, being attracted to that.Only faith in the possibility of creating a better world can create sufficient energy to compete against the relentless forces of money, power and inertia. When there is a faith in a better world, the world is young again and all things are possible. When it is dormant, as now, we find ourselves mired in a dreadful cynism. Jacoby aptly quotes Bertold Brecht at the end, &quot;Something is missing. A light has gone out. The world stripped of anticipation turns cold and grey.&quot;Ultimately, we are responsible for the world we create and no generation gets a free pass. Currently, we need emotional courage, the willingness to reincoporate a utopian vision into our thinking. Once we realize our desire for it, alternatives will begin to present themselves, and even if none existed, we would eventually will them into being. The End of Utopia is a wonderful start, well written, insightful, frequently humorous and highly recommended"},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"As a former student of Professor Jacoby at UCLA, I felt that this was a wonderful book explaining his philosophy on the fall of Utopian thinking. His knowledge on the subject comes through as clearly as it did in class. This should be a must read for anyone interested in why we no longer dream of a perfect society to exist in the future, and have become content with something that falls dramatically short of it."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Radicalism and utopian thinking have withered away, according to Jacoby, in favor of a broad consensus that the good society incorporates a welfare state, a decentralized power structure, a mixed economy, and political pluralism. The collapse of Communism eviscerated radicalism and enfeebled liberalism, removing its vitality and its backbone. He would like to see a rejuvenated utopianism that would provide models of a radically different and better society, but he is never remotely specific about what he means by that, blithering about vague &quot;possibilities of freedom and pleasure hardly tapped&quot; and similar piffle. Mostly, I think, he wants to see a rejuvenated liberalism. He does not seem to notice that the consensual good society he describes is mostly a product of a successful liberal agenda; really new ideas by definition would have to go in some different direction.He takes on the multiculturalists and obscurantist intellectuals without mercy, and those chapters are well-written and fun to read. But when, in the final chapter of the book, he tries to sum up his argument for utopianism and why the idea has receded from public discussion and intellectual discourse everything falls apart. He does not find it plausible that the general disenchantment with utopian thinking is the result of humanity's miserable experience with it in practice during the 20th Century. He conveniently defines Nazism as outside the utopian tradition, which is debatable, and I suppose he'd do the same arabesque with respect to the societal vision of the Islamist fundamentalists. That won't work for Communism, of course, a problem he solves by simply not talking about it and the 100 million or so deaths it caused. He insists on comparing the perfection of utopian fantasies with the faults of actually-existing societies: &quot;[Thomas More's] sketch of the future, now almost five centuries old, still stands light-years ahead of advanced industrial civilization.&quot; Amazing stuff. His notion of what constitutes a utopian project is ideological and myopic. Why isn't the spread of liberal democracy to oppressed peoples a worthy utopian project? Finally, his version of utopian thinking seems to admit only his own standard-issue liberal methodologies; nowhere is there any acknowledgment of the possibility of free-market approaches to societal improvement or transformation.An often entertaining read through a badly flawed argument."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Jacoby is at his best in in The End of Utopia, which could be read along with his earlier work The Last Intellectuals. Few authors reach the understanding of contemporary society as does Jacoby!"},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Liberalism is unable to satisfy the urge for something higher, the search for meaning, because it fails to recognize the necessity of maintaining a faith in possibilities. The recurring problem of liberal politics is that it fails to go far enough, that it is afraid to cast judgment on any subject matter. By deeming everything relative, we sacrifice the ability to hope for more since we are unable to deem any idea as superior to another. The section that is weakest here is that of &quot;Thick aestheticism and thin nativism.&quot; But the biting commentary and insight elsewhere make up for this dense chapter. Jacoby implores leftist liberals to seek more, to become capable of action and do more than concede to others' opinions. His attack on multiculturalism as ultimately reducing the variety of culture and replacing this diversity with a monolithic, superficial culture is well taken. This book is well worth reading as it unites both a cynicism with the present politics with the utopian demand for higher expectations. We should not be content with the status quo, we should strive for more. Without dreams of what may be possible, deterioration from our already shallow public discourse seems inevitable."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Russell is adept in his honesty that most the writers of the &quot;left&quot; have bent to the mainstream ideology as they toss token ideas into the mill."},{"Title":"The End Of Utopia: Politics And Culture In An Age Of Apathy","review":"Jacoby makes some great observations about the quackery,muddle-headedness and sheer silliness of much of academic writing and thinking.He scores some good points criticising our current political and cultural malaise.Where he goes fatally wrong is where the never-had-a-proper-job-and-thus-divorced-from-the-real-world hard Leftists and idle dreamers always go wrong:that the idea and hope of Utopia will bring us some vaguely defined golden future.The 20th century horrors of Communism and Fascism-the products of fuzzy-brained,feel-good nonsense,mythmaking and deep denial of anything you might call reality-ought to have burned into our brains the hard truth that society cannot be engineered into a state of perfection simply because nothing that man devises can ever be perfect.To ascribe ourselves the power of Godhood is pure megalomania and stupid to the point of suicidal.The utopian swindle got 100,000,000 plus people killed in the 20th century.Don't be surprised if the next wave of Utopianistic thinking and the blind,ignorant faith inherent to it,repeats the carnage."},{"Title":"House & garden cookbook","review":"I purchased this book during a search for a game recipe.

I'm not typically a sucker for romances -- I don't watch cheesy Julia Roberts movies, no Harlequin novels, nothing of that sort. But, I must say, this one was very touching. I think it is because the writing is so well done, the characters so beautifully developed, that the love story just became an added bonus. I also treasured the exotic locales McPhee takes the reader to -- from Spain to Greece to Italy to southern France; it made me want to jump on the next plane and experience these places for myself. I knew when I first picked up this book that there would be some connection to 9/11, and I was a bit concerned on how that would be dealt with. I needn't have worried. McPhee handles this delicate event with the sensitivity of a native New Yorker. It was subtle, but always lurking below the surface. I think it is the subtleties of this novel that make it so remarkable. The story is told in such a unique way, not linear at all. In fact, it almost \\"swirled,\\" returning again and again to scenes as it slowly moved forward and back through time. I highly recommend this novel for just about anyone."},{"Title":"L'America","review":"The only thing I knew about L'America before reading it was the underpinning of September 11th, which is handled so delicately and held at such a distance that it simply (yet powerfully) serves to remind us of the fraility of life, the illusive nature of fate, and the extraordinary depth of lives lived by \\"ordinary\\" people. \\"By you,\\" you can almost hear McPhee whispering into your ear. And even if you haven't been to Italy, made love in a public park beneath a towering Pine tree, or gave up love for the sake of independence (or vice versa), by the end of this book you'll remember your own coming-of-age with just as much intensity as Cesare's and Beth's (the book's main characters). In fact, the author's talents as a writer surpass her exquisite scene and character development (both of which are superb) in her ability to expose the universal experience of intimacy (love, loss, life, death) while writing with such artful precision that this centuries' old tale about a love affair wrought with the naivete and willfulness of youth feels like a first...just as it does when lived through in life. I also enjoyed the moments of recollection that came with the wisdom and resignation of age allowing the author, literally, to catch the reader reading personal experiences into the pages. At just the right moments McPhee subtly encourages you to stop and reflect, recognize even, the life-defining choices that make us who we are...or, as L'America often eludes, understand who we've been along. Universal, yet intimate, and ultimately, brilliant!!"},{"Title":"L'America","review":"A facinating look at the lives of two lovers through the years, their stories gradually revealed in their and other various characters' voices interwoven throughout the novel.

The readers have to work through all the mire of information about the characters' lives which didn't interest me enough to finish the book. There are very few books that I have left unfinished but I am sorry to say I just couldn't go on."},{"Title":"L'America","review":"Spoilers Ahead!Martha McPhee's L'America is so much more than an epic and immortal love story between a naive American girl and a sensual Italian boy. The novel is also a strangely beautiful deference to art, food, intimacy and the ineffable transatlantic bond between the old world and the new, where the age-old traditionalism of Italy meets the noisy modernism of America.When Beth and Cesare meet one untroubled summer on the small Greek Island of Paros \\"floating in the Aegean like a song\\", little do they know their affair will last for almost two decades, transcending their families and their respective cultures. The attraction is instant, the love between them a formidable force, \\"the draw, the pull, the urgency behind the love - the desire to conquer the impossible.\\"Beth is only 18 years old, when she takes off to Europe with her best friend Silvia. Their trip brings them to Greece where the blond and blue-eyed Beth meets the dark and swarthy Cesare on some steps leading up to a whitewashed pensione. His eyes lock onto her for an instant only, but long enough for her to feel a shock, a job, and a stab \\"and then nothing was the same.\\"Cesare Cellini is from Citts, a small rich town nestled into the foothills of the Alps, famous for it's industry of socks and shoes. His moneyed family is resolutely embedded in the old-world, with five and twenty generations behind them. For Cesare, Beth represents a refreshing change - almost like \\"a prism, always reflecting new light.\\"Cesare's other Italian girlfriends have always known their path, but Beth is so different, so young, and modern and carefree; they speak about everything and anything, each one comfortable, eager to unfold to the exclusion of all others. From the beginning, however, there's a real sense that this couple will have to fight to stay together, it's as though their time cannot last.Claire, Beth's mother died in a car crash in Turkey when Beth was three, and her unconventional father raised her on a Pennsylvanian hippie commune. As a little girl, she was sent to New York to live with her status conscious grandmother, \\"a self-confessed opera buff and patron of the Met.\\" Yet Beth constantly fights to free herself from the strictures of her youth, and it comes as no surprise that when she falls in love Italy, the whole experience makes her eager, anxious and giddy.Beth will never be accepted into Cesare's self-important and conservative family. She tries to get him to come to America - and for one year he actually does - but his life back in Italy has already been decided for him and he cannot humiliate his family. This is from a man who grew up dreaming of the big roads of America \\"of which Simon and Garfunkel sang - a place where people did what they chose and anyone could become anything.\\"McPhee exquisitely moves her characters backwards and forwards in time - from the early 1970's to 2017 - the climax coming at the beginning of the novel, when Beth ultimately loses her life in the World Trade Center on 9/11. It's a shocking revelation, because for most of their lives, Cesare and Beth have been reinforced by a shared adversity, forever joined in mutual respect.Together, Cesare and Beth are buoyed by abundance and risk, experimentation and discovery, yet they seem to be incapable of transcending the strictures of their respective countries and actually forging out a life together. She falls sweetly, deeply and permanently for him, whilst he loves her for her lack of sophistication and style, \\"she is the Stature of Liberty, he's the Roman Empire.\\"As with all tragic love stories, stubbornness and selfishness eventually derails the relationship. She wants him to give America a try, to construct his own life, separate from the life being handed to him by his family, whilst he cannot escape the guilt and laziness of having his life decided for him. It doesn't help that Cesare begins to see America as filthy, a place filled with \\"smokestacks and fuel tanks,\\" the air thick with smells, \\"and of strip towns with drive thu-just-about-anything, seedy hotels and lonely phone booths on long lonely roads.\\"In the long run, Beth returns to America and becomes an entrepreneur, fired up by her ambitious nature, the beauty of exotic food and her innate talent for cooking. Cesare becomes a rich and prominent citizen of Citts and he lends money, just as his father did and his father's father did. Both of them eventually drift into other marriages and relationships, their connection to each other tempered by occasion and by experience.L'America is a compelling story of love and its victory over time and how love can unpredictably steal from death. The novel is also is a heart-wrenching portrait of a young couple's private passions, obsessions and immense appetite for life - Beth and Cesare's tragic love does indeed transcend time and place, and is ultimately immortalized forever.When Cesare finally learns of Beth's death via an email, he must finally grapple with his feelings and admit, once and for all, that she really was his one great and true love.
