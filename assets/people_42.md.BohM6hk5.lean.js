I found Steinbeck's observations of the American life in 1960 dramatic, yet the problems described are not very different from today's. The main character, Ethan Allen Hawley is a very difficult who lives in an anguished status in this contemporary world. He is deeply committed to his ancestral inheritance and his wife and children,he values honesty and morality, yet betrays his best friend to achieve what some of the important town folks have achieved, status and money. Ethan's change from observer to player energizes him, but in the end it is his son's fraud that breaks Ethan."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I very much enjoy John Steinbeck's novels. This one disappointed me somewhat, I couldn't get into the main character, maybe too American for me to understand and feel comfortable with. I will go back to it at a later date."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck has with this book achieved a rare feat. He has conclusively demonstrated the impossibility of creating material success in a capitalist system and at the same time having sound morals. Ethan realises that his cotownees are unwilling and unable to recognise the all-pervasive, evil American values preventing them from being better people. This saddens and frustrates him. His challenge is to find a way to retain his integrity while accommodating the desires of his family and the expectations of the capitalist system he finds so oppressive. He cunningly nearly achieves this, with little compromise, though he saw his friend from school-days as a casualty of his actions. In the end he feels his conscience is sullied, leaving any future for him fatally devalued, in his eyes. No wonder so many Americans didn't like it. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"After reading Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, and The Pearl in high school, I was not an admirer of Steinbeck, but when I picked up The Winter of Our Discontent as an adult, I was awed by the author I had once shunned. Steinbeck's keen sense of character and a mastery of the language carries this novel from first page to last. The story revolves around Ethan Hawley, a descendent of proud New England stock whose life seems betrayed by circumstances as he struggles to provide for his family. His wife Mary urges him to be more ambitious, and his restless teenage children exhibit signs of being morally corrupt. When Ethan decides that his ethics no longer matter in this demanding world, he enters his own compounding crisis.In perfectly rendered language, Steinbeck explores the themes of two Americas - the old Puritanical and morally staid one, and the one where every man fights for himself. The corruption in New Baytown is rampant. Issues about privilege and entitlement, family values, skewed priorities, flagging morality, and work ethics simmer underneath. Steinbeck's depiction of Ethan and Mary's marriage is witty, biting, and affectionate, demonstrating both his humor and his talent for dissecting domestic issues as well as the grander, social ones.A fine novel by a recently underappreciated author, The Winter of Our Discontent is worth every minute spent with it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"To any of you who are considering reading this book, the following points may be helpful:* Of all the Steinbeck novels I've read, I consider this one to be his wittiest, funniest and most intelligent. The dialogue is great and the main character (Ethan Allen Hawley) may be my favorite Steinbeck character of all-time.* This book focuses on thought rather than plot. We are taken on detailed journeys through Ethan Hawley's mind (in fact, some of the chapters of this book are written in the first-person rather than the third-person, such that Hawley speaks to us directly). What we are shown are the motives and means through which a conscientious human being trades a life of good deeds for a life of deception and acquisitiveness, and the result is jarring.* As indicated above, however, this book is NOT plot-driven. Therefore, some readers may not like it as much as, say, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot;. Do yourselves a favor and read the first page or two of the book before buying it. If you are drawn into the dialogue on these pages, you'll probably love the book - it represents the general tone of the novel throughout, though toward the end the book gets much darker as Ethan's abandonment of his morals and the consequences thereof are driven home to the reader.This truly great novel will stick with the reader long after the last page has been turned. Read it - I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\\"The Winter of our Discontent\\" was published in 1961, just before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in 1962. The story is set in the late 1950s in New Baytown, a small (fictitious) New York -New England town which, Steinbeck tells us, had flourished during the whaling days of the mid-19th century. The main protagonist of the book is Ethan Allen Hawley. Ethan (\\"eth\\" to his friends is descended from early pirates and whaling captains. His family had lost its capital through speculative business ventures during WW II and Ethan, with has backround and his Harvard education, is reduced to working as a clerk in a small grocery store he once owned. Marullo, an Italian immigrant, owns the store and calls Ethan \\"kid\\".For a short novel, the book includes a wealth of characters, many of which I found well described. There is Ethan's wife Mary who is impatient with the family's impoverished lots and eager for Ethan's economic success as well as the couple's two children, Allen, who is writing an essay called \\"Why I Love America\\" and the sexually precocious daughter Ellen. We meet the town banker, Mr. Baker, a bank clerk and a friend of Ethan's, Margie Young-Hunt, twice married and the town seductress, and Danny Taylor, Ethan's childhood friend who has thrown away a career of promise and become a drunk.The book describes the deteriorations of Ethan's life as he gradually loses his integrity and succumbs to temptations to lift his life, and the lives of his family members, from its materially humble state to a state consistent with Ethan's felt family heritage and education and with the desire of his family for material comfort. The story is sad and told in a style mixing irony and ambiguity that requires the reader to reflect and dig into what is happening. The story ends on a highly ambiguous note with Ethan's future left in doubt.The book describes well the lessening of American standards and values. The book seems to attribute the loss to an increasing passion for commercial and economic success among all people in the United States. Juxtaposed with the economic struggle are pictures of, in steinbeck's view, what America was and what it could struggle to be. I think the images are found in religion (much of the story is, importantly, set around Good Friday and Easter and these holidays figure preminently in the book), and in America's political and cultural heritage. In the old town ofNew Baytown, America's history figures prominently with speeches from American statesment such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Abraham Lincoln tucked (suggestively) in the family attic. The book is set against a backround of New England whaling and reminds the reader inevitably of a culture that produced Melville and a work of the caliber of Moby Dick.The most convincing scenes of the book for me were those where Ethan ruminates his life in his own mind and compulsively walks the streets of New Baytown at night. I was reminded of Robert Frost, a poet of New England and his poem \\"Acquainted with the Night\\" which begins:\\"I have been one acquainted with the night.I have walked out in rain -- and back in rain.I have outwalked the furthest city light.\\"Steinbeck captures much of the spirit of this wonderful poem.The plot of the book seems contrived at is climax and depends too much on coincidence. The characters, and their inward reflections on themselves, the descriptions, the setting, and the theme of the book, mingled between a love for our country and a sense of despair, make the book memorable."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a frightening book, with more real horror than ten of the standard fare. By detailing one man's sliding morals, it holds up a mirror to everyone, as we all have faced similar decisions between doing what is right and doing what is convenient. And facing ourselves can be truly horrifying -- especially whenthe collective result of everyone's decisions is clearly evident in the ethical morass of today's world, from a President trying to re-formulate the English language to the Enron financial fiasco to wide-spread cheating on exams at our military academies.For this novel Steinbeck decided to remove himself from his normal California setting in favor of the East Coast. By doing so he availed himself of a milieu where tradition and 'old money' set the standards for acceptance into 'society'. Ethan Hawley is a man whose family used to be part of that 'society', but due to bad financial decisions he now finds himself clerking for an immigrant who owns the grocery store he himself used to own. With a wife quietly but constantly chiding him about her desires for a better life, to be able to hold her head up in society, and two kids constantly clamoring for more things, Ethan finds himself at a crossroads between a rigid moral code instilled in him by his aunt and grandfather, and providing a better life for those he loves.Told partially in first person in spare but very effective prose, the road that Ethan spirals down is brilliantly portrayed, from his 'sermons' to the groceries, to his internal 'conversations' with his grandfather, to the seemingly chance happenings and conversations in his little town that spawns an idea and method for robbing the local bank, to his 'dropping a dime' on his immigrant boss, to his betrayal of his alcoholic friend Danny. Each action and decision proceeds logically from the previous one, each one more step down a path with no end, a path which Ethan continues to tell himself that he can abandon with no lingering aftereffects at any time. Each point is meticulously plotted, with all the proper items set in place before the action, and the choice of time, setting, and materials is rich in irony, a sure mark of an author fully in control of his subject.The ending is deliberately ambiguous. By the time I reached that point I had been so drawn into Ethan's character I found that his final decision was tremendously important to me. Each reader ultimately must draw his own conclusion about what Ethan will do, but regardless of what answer the reader reaches, no reader can remain unaffected by this book, and will find his life richer for having read it.Steinbeck was one of the great American writers. His Nobel prize was richly deserved, and this book, while not as well known as his Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, is certainly one of the reasons why, rivaling his other works in power and insightful looks at American society, just as valid today as when it was written, and peopled by a very living set of characters."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is amazing in a very specific and unusual way. It chronicles the slow slide, not to the depths of immorality that come to mind when we use that term, but merely to one step down on the morality ladder. There is not a mountain of difference between the man on page one and the man who stands on the beach on the final page, contemplating suicide. He has committed no crime, has resisted cheating on his wife, and has tried to save the life of his drug-addicted friend... the tiny difference lies not in the things he hasn't done wrong, but in the things he didn't do quite right. This difference is all the difference in the world. Steinbeck's power is in his portrayal of the nuances that make up personal experience. Where Grapes of Wrath was a powerful epic, the depths of poverty the characters endured enabled us to keep the experience at a distance, since few of us will ever know such poverty. The Winter of Our Discontent allows us no such respite. Each of us experiences temptation on a daily basis, and the risk of moral poverty that we all face and either resist or become accustomed to, is at the heart of this book. The final page is, oddly enough, a mystery, though this fact can easily escape you. All the members of my family read this independently, and only when we discussed it several years later did we find that we each had interpreted the end in different ways. Does he commit suicide or not? We were firmly split, and the wording Steinbeck uses is ambiguous. The answer is in the story that emerges from you as you read the book. Perhaps the most subtly powerful book you will ever read, if you are willing to allow it to affect you."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I liked this Steinbeck offering. I liked the fact that it's about small town morality, and ultimately society's morals too. The narrative raises questions about our attitudes towards the mundane and the everyday humdrum things like friendship, honesty, ambition, deception, fidelity, sex, family, avarice, petty corruption and to those of us who fall between the cracks.Okay, so that may sound very traditional and staid, perhaps it isn't sexy enough, but that's exactly why I admire Steinbeck's work. He writes about the real and our day-to-day lives and in this novel he highlights questions of morality through the story of failed businessman Ethan Hawley and New Baytown in late '50s early '60s America.I found it a compelling read, it wasn't an obvious story to tell and so I never really knew where the story was going to turn. It grabbed me with some clever structure and brilliant characterisation. I was particularly struck by the finely observed relationship between that of the protagonist and of his wife Mary, \\"My Mary\\".Steinbeck's power for social realism shone out, describing the life of New Baytown and its occupants in minute detail and through it showing the quiet nobility of ordinary working people. It reminded me strongly of similar evocations in his masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath.This is a quirky and deceptively well-written book, with snappy dialogue, memorable characters and an intellectual seriousness lying behind the seemingly innocuous events. Recommended."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As social commentary on the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot; as it manifested itself in small towns in the coastal U.S. this is as good as it gets. In stunning prose and articulate style, we are taken into the world of the mind of a man who was born into a world where he never felt he belonged. Upon returning home after becoming a decorated war hero, the protagonist discovers that running the family businesses is a different ballgame. After losing the &quot;family farm&quot; but keeping the house, this Ivy league literature graduate pines away tending shop for a successful Italian immigrant-entrepreneur. Then one day he snaps and the story really begins. Having taught several classes on political science and political economy, I can honestly say this is one of the best expositions of the pervasive power of capitalism to drive a good man to do &quot;ruthless&quot; things. Never black and white, Steinbeck portrays an endless array of ethical dilemmas while keeping a nail-biting dramatic tension throughout. To the reader who chooses to put oneself in the character's shoes, there is much to be gained from an honest reading of this slim volume. I can see why the Nobel committee considered this book to have put him over the top in earning the prize in 1961"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Nobel Prize committee mentioned THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in awarding the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature to Steinbeck--and in so doing touched off a critical backlash against both the novel and Steinbeck's entire body of work. The novel had not been popular with American critics or American readers, and the author was savagely attacked as \\"past it,\\" his current works dismissed as irrelevant and his earlier works as overrated. Steinbeck was so humilated that he did not publish another novel in his lifetime.Part of critical reaction was due to the novel's structure, which jumps from third person to first person narrative and from character to character in an extremely jarring manner--and which in terms of plot seems prepared to run off in a dozen different directions but never actually does. But it may be more accurate to say that the bedrock of critical animosity was the nature of the story itself: an unflattering tale of America at its most hypocritical and corrupt. Given the tenor of the times, it was not a portrait that American critics or the reading public cared to embrace.Ethan Hawley is a descendent of a notable New England shipping family--but the advent of petroleum products destroyed the whaling industry and the family fortune declined. As the novel opens, Ethan is a clerk in the very grocery store he once owned. His wife Betty loves him, but is embarrassed for him; his two children, hungry for the luxuries of the small town upper class, are less discreet in their sentiments. At least Ethan has the satisfaction of knowing that he is a man of integrity ... but one day, for no significant reason at all, his eyes are suddenly opened to the truth. He can have it all. But there is a price to pay: his conscience.Steinbeck's works frequently deal with the struggle between personal integrity and worldly success, but THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT is quite unlike his other works, for instead of painting the battle in broad strokes Steinbeck explores a gray area that gradually darkens to black--and suddenly ends the novel on a slightly ambiguous note, leaving the reader to wonder if Ethan will fight his way out of the darkness or merely strive to protect his family from knowledge of it.Perhaps more so than other Steinbeck novel, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT requires a careful reading. Yes, the structure is jarring, and yes the plot seems to run hither and yon, but at the same time these elements actually mirror the disconnected nature of the characters in a way that becomes increasingly disconcerting as the book progresses. And while there is no doubt that the book is deeply flawed, there is no denying the author's power, a power that seems to arise as much from his failings as from his virtues. As always, Steinbeck takes great risks in his work, and part of the pleasure in reading one of his novels is in seeing how well the gamble pays off.I would not place THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in the first rank of Steinbeck novels--but it certainly did not deserve the scorn heaped upon it in the early 1960s and which continues, to a certain extent, to dog it to this very day. Memorable, provocative, powerful, and recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If I had never read so many of his other works, I would probably rate this fine classic five stars. I rate it just under four and a half stars solely because I don't think it quite compares to \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". These are times in which I wish Amazon had a ten point scale rating system instead of five. How can I honestly give this novel the same rating as the two above referenced classics? Yet, please don't get wrong, I did thoroughly enjoy this book, especially the second half. What I love most about Steinbeck is that he is truly an American through and through. Which makes him very easy for me, an American, to identify with. I also enjoy the fact that he was an artist that lived among the people (just like, and arguably even more so than Mr. Hemingway). This is a very attractive trait, in my opinion, when it comes to writing the dialogue between the characters. Steinbeck has the language and the mannerisms of the common man down to a tee.Three quotes I would like to add here. The first quote, will be the best I can think of when it comes to defining the story of Steinbeck's hero in the novel - Ethan Hawley. The second two quotes are two of my personal favorites from this novel, while they also aid in re-defining the book's main message.\\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\" Mark 8:36\\"Any man of reasonable intelligence can make money if that's what he wants. Mostly it's women or clothes or admiration he really wants and they deflect him. The great artists of finance like Morgan and Rockefeller weren't deflected. They wanted and got money, just simple money. What they did with it afterward is another matter.\\" (p. 45)\\"Strength and success - they are above morality, above criticism. It seems, then, that it is not what you do, but how you do it and what you call it. Is there a check in men, deep in them, that stops or punishes? There doesn't seem to be. The only punishment is failure. In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught.\\" (p. 187)I am huge Steinbeck fan, and I have read quite a bit of his work. In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", he has definitely created in Ethan Hawley a main character that I myself can relate with like none other. I have just become a husband and father. I work in the world of real estate (not as a broker or agent) in the Silicon Valley in Northern California (a.k.a. hades, everlasting fire, nether world, etc...) where attempting to be a man of morality, a man with principals and ethics, is not very easy to say the least. Especially when you are the only breadwinner and you live in one of the most expensive towns. Like Ethan, I am plagued daily by temptations that could easily make me richer and 'more successful' such as kick backs, black mail, cougar women (i.e. Margie Young-Hunt), shady deals, etc... yet, so far, I have been able to hold my ground. For those of you who haven't read this fine novel, that is what you must now find out for yourself. Will Ethan, after years upon years of being Mr. Nice Guy, a man who is going nowhere fast as a grocery clerk, a man that can barely manage to make ends meet for his family, will Ethan finally throw in the towel and join them? God knows he has the pedigree, the smarts, the wherewithal to be a success, the question is whether or not he wants to sell his soul to do so.Fans of Steinbeck's I can assure you that you will find this novel more enjoyable as long as you don't have the expectations of it being in the same league as those two above referenced classics. I still easily put this in my top ten favorites of all his work. My two only knocks (which are in no way a deterrent for reading this) are one, the lack of character development for everyone but Ethan and Margie, you really only get to know the other characters on more of a superficial, less than penetrating level. Which was a bit disheartening, because I really wanted to get to know some of these people more than he allowed me to. The other knock is that much of the book's plot was a bit too transparent for me. I was almost able to forecast everything that was going to transpire in the novel after reading the first forty pages. However, those are two very minor distasteful details when you consider who the author is. John Steinbeck could write a story about professional fly swatters stranded in a desert and still make it interesting. So I hope you all enjoy another little treasure from one of America's greatest twentieth century writers and definitely one of my personal favorites. Damn it! I really want to give this five stars!ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"i had a modern american literature class this last semester and our prof gave us a choice of four steinbeck novels: grapes of wrath, east of eden, travels with charlie, and the winter of our discontent. i chose 'the winter of our discontent' and i was so glad i did. this is one of the finest examples of american literature i've ever read.the novel itself starts out a bit slowly and i was afraid i wouldn't enjoy the novel. it's only in chapter four that steinbeck really hits his stride and shows why he's one of the crown jewels of american literature. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but trust me, the prose is absolutely rapturous. i found myself constantly underlining sentences and paragraphs. pound for pound, steinbeck rivals oscar wilde in clever witticisms and aphorisms.on the surface, yes, 'the winter of our discontent' is a novel about a middle-agend man coming to terms with the new american lifestyle and its accompanying materialism, but it's much more than that. it's a novel about family, love, morality, temptation, corruption, death and ultimately about life, and how our lives are infinitely connected, one to another. like most great literature, we're able to see ourselves in the book's characters.unfortunately we live in an era where 'hip' writers (like david eggers) receive undue attention. consequently, american literature seems to have taken a few steps backwards in quality. not too many of our modern day writers really know how to *write.* fortunately, we still have steinbeck to show us what's right about our literary past and show us what quality literature looks like--there's a reason the man won a nobel prize."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Wonderful story!

I don't believe there was such a degeneration, I believe this is the way humans have always been.Regardless, Steinbeck never passes on the opportunity to teach us something about ourselves. These lessons range from insightful domestic truths to bigger, more easily identifiable truths about what motivates us to make our decisions. He doesn't allow his readers to rationalize or gloss over Ethan Hawley's decisions despite Ethan's own attempts to do just that.His grasp of different characters make me smile as I relate to myself and the people I love, and the dialogue between these characters is witty and more fast-paced than any Steinbeck book I can remember.Some gems:\\"No one wants advice--only corroboration.\\"\\"In poverty she is envious. In riches she may be a snob. Money does not change the sickness, only the symptoms.\\"\\"She gave the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her.\\"\\"You wouldn't be so worried with what folk think about you if you could know how seldom they do.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel of the financial struggle of one man's family was written in the late 1950's, but it is even more relevant today as it details the Hawley family, once a pillar of society in their Long Island community. But now the family's breadwinner is reduced in status to a grocery clerk: sweeping floors, stocking shelves, waiting on impatient customers, while he attempts to feed his family of four. It is hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck. In a town rife with corrupt politicians, bankers, businessmen, and citizens, Ethan struggles to maintain his honesty as he sees others become rich through dishonest means. He decides to abandon his honesty policy and puts several plans of action into motion: taking a bribe, ratting out the store's owner to the Department of Immigration, taking advantage of an alcoholic boyhood best friend, and robbing a bank are all on his agenda. At the same time, his young son wins a national writing honor, which turns out to be based on plagiarism. Ethan, feeling his own dishonest plans corrupted his son, then considers suicide. The economic woes of the family are mirrored by today's stressful times. Steinbeck has laced his story with rich characters and detail. This is Steinbeck's last of sixteen novels. Quite a few, such as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" deal with the human struggle to survive. He's an expert at depicting this battle. The title is taken from the first two lines of Shakespeare's \\"Richard III.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"*No spoilers*If you're reading these reviews and still haven't made up your mind to get this book, hopefully I can give you that one final push - for or against it.When I started reading the first chapter, my first thought was, \\"What prompted me to read this?\\" It reminded me of required reading in high school, but without the distraction of good-looking classmates. But I persevered. And I was immediately rewarded with excellent characters, memorable descriptions of time and place - without being overly wordy - and one-liners that truly need to be read to be appreciated.As I am writing this review, I realize there were a lot more characters than I realized. This is a testament to Steinbeck's writing that I was never confused about how a character fit into the story. If you've ever wondered \\"How well do I really know someone?\\" or \\"How well do I know myself?\\" then you are in for quite a treat since this seems to be woven into every relationship in this novel. If you get the chance to discuss this with a book club, you'll probably have a field day! Also for the book club, the Penguin Classics version has explanatory notes and a 22-page introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, though I personally had no use for this.In a 280-page book, it would be hard to duplicate the inner thoughts of the characters, the descriptions of inanimate objects, motives and family history that stick with us after we read 'The Winter of Our Discontent'. Perhaps I have read others like this, but none come to mind.Finally, I wanted to add some quotes from the book that showcase Steinbeck's wit and thoughtfulness. This was what really kept me focused and smiling as I read. From the 'Penguin Classics' paperback edition:p.5(Mary, Ethan's wife, sends him to get some eggs for the children. Ethan jokingly retorts.)Ethan: \\"Why two dozen?\\"Mary: \\"For dyeing. Allen and Mary Ellen asked specially. You better go.\\"Ethan: \\"Okay bugflower - but can't I just go up and beat the hell out of Allen and Mary Ellen?\\"p. 72(Ethan is discussing the old days of pirates and their search for gold with his son, Allen)Allen: \\"I wouldn't mind that. I'd get the gold and bring it home. I guess they won't let you do it any more.\\"Ethan: \\"No - it's bigger and better organized now. They call it diplomacy.\\"p.149(Ethan's young daughter, Mary Ellen is chastising Ethan for not listening to her, then leaves the room)\\"She lounged away, a baby-fatted volupt. Girls kill me. They turn out to be girls.\\"Since I promised no spoilers, I will end here and encourage you to try this book for yourself."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Ethan Allen Hawley was a man who had it all; money and more importantly status in their small town community. A person's ego is carried into their profession, the amount of money they earn and their social status. And it is one way to climb up the ladder. But it is another matter to fall from the ladder, as if one has fallen from the grace of God.When I was 14 I picked up this novel and I had read most of Steinbeck's classics of my own volition. But this one was so sad, and the protagonist, Ethan could not catch a break.So he went from high society to managing a grocery story. And he had to eat crow at the social events, with people feeling sorry for him as he owned so much and lost it; he felt like hiding under a rock.He had an affair because he felt he had nothing to lose. Similar to his suicide attempt, life just kept on beating him down. But it was not life beating him down; he had an inability to cope with life's situations and to adjust. He had a job, could put food on the table, had a fine family. He had to work on his thin skin and needed to try to go out on his own to become an entrepreneur as his father was in years past. But it was his decision to choose not to try. He did not realize how much his daughter really loved him by replacing the razors in his pockets with her special rocks. But could he man-up and accept what life had given him?These actions would help him focus on the positive instead of focusing on the past failures. But all he wanted to do was feel sorry for himself; enough to leave a widowed wife and orphaned children without financial means. He was selfish even to his death.I enjoy Steinbeck as he wrote about people in California along the coast. He wrote of the people suffering in the Grapes of Wrath, a moral struggle between two brothers in East of Eden, Of Mice and Men, which culminated in one friend having to kill his mentally slow best friend, before the mob would tear him apart for touching a young woman. The there is Cannery Row and As I Lay Dying. This is just a small sampling of a large body of works.I would recommend The Winter of Our Discontent, as it brings the reader into the world of Ethan Allen Hawley and his trials and tribulations. Steinbeck does not write to fill the book just to meet publishing criteria - when it is done it is done."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\`The Winter of Our Discontent' is a slight departure for Steinbeck in that this isn't set in the Salinas valley or California. It has a different feel to his past novels with the themes of human greed and also with a slightly different style to the prose and yet it still has the splendour and amazing technique that Steinbeck is famous for, and which I've grown to love. You still get his lush descriptions, and turns of phrase that encapsulate a feeling or scene in a few perfectly chosen words. The story itself is completely absorbing and as with all of his novels, once you start reading it is very hard to put this down. Written towards the end of his career and when he was living in New York with his last wife you can see the influences of this change come out in his writing, but this in no way detracts from the overall feel, if anything it adds to it. If you've enjoyed any of his past novels then this one will not disappoint and if you're new to Steinbeck I wouldn't recommend this as your first try (maybe Grapes Of Wrath or Cannery Row) but you should definitely come back to it at some point soon. Well worth a read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"One of my very favorite novels is EAST OF EDEN, so I was especially curious to read this, his last novel. I couldn't devour it fast enough. The story of WASP-y Ethan, Mary and their small suburban town immediately gripped me and I was thoroughly captivated by Steinbeck's style of prose. The dialogue crackled with wit...the descriptive passages and storytelling all insightful and artistically composed. A real pleasure to read.The disturbing course on which Ethan embarks, though both personal choice and circumstance, gets a little muddied in Part II but nevertheless my intent interest remained. I was born shortly after the time in which this is set (1960), so many of the references and mindsets rang so very clearly to the way I recall from my childhood. Yet, the lessons of morality remain completely relevant."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I am collecting Steinbeck hardbacks and this is an excellent copy. The Winter of our Discontent is one of my favorites. I have read it many times."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent, Steinbeck's final novel, doesn't read much like early Steinbeck. But, contrary to many critics, that's not entirely a bad thing. A lot of early Steinbeck read like faux-Hemingway, and while the first couple chapters of The Winter of Our Discontent read like faux-Sinclair Lewis (at least he was imitating a better author by this point), after that he seems to find his own voice and later the stylistic similarities to his masterpiece East of Eden emerge...though by the end this is a rather unique novel, even among Steinbeck's own oeuvre.The Winter of Our Discontent follows Ethan Allen Hawley, a down-on-his-luck grocery store clerk who decides to put morality aside temporarily in order to gain wealth and power, after which he intends to resume his former incorruptible ways. But in the end he learns this is too high a price to pay and is nearly destroyed by it.Exceptionally well written (perhaps Steinbeck's best in that regard), and with fascinating, complex characters and an interesting story (if you stick with it, though it has its ups and downs), this is the kind of book that you feel like you need to read at least two or three times to fully get a handle on. But after my first reading, I'm provisionally rating it four stars and declaring it my second-favorite by Steinbeck, after only East of Eden. Skip The Grapes of Wrath and read this!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel is amazing. The way Steinbeck shows the thoughts of Ethan Allen Hawley is wonderful. The look into the human mind makes this book a classic."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was my first Steinbeck novel and it was amazing.

I loved the Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but there was something about this book that made it my favorite. It might be because of the prose or the theme of the book,I really think it is the combination of the two. I think that it hits home with the middle class morality."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book was not the masterpiece that The Grapes of Wrath was in my eyes but it had its own charm and meaning that I feel shows the value of Steinbeck's writings. I thought the story was believable. I also think that the portrayal of the conflict Americans face when it comes to morals and values was also very well done. I do reccommend this book to both Steinbeck and non-Steinbeck lovers alike because it is an excellent and interesting read. I plan on reading it again a few years from now, only after I re-read the Grapes of Wrath again."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest novelists in American history and all of his work deserves reading. But The Winter of Our Discontent is far from his best work. Even his shorter works such as Mice and Men and The Pearl are better. The basic plot is trite and overdone in literature. A \\"good\\" man is tempted to compromise his morality for personal gain. The story itself drags as the characters spend a lot of time talking and musing. There is relatively little action. Even the ending is murky. Read it if you must, but read other works by Steinbeck first."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is easy to teach, but he's not much fun to read. \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" is over-laden with religious symbols and metaphors that have little meaning rather than to be just present. The plot seems contrived and artificial: the protagonist's transformation from saint to manipulator is too sudden, and isn't quite believable.Nevertheless, the main themes of this book -- the corrupting power of money, the diabolical ways of the rich, the sacrifices of good individuals -- are even more relevant today than they were fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book didn't knock me out as did other Steinbeck works, but it had enough to say about double-dealings, the battle between contentment and seeking more from life, and social interactions to make it ring true. It is a comforting slice of life in a time that brought back memories to me of my own childhood, especially the views of a small town in the early sixties. The plot had some moments that threatened credibility and some of the characters were cliches, especially the cops, the drunk, and the banker who should come with his own evil music cues. Furthermore, I found Margie Young-Hunt to be a bizarre invention - a classy town skank who is embraced by the town's women as a trusted friend and part-time sooth-sayer and men as, well, a classy town skank, but she is arguably the most interesting character as well. The book picks up greatly towards the end after you suffer from a bit too much meandering and overly eager exposition. Not a starting point for Steinbeck, but a good place for further exploration."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I've read this book again and again, and each time I realize why this is my favorite novel. The dialogue, descriptions, and prose are so wonderfully constructed that the reader is left to ponder how John Steinbeck ever thought to write such a magical story. It's a tale of man's soul, of morals, of the mind, and of family. If you can find a flaw in this book, I'd love to hear about it. It's perfect."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is a genius and a master of the English language. Please make sure to include this novel on your list of 'must-reads'. It will not let you down."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck comes forth with his usual superb character development as expected. What was unexpected was how relevant his question remains today. Is everyone dishonest in business? Is that what it takes? What happens to an honest man when he tries to get ahead?The story is set in the typical small American town. If you have ever watched small town politics, you know the cast. Except for Ethan. He is unique because he is honest. He is also \\"a failure\\" because he is honest. He has a wonderful wife - never openly begrudging and always accomodating. But then he has two kids, both of whom want to know why he isn't rich or when he will be. They are the future, as children naturally are and the question plays out between them too. Then there is Margie. Like a carbon copy of the perfect wife, she is the perfect \\"confidant\\" if you get my drift. As a woman, the contrast between them begs study. But it also pushes the fidelity angle too as Steinbeck goes into her relationships with various men. Like Young Goodman Brown (Hawthorne, I think) who goes to meet the Devil fearing what various people would think only to find out that they are all already there, Hawley questions of morality go there too.But the true grit of this, for me, is the honesty factor. When being asked by his family when he will be rich, one of his responses is that there are two kinds of money - no money and not enough. It will never be enough. At what point do you stop \\"bending the rules\\". Do you \\"bend the rules\\" to get a house and security and then behave as an honest and decent man? Or do you then have the \\"not enough\\" kind of money and have to keep going. Is to be rich necessarily to be dishonest? And in the return to honesty and decency, will the money be lost?This is an excellent book - and always will be. As long as we keep doing things we wouldn't \\"normally\\" do to make money, i.e. trade off our family and values to do this or do that. Are we being who we want to be? Are we striving to be the best spouse, neighbor, parent or does business come first? And, if so, why? Is that really success?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck's last work of fiction, 'The Winter of Our Discontent', examines the 'moral flabbiness' of post-war America, particularly that of the late 1950's. Its stated question, posed by the main character Ethan Allen Hawley in a first person monologue, is whether an ethical man can set aside his principles, do what is required to advance himself in the world, and then, objective reached, reclaim those principles without suffering moral damage. That Hawley does eventually convince himself to attempt such a 'moral holiday', to prove for himself that it's possible, and the results he obtains is the crux of the book - but from its melodramatic set-up to its engineered ending, it seems as though Steinbeck were shouting out his subject's terrible relevance on every page.I nearly put this book down before I finished the first chapter. It begins with several pages of dialog that sounds artificial and too special, followed by a character sketch of Hawley as he interacts with the same townspeople he'll have to deal with during his 'holiday'. This blatant foundation seems amateurish, and I can't help but think of the last Steinbeck book I read, 'To a God Unknown', which, while it had its faults, had an intrinsic vitality to its spare prose and a calm, evocative pace that is lacking in this much later work.In the book's third chapter, Steinbeck changes his point of view, and Hawley begins to address the reader in the first person. At this point, I did get somewhat drawn into the story, and once his machinations come clearer, there is a bit of tension to their resolution. Unfortunately, the necessity of having the story impart a lesson trumps a realistic, though probably ambiguous, ending, and instead concludes with Hawley frantically out of character.'Winter of Our Discontent' isn't as terrible as I've probably made it out to sound, but it is disappointing in relation to other Steinbeck novels that I've read. In this Penguin Classics Edition, Susan Shillinglaw writes a perceptive, and positive, introduction that contextualizes 'Winter' with Steinbeck's life, and also catalogs some of the references to the outside world that gives this novel an extra layer of texture and nuance; however this still fails to overcome its melodramatic air. In that sense, 'Winter' is reminiscent of 'East of Eden', and readers who enjoyed that Steinbeck work may also find 'The Winter of Our Discontent' to their liking."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\\"In business and politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be King of the Mountain. Once there, he can be great and kind - but he must get there first.\\"The title of this book is a link to Shakespeare's Richard III - which opens with \\"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York; and all the clouds that lowered upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\" This is (future king) Richard celebrating an upturn in his family's fortunes - basically saying that our dark days are behind us (winter) and the future is now turning bright. It begins his accession to the throne, which he briefly attains, through murder, manipulation, and treachery.The Winter of Our Discontent's main character, Ethan Allen Hawley, makes a similar shift to achieve material desires. At the start of the novel, Ethan is a moralistic, but ordinary, man. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ethan is fair and honest in a world that has increasingly become materialistic and corrupt. He is married with two kids, working as a clerk at a grocery store his family used to own. He failed early at business - losing the grocery store and what was left of his family's land in the town (except his house) - which created a chip on his shoulder that everyone in town seems to want to wedge deeper. His family harps on him about their lack of money and status in the town. The town banker questions what Ethan is doing working as a clerk. Ethan's boss stresses business prowess and the need to \\"look after number one.\\" A local vender even offers a bribe and kickback to Ethan for some business, as \\"everybody's got a right to make a buck.\\" Ethan is an outlier in the town his family essentially founded - as the old is constantly being moved out for the new, and Ethan is stuck looking into the past.Ethan begins to tire of being the town doormat - and like most of the town before him, begins to break down and rationalize that morality is relative. He asks if \\"the eaters (are) more immoral than the eaten? In the end all are eaten - all - gobbled up by the earth, even the fiercest and the most crafty.\\" He questions what one gains by being a moral individual, when we all share the same fate. With the help of an opportunistic amateur fortune-teller, Ethan rebuilds himself in efforts to capture the respect of and successes of those around him - like a snake \\"changing its skin, part dusty and ragged and part fresh and new.\\" He falls in line with those around him - letting his animalistic nature control his behavior.He is able to make this change naturally, and he gains success and wealth outwardly but finds that he has morally depleted himself in the process. He manipulates his childhood friend, now a drunk, into giving Ethan his (very valuable) land in exchange for enough money to drink himself to death. He reports his boss (the grocery store owner) to the government as an illegal immigrant, so he can take back ownership of the store. He even contemplates robbing a bank before fate intercedes. All these actions are rationalized by Ethan, as \\"all men are moral, only their neighbors are not.\\" These actions let him achieve the wealth and status that he feels he's been missing, but he finds it unsatisfying given what he had to give up. Ethan realizes that even in a relative world, there are still acceptable and unacceptable moral standards for oneself.Ethan is finally both taken over the edge and then brought back by the future - his children. His son, Allen, has inherited the same moral standards of those around him, having plagiarized his essay in an essay contest. Ethan is disgusted - and at this point realizes his hypocrisy - that while he has justified immorality within himself (due to relative moralism), he finds the same behavior in others detestable. His daughter, Ellen, saves Ethan by representing moralistic hope in the future - a light that has not gone out, and in the end, Ethan puts his own needs aside in order to provide hope for the next generation.A good story that underlines what Steinbeck considered the \\"moral flabbiness\\" spreading from corporate America to everyday American life during the 50s (and 60s). Through Ethan we experience the collapsing of a moral man into the relative morals that has overtaken everyday life. The message Steinbeck is sending is a relevant one - that no matter what relevant morals are prevalent in society, it is up to the individual not to fall into a relative moral trap, but to be guided by a constant set of absolute morals.The weakness of the novel is in its characters and relationships, which are lacking in my opinion. The novel's characters, beyond Ethan, are trivial and not well developed - seeming to only be there to prove a certain point. Part of this probably stems from the fact that most of the book is told from Ethan's point of view - but even he appears to be lacking something, specifically in his relationships. His only connection is with his past - he has no connection with his wife or his kids - their interactions seem contrived. The only connection he makes is at the end - through the talisman, with his daughter - but it seems like a reach given their prior lack of depth. The relationships lacked to me - maybe this was how Steinbeck envisioned Ethan, but I thought his character (and others) could have been filled out better.A lot of criticism of this book also stems from comparing it to his other works (mainly Grapes of Wrath) - which I have not read, but now plan to. I think that is a little unfair though - this book stands on its own, depicting its period with universal moral themes, and delivers its intended message."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is a perfect way to become deeply enveloped in the psychology of a loveable man grappling with the temptations of corruption, greed, and adultery. The characters are vivid and personal, and often we are privy to their most intimate- and amusing- thoughts. Steinbeck is a master of recreating the essence of a culture, and he successfully creates this New England town which remains steeped in its own quaint history despite the increasing infringements of modern life. As with much Steinbeck, it is the characters and the culture that make this short novel great, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I like Steinbeck a lot and I admire his ability to adeptly write about so many different themes in his various novels. Out of all of his books, I think this is one of the least known, which is really too bad. Steinbeck's prose and descriptive ability never falters; he makes the book come alive but never overwhelms the reader with detail. The variety of characters (another one of Steinbeck's traits) usually would seem like too much for this relatively short novel, but each one is memorable, adding another layer, another necessary part that makes this novel work so well. This book's themes, especially the theme of whether it's worth it to sacrifice ideals in order to get ahead, are applicable to this day and age and ensure the timelessness of this novel."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A powerful novel, with a plot that most can relate to. Ethan Hawley, the main character struggles to provide for his family. Comes from a family of successful business men, until The Great Depression hits his family hard and he must start from the bottom, working as a produce market clerk. He feels that he must own up to his name that has been made by his predecessors. He is confronted by opportunities that question his integrity and common sense.What I like about this novel is that present day situations arise which grabs my attention and makes me think. Ethan, married with two children, thinks of his family first, because all he wants is to give them what he feels they deserve. He would sacrifice his own happiness to make his family happy.I also can relate to how he sometimes feels disappointed by how his life is panning out, but doesn't forget all the things he should be grateful for. I strongly recommend this novel to all who love to read. Whether you can relate to it or not, it will make you think, and help you appreciate some things that are taken for granted."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If you are ever asked what five books you would recommend to someone who knew nothing about America to introduce them to what it means to be American...like say...on the Foreign Service Exam ;-) this book had better be on that list. The Grapes of Wrath is the Masterpiece that gets all the attention but this novel shines even in the shadow of one of the key pieces of American literature. I have rarely been &quot;moved&quot; by a novel the way that I was with this book. It forces you to read it at its own pace and to let the story unfold around you. It is a great book and one that deserves to be read time and again. Read it yourself and then give it to your children. This book will speak to your soul."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Simply the best book I have ever read. Steinbeck illustrateshow easily a very moral man can stray from the path ofmorality and how this straying can affect everything aroundhim. Steinbeck also beautifully and grippingly writes of howthe realization of this can crush a man's spirit."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book reads like a howl of pain from a man who did not like where he saw his country headed. Sadly, no one was listening.Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard educated descendent of New England shipping captains. In years past, his family was one of the most important in town. But now times have changed &amp; after his father lost most of the family fortune &amp; Ethan himself lost the family store, he is reduced to being a grocery clerk in the employ of an immigrant, Mr. Marullo.Ethan's wife, Mary, and his two children, Ellen and Allen, push him to better the family's lot. Mary, for instance, wants him to invest the $6000 she inherited upon her brother's death.The town vixen, Margie Young-Hunt, provides a powerful pull to kick over the traces &amp; run a bit wild. She sends a representative from a food wholesaler to Ethan &amp; he is offered a kickback if he'll buy from them.Meanwhile, Danny Taylor, his childhood friend &amp; now the town drunk, holds a piece of property that developers are desparate to get ahold of for their planned airport. The local banker approaches Ethan for help in getting the property away from Danny.In short order Ethan is narcing on neighbors, betraying Danny, taking bribes &amp; planning to rob the bank.The ease with which the morally upright Ethan slips into a life of scheming and crime is not particularly believable. And I'll leave it to others to question the likelihood of a college graduate turned grocery clerk (lawyer/technicians shouldn't throw stones.)However, Steinbeck had clearly perceived the general decline in morality that was occuring and accelerating as the nation entered the 1960's. As Ethan considers his schemes, he says, &quot;A crime is something someone else commits&quot;. Here's his description of the year 1960: it was &quot;a year when secret fears come into the open, when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger. The whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to find outlet in action, any action so long as it is violent.&quot;Steinbeck manages to paint an extremely bleak portrait of America &amp; where it was headed, but it's hard to argue that he was wrong. He offers only two rays of hope. At one point, Ethan recalls the words of his grandfather, &quot;Only in a single man alone--only in one man alone. There's the only power--one man alone. Can't depend on anything else.&quot; This nearly biblical incantation offers the way out of the predicament that Steinbeck has forecast. Each man must take responsibility for his own actions.Then when Ethan has reached the end of his rope &amp; considers suicide, a simple action by his daughter draws him back from the edge &amp; he determines that he must try to help her, &quot;else another light go out.&quot; I found this to be somewhat too little too late, especially as his daughter has already gotten up to no good.I did find one thing remarkable about the book. Steinbeck may well have been the last of the significant traditional novelists. It is such a pleasure to read a straightforward story that doesn't resort to magical realism or interior monologue or other modernistic artifice. At one point, Ethan says, &quot;A man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of predjudice, some paint it with their own delight. A story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home in it. Only then can he accept wonders.&quot; Compare this to The Way of All Flesh, where Samuel Butler stated that he didn't care if anyone ever read his books or to James Joyce's completely inaccessible works.It seems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This underrated book presents the classic moral dilemma which pits the desire of the main character to live a moral, simple and decent life against the pressures from outside influences to obtain material wealth and standing through means which would cause him to give up the morals he holds most precious to him. This is the type of novel that all people should read after they have entered the workforce and can reflect on their own lives. Steinbeck leads the reader through the main character's thoughts and finishes this personal journey with an ending which will have readers turning back the pages to see the events which preceded the conclusion. I read the last chapters several times and each time was moved.The reason why this novel is underrated is that while it lacks the size and power of some of Steinbeck's other novels, such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\", I often reflect upon the lessons of this novel years later in my own life. For this reason, it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's novels. Like all of Steinbeck's writings, it acccomplishes its goals with a concise economic prose, which serves to emphasize the message of the novel. It is a novel of significant moral effect and it should be read several times during a lifetime to remind us of the difference between right and wrong and the significance that our actions may have on the lives of those around us and on ourselves."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"For many years, I have had books thrown in my face and told what they mean and what exactly takes place. But I, as a 1990's teenager, like to have the power to think for myself. John Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent is a perfect example of what to read. In it there is a profound story, but also the freedom to perceive it anyway you like. Ethan Hawley leaves his morals at home almost every morning for a month, and you get to decide what he thinks, knows, and how he feels. If you love to think and have the power to end a book how you see fit, I extremely recommend Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent.

If you like Steinbeck, you will love this book"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Hawley family is \\"Discontent\\". Ethan Hawley is working as a grocery clerk in the store he previously owned. The store now belongs to Marullo, an Italian immigrant who tries to teach Ethan what makes a successful businessman. Even Mr. Baker, the banker, has advice for Ethan: he tries to teach him how to be a good investor. It seems that everyone has an opinion on how Ethan Hawley can bring respect back to his family name. His wife is restless and doesn't like the fact that they are poor and living in a town where they were once respected. Ethan's son wants to go on television and get rich quick, his adolescent daughter is too secretive for his liking.Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is a moral individual who has always done the right thing. This novel is set in New Baytown, a fictitious town near Long Island, a town that operates within a realm of corruption. Yet things have operated that way for so long that no one remembers that it is corrupt anymore. Ethan's family feels that he is too ethical for his own good. He has to choose between his current morals and adapting the definition of his morality.Steinbeck captures a nation that is growing economically but bankrupt morally. Where this novel differs from other fall from grace novels is that the central character observes himself as a third party and slides down the slippery slope knowing full well the consequences. Steinbeck offers redemption in the form or Marullo, on being deported he gives the grocery store to Ethan Hawley. This happens just when Ethan is about to rob the bank.A short novel worthy of praise addresses moral questions that really make you stop and think; the dialogue is brilliant.The characters are clever and witty, but at times I found the plot was very slow."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck shows true artistry of dialogue in this book set in New England in the 1950s. The protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, conveys every bit of his is misfortune (or missed fortune, as the case may be) and everyman, grocery store clerk persona in his words along with something deeper, darker, and perhaps undetectable to one who isn't privy to what haunts his mind at night. He is a delightful character, despite his self-indulgence. Although the plot is slow and relies heavily on somewhat unbelievable coincidences, the story is chock-full of brilliant dialogue. You can practically see the scenes in black and white in your mind with a Jimmy Stewart-esque Ethan tapping out the language in a beautiful staccato song of times gone by."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"First, I will state up front that John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. In this novel Steinbeck atypically writes about life in a town in the east, one somewhere on the lower New England coast. The depth of the characters, a Steinbeck trademark, is present here in spades. His protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is one of the most thoroughly well written characters that you can find. His wife Mary, his boss Marullo, his friend at the bank next store Joey-boy, his wife's friend Margie Young-Hunt, his kids (maybe especially his kids)... are all so vividly displayed that it's easy to forget that this is a fictitious town filled with fictitious people. The subject matter easily matches the character's depth... the difficulty in a modern world, full of all kinds of pressures, to remain moral and honest in the face of an easier way out. (Although written in the early 60s, the relevance to current headlines is obvious). Suffice to say that Steinbeck is one of the great writers of all time and all his copious skills are on display here. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having read many of Steinbeck's books and thoroughly enjoying them, I have been looking forward to reading \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\". The initial tone Steinbeck sets in the book is odd. The main character possesses none of the typical characteristics which mark a Steinbeck main character. Ethan Hawley is hard to like at times because of the strange things he says and does. But in reality, Ethan represents every man. Often not likable, but real.Steinbeck paints vivid characters in this story as he does in his other works. Ethan Hawley finds himself working as a clerk in the store his family once owned. Despite a heritage of wealth, his family has fallen on hard times. A fortune teller suggests this will soon change. When the store's current owner is deported, Ethan regains in possession of the store. The owner gave the store to Ethan at a cheap price because he is an honest man. Despite an apparent influx of wealth on the horizon, Ethan's other problems linger. His daughter merely wants him to be around. His son's fortune of winning an essay contest evaporates when he was found to have plagiarized. Danny, who is like a brother to him, may not have been rehabilitated from his alcoholism. The fortune teller lusts for him. The whole town seems to have fallen into corruption. His wife seems to be the last remaining sane person left.As one would expect from Steinbeck, this book does not have a happy ending. The end is quite depressing, much like reality can be. Steinbeck has a gift for painting reality. While far from his masterwork, this story holds its ground."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a beautifully written book ~~ and my second Steinbeck book. A friend complained to me recently that she finds Steinbeck a depressing writer ~~ I disagree. He writes realistically of the views that society has on one another and of the world. Steinbeck writes convincingly of people and this book is no exception.The book focuses on Ethan, a descendant from the Pilgrims and of the whaling captains, reduced to semi-poverty by working for an Italian immigrant in the grocery store he used to own. His wife, Mary, complains of not having money to spend as well as his two children. Beset by memories of how it used to be, Ethan begins to look for a way to solve his problems. This book focuses on that attempt. Ethan is a lovable character ~~ he defuses every serious conversations or whining with humor, oftentimes at the expense of his good self-will and pride.It is a journey into one man's soul and it's soul-wrenching as well. It makes you stop and think ~~ and you don't dare to criticize anyone because you're guilty of the same feelings of despair and defeat. Ethan struggles to find a way to deal with those expectations and dreams of his loved ones and still keep his pride. But it comes to a conclusion that he can't have both.This may be a smaller book but one still grabs at your soul and your mind. It's a perfect addition to any serious reader's library.1-3-04"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"We all know the difference between right and wrong, but the temptation to commit something that is wrong to make things more right is incredibly strong. That is what Steinbeck main character here has to deal with. Every where he turns their is another temptation to do something and many times he almost gives in, but the decent soul always wins out; well almost always. He does commit somethings that maybe weren't the best things to do, but... This is a fine book, well written and everyone should be able to identify with these all to real characters. The setting is a small town in the east, the kind of town that we have seen in movie after movie, but in all these towns, just as in real life, there are things that are not altogether wholesome going on.

The life of Ethan Hawley, the main character, is simple and complex. He is a working-class man with a blue-blood lineage. In the small town in which he lives - his name rings of history and power - his ancestors were the founders of the village and basked in the glory of their status and wealth for many years. Not so for Ethan. He now lives in the shadow of his great name - no longer having the funds or status to support his legacy.The real story of this book, for me, however, was the clash between his status and the material wants/needs/demands of his family. This is the America conundrum - regardless of how well we do financially - there is always more stuff (bigger, faster, shinier, newer) waiting around the corner - contentment is elusive. Ethan is bombarded daily with the wants of his children - from the latest cereal they'd seen on TV to stories of the vacations their neighbors had recently taken - all followed with - \\"can we...?\\" Of course Ethan wants to provide these things for his family - he simply doesn't have the means or the opportunity to do so.Then opportunity presents itself. To seize it, however, Ethan must trade his morals and ethics for profit. He takes advantage of a \\"friend\\" and profits greatly - enabling him to finally provide the many goodies his family has craved. We do not learn much about the family after the fact - the impact this action had on Ethan, on his relationships with his family or the community. We assume he profited and \\"lived happily ever after.\\"The real question, posed by Steinbeck throughout this story is: What would you do to profit - to attain the American Dream? Is the cost worth it? Is the \\"dream\\" worth it?All of us are asked to do things in our jobs and in our daily living that challenge our personal morality or ethics. Corporations do many good things, but also, as economic engines, they often do things that are pro-business and anti-people: mass lay-offs, off shoring, out-sourcing, questionable environmental ethics, and manipulative tactics to gain position or market share. People are at the levers of these acts - people who must make decisions that are gut wrenching on a human-scale, but smart business and of great benefit to stock holders.Everyday, we purchase millions of dollars of products that are produced in factories that would violate every labor law we have here in the states - yet we are able to purchase it cheaply, which is helpful when one is on a limited budget.I guess I find it important to know, and understand, the complexity of a global world. There is much good, and much bad. Are we to simply accept the bad and strive for our own personal gain? Should we focus on those we help - our employees, stockholders and customers - and ignore those who may suffer as a result of our behavior? It seems that all human activity has some negative and positive outgrowth - perhaps the best we can do is the best we can do.This is, perhaps true on a global level - we can feel for the woman who worked to make the five-dollar t-shirts we are buying at Wal-Mart - but can we, individually, change this system? I don't know. To a large degree, I think, we are all individuals stuck in a monstrous-global economic machine that exists outside of any ethical or moral code. The name of the game is - profit. I am all for the free market - 100% - however, I do not like to see, nor do I celebrate and entity (private or public) that serves itself first, often at the expense of the individual. The Leviathan-state (or Corporation, or any organization) rarely benefits those it professes to serve.It seems much more complicated, however, on a personal level. The real question is: What would you do to your neighbor to attain the brass ring? That is what Steinbeck presented with perfect clarity - the dramatic change between the Puritanical culture that had passed and the new age of economic ambition and material want. The old Ethan held to the Golden Rule - Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do To You. The new Ethan held to the Gecko Rule - Do It To The Other Before They Do It To You.The future for such a culture seems bleak.This book is an excellent meditation on personal ethics. It is definitely worth a tumble.Peace & God Bless!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Out of print in Italy luckly available somewhere else, I and my 18 years old boy appreciated very much. A must for who wants to understand the US citizens."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent showcases John Steinbeck's trademark understanding of human nature in a unique East Coast venue. My reading of this book was particularly well-timed; I was completing my education and job hunting. Ethan made me realize that the quest for money, power, and prestige is dangerous when it involves the sacrificing of one's happiness, morals, and values. This book is all about the danger posed by our society's defining success by monetary achievement. Human nature is funny: it is just when we achieve happiness and stability that we find something else to covet -- the endless cycle that makes so many unhappy when they reach their life's end."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As an avid reader of Steinbeck's works, DISCONTENT blew me away. While lacking the development of a breadth of characters, as we see in EAST OF EDEN and GRAPES OF WRATH, Steinbeck really captures the human spirit in the character of Ethan Hawley.While not as descriptive in the same way as other Steinbeck novels, he makes up for this with great use of language. However, there is no lack of description, and one gets a true picture of what is going on. This book is a quicker read than other novels of similar size, such as THE WAYWARD BUS, and is well worth ones time. It is an incredible experience to see the mind of Ethan Allen Hawley at work."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Had it not been for Steinbeck's already intimidating library of classics, this novel would have definitely gone down as one of the most important of the 20th century.The wit of part one is nothing short of amazing. I actually found myself laughing uncontrollably a few times, which is an extremely rare occurrence when it comes to good literature.Ethan is both one of the easiest to love and easiest to hate characters at different parts of the story that I've ever come across. The transition from honest working man to greedy businessman is done perfectly. His final confrontation with Mr. Baker was one of the most exciting climaxes in recent memory.The entire ensemble of characters alone would make this an instant classic. Steinbeck then goes as far as to create dozens of themes and potential discussions, all the while effectively making sure the plot was not forgotten.I can see how some would see it as boring at times. Part two goes much faster than part one, which is probably due to the plethora of off-topic discourses in the first part and the equal amount of dialogue in part two.I wouldn't suggest starting with this if you're trying to get into Steinbeck, but it shouldn't be the last title on your reading list. If it seems to drag on at times just stick with it. I will most definitely be reading this time and again."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This Steinbeck novel mesmerized me when I was young; it was my favorite \\"morality\\" book. But now that I'm older and I've read it again, I'm not so sure where it stands. I loved its cerebral but playful style, similar to Steinbeck's East of Eden, and I took as gospel the book's revelations about the ethics and reality of business. The story takes place in a small New England town, but it's meant to apply to the world at large.On a second \\"older\\" reading, I feel that I have discovered why this book is an \\"overlooked\\" classic, which makes me wonder how Steinbeck's acknowledged powerhouses - Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden - would fare on a second reading. The Winter Of Our Discontent is still cerebral and playful, it's still a good story, but now it seems too clever by half. It's almost as if Steinbeck tried to put The Great Game into a small town and it doesn't quite fit. The characters are clever and witty, but none of them, not even the main character, Ethan, is truly fleshed out. The characters seem to represent ideas rather than people, or they exist merely to advance the plot. People are divided into two camps: those in the know and playing the game and those not. Ethan is an exception; he is a good man who is aware of the game but stays out of it and protects his family from it. But the price Ethan pays for goodness is to be meek and almost poor. Once Ethan begins to feel pressure from his family to rise up from his ethical but lowly station in life, he decides to get in the game, and he plays like a master. Ethan doesn't overrationalize his decision, but he is quietly desperate, making it feel a bit false and overplayed to me, especially at the conclusion when Ethan's ambivalence overwhelms him (I can't say more about this without giving an important part of the story away). In other words, The Winter Of Our Discontent seems like an oversimplistic moral story with undeveloped characters. It wasn't as \\"deep\\" as I remembered. I wasn't able to know or like any of the characters; I could only follow the plot, which, as I said, is still interesting enough.Now I have the challenge of finding a new favorite morality story, one that is deep, true, compelling, and a great read. No, don't tell me about Ayn Rand! Any other suggestions?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I probably would not have picked this book to read on my own. I was assigned it in an English Literature class at Santa Monica College. I loved it. It is timeless piece of literature. I give this book as a gift to anyone who has ever paid a fortune teller. It is a perfect example of how a seed can be planted. I give it 10+++++++++++++++."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The moral decline of the nation is reflected in the inner struggle of Ethan Allen Hawley, resident of New Baytown, a sleepy New England town about to expand its tourist industry. Ethan, who lives in a house built by his forefathers, is a clerk in a store once owned by them. He has not lived up to the family fortune and promise, as a descendant of pilgrims, pirates and whaling captains. It seems as if he has found a sort of contentment, is in love with his wife, loving towards his two kids and spouting sermons to the canned goods in the early morning. &quot;A reflected cathedral light filled the store, a diffused cathedral light like that of Chartres. Ethan paused to admire it, the organ pipes of canned tomatoes, the chapels of mustard and olives, the hundred oval tombs of sardines.&quot; He has the Place as well, an escape where he can be alone and take stock. And he needs to take stock, because the pressures of others-- his family, the town banker who is plotting for the overthrow of the local government, and the town fortune-teller and promiscuous divorcee, Mrs. Margie Young-Hunt who has her designs on him as a &quot;back-up plan&quot; of sorts -- they all want him to desire more for himself. They want him to reclaim his family's fortunes, to pursue money and rise in position. Marullo, the owner of the store, tells him how business really works: &quot;'Business is money. Money is not friendly. Kid, maybe you too friendly--too nice. Money is not nice. Money got no friends but more money.'&quot; Within the same day, Ethan resists a bribe by a traveling salesman to switch his meat vendor and take a kickback, being told that &quot;everyone does it.&quot; Even his friend Danny Taylor, who is now the town drunk, holds himself in higher regard than Ethan because of his lowly position as store clerk.Between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, a plan begins to form in Ethan's mind to change his situation and the vague outline of it is slowly revealed to the reader. He wonders if he can have a short moral lapse, set the rules so ingrained in his being aside for a short time for a large, temporary gain. Will he be able to carry out the plan? Will he be able to live with himself afterward?Steinbeck's characters are interesting and memorable. Joey Morphy, aptly known as the Morph, turns into what he needs to be, often saying things he suspiciously &quot;heard from a friend.&quot; Then there is Margie Young-Hunt, who is indeed a hunter. She sets a bit of a trap for Ethan, who never trusted her despite her being close to his wife. He calls her a witch, and by the end of the book, I did wonder if she had cast a spell over him. Ethan's grandfather, Cap'n, has long since passed away, but to him Ethan still loudly recites the rigging of the ships in the harbor. He is also haunted by Aunt Deborah, whose moral fiber runs deeply ingrained in her nephew.This is a very different Steinbeck than Of Mice and Men or Grapes of Wrath. It is rich in its use of dialogue, with both interior and exterior conversations. This book is superbly written, complex yet a &quot;page-turner&quot; in its suspense. It is clear why it is considered an American classic."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Published in 1961, a mere year before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature, *The Winter of Our Discontent* is the culmination and thematic summation of a Great American Author, the resultant craft of a man who, over the course of his career, concerned himself with the American Ideal and the American Reality, despaired at stagnancy and loss of character, and ever fought the rising forces of material obsession and moral capitulation; it is a masterwork, albeit a slow-going and rather depressing one at that. Steinbeck would never again produce a novel of this scope and social-penetration, nor need he try: along with *Grapes*, *Eden*, and a few other contestable entries, the man had made his mark upon the literary zeitgeist: with *Winter*, he had fulfilled his promise ten-fold, delivering a powerful fable of loss, despair and (potential) redemption.Ethan Hawley is a deeply troubled man. A Harvard graduate and veteran, he has settled for the path of (dis)contented mediocrity. Forced to work as a clerk in the store his father owned - and lost, due to shady speculations during World War II - Ethan continually ruminates inwardly on the past, the present, and the rather-dim looking future; he is haunted by the daunting specters of his wild, whale-hunting ancestors, an imposing legacy he feels inadequate to challenge; he endures beneath the crushing weight of perceived - and socially imposed - *failure*. The ghosts of the ancestral dynasty are ever on his mind, while the concerns of his immediate family threaten his strongly-inlaid yet increasingly fragile moral bedrock - for his wife and children resent the poverty of the Hawley misfortune, the wife constantly giving subtle hints as to her personal shame, unable to \\"hold her head up high;\\" and the children, pining for the creature-comforts the productive 50's began to bestow (a television, new car, etc.), which the lack of solvency denies them, begin to slide into pubescent angst and experiment with the relative-morality ethic seemingly prevalent everywhere beyond the Hawley domain.In a sense (as several of the negative reviews on this page have pointed out), one feels Steinbeck has crafted a too-perfect foil in Ethan: he is almost *too* good, *too* straight-laced, and thus a rather \`easy' contrast to the various corrupting forces the author perceived in the United States - and wished to combat, via the artistic craft. And yet, and yet... there is more than enough psychological meat in the text to justify the technique. Ethan's character is complex, and complexly drawn - the reader is given the clues, well early on, that the seed of temptation actively writhes to undermine the protagonist's staunch moral code; the presentation of such is done in a way both obvious and yet subtle, for we know what will happen but wonder (and hope) that events might force these carefully-laid plans awry. Nearly the entire novel can be thus seen as a slow, achingly certain capitulation of the primeval American standard - that is, honesty and self-reliance, coupled with integrity - and the key, then, is in making the main character likable and sympathetic in his torment. And Steinbeck succeeds marvelously, not only in Ethan but in those around him, who alternatively tempt, encourage, repress: Mary Hawley, the loving yet anxious wife; his son Allen, already succumbing to the irresistible forces of corruption; bank-manager Baker, epitome of fat-cat syndrome; Danny, the childhood friend-turned-alcoholic wastrel; and Margie, the most vivacious and vividly-drawn, the fallen-woman & town comfort, grown desperate as the years march on... Steinbeck has the way, as with all masters of word-smithy, to fashion a character within the space of a few lines, and make them seem *real*: someone you've seen before, or perhaps known intimately.Again, I stress that *Winter* is not an easy read: the phrasing is deliberate and dirge-like, alternatively evocative and experimental (~while avoiding the excess of stream-of-consciousness); the atmosphere of New Bayton - and Ethan's inward ponderings - is gloomily suppressive, a miasma of failure, discontent, addiction and existential angst. Even as the time-table of the novel enters into spring, then summer, the cold shadow of *Winter's* desolate, desperate themes linger on. No, not an easy read - but, in passages, a beautiful one, and well worth the effort undergone. It is Steinbeck's final masterwork, a thousand-year gaze penetrating the cozy illusions of the fifties and accurately predicting the turmoil of the upcoming Aquarius decade.Five Stars."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is one of those writers who get in your face, who engage you in passionate conversation, if not downright argument, almost as soon as you turn the first page. I read this book in a paperback version, printed in 1962, whose dogeared cover featured an angry young man in tie and shirtsleeves, seated; a sleazy cigarette-smoking blonde, standing behind him with her arm over his shoulder; and another woman, younger and more wholesome, profiled in the rear. I loved this book and found it laughable at the same time, and the fact that I couldn't wait to finish it and write this review is, I think, a testimonial to its singular kind of greatness.What kind is that? The greatness of perversity. Although Steinbeck meant this book to be a stern-browed statement on How We Live in America, Today -- as if tomorrow would never come -- forty-odd years later \\"Winter\\" is a remarkable antique, a pitch-perfect evocation of its much-ballyhooed era. Here are all the usual fifties tropes: neighbors all knew and spoke to each other, every kid had a mom and a dad, families stayed put for generations, corner bank, corner grocery -- and here is Steinbeck happily blowing them all to smithereens, reveling in the locals' hypocrisy, corruption, and xenophobia, having a splendid time steering his virtuous hero -- one Ethan Allen Hawley, something of an UberW.A.S.P. -- around various tempting and lethal shoals, pullling off a grandstanding switcheroo ending in which the hero's fate remains unclear till the last sentence.So why was it laughable? Because Steinbeck's ripsnorting righteous exposure, of course, is as worn-out as the plasticated happy-days delusion it condemns. \\"Winter\\"'s world is deader than Dickens, buried under so many layers of historical effluvia -- electronics and mass media, computers, feminism, relativism in all its forms, the end of the Cold War -- that even those old enough to remember those times groan aloud over this Ozymandias of a novel. Was there really a time when a man could talk nonstop in graduate-level literary references to a wife who appeared to have the I.Q. of a chipmunk? After I identified the 13th Shakespearean nugget in the one-sided banter of overeducated Ethan and his acorn-brained wife, I found myself wondering whether the right medication might have made Steinbeck more ready to edit himself (for the record, I doubt it). Would the nation snatch up as an instant celebrity a fourteen-year-old boy who'd won honorable mention -- honorable mention! And one of five at that -- in a patriotic essay contest? Was there actually, and did I live in, a time when the federal government would -- on an anonymous tip -- dispatch agents to hunt down one -- one! -- illegal alien? (I must admit I bonded at once with the grocer Marullo. He was after all the only ethnic in the book, and like Steinbeck's diverse Californians magnificently rendered). And was there ever a town mattress as friendly and presentable and prescient as Margie Young-Hunt? Why, this gal sleeps with every man in town, from the not-so-picturesque local drunk to the police chief, and no doubt the dogcatcher; and upstanding Ethan and his doe-eyed wife leave their CHILDREN with her for the weekend.Steinbeck's rendition of the Hawley children -- actually teenagers -- remind me of Timothy Leary's remark, made in the early 70s: \\"the genocidal hatred of a generation for its young.\\" Allen and Ellen Hawley are nasty brats, but their parents barely seem to notice their existence, and when they do, it is mostly to plot an escape from the troublesome offspring. There is, throughout the novel, an almost palpable antipathy on the part of Ethan Hawley toward his son. Allen is unpromising, to say the least, but one wonders what he and his sister might or might not have been, if someone had bothered to love them, or at the minimum make their acquaintance.The tight-lipped coldness of these people ... UberW.A.S.P. is an understatement. These people eat ham and cheese with butter AND mayo, they wash down onion sandwiches with bottles of milk. Ethan Hawley drinks a martini and straight away praises the brew as a \\"sacrament.\\" Here we have men and women who don't argue; they just fold their lips like Jo in \\"Little Women\\" and retreat into another room, or a drunk night. By the ethos of this novel, or that of the culture it purports to represent, it is better to be drunk in public than to display sober emotion. In some ways, Steinbeck's New Baytown's as exotic as Bhutan.The book works anyway, and I repeat I loved it, in large part because Steinbeck took such loving and inspired effort in its construction. Hawley's genealogy, the DNA cross he must carry, is its own potentially fascinating, if not entirely original, story. His motives and actions are consistent, as well as psychologically sound. The narrative/P.O.V. switches are seamless, and in fact I barely noticed the shifts from third-person to first and ] back again. While in good old reliable Steinbeck the reader always knows where he/she \\"is\\" -- no somersaults in time, no leapfrogging back and forth in the mode of Joyce or Conrad -- those who seek will discover envelope-pushing aplenty. Withheld information, delayed description, shell games with various characters, all testify to Steinbeck's monumental storytelling power. Dated and ridiculous as \\"Winter\\" may be, the novel is not about its setting in space and time. Ethan Hawley may be an annoying and motormouthed snob, but the reader wants to like him, wants him to end with some money in his pocket and some pride in his arid heart. Steinbeck, the writer, gets into your face; his characters creep deeper, and stay there."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"When John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1962, many felt that this book was what reminded the Prize committee of Steinbeck's greatness. Like all of his books, short stories and non-fiction journalism, this is very well written, has developed characters who readers will recognize and presents a useful moral at the end. This might be his most modern and recognizable story, however.Ethan Hawley is the well educated scion of a prominent Long Island family that has fallen on hard times and has lost its place at the top of society. Ethan is known throughout the community for his honesty and integrity, but there is pressure from everyone--his family, his boss, friends and local big wigs--for him to sacrifice his morales to earn a better living and make a name for himself. As he struggles with the temptation of a big pay day, he develops a plan which will destroy his own standards of decency, but will elevate his family back into the prestigious position he thinks they deserve.The story is well told and engaging, plus it gives readers a great opportunity to decide whether the modern society Steinbeck sees is really worth the price it costs. I would highly recommend this book to Steinbeck fans or people who enjoy good writing and stories that make them think."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Had Steinbeck not also written such works as Of Mice and Men, East of Eden, as well as The Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent would be a much better known book. On par with the books previously mentioned, Winter is an engrossing study of a man and his society. The story focuses on a middle-aged man and his family, a family that used to have much greater financial and social status. He is an honorable and philosophical man, who must wrestle with the loss of status and the obvious hypocrisy he sees around him. We watch his character gradually change as he questions himself, planning acts and then questioning them. We see as highly charged an emotional moment as Steinbeck ever wrote when, during a confrontation, our hero informs his adversary that \\"You'll feel better, sir, when you have got used to the fact that I am not a pleasant fool.\\" His children show the two possibilities for America moving forward. This book is worth serious study."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If you were forced to read \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" in high school, and a few years have passed, it's worth going back in for another read. The story is an American classic. A common grocery store clerk, Ethan Hawley, is shamed by his lowly status in a small town where his family name was once held in esteem. Believing that wealth and power will bring back that respect, Ethan sets in motion a series of events designed to return affluence to his family and political power to himself. Of course, the scheme has its victims, including those against whom Ethan is seeking revenge, and ultimately Ethan himself.Published in 1961, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" was Steinbeck's last novel. Some may criticize the book for its lack of subtlety. To be sure, the key theme -- the moral corruption of America -- surfaces throughout the novel's pages, and permeates many of its characters. While it may be true that Steinbeck avoided his usual nuance in crafting this story, to me this doesn't take away from the enjoyment of reading it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having read much of Steinbeck in my youth, I lately read one book I missed. Wow. This is a masterpiece in my view. Put it on your list, for sure. You will probably reread the final couple of chapters. You can also write your own ending."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"After writing East of Eden, JohnSteinbecks productivity in writing fiction tailed off. He seemingly had said what he wanted to say in his fiction.The novel about modern france was one of his weakest but he rebounds with his best post Eden novel, The Winter Of Our Discontent. Ethan Hawley is the clerk at a New England grocery store .The building once belonged to Hawleys family but the fortune has been lost andEthan s now a Harvard graduate working as a store manager. The scenario is rather implausible if you think about it a Harvard grad managing a small city grocery.However Steinbeck quickly gets you into Ethans mind and he does it in such a compelling you believe it. The story is about how motivated by a fortune predicted by a good friend of his wife leads Ethan to listen and pay attention to the world around him and conclude that ethics and morality do not mix well with business. Ethan does nothing illegal or criminal but he does things that are ethically and morally dubious. The last scene is deliberately ambivalent does Ethan kill himself or not In looking at moral poverty and how the consequences of being self aware of ones moral deterioratioc coupled by a desire for personal integrity for at one point it was Ethans most prized possession Steinbeck creates another 5 star classic if not as good as some of his other novels. I call it the weakest of his 5 star novels because of the implausibility I mentioned earlier but consider it a classic despite that flaw"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a very easy read. Steinbeck lays a moral foundation through the characters and develops each of them well. He shows the weaknesses of humanity through the lens of the story. In a nutshell this is a very good, well written, story of hope and possibility despite decadence, greed and corruption within all of humanity."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I was strolling the bookshop at the Monterey Bay aquarium and saw that book that I hadn't read in many years. I am recommending it, because as a seasoned adult I was able to get a whole different reading experience from it, this second time around!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", Steinbeck has us step into the shoes of an individual that I would guess is of a pretty rare breed: someone whose immediate ancestors had wealth, significance, & pedigree but all of which was recently lost, reducing this person to scratching out a living paycheck to paycheck. Ethan Hawley spends a lot of time deliberating on the greatness of his heritage and its contrast with his current situation as a grocery store clerk barely making ends meet for his wife and two children. In the course of the novel, Hawley devises a way to augment his finances even though by so doing he must justify a breach of his high moral standards. But as we learn, there's a price for everything...This is a really well written book that reads quickly. It has a more profound impact than its length of under 300 pages would indicate. I read this a couple months ago and the details are already fading, but certain scenes will remain with me I'm sure. The sad ending of course. The no-nonsense banker / businessman Mr. Baker discovering Ethan's plan. Ethan's last meeting with his drunkard old friend Danny. Ethan's foiled bank heist. A few others.In truth I'd give this 4.5 stars, if only because Ethan himself is a pretty annoying character since one can never tell if he's joking or serious. Everything else, very well done. Highly recommended. This is a serious book for adults, not light reading for kids or teens."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I recommend this book for numerous reasons; a good story, a good reflection and Steinbeck is a genious with words. This is a book written by a man with experience, one who has the ability to look backwards in his history and plumb the youth, to look forward into the mirror and see the inevitable changes time wroughts and to look future with hope and despair, in short Steinbeck's main character Ethan is a metaphor for the human condition and a glimpse into the man behind the words."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck had this book in a different fashion than I found the many others I read of his. I have always found him to be a literary god at creating character clashes (in each and every other of his I read). I loved how he had the characters interact. Althuogh this book was different. It was changed in that one character clashed with himself as much as everyone else&#8230; I was expecting maybe a lower personal ranking to his other books, but I found it just as good, and literally beautifully written. The book not only is fun to read (and im not that much of a reader) but I found its moral lesson very agreeable and useful to societies commonly immoral business habits.i suggest it to be read... though sometimes hard for some of us non readers to keep up with such deep thought, it is none the less a great read and understandable..."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I like this Steinbeck novel because it suggests ideas about morality, but requires the reader to further those ideas allowing the reader to form a relation with Steinbeck's ideas. I found this novel to be more insightful and thought out than a few of Steinbeck's other novels, notably Cannery Row. While Cannery Row and even Of Mice and Men pave a definite internal path for the reader, The Winter of Our Discontent allows the reader freedom to expand his or her mind on the ideas of morality standards and temptation.Overall, The Winter of Our Discontent reminded me of how much we, as humans, are saturated in a greedy, free-riding society. Steinbeck's story implies that maintaining one's morals within society is an impossibility, but the novel also challenges me, and other readers, to prove that wrong."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I loved this novel because of Steinbeck's mastery with images and words. Things like how he described the leaves of a tree that sprang too soon, too trusting of spring, only too be blown away when winter didn't quite leave. Or of using Easter and Resurrection to describe Ethan's transformation.I thoroughly enjoyed this Steinbeck's work of prose because of the way he described the inner conflict of Ethan Allen Hawley, using almost-perfect allegories and allusions.In a larger sense, Ethan's struggle to be true to himself while trying to improve his station is an allegory about America. This book reminds me a lot of THE GREAT GATSBY."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having recently read the over-hyped \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" proved an excellent respite from all the drivel that's being passed off these days as modern masterworks. Steinbeck is amazing."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I was pleased, but not enraptured. Whereas \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting.

It was rather descriptive and tried to dissect the human psyche. This particular book studied the effects of compromising one's morals. It was pretty good and definitely worth reading, especially for any Steinbeck obsessors (like me hehe). For those who want to get a feel of Steinbeck's writing, but don't feel like investing enough time to read Grapes of Wrath, this would work as a decent substitute."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Only bad thing in that book is atempt to answer the question.May be it is the most powerful of all Steinbeck books. May be only one of them, where author do not really know the answer.Of course, he is trying to answer. While Dostoevsky in same situation forced his hero to commit murder, Steinbeck forces world to teach hero a lesson. But he have enough taste to live hero with gains from his crime."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I recently listened to a Steinbeck book for the first time on an audio book. I liked it a lot so I went to my own bookshelf where I have several Steinbeck books (all unread), one being the Winter of our Discontent. I had started to read it in high school years ago but never finished it. I found The Winter of Our Discontent to be interesting and thought provoking. If you're thinking about whether to read it or not, my suggestion is read it. I think you'll find it worth the read."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Although the title portends a setting of bleak winter, the main plot activities take place in the heat of summer. The winter of discontent resides metaphorically, in the soul of the protagonist. Steinbeck is in great form here, and his character development is superb, most especially with the two women in the novel, who are finely drawn, studied, mysterious, fascinating. The last couple of pages, while inevitable I suppose, were sort of a let-down, and the children in the novel beg a deeper exploration. But these are smallish concerns. This novel is a fine one, open & easily accessible if one is looking for a quick read, yet also filled with philosophy, symbolism, & enough \\"opaqueness\\" to withstand deep inquiries & graduate-level studies."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I read this book for American Lit in college. Since then, I have read it 3 more times. There is something about the main character and what happens to his life that is just so very....haunting."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck? Oh, right. Steinbeck. THE Steinbeck. I can imagine the man sitting in his study on the eve on his sixth birthday. He opens that letter from his publisher, or maybe James Dean. Whoever. It's the letter same letter he's receiving for the millionth time:::John, East of Eden was... It was... Gosh! I've just got no words, man. But then again, that's you're job. Really though, you've really done it this time, the pinnacle of your literary carrier. You're golden, now just kick back and have a martini, maybe give the kids a call. Anyway you can take it easy and die in peace \`cause I happen to know that Governor Schwarzenegger is going to make an awesome speech about you in like, 50 years when he adds you to the California Hall of Fame... ::Yeah maybe he's getting pretty old at this point, but he's a writer. He doesn't like playing bingo. He doesn't want to move to Florida and sit on his ass day, he wants to write, even if he's loosing steam.I think Steinbeck's biggest mistake with this book was simply writing some of the world's most brilliant literary fiction, beforehand and not afterward. He kindof sets himself up for some pretty rigorous criticism.Ethan Hawley, admittedly, is a pretty interesting guy. His wit matched with an offhanded and loving sense of humor keeps his interactions with anyone, and sometimes even anything (the cans of produce at the Marullo grocery store, the surreptitious jury of his own subconscious) upbeat with a jolly sort of humor that adds flavor to his constant moral introspections.The rest of New Barrytown though, I couldn't seem to shake the eerie feeling that I'd landed inside a really well written 1960's sitcom. Even Margie, the town floozy, seemed antiquated, repressed, compelled or bound by the book's own courteous tone. The whole reason I love Steinbeck so much is that he usually gives narrative priority to the modalities of commonplace human life before a book's higher social or political motivation. (in Cannery Row he spends nearly an entire chapter delineating mankind's prehistoric relationship with frog hunting) I felt that here, too often, I was getting \`American capitalism breeds immorality' smeared around it my face so much, I couldn't see though to what was actually going on, i.e. a portrait of life and money in a very interesting town.Long story short, it's a good read, but nowhere as good as some of his others. Unless you just have to have it all, I'd recommend first sampling the Grapes or the Mice or the Cans."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As one who loved The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was excited to revisit Steinbeck after quite a few years. Reading this book was simply painful. I didn't like the characters, the prose seemed to drag, and it just didn't ring true. I never accepted the premise, that Ethan would change from a good and decent man to a deceitful one who turned on his friends and colleagues. Most of all, I didn't care what happened! There was the occasional brilliant phrase but I was so bored that I could barely appreciate it. I must have read a different novel than all of your other reviewers."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This price is OUTRAGEOUS for a Kindle book!!!

What I discovered was a focused and well-commented set of materials designed to provide the reader with a source-based picture into the development of early church ecclesiology. The author selects 4 Latin writers (Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Jerome) and provides a brief biography of each. Then chooses a set of source materials that highlight their conception of church government. Prior to each material, the author thoroughly describes the historical occasion which precipitates the source document.

At twenty, however, he had burned many of his poems and had vowed never to write another line. He began to wander Europe and Africa, becoming a gunrunner, a slavetrader, a construction foreman. He was a rebel in the truest sense of the world and his motto could well have been &quot;too fast to live, too young to die.&quot;Rimbaud is a remembered for his outrageous behavior as much as for his amazing literary work. Drunk on absinthe, he would insult priests, other poets, casual passersby. He was both unkempt and anti-social, to say the least, but his influence on surrealism cannot be denied and such works as A Season in Hell have exerted tremendous influence over the literary community. Rimbaud's experimentation with language and with imagery is so astounding that the reader is left bewildered and amazed.Rimbaud, in fact, established a new approach to writing. In a letter to a friend, dated 1871, he wrote, &quot;the Poet makes himself a seer by a long, immense and systematic derangement of all the senses.&quot; Rimbaud's systematic derangement released all future poets from the bourgeois bonds of the good and evil of conventional morality. For the first time, perhaps, poets felt free to explore the powerful, unarticulated, subconscious regions of the mind. As Rimbaud, himself, wrote in &quot;Alchemy of the Word,&quot; &quot;I boasted of inventing, with rhythm from within me, a kind of poetry that all the senses, sooner or later, would recognize. And I alone would be its translator...I began it as an investigation. I turned silences and nights into words. What was unutterable, I wrote down. I made the whirling world stand still.&quot; And so he did.Enid Starkie, who devoted much of her life to the study of this fascinating young rebel, tells us that Rimbaud was disgusted by those who approached poetry as a hobby or a social activity only. These writers, he said, had the soul of a banker or and accountant. &quot;The soul must be made monstrous.&quot; Rimbaud believed this with all his heart and he stated it in no uncertain terms. &quot;I say the Poet is therefore truly the thief of fire!&quot; Rimbaud, truly a man possessed of Promethean prowess and stature, also suffered endless torment. He was an outcast, rejected by society, but, though seemingly frail at times, he was really possessed of superhuman strength. It was this emotional strength that allowed him to produce poetry that was both astounding and lasting.Starkie describes how Rimbaud, with his mentor and lover, the poet, Paul Verlaine, became the sensation of both Paris and London as he attacked and insulted poets of the day for, as he put it, murdering the language. He engaged in debauchery of the most astonishing kind, but it was a debauchery that led to a sublime state of artistic creativity seldom achieved.Enid Starkie's biography is wonderful and eminently readable. It stands as the premier chronicle of Rimbaud's life and work. Anyone seeking to understand this complex young man and his equally complex work should read this book. It is, in fact, essential."},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"Enid Starkie's biography of Rimbaud, published nearly forty years ago, still stands as both the definitive narrative of Rimbaud's life and a model of literary biography.Rimbaud was a rebellious, enigmatic, brilliant, and inscrutable poet who, in just four short years between the ages of sixteen and twenty, wrote the poetry which has made him a figure of mythic proportions, not only in French literature, but in the literature and history of Modernism. Starkie, in brilliantly lucid prose and with loving attention to every detail, tells Rimbaud's life story and connects that story to the writing of the poems and the evolution of Rimbaud's views on poetry and the task of the poet.Influenced by his studies of Kabbalah, alchemy and illuminism, and writing in the long shadow of Baudelaire's \\"Les Fleurs du Mal\\", Rimbaud precociously enunciated his attack on the then dominant Parnassian school of French poetry at the tender age of sixteen. Starkie examines Rimbaud's original aesthetic doctrine in great detail; in her words, the poet must discover a \\"new language . . . capable of expressing the ineffable, a new language not bound by logic, nor by grammar or syntax.\\" In Rimbaud's words, the \\"Poet\\" must make himself a \\"seer\\" by a \\"long, immense and systematic derangement of all the senses.\\"From this initial position, Starkie brilliantly details Rimbaud's turbulent relationship with Paul Verlaine and his descent into what one reviewer has aptly described as a \\"perpetual roister of absinthe, hashish and sodomy.\\" Starkie painstakingly relates Rimbaud's poetry to his experiences with Verlaine in London and Paris. In particular, Starkie convincingly demonstrates, through careful exegesis of the poems and their correspondences with Rimbaud's letters and other biographical materials, that the \\"Illuminations\\" (perhaps Rimbaud's most brilliant poems) were written over several years preceding and following \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\". Starkie then goes on to demonstrate that the latter prose poems were hardly intended to be Rimbaud's \\"farewell to literature in general, but only to visionary literature.\\" In other words, \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\" represents the rejection by Rimbaud of his original mind-bending iconoclasm--the liquidation \\"of all his previous dreams and aspirations\\"--in favor of a rational and materialist aesthetics. Of course, after completing \\"Une Saison en Enfer\\", Rimbaud's life moved in completely different directions and there is, unfortunately, no existing evidence that he continued his poetic endeavor after the age of twenty.Starkie's biography captures the details of the remainder of Rimbaud's life--he died at the age of thirty-seven--with fascinating and attentive detail. And the remainder of his life, as related by Starkie, is a biography in itself--vagabond in Europe, sailor to the East Indies, gun runner and (slave?) trader in Abyssinia, and mysterious cult hero of the emerging French symbolist movement. Indeed, in 1888, more than fourteen years after Rimbaud's known literary career had ended, he received a letter from a prominent Parisian editor: \\"You have become, among a little coterie, a sort of legendary figure . . . This little group, who claim you as their Master, do not know what has become of you, but hope you will one day reappear, and rescue them from obscurity.\\" Starkie scrutinizes all of these events with scrupulous attention to detail and accuracy.This is truly a classic of literary biography!

If you are not fluent in French, you should have Wallace Fowlie's English translation of Rimbaud's Complete Works and Selected Letters by your side as a reference.)"},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"Enid Starkie's biography of Rimbaud, published nearly forty years ago, still stands as both the definitive narrative of Rimbaud's life and a model of literary biography.

Rimbaud is an excellent subject because he led such a fascinating and contradictory life. He went from being the archetypal enfant terrible and prototypical bohemian poet to an engineer in Egypt without any interest in the Parisian literary &quot;scene&quot; whatsoever. Along the way was his enigmatic relationship with Verlaine and Verlaine's wife. Starkie doesn't answer all the questions we are left with regarding this singular artist. Nobody can. It's not even clear what caused his relatively early death. What Starkie does provide is an intelligently illuminated portrait of Rimbaud and provides us with the background for the well of angst into which he dipped his vituperous pen. I can't believe that Starkie's equally compelling bio of Baudelaire is not listed ........ If this book is out of print, it's criminal. It's almost a companion piece to her Rimbaud. It should also be read by anyone interested in French poetry, literary history, or great literary biography."},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"There is no doubt that Rimbaud presents a complex, almost contradictory metaphor for the life of the &quot;Literary Voyant.&quot; He is embraced by various communities who identify with certain aspects or should I say phases of his life. I have read many essays, books, and bits and pieces on his life, poetry. As a lover of Rimbaud, I feel Starkie has captured the poet as no other. She looks into his mind and sees what others cannot see. This is the real Rimbaud, as real as we are ever going to know him. When I read this book, I always think of how Starkie closed her bio, with a little boat tossed drunkenly on the waves. Don't miss this book. It's what a literary biography should be, unbiased, thoughtful, and intelligent."},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"Although this is the only Arthur Rimbaud biography I've read, it seems to me very well-written and true to his life. Enid Starkie is perhaps the leading non-French expert scholar on Rimbaud and this long seminal work is very readable and comprehensive. I learned a lot about the life of the man who was one of my favorite poets in my teens. It's amazing when you consider that he wrote all his stuff before he was 20, and that he then suddenly stopped writing altogether. He became lost to literature in his quest to make money and become a successful business man (trader in Africa). One of the most intriguing things in the book is how it talks about \\"La Chasse Spirituelle\\" which Verlaine calls Rimbaud's masterpiece, and which has since been lost. I wonder what happened to this work, and it's a great pity that we will never be able to read it. One of the other many things I found interesting was that Rimbaud apparently changed his view on God when he was on his deathbed, as his relgiously devout sister Isabelle pleaded with him to be converted. The cocky and rebellious kid who tried to use alchemy and occult magic to become as powerful as God, who as a 16-year-old punk used to write (...) on the church door, was now in his late 30s a humble, broken, and resigned man who turned to God for comfort and salvation. That may have been important to the fate of his soul, but what is important to us is his written words. And even though Rimbaud only wrote for about 5 years of his life, his contribution to poetry is timeless.(...)"},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"A marvelous example of the biographical art. Enid Starkie gets right at the fury and pain and intensity of Rimbaud's fiery life, combining the detail and digressions that make biographies readable, and excellent critical insight to his poems and the life situations that shaped them. I had been reading Rimbaud for years when I came across this book and it made me go back to his poems anew, finding various translations and comparing them. Suddenly I had the key to this savage parade! Rimbaud's poems cracked open, and I realized I had barely understood his work.

Nevertheless , it has some serious mistakes that the readers and mainly the lovers of Rimbaud must know. Starkie stained the memory of Rimbaud accusing him of having done slaves traffic. Detailed studies have proved that this was absolutely impossible. (You can read the books of Alain Borer, Graham Robb, Charles Nicholl...)Starkie wants to show us a rimbaud that failed in Abyssinia. It seems that he deserved a punishment for having left the poetry. The truth is that Arthur Rimbaud was an excellent trader that made a little fortune.A few moths ago I went to Charleville. There, the Rimbaud's museum has a place where important studies about Rimbaud are shown. In spite of the Starkie's play is very well-known, it has not earned a place there."},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"It is difficult to imagine a book on Rimbaud (or anyone else, for that matter) which contains more detail than this one. In addition, it is very readable and is definitely &quot;unputdownable&quot;. The reader follows Rimbaud from his birth place Charleville, through his life in the capitals of Western Europe (Paris, Brussels and London), to his wanderings in Africa and his final return to France.On the downside, while I can well imagine the reason for doing so, I found it a bit disappointing that the poems and letters - which are quoted at length in the book - are not translated into English. I guess this is more a critique of my own ignorance of French than a critique of Starkie's (some would say &quot;wise&quot;) decision to leave her primary source untranslated and, therefore, uncorrupted.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this youthful visionary."},{"Title":"Arthur Rimbaud","review":"I loved this book when I first read it back in the day.

I was moved by several of the short nuggets of prose that were exhumed from a splattering of ideas on a dart board. I have heard it said that if you throw enough darts at a dart board, you will hit the bulls-eye at least once. I think this is true of this work. That is not to say that it is intrinsically bad by any means. I just see too much mash-up of ideas and emotion that possibly lead to revelation when set in a whole but as a finished work it seems just to scatterbrained. I want some more organization in the writing. I prefer if you are reading things that just don't seem to make sense at first later lead to some greater enlightenment.

However, elements related to Navy or military diving, surface supplied air, and hardhat diving are of academic value to most SCUBA divers. Often looked for and thus should be mentioned, both Manuals cover thoroughly diving medicine: USN chamber decompression, dangerous marine animals, and emergent care procedures. However, NOAA's emphasis on SCUBA and many items with some relevance to sport divers, such as survey methods or search and recovery techniques, put it ahead of the USN Manual, on a relevance per dollar basis. One item of note, the USN Manual seems to have omitted the long term 02 exposure tables ... this maybe problematic as nitrox increases in popularity.The USN Diving Manual is written in an easier to read format compared to the NOAA Diving Manual, and is excellent as a pocket synopsis [ the waterproof USN Diving Handbook.] It can be read quickly, but is also very procedural: do item 1-2-3-4-5. NOAA is more conceptual. However, given its cost [free as a pdf download from the US Navy or Army public websites] the USN Diving Manual has elements for civilian divers and is less wordy per topic that the verbose NOAA manual, to make it an excellent part of a Diving library."},{"Title":"United States Navy Diving Manual, Revision 4","review":"Yes. I read this whole thing in the last week or so.The U.S. Navy Diving Manual is probably the most complete single reference on diving based on the most extensive research and experience in the world. Its five volumes discuss mixed-gas and oxygen rebreathers, no-decompression diving, open-circuit SCUBA (&quot;conventional&quot; SCUBA), surface-supplied air and mixed-gas (nitrox and heliox) diving, the diving environment, Navy dive procedures, physics, physiology and recompression chamber operation.Unfortunately, the recreational diver, or even the tech diver, may not find much in here that they can apply to their own diving that they don't already know from the materials from their certification classes. An open water diver will already have no-compression tables, and a tech diver will already already have decompression tables from air and mixed gas. Also, the recreational SCUBA diver may be disappointed to find that the Navy (in my inference anyway, from reading this) eschews OC SCUBA in favor of surface-supplied except when surface-supplied is impractical. You may also bog down reading the sections on Navy procedure. (If recreational divers used these protocols, the number of crew and number of divers on a party dive boat would be reversed!)A recreational diver looking for more information on recreational OC SCUBA beyond the superficial coverage of open water class materials might be better served by the PADI Encyclopedia of Recreational Diving.However, the USN Diving Manual covers things that you won't see elsewhere, such as safe operating distances from SONAR and explosives!I recommend this reference if you are like me - just curious about diving, how the military does it, and/or wants to have a complete reference library on diving."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Shakespeare Handbooks)","review":"As an actor and theatre practitioner, any resource i can find on performance and clarifying the text or offering ideas on the text is invaluable on my way to working with Shakespeare's text. Any tool that will help you get that inspiration you need or click into place with some idea you have been mulling over but haven't quite figured out, this book might help.What is nice is often the editors that are writing these books in the Shakespeare Handbooks, are not just scholars, but come mostly from Shakespeare in Performance backgrounds as Directors (and still are).One of my favorite features is the performance history sections. You can read up on what choices and problems other actors had with the show and questions they had about their characters that you as an actor might find very helpful. I think actors shouldn't be afraid of the choices other actors have made in a famous role, because often actors will encounter the same problems as others and why not look to the best for how they might have solved them or asked things differently. Just a thought...Overall, a good tool."},{"Title":"The Merchant of Venice (Shakespeare Handbooks)","review":"This series (Shakespeare Handbooks) is a new one with only a handful of plays covered. My only complaint is that they don't have more of the plays done!This is an outstanding book that gives a sense of historical perspective, but spends the vast (and I mean VAST) majority of its pages discussing \\"The Merchant of Venice\\" as a PLAY. It doesn't focus on close reading or nudging some obscure reference to a historical event that has faded from view. Instead, it brings the text to life by offering some insights into how the scene may be presented on stage. It goes scene by scene, with a thorough, but not overwhelming, commentary into how the scene plays out in the theatre.For those who want to approach Shakespeare as a playwright rather than simply as a poet, these are invaluable resources."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"Comprehensive account of all WWII PT Operations.

Everytime a boat goes out through out the entire book, the author quotes the captains full name and rank to the point your eyes glaze over.

At times it read like more of a after action report than an authors opinion."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This book is a thorough history of American PT boat operations in World War Two. It covers all battle actions of the boats and what they accomplished in all theaters that the boats operated in -- the South Pacific, the Aleutians, and in Europe and the Mediterranean, an area of the PT boat war that, for some reaon, has had much less coverage than what these boats did in the Pacific. It also details the origins and developements of the boats, and the vastly complicated logistical problems covering huge distances that often bedeviled the boats and their crews. The book features many photographs of the boats and their crews and how they lived, as well as a complete list of every man killed or wounded on a PT boat during the war, as well as the numerous medals awarded to pt boat crews. It is a great record of these versatile boats and their courageous sailors.Yet, it is a dry history. There is little or nothing about the men that sailed these boats into harm's way. Where did they come from? Why did they choose the dangers of a PT boat? What led them to go up against destroyers in plywood/mahongeny boats? A little bit of that and it would have been a fantastic account of the pt boats. Still, for anyone that loves naval history this is an incredible book."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"My father was a PT sailor during World War II in the Solomon Islands, then stateside for the last 2 years of the war.

Does not describe the boat configurations at all though. This would have been a good supplement. Overall very interesting."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This is a rare book. By that I mean the author has not just used the after action reports of the various boats but also given a detailed listing of awards received, casualities listed individually, and the short life history of each boat. As a historian I can tell you this is a monumental work in research. I knew a little about the boats being used to put intelligence teams in, my Dad was one of them when he commanded the 41st Infantry Div Reconnisance Troop. All he ever told me about working with the PTs was they were good men to work with, from him that was a high complement. While for many people may this book may seem dry, to those of us that have studied World War II it is far from it and I strongly recommend this book to anyone that is intrested in the little known facts of the US Navy in World War II."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"This book opened my eyes to the fact that there was more than one PT Boat, the 109, employed during WWII. Forthose interested in the employment of PT boats during the war, this is a good start.The book also covers the various makes and models of PT boats. The book covers how the various models weretested before acceptance by the Navy, the different equipment installed on the various boats as the warprogressed and their missions changed. It also covers some of the missions the boats carried out withtheir success or failure."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"I bought this for my Dad who was on PT-224.

Essentially it's a collection of blow-by-blow descriptions of every PT boat ever commissioned with such facinating details as; when it was commissioned, when it joined a squadron, names of crew members, when they got promoted, etc. Granted some of this information was interesting but after 3 or 4 chapters is becomes quite repetitive and dull. Some of the combat narratives start to bread up the monontony but I found them few and usually brief. I would say this book is ideal for the dedicated Naval historian. If it's important to you to know when 'Joe Blow' got promoted to Captn' or Commander, and when it was decided to move squadron X from island A to island B, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy","review":"Excellent book overall. It gives a complete story of the actions of PT Boats in all the theaters of operations. i personally never really knew much about the actions of PT boats in other places than the Solomon's.

The viper bites his calf, but he survives because his twelve year old son witnessed the incident and screamed for help. His wife and his heir believe the obvious culprit is either a family member, an un-loyal servant, or another member of the inner retinue. However, an unrecognized son by a different woman Kashif Pasha believes the NR is behind the assault.To protect the Emir and to uncover the assassin, former cop turned private investigator Ashraf Bey, who may be another unacknowledged offspring of the prolific Emir is hired. The genetically altered Ashraf struggles to uncover who wants the Emir dead; he leans towards the North African rebellion as the source so he goes undercover as a laborer in the lair of the enemy the metropolis of El Iskandryia while his maybe ten years old niece Hana al-Mansour better known as Hani decides to become Uncle Raf's \\"apprentice\\".The Third Arabesk alternate history Ottoman Empire Noir (see PASHAZADE AND EFFENDI) is a terrific who-done-it starring a fabulous hard boiled sleuth who is softened by his niece. The story paints quite a vivid picture of a world in which the Ottoman Empire still exists in the twenty-first century. The complex sty line takes the audience all over from Manhattan to the Ifriqiy Desert to El Iskandryia and elsewhere without missing a beat so that the reader knows this is the real stuff. Reading the previous novels would be worth the effort as they are amongst the best in the sub-genre, Jon Courtenay Grimwood cleverly intertwines the key elements into this excellent entry. FELAHEEN makes three winners in a row.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Felaheen","review":"A wild tapestry of a thoroughly enjoyable story. There are elements of sci-fi, alternate history, fantasy, mystery, quest, fairy tale and more. The hard-boiled tagging of this book shouldn't put off readers who don't usually incline to that breed of book -- it's our hero's will more than any beat-em-up and leave-em-dying that's really hard-boiled. There is violence, but it's neither excessive or gratuitous.The warp-speed tale is colorful, incredibly convoluted and quick, and challenging: you've got to stop every so often to figure out if you've kept up with all the inferences and developments. With all this, there's more than a sprinkling of dry humour and sarcasm to whet the sharpness of this tale. And if you want to see a really hot and hellish restaurant kitchen, this is the place.Despite the alternate history aspects - the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany still exist - this is a recognizable modern world, advanced technology, bio-medical tinkering (one fantasy element), and the contemporary range of mores we are now familiar with in the Muslim world.A final note - I was pleasantly surprised that this not a travelogue with action thrown around some famous sites. It takes place where it needs to. Not a pyramid or sphinx in sight, but wonderful dramatic support from the deserts, kitchens as noted already, and boulevards.An altogether breathless and entertaining experience."},{"Title":"Felaheen","review":"Having enjoyed the first 2 I was waiting for this one.It didn't disappoint,fast moving and continuing on.If you havent read the others I think you won't make heads or tails of it but as a set great.An original idea with Arabic tones but not religious was interesting."},{"Title":"Klimke on Dressage: From the Young Horse Through Grand Prix","review":"If, on the other hand, you are looking for lots of pictures of great riders and equally great horses, this is it!

I was in the middle of reading it when my beloved husband had to have emergency open-heart surgery so I took it with me to read in the hospital. I would normally have been worried and very scared, but instead I felt quite calm and accepting of the situation as it unfolded. This book has the power to completely remove fear from your life. It shows you that there really is NOTHING to be afraid of. Fear of the future, fear of death, fear of change or unpleasant circumstances, it's all unnecessary. This is a staggeringly huge gift and the knowledge will change your life.This book used to be titled Freedom from Judgment and reading it will give you a whole new insight into how the world and life really look without the clouding lens of judgment. You will experience a new way of seeing yourself and the people around you. You will also never look at crime and justice the same way.I highly, highly, highly recommend this book to anyone.

I was fascinated by the extensive knowledge Andreas had in Ayuvedic medicine and the human digestive system. At that time I purchased the 1st edition of, \\"Lifting the Veil of Duality\\" called, \\"Freedom From Judgment\\" as well as, \\"The Key to Health and Rejuvenation\\".These books have been instrumental in my growth as a human being and correlated with other modern philosophies: ie; Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, as well as many ancient understandings. Almost 10 years ago, when reading and trying to understand these philosophies I had two contributing factors that got in my way; fear and denial. When I read some of the one star reviews I am reminded of that time. Today, I stand for all possibilities. Life is no longer a struggle. It has become an evolving masterpiece of the person that I have always been. I look forward to buying the revised edition. Although I've managed to keep it together my original copy is in pieces."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil of Duality","review":"My life has had good days and challenging days. This marvelous book has helped me discover that every day I have the opportunity to freshly re-start my life without carrying forward the baggage I have accumulated the day before--even all the days before. Moritz slowly helped me build a foundation for making this possible by enabling me to question without fear all my beliefs about living the \\"good life.\\" This enabled me to replace them with a much more coherent, logical and practical approach to living with much less stress, strain and concern.This required no great leaps of faith on my part. He helped me build a new paradigm about meaning and purpose in one's life, and gently offered the \\"how-to\\"s I could put into practice with amazing results. Yes, it took some courage to let go of my past patterns dealing with day-to-day issues. But as I did, the results were worth every ounce of effort a hundredfold. I have given this book to many friends who have observed my calmer and happier countenance and questioned me about it."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil of Duality","review":"I highly recommend this book.

I read this book on a cross Atlantic flight and never has such a journey seemed so short. I regard this book as a must read for anyone awake enough to realise that they are on a spiritual path."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil of Duality","review":"This is a very interesting work where the author is discussing aspects of our spiritual existence and general understanding of the world that and life. It addresses some essential aspects of our understanding of life and time, questioning the existence of the duality itself. It displays, in essence, a \\"holistic\\" (ore should we call it \\"wholeistic\\") approach to explaining the quintessence of our beginnings. More than that, this book is a real in-home psychiatrist and friend. It helped me regain my self during a very difficult time in my life, when nothing else seemed to. There is a gentle smile that goes through every line in this book.The author offers his own theory of the meaning of our existence and our souls, without forcing this theory upon the reader. Yet, he makes the reader feel powerful and free, without having to believe in his theory. While reading some chapters may bring smile to one's face, as they seem too naive to a 21st century-technology driven-science conscious-realist reader, the author seems to want it to be taken just like that, with a smile, and here and there one encounters real words of wisdom and kindness.One criticism is the repetitiveness in the volume. While in his more specifically medicinal books Moritz is perfectly concise and on point, here you find the same phrase repeated numerous times, which gets a bit tiring at times. Other than that, this is a most valuable volume, and until recently I used to carry it in my suitcase (was there for over a year!)."},{"Title":"Lifting the Veil of Duality","review":"This is one of those books that you'll keep on your shelf and go back to several times.

Read it and feel it... once you complete reading it, then if you want to and feel like, try to see if you can really make sense of it with the normal mind.

This line of thinking comes from the same mindset as the chauvinists that proclaim that if a woman gets raped, she asked for it.We then go to chapter 2, where murderers and terrorists are no worse than people who spent their entire lives living by The Golden Rule. I guess this might also apply to anyone who strangles Andreas Moritz?This book went right into my stove. I am glad that I got it second hand at a flea market instead of paying full price for it.

Her colorful, descriptive style of writing really opens the mind to the world that she presented---we get more than a glimpse, we get the whole story."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This was Ms Ali's debut novel, and was shortlisted for the 2003 Man Booker Prize. While Brick Lane is about a particular set of experiences for a specific set of characters, it is also more broadly about the dislocation experienced by all migrants.Brick Lane tells the story of Hazneen, who came to England from Bangladesh at the age of 18 for an arranged marriage to Chanu. When she arrives, she has very limited English, but falls into the role of a dutiful wife to a man who is also culturally dislocated and whose rigid adherence to remembered custom and practice renders him sadly ineffectual.This novel explores cultural difference, family ties and associated impacts on individuals.Highly recommended - not because it provides all of the answers or instant understanding but because it identifies so many of the questions.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane is a novel about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman who moves to London for an arranged marriage with a Bangladeshi man who had been living there for several years before. In the background of the story is the pre and post 9/11 lives of Muslim immigrants in the west provided from Nazneen's perspective. The character struggles with the question \\"can people change their fate?\\" Nazneen herself was born as a very weak baby and was left to her fate by her family because they believed one should not intervene with what has been planned for them. But Nazneen also doubts \\"if one changes the course of fate, may be their fate was such that the course of events were meant to be altered anyway.\\"The book became controversial in the Bangladeshi community in London especially when a film based on the book was planned to be made. Some felt that the book or the film would give the wrong impression about Bangladeshi life in London.This book was a difficult read for me since I did not really feel much affection for any of the characters. This may of course be because the author made them so real that they had all the faults that real people have."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This book was captivating. Ali lets the reader into the mind main character, Nazneen, and all the new experiences she must encounter and to which she must react (or not react). Ali provides poignant examples of the variety of reactions from which someone in Nazneen's position might choose, and she portrays the English-Bangladeshi culture at once critically and lovingly - vividly, to say the least. Intermingled are letters from Nazneen's sister, Hasina, who remains in Dhaka. These are some of the most insightful passages in the novel. The life Hasina leads is full of pain and joy, trials and pleasure, and the life of a lone woman in a Bengali city is portrayed with tenderness, vividness, and honesty.Ali is not afraid to bump into many issues, of gender, justice, theology, philosophy, and individuality. It is a quick enough read, but still a well-written novel - a hard coupling to come by.One of my favourite things about the book were the descriptions of Bengal. Having personally reached out over rice paddy, having felt the sun and community in the Bengali village, having breathed the humid and dusty - perfect air, and hidden beneath the palm trees and among the water buffalo, I deeply appreciated stepping into Nazneen's rich memories of home."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time. The author has a remarkable ability to make you care about her characters, from the amazing development of the heroine, to the wide variety of supporting characters."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Review Brick LaneMonica Ali who came to Great Britain at the age of three as the daughter of a English mother and a Bangladeshi father, wrote with Brick Lane in my opinion a wonderful book.Brick Lane, a street in London's East End, is home to many Bangladeshi immigrants since they came as seamen in the 20th century.We accompany Nazneen, the main character, from her birth in Bangladesh over her arranged marriage to the 20 years older Chanu who brings her to London to that point of her life she develops to a woman with an own will.In the course of the book the issue of Fate plays an important role. It comes up the first at Nazneen's tragic birth and the question whether Fate should decide will accompany Nazneen during the years.In contrary to her sister Hasina: she decides to take her life in her own hand and leaves her brutal husband to work in a sewing factory.We get to know her better by reading her letters to Nazneen. They include also a very vivid and touching description of the country Bangladesh and the role of women there.In general the descriptions in Brick Lane are definitly a plus. Monica Ali has the skill to describe every little detail in such a fascinating and lively way that you really feel as a part of it. The descriptions, often interlarded with similes and methapors, function as the spice of Nazneen's rather gloomy atmosphere in Tower Hamlet.Monica Ali succeeded in representing the never ending inner-conflict of immigrants with the western civilisation. As supporting characters, like Chanu and Mrs. Islam, show, London (in this case) is just a station for succeeding in a job and for making money to send it home or to save it for home-coming. But during that time the moral values and the traditions from back home threaten to get lost. This omnipresent apprehension becomes clear by focusing on Chanu, on the way he oppresses his children and by looking at Karim who has never been in Bangladesh but fights with all weapons for his religion and its traditions.Focusing on Brick Lane's characters has always been a pleasure because all of them are brilliant represented.With its partly humorous but also very touching and sad sides every page of the book is an adventure and absolutely worth to be read."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I didn't expect much from this book at the beginning and yet became engaged by the mundane characters. The characters come to life and some who start off as fairly despicable become endearing towards the end. The book has color and verve and though the hard lives of the characters might be depressing, the overall novel is quite uplifting. Highly recommended! There's a film waitng to be made in this book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I thought this book was very original. I really enjoyed how it was written from the point of view of the main character's interior life, which was very effective because at the beginning of the story, she didn't speak English. We watch her grow and learn English as well as about herself and life.The contrast of her life to that of the sister who remained back home is revealing. It is the life she would have had if she had not come to England.It is a story of culture clash as well as assimilation and is beautifully written."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"this reading is excellent..save that it is abridged..why oh why?..monetary reasons i presume. certainly they are not &quot;improving&quot; the novel. a shame really, but still the reading is well done and brings the characters to life."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I got through maybe half of the book and put it down for a week. I thought it might not apply to me, that maybe I was too different or too far from that culture for it to feel relevant.In that week, I realized that she was struggling with almost exactly the same questions I was. She was coming to the same unacceptable, or desireable, answers. And she was getting there by a completely different route.I started reading it again.I keep thinking about it even though I finished it a month ago. Perhaps it's a slow-acting book. At least it's working that way on me. Every now and then I get a glimmer of the wisdom that's there.It's a good book. It's well written. I suppose I'm disappointed because what I'm seeing in it isn't magical, cure-all wisdom. It's the wisdom that people gain and use, almost only when it's not easy."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I can't remember the last novel I read that created such a wonderful character as Nazneen. I thought of Faulkner when reading the italicized passages about her sister. The little philosophic twists of insight throughout the novel completed for me what was the ultimate reading experience."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane is a promising debut that deals with a woman, Nazneen, who is raised up with the mentality that she cant change her fate. Married off to another Bengali, Chanu in London, she assumes a servile role in her matrimonial home. While the novel itself shows potential since it addresses the possibility of changing our destiny, the tome is sometimes marred by belabored and unnecessary writing/descriptions. For instance, the first page, about the mother preparing a chicken is way too descriptive and repititive. Then, the unintelligible letters sent to Nazneen by her sister, Hasina is hard to even comprehend what the story is all about. I mean, if they were mistakes here and there, that could be tolerable but forcing oneself to gain an insight on the sister's predicament/challenges back home was very hard and not worth immersing myself into. There are a whole lot of characters in the novel that you cant even figure out who is who in the novel. So, while the novel itself comes up with an interesting subject line,(is it possible to change one's destiny) it does not live upto the hype accorded it. For once, I cant see how it was 'wildly embraced by critics'... when it was monotonous to read the same thing over and over again."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I really regret having bought and having read this book. The first few pages seem to start off well, with the birth of the main character Nazeen. Appearing to be a still born she somehow comes back to life after which her parents decide that she should not be taken hospital but instead be Left To Her Fate. This of course becomes the central theme of the book, how she struggles with taking action or being passive in her life. At first the book's start impressed me, but after a while it dawned on me she stole this idea from Rushdie, who often has a very dramatic event occur within the first few pages that becomes symbolic for events thereafter. But Rushdie doesn't beat the symbolism to death! He leaves it there for you to discover. In Brick Lane literally hundreds of times we are reminded that Nazeen was Left To Her Fate. So even this apparently good (although plagiarized) opening is spoiled. The rest of the book is basically just drivel, with the exception of one decent passage while Nazeen son is in the hospital. I've read books with 1 dimensional characters, but as I read this book I was wondering if it was possible to have 0 dimensional characters and events? Characters so lacking they suck out your personality as you read? The end of the book is just a nose dive into abysmal. It's so bad its offensive. Nazeen leaves her apartment to go looking for her daughter and spots a young girl somewhere and remarks, \\"Nazeen had learned to recognize the face of a refugee child that traumatized stillness, the need they have to learn to play again\\". Not only is this overly sentimental, up until this point there had been no mention of refugees or the struggles of refugees. What offends me here is that this book does not handle any big issues (racism, poverty, refugees,..) it co-opts them, and it rubs me the wrong way just the same way that those Shell Oil commercials claiming they care about the environment did. Even the title, Brick Lane, which is a trendy ethnic area in London, feels dishonest to me. Brick Lane would be a great title for a book about poverty, ghettos and gentrification; of course nothing that real is ever mentioned. If you want to read trash then at least read honest trash, this book is trash and dishonest."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Its not a bad read, better than some of the other asian-culture books I have read. The book is about Nazneen, a Bangladeshi, who is at 18 years married off to a UK-based Bangladeshi, some 20 years her senior. The book revolves arounf her life in the East End of London, and her silent struggles. I felt that the book was like a great looking sandwich, with fresh bread, however, the filling was a little soggy! In other words, the beginning and ending are captivating, but the middle was a little slow. I would have liked to have read more about Nazneens relationship with Karim. The letters from her sister slowed the whole reading experience down a bit - and I could have done without this."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"It always makes me feel bad to critise a novel when, as in the case of 'Brick Lane' by Monica Ali, the author has placed her heart and soul into every word. This colourful story of Bangladeshi-Engish cultural blending is certainly passionate. However if it weren't for this passion the book would be a dud; it attempts to cover way too much ground (drugs, infidelity, inter-religious issues, inter-cultural issues, Bangladeshi folklore, etc). By mid-way I wasn't sure the whether author knew where she was going with 'Brick Lane'. Less would have been a lot more.As for the story itself, it is about a young Bangladeshi woman and her husband (from an arranged marriage) who settle in an east London council flat. Both of them have difficulties maintaining their Islamic values in this very foreign country, with their children seemingly suffering even more. The author does a fine job in describing the heartache of these Bangladeshi families who are most often trapped in their own homes, afraid to leave. However as the story progresses the author, as I explain above, losses focus. And this reader gradually lost interest. Yet thanks to Monica Ali I think I understand my east London neighbours a bit better.Bottom line: Monica Ali's love of Bangladesh and London permeate 'Brick Lane'. This alone makes it an impressive debut."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I picked up this book expecting another White Teeth, and I was initially disappointed that Monica Ali's story was less cross-cultural and loose-limbed. But soon enough, I found myself intrigued by Nazneen, frustrated by her hapless husband, and eager to see things come to a head. Some things just didn't pan out - the letters from Bangladesh, for instance, though interesting in their own right and a valid counterpoint to events in England, never became essential until the very end. Significant events like Amma's death were buried beneath the detritus of Nazneen's shadow life until late in the novel; as result the last quarter of the book felt like a new story about a familiar character. I would have liked a smoother ramp to the book's exciting conclusion, but complaining about that feels a bit like criticizing life for its odd rhythm. Brick Alley has a natural pace and form that reflect experience more than artifice. In the end, I cheered for Nazneen, her daughters, and her sisters who escape the heavy hands of patriarchy and self-destruction. In some ways this book of liberation reminds me of The Color Purple, but I didn't delight in Ali's voice the way I did in Walker's. That may be simply a cultural difference or an aesthetic choice, but the selections from Tagore, although sententiously recited by Chanu, the husband, ring with a lyricism that was too often missing in the rest of the novel. I enjoyed hanging out on Brick Lane, sampling its curry and checking out the fashions, but in the end I felt like I was seeing a faade more than the real thing."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"i was expecting a novel which was going to be unique since it was nominated for so many awards but was disappointed. The novel drags on and there is no definite path it takes...i am not sure what message the author was trying to send...the characters were not clearly etched...i thought it was about the struggles of an immigrant girl in london but all it did was ramble..i have to be careful to pick authors based on nominations for &quot;awards&quot;..."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"It was dissapointing. It was long and got boring after the first 150 pages. Towards the end, when the Muslim League agenda comes in, it was unbearable. I was reading every alternate page. Nazneen's sister, Hasina's story would have been more compelling and interesting. The protagonist's character lacks depth. Overall, Ali should have kept the book shorter, got rid of the religious aspect and strengthen her characters."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Reading the rave reviews , i bought this book. Writers from Indian subcontinent(India, Pakistan and Bangladesh) has done some brillant writing , about migrant community in Britan.Example of this writing is Hanif Khureishi (Black Album, Buddha of Subarbia). While khureishi's Buddha of Suburbia represents the best of this crop,Brick Lane is among the forgettable ones. The pace is slow and characters live unbelivably boring lives. The narratives itself unexciting in most places. I worked my way thorough work and never enjoyed it. The author is no story teller, though she seems to know her characters and their ways well. But who wants to read abt some Bangaldeshi housewife ( or for that matter any housewife) holed up in their boring existence ? (maybe some Westerner who want more of Eastern exotica , but up dated to modern day political correctness.)At one stage the book peeks into world of South Asian millitant Islam in U.K. Other authors have explored similar terrain ( Khureishi in Black Album,) and they done a zillion times better.But there are dim flashes of brillance in the books. Sometimes the insights seems authentic and then the characters comes alive, transporting us to their world.All in all ,rather avoidable book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I was really excited to read this book being a huge fan of Indian literature. Unfortunately, this book did not captivate my interest and I had to put it down after a hundred pages or so. It was very slow going and the plot could not keep me interested enough to read the whole book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book, having read so much about it. It is also a subject close to my heart, because I am a Bengali woman who doesn't live in her homeland. It began promisingly enough,(but what on earth was that about the rice stalks as tall as skyscrapers?)but doesn't keep it up. Most reviewers have complained about Hasina's letters to her sister. My understanding of them at the start, having tried to translate them back into Bengali, was that they were a literal, word for word translation from Bengali. They don't continue that way, but I think this is what the author intended.The characters could have been fleshed out so much better. They felt cold and one-dimensional. I felt more of a connection with Zadie Smith's Samad and Alsana than with Nazneen. Chanu comes across a pompous, sorry figure...I know many men who are like Chanu, but they are usually less benign than he; men who know everything are usually more aggressive- it doesn't fit. Nazneen is not really shown growing as a person; all at once, she seems to acquire the courage to speak her mind. The ending-this is England, you can do anything- is reminiscent of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and Bharati Mukherjee,; that the West equals freedom. and it is impossible to be free in the Third World. Of course, she reminds us that women in Bangladesh get acid thrown on their faces; this is horrifying and has been going on for several years, though many of her readers will have heard of it for the first time.So, you are meant to think, isn't Nazneen lucky, that she escaped that? Ali also misses the fact that immigrant communities are usually steeped in the values of their homeland at the time they left, so that Bangladeshis in London might be more conservative than those in Dhaka or Mymensingh.For Westerners, maybe this book is a bit of exotica, but I don't see what the fuss is about. It's not a bad book, but I doubt I'll remember it in 5 years time."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Nanzeen is a Bangladeshi woman who marries young, sent to Britain to a husband chosen by her father. This book follows her journey, from naive village girl to mother of two living in modern London.This book has been highly feted since before its publication (the author made it onto the Granta authors under 40 list based on an unpublished manuscript). As usually happens, this book doesn't quite live up to expectations. It has its faults - Ali uses the device of letters written by Nanzeen's sister to forward the plot, and while in short doses it is interesting, she over-uses it and a whole chapter of these letters is too much, especially as they are written in childish, broken English. And the pivotal affair between Nanzeen and a young Islamic activist is not very credible.But there is more good about this book than bad - every character feels well rounded, and their motivations seem plausible without being overly obvious. This is a book that touches on a lot of political points (Islam, women's rights, culture clash etc) but avoids the soapbox and none feels shoehorned in. Most importantly, this is an interesting story well written that carries you along to the very end. While the setting and plot on first inspection could be considered mundane - a woman living in a council flat who does little else but cook, clean and care for her husband &amp; children - is developed into an interesting story by great characterisation and a vibrant spin on universal themes. This is a longish book - over 400 pages - but it doesn't read as such. Taken on its own merits, rather than as the great 'Bangla' hope, this is a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I honestly don't get it. As another reviewer suggested, this writer is just the luckiest girl alive....she's riding a hot wave of interest in ethnic fiction, and the Bangladesh/London setting is what must have sold this book. It can't be the writing. This is one of the most painfully boring and slow moving stories that I have read. The opening is quite good, but from there it just fizzles. We know far too much of her old husband Chandu and his weird habit of playing with his stomach. She repeats things endlessly in this book. The letters from the sister are also painful to read, and as someone else mentioned for some unknown reason they are in broken english, which makes zero sense. The letter would have been written in their native tongue, and unless the sister has dyslexia or is completely illiterate, it just make no sense to have her writing be so bad.This book is just so easy to put down. It amazes me that for all the really good books out there, this one is garnering so much unwarranted attention."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"For the first 200 pages, Brick Lane is absolutely fascinating and the story of Nazneen, her childhood in Bangladesh and how he she is married off to London really grabs. But from then on, the story starts to drag a bit (like some other reviewers, I couldn't get into the 40 pages of Hasina's letters, written in broken English).Still, all in all I think the hype for this book is deserved: The alienation of Bangladeshis in London is very well described, the characters in the book are multilayered and believable (for example, Chanu, Nazneen's husband, is a gem and Mrs Islam adds some color, too) and there is enough substance, inelligence and feeling to fill half a dozen of lesser books. With a bit of pruning, Brick Lane could have been a perfect 350 page novel."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I forced myself to read this book as it is going to be discussed at my next book club. The best word I can use to describe this book is tedious. The dialogue especially was uninspired. I really could not care less what happened to any of the characters, and the ending was just as boring as the rest of the book. I was very disappointed in the entire story."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, this is the story of Nazneen, from her birth in a village in Bangladesh, to her physical settlement in London's East End for an arranged marriage, to her emotional settlement as a (relatively) independent woman, the mother of daughters who are, despite their family environment, inevitably going to grow up more English in their ways than Bangladeshi. It is a fine novel, providing rich, colourful insights into the culture of a first generation in a new country. The main characters, Nazneen and her husband Chanu are believable and sympathetically developed. Ali doesn't take sides in their relationship, the reader understands the needs and aspirations of both of them, and what this means for their marriage. The supporting characters, especially Dr Azad, Mrs Islam and Razia add another layer of richness to the narrative. There is tragedy, sadness, conflict, touches of pathos and humour and ultimately, hope. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This book came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, \\"Brick Lane\\" tells the story of a Bangladeshi woman named Nanzeen who moves to London in an arranged marriage. After 10+ years of living life fairly uneventfully and raising her 2 young daughters, Nanzeen ultimately becomes involved romantically with another man, Karim, also of Bangladeshi descent. When Nanzeen's husband decides that the family should relocate back to Bangladesh, Nanzeen is forced to make a decision: follow her husband back to Bangladesh, or staying in London with Karim. Or is there a third option?Monica Ali takes her time developing the characters, which works well actually. Nevertheless somewhat distracting in my opinion is the side-story involving Nanzeen's sister who has remained in Bangladesh. It takes up quite a bit of the book but ultimately has really nothing to do with the resolution of Nanzeen's life choices.The book's inside cover points out that Ms. Ali herself is from Bangladesh and now lives in London. Obviously she knows what she is writing about, even though the circumstances of her move to London are presumably quite different from the fictional characters in the book. But it does beg the question what Ms. Ali will write about next, I mean, how many times can you approach the Bangladesh-to-London story? Meanwhile, \\"Brick Lane\\" is a very engaging book, and as highly recommended it came to me, I can now recommend it on to the next person."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Life in Brick Lane is captured with an uncanny, almost photographic realism. And the story of Nanzeen and Chanu's life together rings true. Yet the pace is maddeningly slow and the plot disintegrates into predictability. That said, I believe that Monica Ali is a writer who has been blessed with great talent. Unfortunately, Brick Lane is not a great novel."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali may not be much of a writer but if you are a struggling author trying to scheme your way into the publishing industry, you will do well to read this book and see how a pro does it.Ali has crafted a rather tedious tale of a young woman's pseudo independence from the tyranny of Asian cultural repression. The message of her book is perhaps this (if there is one): For everything that is dysfunctional and self-destructively narrow-minded, look to the East (and the people from the East living in the West). For enlightenment and freedom (of wearing sweat shirts all day), look towards the island kingdom, England. Her novel even ends with words to the effect that 'Anything is possible in England' (subtlety is not Ali's strong suit when it comes to sucking up). She chooses to forget that these english enlightened - famed for their gentility, wisdom and above all else good manners - were the same colonnizers who cut off the thumbs of muslim weavers in the Indian sub-continent to promote fabrics from Manchester, but let's not dig up the past.Ali has used every conceivable ploy in her book to successfully attract the gleeful attention of the western literary sphere. She has outlined her characters according to perfect stereotypes. the doormat wife, the pot-bellied loser of a husband, the renegade, morally corrupt children, the nosey neighbors - cliches galore... even the lover that her young, apathetic protagonist takes appears as if on cue when needed. Their love making is so contrived that it reads like a 13-year-old's red-faced, hormonal imagination running wild.now for factual accuracy: in her book kids run through man-high rice stalks in Bangladesh. This may be Ali's futuristic visions of Bangladeshi progress running away with her, because as far as we know rice \\"stalk\\" does not grow man-high. May be she meant jute??nazneen's sister (haseena) writes letters to her from Bangladesh in some sort of pidgin english. i failed to grasp the point of that. is she writing in english? how? what kind of education does she have? why would you write to your sister in english anyway? is she writing in Bangla? then why is her language so poor - one can understand bad spelling but her sentences at least should make sense!Anyway, moving on, in these letters she mentions characters in bangladesh with english names. well, ok.. perhaps there are some people in Bangladesh who have foreign names, but one character named \\"Betty\\" would be in serious trouble due to the obscene meaning of her name in the native language.In one of her letters (designed to paint a hideous picture of what life is like in barbaric dhaka society) haseena compares a color of some clothing to that of a \\"ripe peach\\". Peach does not grow in Bangladesh. Nor is it imported like certain other fruits.enough nit picking. turth be told - it is a shallow little novel with no such thing as character development and reeking of bad research. Ali chooses to write about a people and a country she knows nothing about. Perhaps because she knew if she packed in enough sensational snippets of third world country barbarism, she would have her fifteen minutes. And I bet she has.I have been reading reviews of her 'accomplished' writing but I must say that she hides her talent well. If you are not the keen-eyed, highly sophisticated (read: british) editors of Granta, you might entirely miss it. Like I did.Waiting to see what the author has up her sleeve next. There is only one Bangladesh, you see. How many times can she sell it short?"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I loved this book and have read it more than once. I think it shows an outsider possibly what it is like not only for Bangladeshi immigrant women living in London, but also for the women in Bagladesh.It really makes you appreciate your own life and situation too. I can't belive this is her first book! For all of those harsh critics out there; can you do better? If so, do it! From my experience some of the critics are the least expert on the things they critique (as in they could hardly do it themselves, but find it easier to judge the work of others)...just saying."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali has written a historically interesting book about the Bangladeshi experience in England; however, most of the characters could have been better developed. A reader can have an interesting few hours by reading the sister's letters and skimming the rest of the book.Ms. Ali's words brought to life the poverty and struggles experienced by many of the English Bangladeshi immigrants. The story Ms. Ali created about the main character's sister, who still resided in Bangladesh, and the way that her story her told, by letters, was by far the most interesting part of the book.I wished that Ms. Ali would have made the lives of the main character's daughters more interesting. The daughters appeared to be uni-dimensional, one dutiful and the other argumentative. The girls' desire to become more western and less Bangladeshi could have been better developed.Similarly, the main character's love affair could not have been more boring. I repeatedly wondered why the main character chose to have a relationship with such an uninteresting, unattractive \\"boy.\\""},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali's Brick Lane is the story of Nazneen, a Bangladeshi woman living in London with her older, fatter husband, Chanu. Theirs is an arranged marriage, but Nazneen is pretty much resigned to whatever fate dishes out. At least Chanu is kind, but, while he is educated and somewhat of a dreamer, he stifles Nazneen's thoughts of expanding her horizons, even discouraging her from learning English. He inadvertently expands her horizons, though, by introducing a sewing machine into the house so that Nazneen can contribute to the family's income. Karim, the young handsome Muslim organizer who delivers and retrieves Nazneen's sewing projects, piques her interest in more ways than one. The book is full of colorful, though sometimes tragic, characters, including Nazneen's sister Hasina, whose love marriage doesn't work out so well, Nazneen's friend Razia whose husband is killed by frozen beef, and Mrs. Islam, who is the neighborhood loan shark. My biggest complaint is that there a number of letters from Nazneen's sister, including one 20-page section, in broken English that is very difficult and annoying to read. Since neither Nazneen nor her sister speaks English, I don't understand the author's purpose in making the letters grammatically incorrect."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"What a magnificent study of a repressed woman realizing the power of her own singular identity!\\"Brick Lane\\" is a novel that gives abundant rewards to the PATIENT reader.

But this novel gains incredible momentum as it goes along, Monica Ali's structure is so clearly one of a building intensity, that to dismiss it after only reading a third of the novel is a shame.The heroine of \\"Brick Lane\\", the newly betrothed Bangladeshi wife Nazneen, begins this story as a fundamentaly simple Muslim woman -- but the gradual development of her awareness and commitment to her limited world as an immigrant in London provides a deeply involving character study, and it is presented in a context that is so immediate to the state of the world today.The story is deceptively slow in the beginning, but any perceptive reader will understand that the claustrophobic and mundane treatment of the life of Nazneen is a true depiction of her life, as a devout Muslim immigrant in London.Ali's steady and perceptive development of Nazneem's experience is a fascinating window into the very real identities of these immigrants, and the gradually unfolding emotions of that experience will come to bear on Nazneen's life in a way that makes her a much richer character than could have been expected. Her journey has been richly imagined by Monica Ali, and her story only becomes more exciting as the novel progresses.This is a novel that truly BUILDS to its conclusion, a closure to Nazneen's story that is so wonderfully satisfying. Monica Ali is able to deliver a profound conclusion to her story of Nazneen, because she has carefully controlled the detailed journey that brings the immigrant bride to a place of un-hoped for independence and strength.And along the way, Monica Ali creates secondary characters that are a as much a part of the social fabric of Immigrant London as the central character of Nazneen. It is a cliche to say that a novel set in London is Dickensian, but the friends and family of Nazneen are presented in a way that only hints at the depth of their humanity, each could be the subject of their own novel.That a novel presenting a simple character such as Nazneen could grow into a complex story that is so rewarding to the reader, surely speaks to the artistry of Monical Ali, and she has written a profoundly moving story.Trust this novel to involve you, and you will be rewarded with an unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"My great aunt initially suggested Brick Lane to me and I now can see how the generation gap made a big difference to the way in which we reacted to the story. While she told me it was magnificent I found the story only mediocre. I expected a new Memoirs of a Geisha, yet I did not grow as attached to the main character or become as enthralled in her story. The story did not really pick up until the last 70 or so pages. The first half of the book attempted to set up the rest of the novel, but a lot of the things learned during this time were unhelpful. Ali made a big deal about the letters written between the sisters, however I felt that that aspect did not bring much to the book and I felt myself groan each time I saw the italicized letters which signaled the start of a letter series. However, the book did have some redeeming moments. It was often the slightest of comments that were the most insightful and gave me the most respect and sympathy for Nazneen. The end of the novel, while slightly anticlimactic, was satisfying in that the women were able to find their own life paths and create more opportunities for themselves."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The author has a beautiful writing style, and is able to delve into the sensitive issues affecting an Islamic minority subculture during the events of September 11th. She succeeds because it is done through the eyes of Nanzeen, someone who believes in her religion strongly, but not in violence, and silently but diligently observes those within her community.To me the book is about Nanzeen- and she is engaging.She is a young village girl propelled into London where she meets her selected husband, does as he says(he is good for he does not beat her-this is her initial diagnosis), speaks only her native tongue, and her husband discourages any outside work or classes to learn the language.She transforms, through trials of her own, and those of her sister, into a woman with her own income, a lover which plagues her with guilt, two children, and a husband she has come to care for over time.Some say the book is tedious, or the letters are too long, or boring, but I think it well worth the read. Her writing is really beautiful in itself, and the book gives a really different insight into the events surrounding Sep. 11th, and the repercussions thereafter."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali has a tremendous talent for creating characters who exemplify the doubts &amp; struggles we all face in life. Her descriptions of places, from London to the villages in Bangladesh, teem with vivid detail. She tells her characters' stories not by dumping the details on the page in plain sight, but rather by implying things; she does not take her reader for a fool. This book was such a joy to read. I learned a lot about a different culture, &amp; I loved that the characters are not perfect but do have flaws, yet they live by principles which make you respect them as people. Her strength in writing can perhaps be seen best in the character of Chanu, who despite being deeply flawed, is still very sympathetic. It is her ability to capture the complexity of real life that amazed me page after page. I have not read such a wonderful book since &quot;The God of Small THings&quot; by Arundati Roy. I can't wait for Ali's next book!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I have to seriously wonder in this day of ubiquitous books by the South Asian diaspora, what makes a novel wrestle and rise to the top? What makes an author garner the distinction of Granta? What makes a book the topic of literary and popular conversations? Surely, it can't be a pretty author photograph on the back of a book jacket. Nor can it merely be the author's point of origin, and now chosen place of residence.Please restore my faith in the idea that a book's sole merit lies in the quality of the writing, and in the writing alone. Brick Lane fails on this most crucial level. The novel lacks any complexity or development. Initially, I was curious to read about the Bangladeshi immigrant experience because the subject matter is relatively new to South Asian immigrant writing. I was sorely disappointed, and at times repelled by the narrative.Clearly, Monica Ali doesn't have a clue about the real Bangladesh. I have to question whether she's ever traveled there. Her portrayals of the country are relegated to a strange rolling green idyllic village, and a non-visual, drab depiction of urban Dhaka. We thirst for more connection to the point of origin, but the author leaves us high and dry. Nazneen's home, which would explain so much of her supposed angst and identity issues, is hidden or rather inaccurately described by the author.Could a story be any more boring and stereotypical? Nazneen is married off to repugnant Chanu, who is significantly older than her, and consequently trapped in a loveless marriage transported to Brick Lane in London. She flits around her low income flat with grease stained sofas in a stupor, gives birth to two girls, and then begins an affair with the classic lover. A young, interested in all things Islam, muscular, tailor's nephew Karim. For goodness sakes, is this a Bangladeshi Bollywood film script? The film would at least have a song and dance routine to relieve the sheer predictability and repetitive boredom.I was so put off by Ali's constant descriptions of Chanu stroking his pot belly, droning on patriotic themes, and comparing his homeland to the evils of England and the English, that I wanted to gloss over those paragraphs. I kept looking at the page numbers to see how much more I would have to endure.A big portion of the book is devoted to the strange letters Nazneen receives from her sister in Bangladesh. It's best if I don't go into the sister's life because it is completely ludicrous, even vaudevillian dumb, prostitution and the lot, you get the idea. Back to the letters, the sister writes in broken, 'Banglafied' English that makes absolutely no stylistic or thematic sense. Is she writing in English? This can't be possible because Nazleen doesn't speak or write it either. So then why is her Bangla broken and in pigeon form, but then translated to doubly broken English? Is she mentally challenged? Ali doesn't indicate this at any point. If this is some attempt to be innovative in the novelistic form, Ali desperately needs an editor and many creative writing classes because it ain't working.Brick Lane is a book by a first time author that is riding on the 'all things South Asian are hip wave.' I hope that readers don't take this to be representative of an experience of an immigrant family from the subcontinent living in the West. Hype at it's worst. Don't waste your mind space on this book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Nazneen agrees to an arranged marriage, which is a traditional custom in Bangladesh. But her free-thinking sister runs away to marry a local boy she loves. The book follows both sisters' lives over a course of 15 years.Nazneen's husband is a lot older than her and he often raves on what an educated man he is, he seems to love to hear himself talk. Quite a few reviewers disliked Chanu the husband raving on, I felt it was necessary for us to understand him (even though we would have said to him \\"You've said that 1000 times before stop going on and on.\\") . The letters from the sisters to each other were an essential part of showing us the two worlds, Nazeen living in England and her sister still in Bangladesh.This story was interesting well written but only deserves a 3 star."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Although I was obviously attracted to the 'blurb' on the back of the book enough to buy it, 'Brick Lane' then sat on my book case for about a year waiting to be read purely because the reviews put me off. However, I'm glad I got around to it because I enjoyed it.The first few days of Nazneen's life were touch and go and left her with a story that her children would request again and again. The story of 'How You Were Left To Your Fate'. Brick Lane is the story of how Nazneen grows as a person and is able to take her fate into her own hands.Nazneen and her sister Hasina were both born in a Bangladeshi village but where Nazneen comes to London after an arranged marriage to Chanu, Hasina at sixteen, elopes to the city of Khulna to marry for love. The story is really about Nazneen but we discover what is happening to Hasina through the letter's she sends from Bangladesh which whilst showing us the parallels in their lives it also creates an excellent way in which the author can move time on a few years.All the characters were brilliantly described, and really brought the book to life. Even the minor characters weren't skimped on. \\"...Son Number One wore a round necked peach jumper and a collar of chest hair. The distance between his nostrils and his upper lip were unusually small. As a result he appeared constantly offended. He looked like he was making up insults. And failing.\\"Surely I wasn't the only reader to try and recreate that face?!! ;-)Although fictional, real events such as the riots in Oldham and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon are touched on and it was interesting to see how they effected the Muslim people in Nazneens neighbourhood.If you are interested in people, how they live and what effects and shapes them...then you'll enjoy this novel.*****SPOILER*****SPOILER*****SPOILERAlthough it was interesting to see Nasneen grow and become more confident I was disappointed that her and Chanu went their separate ways in the end. It was mentioned that there were two kinds of love; \\"the kind that starts off big and slowly wears away...And the kind that you didn't notice at first, but which adds a little bit to itself everyday\\" I realise that Chanu had his dream but I felt that he did love Nazneen and that she had grown to love him. So although it was a turning point for her when she took her fate into her own hands and decided to stay in England, it left me feeling a little sad."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"There are two striking qualities to be found in Monica Ali's debut novel. First, although the book's pace is measured and at times even slow, I never found it boring. The second feat is that all her characters are far from perfect, and their actions are often blameworthy, but--with the exception of a a nosy and malevolent neighbor, who figures late in the plot--they are nevertheless endearing. It's rare to find a writer who strikes such a delicate balance between the ordinariness and the uniqueness of the lives of everyday people.The heroine, Nazneen, is far from a saint, and she could even be called simple (both deferential to her husband and meek in her expectations), but she commands the sympathies of her husband, her neighbors, and the reader. She comes to England from Bangladesh, to enter into an arranged marriage and raise two children and to live as a stranger in her both her new country and the neighborhood around Brick Lane. The bubble in which she lives bursts when her children become teenagers and when Nazneen begins an affair with a young activist. Gradually, she matures beyond her deference and her low expectations--and she begins to love her new home.The men in Nazneen's life are equally conflicted. Her husband is oafish, pompous, and even delusional--one daughter finds him utterly embarassing, the other is anxiously eager to please--but he's basically a good, caring man. Constantly seeing the mirage of success on the horizon of his flailing employment prospects, he plans to return to Bangladesh--intentions thwarted by the economic realities of his life in London. Nazneen's lover, in contrast, is idealistic, arrogant, and passionate; he fills her life with excitement, but he encloses her with a trap of a different sort. A reasonable request for information or a calm appeal for respect can be greeted by rigid certainty: \\"He looked at her up and down, as if she might be an impostor. 'Because,' he said with quiet emphasis, 'it is.'\\"Until the unexpected, frantic climatic chapters that close the book, \\"Brick Lane\\" is composed of scenes from a marriage, scenes from an affair. She understands she can't have both, but she is confronted yet by another choice: her native country against her adopted one. The ghost of her mother tells her, \\"It's easy. You just have to endure,\\" while her best friend in London asserts, \\"You can do whatever you like.\\" Yet none of her decisions are \\"easy.\\""},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; is an excellent debut novel that captures the struggles, the cultural clash, and the frustrations of a family caught between two worlds.From the day of her birth, Nazneen is reminded how she is a puppet of fate. She dutifully leaves her small Bangladeshi village and goes to live in Brick Lane, the Bengali enclave of London, after her arranged marriage to Chanu, an educated but pompous and ineffectual man twice her age. She acts as a traditional, dutiful, and useful wife. After accepting whatever cards fate deals her, however, she casts a critical eye at the actions of her friends, her sister and her mother. She questions whether she can actually control her life. She starts to break free, first with small subtle acts of rebellion and then an affair. Finally, with the interests of her children in mind, she takes a giant step toward becoming her own woman. Interspersed throughout the story line are letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina, who strikes out on her own in Bangladesh and, through good times and bad, forges a life of her own.The writing style is colorful and descriptive. The reader can smell the spices wafting through the hallways, view the multicultural clutter of a shabby and overcrowded apartment, and share the confusion and outrage that simmer in Brick Lane due to cultural, religious, and racial prejudice. Each character is carefully crafted and brought to life. Ali peels back the surface layers of Chanu to reveal his inner doubts and disallusionment. The secondary characters such as the starchy Dr. Azad, the crafty hypochondriac Mrs. Islam, and the Britishized Razia, are depicted with a deft touch. There are only two points in the novel that could be improved upon. First, although the absent Hasina's letters add another dimension to the story by developing her personality and experiences, at one point they lead the reader off on a several year tangent that leaves a gap in Nazneen's time-line. Second, there are many ethnic words for food and clothing that are not explained, and these might cause the reader some confusion. Overall, however, this book is a seamless blend of the Old Country and the New, and it brings new insights to the immigrant experience."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I am a devoted fan of Indian novelists, those particularly observant writers who miss no detail while creating intensely personal landscapes of time and place. In Brick Lane, author Ali examines the life of Nazneen, a young Bangladeshi wife. The young woman settles in a London enclave filled with other Bengali tenants, all seeking assimilation while maintaining their cultural identity. Surrounded by familiar objects and customs, the immigrant community is constantly assailed by the inevitability of Westernization.Following custom, Nazneen dutifully accepts marriage to the much older Chanu. Nazneen is an obedient wife, settled now in her London flat, her homesickness brightened by letters from Hasina, Nazneen's sister, who flaunts tradition by marrying for love. Over the years, the differences in their worlds are apparent, as the letters they exchange reflect their diverse paths. Through their letters, Nazneen examines her days as mother and wife, governed by minutiae, while Hasina is often at the mercy of changing circumstances.Bengali lives are governed by strict traditions. While eyes watch and tongues wag with gossip, most of the women shun Westernization. Still, there is a profound cultural disturbance beneath the surface of the Bengali's world. It is nearly impossible to make a decent living; most are forced to work demeaning jobs to support their households, regardless of education and among the young people, there is a growing unrest. Some embrace the new lifestyle, while others are outraged by the implicit denial of Islamic tradition.Nazneen is patient, wedded to her fate, but the couple's two daughters are a constant irritation to Chanu, especially the oldest, who exhibits the usual teenage angst. Accepting employment as a taxi driver, working nights, he finally acknowledges the sad truth of his diminished job prospects. Borrowing from a moneylender, Chanu purchases a sewing machine for Nazneen so she can do piecework for a local manufacturer, contributing to the family income.While doing this piecework, Nazneen meets a young man with revolutionary dreams who yearns to direct the local Muslim population away from secularization and back to strict religious traditions. Karim picks up Nazneen's sewing daily and befriending her, he gradually challenges Nazneen to redefine her priorities and unquestioning acceptance of Fate's directives. For the first time, through his eyes, Nazneen views herself as a woman.This is a small story on a large canvas, the universal struggle of people searching for personal definition and quality of life. Like pieces of a quilt, Ali stitches her eccentric characters together with subtle precision, from kind-hearted, plain-faced friends to hawkish moneylenders bleeding customers dry and pedantic old men longing for their birth country. While they trudge through daily difficulties, dreaming of home, most Bengali's accept their gradual acculturation, if unwittingly. In her way, Nazneen struggles to find her voice as a mother and wife, a woman of two worlds.

Taught from the day of her birth that &quot;fighting against one's Fate can weaken the blood,&quot; or even be fatal, she accepts the miserably lonely existence that fate has bestowed on her in a London council flat. Nazneen's only contact with home is the letters she exchanges with her sister Hasina, whose own fate back home in Dhaka changes throughout the fifteen years that this novel takes place. Through these letters, author Ali shows the similarities and contrasts in the lives of Nazneen and Hasina, both subservient to their husbands, and, like other Bengali wives, powerless to control their fates in the culture in which they live.With warmth and sensitivity, author Ali draws us into Nazneen's world, showing it in all its earthy details. The reader sees her increasingly cluttered apartment, hears the constant excuses and boasts from Chanu, gets lost with her on a walk in the city, and feels Nazneen's confusion and frustration with the isolation of her life, as she continues to act the dutiful wife, cutting Chanu's corns and trimming his nose hair while planning mini-rebellions. Her sister, eventually alone in Dhaka, struggles to support herself, doing whatever she has to do to stay alive in a culture in which her life has no value. But, as their mother once said, &quot;If God wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.&quot;Speaking directly to the reader in unpretentious but vividly descriptive prose, Ali recreates the minutiae of Nazneen's life, showing how the seemingly unimportant decisions she begins to make acquire new meanings in her life. Through striking details, the reader watches her gradual acceptance of a new culture (which some would call &quot;growth&quot;), while her husband Chanu remains anchored in the traditions of the past. Her slow evolution is neither simple nor without conflict, and no member of the family escapes her transformation. Brick Lane reveals the emotional conflicts and the subtle changes that occur when an immigrant sees the possibilities inherent in a new culture, radically different from the culture of the past, and begins to embrace it.. Step by inevitable step, Ali shows just how this process evolves, creating a vibrant portrait of a family in transition and of a woman coming into her own.

As a newborn she did not nurse for five days yet survived. In 1985, at age 18, she marries a man 22 years older whom she had never seen, a man who had been living in England since the early 1970s. Chanu needs her to cut his hair, his nails, and his corns, clip his nose hairs, feed him, keep his apartment clean, wash his clothes and to bear his children. When she is 21 she bears a son who dies after a year and then she has two daughters.Chanu is educated and she is not. He has a degree from Dhaka University in English literature and is working for an Open University degree. She knew no English. When she expressed a desire to go college to learn English Chanu said \\"there was no need.\\" What English she learned she learned from her daughters, who \\"demanded to be understood [in English].\\" She lives in a cube, with thin walls, falling plaster, and two sinks, in public housing. Her husband's ambition is humbled by the racial wall-at the age of 43 he resigns from his job in the council of the local government. After months of depression he determines to return to Dhaka and to raise money for his trip he becomes \\"driver number one-six one nine\\" for Kempton Kars.It is Nazneen, however, who makes the money for the family with her sewing machine. She has an affair with a younger man when she is 34, a man who brings her garments to sew and is a founder of an active Islamic group, the Bengal Tigers. She learns about love from the wise Dr. Azad: \\". . . 'there are two kinds of love. The kind that starts big and slowly wears away, that seem you can never use it up and then one day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.'\\"Nazneen's younger sister Hasina, is always in the background. She never leaves Bangladesh. At age16 she elopes in a love marriage, a marriage that fails. She works as a machine woman sewing garments but her beauty is too much and she is locked out of the factory, accused of licentious behavior. She becomes a prostitute and marries Ahmed, one of her clients. Family pressure causes him to later turn against her. She seeks refuge in the House of Falling Women, run by Brother Andrew from Canada. Lovely hires her as a nanny for her son and daughter. Ultimately she runs away again with Lovely's young cook. It is Hasina who tells Nazneen about their mother's suicide dressed in her best sari. This is the mother who told her daughters \\"'If God wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.\\"Although Chanu has been gone from Bangladesh for over thirty years, he pines for home. He yearns for the sixteenth century, when Bengal was the \\"Paradise of Nations\\". When Dhaka was the home of textiles. When the Bengalis invented muslin and damask. In the Eighteenth Century Bengal provided one-third of the revenues of Britain's Indian Empire. He is pushed to return home by the anti-Islamic hostility after September 11, 2001. Chanu, at age 57, returns shortly thereafter without Nazneen and his daughter. He has plans to go into the soap business and to gain self respect.The minor characters are fascinating and suggestive. In Bangladesh, there is Makku Pagla, always reading and carrying an umbrella who kills himself by falling down a well. There is Tamizuddin Mizra Haque the quiet barber who always knows the correct information about every thing. In London, there is Mrs. Islam, the money lender with her two sons, Number One and Number Two, as enforcers. There is Razia, Nazneen's closest friend whose husband dies when seventeen frozen cows fall on him in the slaughterhouse where he works. Her response is that \\"I can get that job now. No slaughter man to slaughter me now.\\" Nazneen too becomes free for the first time with Chanu's departure for Bangladesh.The novel has considerable depth to it. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This lengthy and ambitious first novel explores, with indifferent success, the lives of Bangladeshi immigrants to London and the growth in independence and modification of culture of a young Bangladeshi woman.The heroine of the book is Nazneen who at the age of 20 enters an arranged marriage with Chanu, age 40, a Banladeshi struggling to establish himself in London. Chanu is striving for a promotion, is proud of his attempts to secure education, and is portrayed at the outset of the book as rather vain and foolish. Bangladeshi society and traditional Islamic practices are patriarchal by western lights, and much is made of this throughout the book. Nanzeen and Chanu have a son, who dies as an infant, and two daughters Shahana and Bibi. Mid-way in the book, with her growth in independence and awareness of her physical and emotional needs, Nanzeen takes a lover, a young man and would-be Islamic radical named Karim. Nanzeen has a beautiful younger sister, Hasina, who remains in Bangladesh, and writes many letters to her sister in a broken English about the course of her life and its hardships.The book gives a portrait of life of the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London. I had no prior knowledge of this community. It describes how the immigrants lived in cramped living conditions in the poorer sections of town with up to ten people per room trying to support themselves in a culture utterly foreign to most of them. Some of the people work at assimilation while others try to retain their religious and Bangladeshi identity. Drugs and violence come to plague the community and, of course, the open sexual mores of modern London prove irresistable to many. The community is shown as divided in its response to the terrorism that has come to dominate world news in recent years.There are a host of well-drawn secondary characters in this novel, including the loan-shark, Mrs. Islam, Nanzeen's lover, named Karim, a friend of Chanu named Dr. Azad, and Razia, a friend of Nanzeen. These characters give weight and texture to the novel and partly succeed in bringing it to life.The book focuses on Nanzeen's development, and the parallel development of Hasina, as it involves Nanzeen's husband, her lover, and, ultimately her independence. It also centers upon Chanu's and Nanzeen's differing desires in terms of returning to Bangladesh.I was intrigued by the excellence of the 100-some discussions by my fellow Amazon reviewers and by the wide divergence of considered responses to this book. Reading the reviews helped me focus upon my own response to the book. Many reviewers found this novel an outstanding first attempt to describe the immigrant experience of the Bangladeshis and the personal growth of the heroine. Other readers found the novel vastly overpraised, difficult, and trite. There is something to be said for both views, but on the whole I agree with the latter opinion. I was happy to have it reinforced by a substantial group of fellow reviewers.The book does portray eloquently the difficulties of the Bangladeshi immigrant community and provokes reflection on how many individuals, in immigrating to a new land, respond to the various choices of assimilation on the one hand and remaining deeply attached to one's initial identity on the other hand. Some of the characters in this book are convincingly drawn. But these are largely the secondary characters, such as Mrs. Islam and Dr. Azad, and also, surprisingly enough, Chanu, Nanzeen's husband.The problems with this book far outweigh its virtues. To begin with, I found it far too long, too slow, and, in many places, dull. It was an unrelieved chore to finish this book. The long sections of letters to Nazneen from her sister Hasina break up the story are difficult to read and detract much more than they add.Equally important, the character on whom Ms. Ali lavishes most of her attention, Nazneen, is trite and unconvincing. I don't think we need another long novel to inform the reader that traditional Islamic society is patriarchal. At times, both at the beginning and at the end of the story, the book does little more than that. Portions of the Nanzeen's development show more depth, as Nanzeen learns of her sexuality and also stands up to Mrs. Islam. But the main theme of the book is predictable and boring and has been done many times in many other contexts.While Nazneen's development shows predictable stereotyping, the author, possibly in spite of herself does a better job with Chanu who for all his faults is a complexly drawn human being deserving of compassion and, perhaps, of a better fate.Thus, in spite of some good moments, I cannot recommend this book due to its length and structure and due to its stereotyped plot line and heroine. I found it worthwhile to review the comments of my fellow reviewers and to offer my own comments here.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This Booker Prize-nominated novel provides engaging characters and thought-provoking insight into the Muslim immigrant world.The main character, Nazneen, is a young &quot;unspoiled&quot; Bangladeshi village girl who enters into an arranged marriage with a much older Bangladeshi who lives in London. Her beautiful sister defies her father's wishes and elopes in a love match, running off to Dakha. Nazneen has been raised to accept whatever happens to her, but in London, gradually (over the course of 15 years or so) begins to take control of her own life.Her husband Chanu at first seems clownlike, for example, he frames a collection of meaningless certificates for very minor achievements. Chanu regards himself as a scholar, because he has a BA from a Bangladeshi university, but he realizes that in Britain, he is regarded as nobody of any importance). Nazneen is expected to trim his corns every night, and later, his daughters are expected to sit beside him as he reads to turn the pages for him. But Chanu is a complex person who has a good heart, and the reader develops a fondness for this would-be patriarch. Life has not turned out as he wanted or expected, but he is devoted to his family.Nazneen, on the other hand, had no expectations of life but has been swept along like a piece of wood in a river. Her transformation -- how to combine the traditional values and reject what is problematic in the western world while recognizing what is bad about the old ways and changing -- forms the plot of the book.In the background is her sister's story, told in letters; the sister, who was more proactive in her choices, suffers the consequences, and it's hard to avoid wondering if the sister would not have been better off in an arranged marriage. The reader is left pondering Western vs. non-Western values, particularly with regard to love and marriage.Like other reviewers, I found the use of broken English in her sister's letters baffling and annoying -- fortunately they were a comparatively small part of the book. If her sister was writing in Bengali, wouldn't it be grammatical at least? And why would her sister write in English (which would explain the bad grammar)?The author has done a great job of creating a very different world for the reader to inhabit. Life for Muslim women both in a council estate (public housing project) in London (Nazneen's story) and a large city in Bangladesh (her sister's story) are described vividly and without romantic illusions.This is not a quickly read book, but it certainly held my interest all the way through, and I will remember these characters for a long time."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is a highly intelligent novel with writing so evocative (and I'm not just talking about the cooking-with-spices and colourful-laundry stuff)that you know no movie of the week or Hollywood effort could ever do justice to it. The story is about Nazneen's life as a young Bangladeshi bride brought to London and her growing realization that she can manipulate &quot;fate&quot;. Her husband is a silly buffoon who the reader at first despises but eventually feels some fondness for. Nazneen protests her unpleasant situation silently; for example, she refuses to eat in front of her husband. She eats out of Tupperware containers during the night standing over the sink. At one point she equally despises and pities her husband,simultaneously feeling like &quot;going to him and stroking his head ....and getting up from the table and walking out of the door and never seeing him again.&quot; Familiar feelings anyone? My only complaint about this excellent book is the device of conveying Nazeen's sister's thoughts through letters from Bangladesh. They hardly ring true. Why couldn't Hasina's (the sister) version be told, like Nazneen's, in the third person? Her letters are a silly combination of Bengali-English and incredible insight conveyed with what is meant to be naivete. They don't work. However, this is the book's only flaw. The story is fascinating, rolls along at a good pace, is very, very funny and very, very tragic. It is a story that is rich in detail yet every word, in English or Bengali, is necessary. When you have finished reading it you feel enriched, educated, chastened, entertained, and hungry for more books by Monica Ali."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I am from Bangladesh, and have lived in the West for some years. Although Westernized in many ways, I am acutely aware of the experience of being brown and Asian in the West. Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; touches me in multiple ways.&quot;Brick Lane&quot; is unique. There are many novels centered on Bengali housewives; unfortunately most are in Bengali and not translated. The number of novels with Bangladeshi women as protagonists is smaller. Novels dealing with Bangladeshi immigrant women are very rare --- Ms Ali is exploring new ground here. And she does it so touchingly, with such attention to detail and nuances.The novel is about Nazneen, born in a Bangladeshi village and married off to an older man who is an immigrant in England. Nazneen moves to England, submits herself to fate as she has been taught to, bears life and children and her husband's stupidities, and watches her daughter grow Westernized. Eventually, she surprises herself by her own initiative, taking a lover and deciding not to return to Bangladesh with her husband.Other than Nazneen, the main characters are her husband Chanu, and her sister Hasina whom we meet through her letters to Nazneen written over the years. We also meet several other immigrant Bangladeshi characters living in Brick Lane, and get flashbacks of Nazneen's life in Bangladesh.Through Hasina's sporadic letters to Nazneen, which take up significant parts of the book, we follow the life of an unmarried lower-class woman in Bangladesh. Hasina, unlike Nazneen, chooses her own path in life and elopes as a teenager, but her husband leaves her and she suffers through a series of ordeals. Her life story is probably realistic and reflects the lives of the many poor rural women in Bangladesh who have moved to the cities in recent years, forced to be independent in a patriarchial society that resists women's independence.Like other reviewers, I was annoyed by the author's choice to transcribe Hasina's letters in broken English. This is the only major complaint I have about the book.The characterization of Nazneen's husband, Chanu, is masterly. Chanu is an educated but completely impractical person. A complete failure in British life, he toils away as a clerk hoping that his culture &amp; worth will someday be appreciated. He borrows money and leaves his wife to deal with the usurer. He appreciates the wrong people, and is completely unable to deal with his daughter's rebellion.Perhaps even more paradigmic is Chanu's pompous behavior with his wife. The Bengali male, it has been said, is a great loser in life and a fearless lion in dealing with his subservient wife.Chanu actually thinks of himself as a liberated man, whose wife has complete freedom in theory. In practice, unfortunately, Nazneen does not get to taste any of these freedoms (such as learning the local language English). The reason is that &quot;she does not need them&quot;, as Chanu assures her, and also because it is unnecessary to evoke gossip in the immigrant community.Chanu's laziness, his readings in impractical subjects, reminds me of my brother :-) And his complete inability to actually listen to anything Nazneen says, reminds me of my father's treatment of my mom. In return, Nazneen's response to Chanu, her near-complete acceptance and sporadic rebellions, reminds me of my mom and some aunts.As for the other characters, Nazneen's friend Razia is drawn beautifully, a strong woman who decides to Westernize herself, and keeps her enormous humor and sarcasm intact through the adversities of immigrant life. I liked her imitation of pompous people, a very Bengali kind of humor.A minor character particularly attracted me, Nazneen's aunt Mumtaz, seen almost entirely in flashbacks. Quietly strong, in a manner peculiar to some Bengali rural women. I have an aunt like that.The writing is, for the most part, low-keyed and subdued. This style seems fitting, as it reflects Nazneen's accepting, compromising attitude to life. Sometimes quietly funny, and sometimes emotionally exhausting, not always an easy book to read.There are some masterful descriptions, like that of Nazneen before her nervous breakdown watching her dead mom slide across her living room. Like the hilarious jostling among different brands of pseudo-Islamic factions in the young Bengali community. Or Razia being spat on after September 11, on a London street wearing a Union Jack T-shirt. And so on and so forth.Ms Ali has done a wonderful job. To the non-Bengali reader, I have an invitation: welcome to my world. Maybe you will find the setting too alien for you to be interested in. But maybe (I hope) you will actually discover a beautiful story set amongst a struggling people."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Not as much fun as White Teeth and not as deep as Midnight's Children. I did enjoy reading Monica Ali's much hyped new novel, but really felt it a quite light, entertaining novel that was let down by lapses into cliche. I think there is a curious situation with books that refer to a specific community and are written by someone who comes from that community - the voice is taken to be very authentic and that allows them to draw upon a pool of 2-dimensional characters that an outsider would not necessarily get away with. I thought the novel was well paced and well written, but I did feel frustrated by the gallery of characters - the rebellious friend, the hypocritical maintainer of old-style values (who is a Usurer), the not-good, not-bad sad husband, the down-trodden doctor, the sexy revolutionary. I felt I had met them all before in a myriad of other novels. I do however think that Nazneen is an immensely likeable heroine and she did live for me. More than that Ali should be commended for dealing with the impact of 9/11 on the Muslim community so directly. I'm sure Ali will develop and grow as a writer and there a signs of something very good here - but she's not there yet."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"One of my professors assigned this book as required reading for a history class. Although I never would have picked it up for myself based on the description, I quickly found that I was unable to put this book down and forget about it -- in fact I finished it well before the due date.The language in this book makes the settings come alive for the reader; Nazneen, the protagonist, exists in a very lush environment defined by rich sensory details. Ali does not glaze over descriptions of the main locales, most notably Nazneen and Chanu's apartment, which she describes in lavish detail. She does the same for her characters, painting lively portraits of toady Chanu (and making the reader feel Nazneen's conflicted revulsion and affection for the man), rebellious Razia and her sometimes volatile interactions with native Britons, and sickly Mrs. Islam in the role of the money lender, who echoes the theme of debt and payment from other South Asian works. The total effect is immersion into Nazneen's world and a genuine interest in all of the characters.I agree with many of the other reviewers who say that Hasina's letters make for a laborious read. They are not, however, completely divorced from the rest of the book, and deserve at least a good skim.If you are expecting Nazneen's affair to be torrid and sensual, you will certainly be disappointed. Nazneen becomes more infatuated with a set of ideals than she does with the man himself, so don't go into this book expecting a juicy love story. Also, readers who expect a clear-cut problem and resolution will find this book unfulfilling, because the issues with which it grapples are more vague than the affair itself or any singular problem. In spite of this, Brick Lane provides a unique window into the lives of London immigrants that richly invites the reader to take a new perspective and experience the everyday tragedies and triumphs of these immigrants in an unforgettable way."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The main, only really, lesson Nazneen's mother teaches her is submission to fate. Indeed, Nazneen is \\"left to her fate\\" from birth, when she is at first thought to be stillborn. This is a recurrent theme and it's interesting to see how it plays out in her life.Nazneen's sister Hasina's long letters in broken English -- I suppose it's supposed to be broken Bengali -- at first seem a bit tough to read. But *do* read them as they add a lot to the story.One reviewer poses the rhetorical question \\"Who wants to read about some Bangladeshi housewife (or, for that matter, any housewife) holed up in their (sic) boring existence? Well, speaking as on of those boring housewives, I had a hard time believing that we'd read the same book (boring?). I guess fine storytelling, culture clash and psychological insights won't interest everyone.The one criticism I have is that Monica Ali ties up all the loose ends a bit to neatly for my taste. Brick Lane is so rich and complicated -- until the last few chapters where ALL IS EXPLAINED.All in all, though, Brick Lane is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane, by Monica Ali, is a beautifully written novel that tells the story of a woman named Nazneen, who comes from a Bangladeshi village. Obeying the traditions of her culture, Nazneen marries a man that her parents choose for her and is forced to move to London with him. In London, Nazneen feels out of place and lonely...until she meets a man with whom she falls madly in love with. She decides to push fate aside and take control of her own life, by making the choice to start a relationship with this man behind her family's back. Nazneen finally begins to discover the attachment she feels toward her family and the hardships this sense of freedom brings to her.From the moment I began to read this novel, I was absorbed into the life of Nazneen. Ali's descriptive writing makes one feel as if they are there with the character, going through her struggles and feeling her pain. I recommend this novel to readers who enjoy moving love stories, learning about new cultures, and experiencing the emotions of life."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"May be we can compare this book with Purple Color by Alice Walker. A story of two sisters a distance away writing about religion and family. In fact both are using slangs. One is African American and and the other Bangladeshi.This book is a good bet nonetheless. Beautifully written and coincide with the growing interest on Islam."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I bought Brick Lane\\" because of all the publicity surrounding the author Monica Ali and her debut novel: \\"A magnificent coup\\" according to the Observer\\", with a \\"comic touch\\" according to the \\"Guardian\\". Neither did I find \\"Brick Lane\\" magnificient, nor a coup. Hints of a comic touch may have been there, but I must have missed missed them.Don't get me wrong, at times I did enjoy reading \\"Brick Lane\\", but it was not a book that I did not want to put down until I had finished reading the last page. It started out good, but weakened by the page.\\"Brick Lane\\" is basically the story about Nazneen's and Chanu's marriage, their life in Tower Hamlets in London and that of a woman who was left to her fate until she took fate in her own hands. Throughout Nazneen's stay at Tower Hamlets she receives letters from her sister Hazima, who ran away from home for a love marriage (whereas Nazneen submitted to her father in marrying Chanu). Hasina's letters are not only updates of life in Bangladesh but also mirror Nazneen's life in London.Some of the characters are indeed very well developed, but mostly I found the read tedious and somewhat lengthy. 200 pages less would have sufficed and a tad more spark would have been good!Result: Don't set your hopes to high on this one or you might be as disappointed as I am!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The sheer quality - of tone, of voice, of story - of Brick Lane is something that doesn't come along too often, even in these days of mass book publishing.It's a universal story told with extraordinary technical skill. The qualities of the book have been compared to Jane Austen, Dickens and Dostoevsky. Yet the protagonist is the simplest of characters trying to lead the simplest of life.Brick Lane seems to be winning as many popular reader awards as it is literary gongs and, given its readability, it can be little wonder that Barnes &amp; Noble are publicising it for a year in their shop windows across America.This book is for the intelligent, thoughtful reader who is willing to immerse themselves in literature, even temporarily, to see the world in a clearer way.Take your time with this book and it will reward you greatly. It is an uplifting antidote to the increasingly brash, crass world we find ourselves within."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I was excited to read this book when it was selected by my book club, but I found it disappointing. Though Monica Ali is a talented writer who uses words beautifully to capture the mood, look, smell, and emotion of a scene, the book introduced too many concepts and themes that either went nowhere or that were wrapped up much too easily and conveniently. Nazneen is an interesting character whose traditional upbringing and deep faith conflict with some of her life choices (such as her extra-marital affair with a much younger man), but I never felt that the author delved into how the character resolved or worked through those conflicts in any significant way. I found myself bored by the last 100 pages, skimming through the conclusion only to find out what happened, but not really caring one way or the other."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I really wanted to love this book. I got lost in the letters from Razia and I just couldn't get a handle on Nazneen and Karim's budding relationship. I thought the daughters were poorly developed and the husband was ridiculous. Cutting corns and trimming nosehairs are not my idea of a successful marriage. So I will say that Monica Ali definitely portrayed their lacking marriage successfully. I wish I would have liked it more. I am interested in seeing the movie, but I think it's a shame when I have a feeling that the movie will be better than the book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Title: Brick LaneAuthor: Monica AliGrade: AIdeal Audience: Boys & Girls, 14+Summary: Nazneen was raised in Bangladesh, but at a young age was sent to London to marry a man she had never before met. Her husband, Chanu, may be fat and boring, spending too much time baffling over his books and fruitlessly planning for a promotion, but as the years pass by Nazneen develops a fondness for him.After the death of a baby son, Nazneen undergoes a mental change. Before, she would try to fog her mind. She would say her prayers, clean the house, simply wait for the life that comes after death. But now there is a stirring inside of her, a growing restlessness. Perhaps it started the first time she saw ice skating on the television, and then made itself clear after the tragedy.Time passes, and Nazneen and Chanu now have two daughters. The eldest, Shahana, is rebellious, while the younger, Bibi, tentatively tries to please her father. But there is now disquiet in their lives. Chanu owes money to Mrs. Islam, who ruthlessly squeezes every penny out of them. Nazneen suspects that the son of her friend, Razia, has taken up heroin, but is unsure of how to point this out to Razia.Nazneen has taken up sewing as a job, and the middleman, Karim, is broadening her view of the world. He speaks of politics, of injustice. He makes Nazneen feel important, treats everything she says as a new revelation. Before she knows it, she is in the middle of a damning affair. Meanwhile, we read letters from her sister, Hasina, who along with Chanu's speculations and Karim's accounts, gives us a view of Bangladesh.My thoughts: The most interesting quote in the book, I thought, was one spoken by Dr. Azad, Chanu's friend. Although he speaks of himself, it explains the background of Nazneen's relationships with Chanu and Karim:\\" 'What I did not know- I was a young man- is that there are two kinds of love. The kind that starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then one day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit to itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.' \\"Thought provoking and imaginative, Brick Lane is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The ending is superb and deeply satisfies the reader. All of the narration comes together to leave an accomplishment... but had I not persevered through the book my initial lack of interest (which spanned for 3/4 of the book) would have won out. Brick Lane takes too long to go anywhere and seems to spend too much time explaining the plot rather than living it. Nazneen's seclusion from the world did not work to the favor of this book and her emotions seem stifled. Hasina's letters seem to be a bit odd in place as Nazneen only seems to be casually interested in them. However, if you can wait out for the last few chapters of the book you will find that it is a quiet gem of a read... though you may not read it twice."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Life, love and women's lib, Bengali-style.

I appreciated the flow of the writing--it was easy to read. I didn't find myself caught up on misplaced words like some other books I've read. However, the main events, or what you would expect to be main events, were poorly executed. There was maybe a page devoted to each \\"main event\\" with most of the book being devoted to ordinary daily doings. The author would drop the anticlimactic bomb and then move on without spending any time describing the main character's emotions. It was difficult to connect to the story. Also, there were so many things in the book that took place without consequence, so it was almost as if there were no point to inserting the event. The affair elicited no heightened sense of anxiety surrounding the secrecy. It was just flat, like the character's personality."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"What would it be like to be sent to another country where you didn't know the language or another living soul? How would it feel to enter an arranged marriage--with a chubby, frog-faced man two decades older than you? Who lives behind all those windows in the high-rises of public housing? What are their days like? Their dreams?Monica Ali's novel Brick Lane explores these mysteries in the story of a young Bangladeshi girl sent to England to marry a kinsman, sight unseen. Though marked by many tragedies, overall the story is characterized by a sweet flow of love, great humor, and the pulsing energy of a densely knit community.The British-Bangladeshi author takes up many themes, most notably the role of destiny in her characters' lives. Nazneen has been raised to believe that \\"Fighting against one's Fate weakens the blood\\" and indeed may even kill you. Easy to see how that might comfort an uneducated girl, ensnared by poverty, religion, and patriarchy. Brick Lane begins with Nazneen's birth and near-death because of a balky Fate. By story's end, she has been reborn, a middle-aged woman who is no longer willing to be Fate's plaything.There are other equally rich themes in the novel: the inevitable conflict between first and second generation immigrants, the experience of being an outsider, especially for non-English-speaking women, and the tensions arising from unemployment and anti-Muslim sentiment, particularly after 9/11. The young men on Nazneen's estate fight among themselves as much as against the white majority culture. In time their frustration spills off the estate and erupts in a riot on Brick Lane.The heroine, Nazneen, is endlessly adaptable, hard-working, kind, and observant. She must contend with quite a lot, from the unimaginable--leaving her family behind and losing a child--to the demeaning--made to trim her husband's corns and toenails. Throughout the story, she remains a work in progress; you are never safe second-guessing her.Nazneen's portly husband Chanu is the Rodney Dangerfield of Brick Lane: he never gets enough respect because he is, as he will helpfully inform you, an immigrant, poor, and brown. He rails against the ignorance of the British--and those \\"villagers\\" his Bengali neighbors--while extolling the wisdom of his beloved English writers, Chaucer, Dickens, and Hardy. He's overbearing, pretentious, and often unintentionally funny. He can also be harsh and unforgiving.Brick Lane, which was turned into a controversial BBC drama a few years back, was short-listed for the prestigious Man Booker Prize and named to numerous \\"best\\"-lists in England. And no wonder: it is a rich and resonant depiction of a life that is becoming more and more familiar in its general outlines. Many experts believe that the global tsunami of immigration will be the defining characteristic of the 21st century. Whether we know much about the Brick Lanes in our own communities, they exist, populated by people who are adapting (or not), but nonetheless slowly beginning to change the character of their new surroundings.Monica Ali, born in Bangladesh but raised in England, was inspired by her Bengali father's stories about village life. Though she says her book is not autobiographical--she was not married off to a stranger, did not grow up in London, and no longer truly speaks her father's language--Brick Lane has the feel of authenticity. She's a vivid storyteller, her novel much better than the movie that was made from it.Rebecca BurkeAuthor of When I Am Singing to You"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali's much heralded debut in 2003 that promised to unveil the little-known Bengali community in the East London settlement of Brick Lane met with polarised reactions from critics and the reading public alike - not least of these the inhabitants of Brick Lane and Bangladeshis at large.From the way Ali squandered her once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cast real light on this veiled community by creating stereotypical characters, to the way she romanticised adultery and demonised Islam, the criticisms came fast and furious. There were of course other camps that embraced the love story elements of the plot and applauded the way the marginalised heroine Nazreen learns to take control of her life and free herself from the tyranny of (her belief in) fate that she saw destroy her own mother.Those elements did work for me in terms of plot and I enjoyed the portrayal of Nazreen's much-older husband who bounces back with each setback that comes his way. A truly sympathetic character who realises that the forces he's up against are more than an outsider like him can counter, no matter how many certificates he accumulates and brandishes like talismans, nor how many books he reads and how many poems he teaches his daughters to recite. That one of her daughters is the anxious and bewildered girl, while the other the cynical rebel who declares \\"I did not asked to be born here!\\" are, if you like, yet more ammunition for the book's naysayers.At the end of the day, the reader needs to decide if it is the writer's or artist's responsibility to represent accurately her subject matter (especially if they deal with specific and minority communities) or if it is her prerogative to write imaginatively and in accordance to her artistic vision."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Great story from an interesting perspective.

However, the novel is dissapointing. The heroine has an empty affair and is less than honest with both her lover and her husband. She allows her family to break up, and her children to lose their father (although she supposedly loves him) without any attempt to try to save things. But since she achieves \\"independence\\" in the process, we are unsubtly pushed by the author to approve. In the end, I felt the story promoted selfishness. The character development was also quite weak. It was an interesting read, but unmemorable and hardly worthy of the Booker short list."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I didn't really like Brick Lane (though I respected it), which is full of longeurs as we go through the dreary life of a Bangla immigrant in London, punctuated when things got too dull with animplausible series of dramas that I guess was supposed to appeal to females: kids in trouble! middle-aged wives can have hot sex! to heck with men! and so on.All of this was interspersed with semi-literate letters from the sister who remained in Bangladesh, which reminded me how annoying accent fiction is, and I guess was supposed to illustrate that life for woman Banglas sucks, whether in Dhaka or Durham.All in all, it seemed like a quality fiction effort marred by an attempt at becoming an Oprah pick, and I can only assume the critics all embraced it because some of the characters - Chanu, the inept husband, and Mrs. Islam, the terrifying neighbor - are richly drawn. That and because it's always nice to recommend a novel by an Islamic writer that touches on 9/11.

The story follows Nazneen over many years as she grapples with the Big Questions of Life: Is there such a thing as fate? Can an individual control or influence it? Are you bound by it? If this sounds dull, rest assured, it isn't. This is a wonderful story filled with vibrant, unforgettable characters. The author does a wonderful job of allowing us to see Nazneen's slow progression from dutiful daughter and wife to quietly confident woman. What makes it so true to life and keeps the book from being a feminist screed is that she shows that Nazneen's progression is not without hardship: \\"she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"Hard to believe that this is a first novel, it is so well-written.

It is the story of the liberation and strength of this woman, Nazneen, as she grows out of a childhood dominated by the concept of unmovable \\"fate\\" determining all action. As Nazneen evolves and begins to think for herself, she sees that she can take on \\"fate\\" and create her own perceptions, think her own ideas, feel her own feelings, and stand up to the powerful grinding forces that are always ready to ensnare her. Because her husband is \\"kind\\" and does not beat her, she is able to have moments of autonomy. She meets Karim, a young rebel who brings her work in the form of clothing to be sewn. They have a forbidden love affair. Her two daughters are perfectly drawn: the older westernized and cocky, the younger tense and insecure. And her husband is so well constructed as a character that you understand exactly what makes him tick. He is a multifaceted character, representing the immigrant experience in all its bluster and frustration and self-deceit. All this takes place in the backdrop of 9/11 and the Bangladeshi community in London, seemingly authentically described in depressing and rich detail.This book required my patience, as its pace is sometimes slow. But Monica Ali is a keen observer, and although at times she can overwrite and be carried away by her poetic rhetoric, she rewards the reader often with sharp images and perceptive character analysis. By the end of this book, I was convinced it was well worth the effort. The liberation of women is a worldwide movement, not just a western one, and this book chronicles its dramas, its agonies, and its triumphs. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I loved the idea of this book and was very open to it being as good as the hype, but it's not. To start with, the characters are too black and white, and not well drawn. Some characters don't even have names, they're a category: \\"The Questioner\\" and so forth. The characters that do have names are given characteristics much more that features. Chanu, the husband, is a pompous gasbag in the way that only the men of patriarchal cultures can be. He is a castles-in-the-air-type of person, and we read over and over about the selfish things he does, how he lords over and oppresses his wife and two daughers, how fat and revolting he is physically. His wife, Nazneen, married off by her father is virtuous, thoughtful, pious and not only runs the household, but ends up supporting her family with sewing piece-work. This book is LOOOOOOOONGGG, at least a hundred pages too long, and not in the good way. It's long in the way that has you skimming over pages, especially the ones about the Muslim group forming, losing your place and not caring, and basically just trying to get through it. After all that work, the denoument doesn't satisfy -- one can't believe that characters that have been shown to act one way (over and over and over) would suddenly start acting otherwise so the book could have the endig it did. Skip it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Fascinating book. As for the seller, the book came on time and in good condition. The price was reasonable."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane begins well. The characters are wittily drawn -- the protagonist's husband, Chanu, wouldn't be out of place in Dickens (and I'm afraid he'd take that as a compliment, poor fool). The structure is promising - the protagonist in London and her sister back home in Bangladesh tell their stories in counterpoint. We see how poverty and culture constrain their choices. Their lives unfold in a series of carefully explored scenes, from which we can infer the years between. *SPOILER ALERT* But then, alas, the second half of the book drifts off into all the cliches of chick lit. The female protagonist has an affair - of course - with a handsome young stranger - and uncovers an ill-concealed family skeleton - I'm sure you can guess, it's always either suicide or sexual abuse isn't it? - and finds empowerment, and sisterhood, and sexual self-determinism, blah blah blah. The really interesting issues raised in the first half of the book - acculturation, labor economics, the development of love in an arranged marriage - are just dropped without resolution."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The core of this book revolves around the themes of submission, immigration and integration. It's the story of Nazneen, a quiet young girl whose life changes when the arranged marriage to a much older man takes them to London's East End. She leaves behind all she had ever known in her native Bangladesh. Whilst her husband Chanu's hopes and dreams of a \\"big life\\" are slowly shattered, Nazneen devotes herself to raising her family, trying to adjust and make sense of a world that she doesn't quite understand. A lot happens in London and new people enter their life, influencing their thoughts and actions. Nazneen has always thought of herself and the events in her life to belong to fate and fate only but, without quite realising it, a hidden strength and determination lead her to an unexpected path.This book has a special depth, especially in connection with racial and social issues. The prose is flawless and make the characters come to life so vividly. I also very much appreciated the letters written in broken English by Nazneen's sister Hasina, which in themselves represent a different side of the story, directly from a member of the family left behind in Bangladesh.Some parts of this book are very moving and dramatic, however there are some ironic and comical events/dialogues, sad in themselves given the often pathetic circumstances, but they made me smile nevertheless.A lovely, gripping book, well done to Ms. Ali!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This story follows the lives of a family of Bangladeshi immigrants in London. The heroine, Nazneen, was born in a Bangladeshi village. She was arranged to be married at a young age to a man in London. The novel covers about 15 years and follows Nazneen's transformation from a naive, subservient wife into a strong-willed woman unafraid to make her own decisions. This personal development forms the central theme of the story. Nazneen was raised to have a fatalistic attitude towards life. She learned from her mother that a woman's lot on this earth is to suffer and bear this suffering stoically. Nazneen herself was born stillborn and her mother did not take her to a doctor, preferring to let Allah decide whether she would live or die. This attitude was imprinted on Nazneen at a young age and the story revolves around her escaping this mental straitjacket.The novel is populated with a number of interesting characters. Nazneen's husband, Chanu, is an ambiguous figure. On the one hand, he is no religious fundamentalist. He fancies himself as a sort of intellectual, and is familar with and has an appreciation for Western literature and philosophy. Despite these modern leanings, Chanu has retained many traditional attitudes. Although he never beats Nazneen and genuinely loves her, he expects her to play a subservient role and congratulates himself for being an enlightened man when he allows her to do simple things like go to the store alone or earn money through sewing. Although he appreciates the contributions of Western culture, he constantly rails against the moral depravity of British society. His dream is to eventually save up enough money to go back to Bangladesh, where his children will supposedly not have to deal with this moral corruption. Chanu seems to be a bit of a dilettante; he is obviously well-read and has accumulated a storehouse of useless knowledge, but he is unsuccessful at business and blaims his failures on real or perceived racism.Monica Ali explores a number of issues that are central to the immigrant experience. Nazneen's friend Razia has a son who is addicted to heroin. Nazneen's neighborhood, largely populated by Bangladeshi immigrants, has in recent years been overrun by gangs. Ali's novel also looks at how the 9/11 attacks impacted Nazneen's community. An Islamic community group is formed, but members of the group are divided over what they should do and what their tactics should be. The character of Mrs. Islam is a sort of community matriarch. She is old and scrupulous enough to have amassed considerable influence within the community. She loans money at outrageous interest to needy families, and employs her two uneducated sons as enforcers. She knows everything about everybody in the community, and often uses this knowledge of other people's private affairs as a form of ransom. Finally, through the characters of Nazneen's two daughters, we see how difficult it is for immigrant parents who wish to preserve some of their native culture. Chanu's efforts to instill in his daughter's an appreciation of the wonders of Bangladesh fall on deaf ears, as the two have lived in London their whole lives.Throughout the story, Nazneen receives letters from her younger sister Hasina, who still lives in Bangladesh. Hasina ran away from home to avoid an arranged marriage. Her first \\"love marriage\\" did not work out, and throughout the book she struggles as a single, uneducated woman in a traditional, patriarchal society.Overall, I really liked this book. It offers a valuable perspective on a number of important issues: tradition versus modernity, the role of women, assimilation versus multiculturalism, individual freedom versus societal pressures, the role of Islam, etc. Monica Ali treats these issues delicately, showing how they are dealt with by ordinary people on an everyday basis. I hope we see more novels like this from people with similar backgrounds.There were just a couple of things that prevented me from giving the book 5 stars. First, a good chunk of the book's text consists of letters Nazneen receives from Hasina. As they are written in a semi-literate style, they are not easy to read. I realize that Hasina is an uneducated woman, and the letters reflect that, but these letters simply took me about twice as long to read as the rest of the text. I can think of other authors who have managed to write from the perspective of uneducated people far more fluidly. Finally, the novel contains another plot twist that is rather central to the story. Nazneen has an affair with another man from within the community. I personally didn't think that this element of the story was handled very well, and it wasn't very convincing to me. However, that was just my own perspective and I will let others make their own judgments. Overall, I would recommend this book to anybody interested in the issues mentioned above."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"BRICK LANE by Monica AliJuly 15, 2006Rating ****Short-listed for the Booker Award, BRICK LANE is the story of a woman originally from Bangladesh, who is sent to London to marry an older man. Her younger sister had just ran away with a man not approved by her parents. A love match is what they call it, but Nazneen is the good daughter, not as beautiful as her sister Hasina, and she feels it is her good fortune to be matched with a man such as Chanu.Chanu is her new husband, older by about twenty years. He's not handsome, but he's a good man and treats her kindly. As time passes, Nazneen reflects on her life, her current role as wife and mother as well as her childhood in Bangladesh. She's not really happy, but she does what is expected of her.The people she meets in her new homeland are varied. There is her soon-to-be new best friend Razia, who is very butch and aggressive, but it is being away from their homeland that makes her this way, one is apt to believe. There's Mrs. Islam, a very large woman who intimidates many.And then there is Dr Azad, who becomes a regular guest at their home for dinner. Nazneen can't figure out why her husband (a man who seems to think he knows it all, but doesn't seem to be able to hold down a job despite all his certificates and degrees) and this doctor are even friends, and what do they see in each other? This becomes a running theme in the novel, as she watches the two of them \\"talk\\" and interact with one another throughout the years.Then she meets Karim, who brings her work (sewing) as well as his world as he sees it, into her life and opens up Nazneen's eyes and heart and passions, as she's never felt before.I wasn't sure what to think of BRICK LANE. Monica Ali does a great job with telling her tale, and she is very descriptive and lyrical in her writing. The book is filled with a lot of reflection, although the story is constantly moving, with Nazneen's memories from the past, letters from Hasina, and action in the present. I think my problem was I did not quite bond with the characters, and I always felt I was more of an observer than a participant. It is definitely a book that did deserve all the accolades it received when it came out a few years ago. However, as a whole, the book didn't touch me the way I had hoped it would."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"For a person like me, who hates not to finish reading a book, I had the hardest of the time finishing Brick Lane.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed in it. It was nicely written in places and I was happy for Nanzeen's final choice but, for the most part, I was ready for the next book by the time I was half way through.The characters had so much potential but remained flat and inanimate throughout. There were so many times when they could have sprung to life but did not. The ending seemed a bit false to me - all of a sudden, Nanzeen has the courage to stand up to her husband? Her image as a meek woman through much of the book did not match up with the woman having an affair with a younger man. I also think Ali wrapped up that affair too neatly. Where was the pain, the torment, anything to show that the affair was worth something to either participant?It was a nice read but I much prefer a book that I can immerse myself in at least one angle - the story line, the characters, the setting, anything. That just did not happen in this book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This books had many starts and stops. Unfortunately, there are too many stops.

I, luckily, borrowed this book from the library just I didn't feel as I wasted my money. I think the book would have been so much more interesting if it had been written with the sister's view and her story, albeit a little more realistic. However, this book was too long, boring and depressing."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I have read \\"Brick Lane\\", by Monica Ali, over a period of two and a half months. We had to read it in school, so we concerned ourself intensively with this book. Believe you me, if I hadn't had to read it in school, I wouldn't have bought it to readin my leisure time. Every time I started reading the book I had to stop myself from yawning!This book is about a Muslim woman from Bangladesh, called Nazneen, who is forced to marry a 40-year old man, named Chanu, at the age of 18. When Nazneen was born everybody thought that she would die except her mother who believed that if fate decided her daughter should live, then she would live. Nazneen survives and this is the reason why she accepts everything that happens to her instead of fighting against her fate.After the marriage both live together in a small flat in Tower Hamlets in London. Nazneen always misses her younger sister, Hasina, who lives in Dhaka. In contrast to Nazneen Hasina does not believe that her fate is already sealed. In her opinion her fate lies in her own hands. While Nazneen lives in London with her kind and educated husband, who does not beat her. Hasina has a horrible life in Dhaka.Nazneen envies her younger sister a little because she takes responsibility for her own life.Although Nazneen knows that she is not allowed to have an affair, she starts one with a younger man, she does not really love.During their life in London Chanu has to suffer some defeats, so that he thinks that it is the best idea for his family to go back to Bangladesh. At this moment Nazneen realizes that she has to act in a responsible manner and tell her husband that he is the only one who goes back to Bangladesh, because Nazneen as well as her daughters would be unhappy in Dhaka.Finally, Nazneen stays in London with her children and works in a fashion factory of one of her friends. Her husband has moved to Dhaka and her affair has also ended. On the whole, Nazneen seems to be really happy when she takes control of her life.All in all, I am totally surprised that this book is a \\"Sunday Times\\" bestseller because, in my opinion, their is nothing special about Monica Ali's work. It is just boring!The story is introduced by Nazneen's birth and how she is left to her fate. Although it is a nice idea to start a novel with a flashback, it is actually pretty boring because of the way it is written, in other words she uses a lot of description that makes the book uninteresting, and the topic \\"fate\\" does not belong to any important issues like poverty, unemployment, etc. A topic that relates to one of them might have been more interesting. During the whole novel you are reminded by almost every event that Nazneen was left to her fate. On the one hand, you can say that the characters have a personality development, but on the other hand it is not a big one and after a few pages you realize that it is always the same, so that you are not interested in reading the book any more.I think specially Chanu, who always teaches Nazneen, Mrs.Islam, who crave for money, and the self-pitying Dr.Azad are boring. They show the same behavioural pattern until nearly the end of the novel and then their personalities change from one moment to the next. It is so taxing to try to remember anything about them. Another annoying aspect is the way it is structured, e.g. by Hasina's letters. Although I know that her English is not better than Nazneen's English, which is actually really bad, I am surprised that her letters are written in bad English instead of perfect English. It might have been more pleasant to read and as a matter of fact it wouldn't have changed anything, because they would have written each other the letters in their own language. As a result it is more difficult to concentrate on reading them, so that you are soon on bad terms with thebook in general.You can describe this book with just one word: BORING!!!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Do yourself a favor and pass on this book. Could not care about the characters, story just seemed to go on and on. It was way too long which just increased the pain."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control. Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live. This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate. When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.London is lonely. Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife. She tries being passive and going along with her life. Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties. It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness. It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read. Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable. I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children. The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The reason I gave this book one star is that it is not possible to give none.Every time I walked into a bookstore for a couple of months I wanted to buy this book, because it was getting very good reviews and the beginning was promising.

At no point did I feel I was actually getting involved in the characters' lives - I simply couldn't care less.

She leads a host of supporting characters through daily life in their little slice of London life. Fleshing out the ranks behind her are: Razia, over-weight and self-absorbed; Chanu, the over-bearing bumpkin of a husband; Shahana, the shin-kicking teenage daughter, the brat whose neck you want to wring; Bibi, the loving, adoring and eager-to-please younger daughter; Hasina, the letter writing sister, and anchoring voice from her former home, Dhaka, Bengladesh; Ms. Islam, the stingy, hypochondriacal loanshark; Dr. Azad the learned doctor and unloved husband; Karim, the morally-upright, yet lustful, responsible yet irresponsible, handsome, virile, and available lover ...the list goes on. These characters spring to life in all of their various stages of non-linear, unpredictable complexity.Through Nazeen's life, the reader gains access into London's Brick Lane where Bengalees has been transported. They are immigrants seeking the &quot;better life&quot;. Their arrival is accompanied by cultural confusion and breakdown of traditional values. Their families are bombarded with drugs and other vicissitudes but in the end they learn the new ways, integrate new values into their lives and transform their identities.As readers, we learn about the rural Bengaldesh of Nazeen's memory. She frequently returns to the land of her childhood, in dreams in fantasies, and in recollections, in her desire for things known. We are also shown the modern state of Bengaladesh as Chanu delivers sermons to his captive daughters and wife. We are driven into an English-Bengali life to then look out at white English people. Nazeen's unassuming anxiety about cultural clues gave me, a non-Bengali reader, insight into my own culture and cultural assumptions without having to travel to another land. It is unlikely that, even if I travelled to London or Dhaka, that I would have been privy to this life.&quot;But they were not aware of her. In the next instant she knew it. They could not see her any more than she could see God. They knew that she existed (just as she knew that He existed) but unless she did something, waved a gun, halted the traffic, they would not see her. She enjoyed this thought. She began to scrutinize. She stared at the long, thin faces, the pointy chins. The women had strange hair. It puffed up around their heads, pumped up like a snake's hood. They pressed their lips together and narrowed their eyes as though they were angry at something they had heard, or at the wind for messing their hair.&quot;Our heroine is a woman that doesn't seem to know herself, just loves whom she loves, goes where she is sent, cooks what is expected that she cook. She changes, sometimes slowly, unassumingly and sometimes, rapidly and unexpectedly. She comes alive in her indecision, in her faith, in her lust, and in her confusion.&quot;Nazeen could not concentrate on her sewing. She watched the back of Karim's head, the strong lines his neck made. If she were to describe him to Hasina, what would she say?That even when you knew you had not, you could end up believing you had said something that might change his life....She would say that he knew so many things. ...Chanu also knew many things but they only left him bewildered. If knowledge was food then while Karim grew strong on his intake, Chanu become only bloated, bilious, and pained. The made Karim made you feel was...&quot;She struggles with her faith, she is flawed, she has doen peculiar, idiosyncratic. For example, she has passed many hours in the night, standing at the kitchen counter eating, after her family is in bed; a thinking/non-thinking.&quot;For her, there was nothing else to be done. Nothing else that God wanted her to do. Sometimes she wanted to get up and run. Most of the time she did not want to run, but neither did she want to sit still. How difficult it was, this business of sitting still. But there was nothing really to complain of. There was Chanu, who was kind and never beat her. There was Raqib. And there was this shapeless, nameless thing that crawled across her shoulders and nested in her hair and poisoned her lungs, that made her both restless and listless.&quot;This life goes-on-type of story lends strength to the human heart through the perseverance of the characters while holding the readers attention with like a spicy, aromatic, well-prepared dinner that will keep you reading through the night.

His heroine, also, falls in love with a charismatic religious leader ... the contrast in the style of handling the material, and in the influences of culture, time, and place, are a fascinating study. And, notice that Ms. Ali refers to Tagore directly several times in her book. Some readers may wish to read the Home and the World, as a companion to Brick Lane."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"As someone below wisely noted, Monica Ali's first novel, shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize (and expected to have won, though it lost out), is in many ways a response to THE HOME AND THE WORLD, the beautiful turn-of-the-century novel by Rabindranath Tagore, the Nobel prizewinning Bengali poet and novelist. As in Tagore's novel, Ali's work shows the very circumscribed world of a Bangla woman, her husband who adores her, and the young man who excites her, and the competing claims the public life makes upon her own inner sanctum. Nazneen, the central character of Ali's novel, is extremely beautifully fleshed out, and her inner life is probed with great profundity despite the quietness of her actions and the closed-in nature of her immediate physical world. Her stubborn and talkative husband Chanu--at times contemptible, at other times quite loveable, and always human-- also emerges as a memorable three-dimensional character, and their interactions frame an intelligent meditation on multiculturalism, on Islam, on women, on Britain, on Bangladesh. This is a superb first work."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali offers a peek inside the mysterious world of immigrant Muslims in England. As a Muslim myself, I was deeply impressed with the honest portrayal of the lives of these characters, a portrayal that flies in the face of the one-dimentional view and gross misconceptions of Muslims that are perpetuated by a lazy media. It is very difficult for the Muslim community to take an unvarnished look at itself, as Brick Lane offers, when it is under attack from all sides. No doubt, members of the Muslim community will feel as if Ms. Ali is exposing too much in public, but this novel is not meant to be a documentary. Brick Lane is an exploration of one thin slice of this community. This is a novel of growth, hope, pain, and honesty."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Stunning. This is great novel about love, fitting in, and the pain of loss. More importantly, this is how it is for many muslim immigrants, and as such is almost social realism. One of the best London novels I've read in years. Oh and Brick lane itself is wonderfully realised too: you can almost smell the spices coming off the page."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I do a lot of reading, and this was the best novel I've read in the last year. Ali has an amazing imagination, a keen eye for character and human nature, and a wonderful sense of humor. Her sense of language is lyrical and magical.I loved how the details of London streetlife are colored by Nazneen's (the main character) lack of experience with the modern world. The details progress as she becomes accustomed to her adopted city. And unlike the stereotypical immigrant wife, she's not some helpless victim, she applies her power through the ways afforded to her; subtle, not-so-subtle, and sometimes passive-aggressively, just like in real life.The work spills over with such subjects as assimilation, the patriarchal use of religious faith as a cudgel against women (of course, this could be true of any organized religion), global economic inequities, the post-9-11 world for Muslims, and incisive observations of what it means to be a human being. It's a heady mix that sometimes feels like too much but I couldn't put the book down; I became engrossed in Nazneen's plight through vivid language and Ali's fearless and intuitive storytelling.Where Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" never reaches the full promise of its first few chapters, I feel that Ali channels the energy of the book successfully from beginning to end. There were some places where the conflict between the characters felt glossed over, but overall I think this is great work that will stand the test of time."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is the story of a young Bangladeshi woman who is sent to London as a bride. It is the late 1980s and she has to adapt to the challenges of an arranged marriage. It is a restricted world, of course, as she rarely leaves their tiny apartment and everyone she meets is alo immigrant from Bangladesh. She does adjust though, and we follow her life for the next dozen years, including the tragic death of one of her three children. We also observe growing Islamic militancy and the influence of Western culture on traditional values.It is only after we get to know this woman from the inside out that a new character is introduced, a young man full of Islamic fervor. By now it's 2001 and the whole community is affected by the events of 9/11.We also get to see the infrequent letters she receives from her sister, who is still in Bangladesh. There's a constant contrast between the two sisters, the one in Bangladesh having run away for a &quot;love marriage&quot; with horrible results. She is cast out and alone and has to survive a factory job, then by selling her body, and later as a servant. Life in Bangladesh is harsh.One of the best things about this book is how the author can really get inside these two womens' minds. One has accepted her fate. The other has fought against it. Both of them have different challenges. And each of them is a product of her culture as well as the world around her. All her descriptions ring true and made me look at things in a new way.The author knows her subject well. She was born in Bangladesh and came to London as a child. She's now married and has two children. The photo on the flyleaf shows her in Western clothes.

Their parents can see this also, and try to turn them around.Nanzeen has a sister, Hasina, who stays in Bangladesh. Through their letters, we can see Hasina's love marriage to an abusive man. She flees this marriage and goes to Dhaka. The years and her escapades move on, and the adversity that Hasina braves is reflected in her letters. She is a loving and faithful sister, and they remain close through their letters.Nanzeen falls in love with a young man in the community, and through this relationship Nanzeen awakens and starts to flourish. We can see the change in Nanzeen, and she is transformed into a young woman who can make her own decisions.Nanzeen and her husband, Chanu are marvelous cooks. The descriptions of the preparation of their meals with the spices and ingredients from their world permeate this book. The food is colorful and many decisions are made with Nanzeen eating from plastic containers by the kitchen sink. The spices and flavors of this world bring to mind many wonderful curries and Indian foods. Colorful saris and cloths and pictures bring to us a culture we have read about, and are now beginning to understand.The decisions made by Chanu and Nanzeen bring their family to a brink. We are allowed into the politics of this culture in London. We hear how events in the United States play in their life. We see that the more mature Nanzeen makes mature decisions that allow her children to lead the life that they want. This is the kind of book that you do not want to end. I want to know more, I want to know what happens next. The book ends with a hint of promise.. enjoy. prisrob"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"For someone who never puts a book down once I have started no matter how little it appeals to me, I did the impossible and gave up reading the rest of Brick Lane when I arrived at 200 pages. The reviews on Monica Ali's book promised so much, but gave so little. A long drawn out book with a few redeeming scenes (when Nazneen's first child was ill in hospital and she and Chanu took turns to keep watch), Brick Lane is tough going. Especially annoying was the gibberish from Nazneen's sister which I assumed was meant to be Bengali expressed in direct transliteration. The characters were neither fascinating nor inspirational nor interesting nor deserving of empathy. Of course if I had plodded on I might have changed my mind, but the point being that it was so un-engaging there was no desire on my part to get to the end of it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane is about a woman for Bangladesh who moves to London to marry a man she is arranged to marry and how Nazneen progressively tries to better her live. The book nicely displays Nazeen's development and shows how she grows as a character. In the beginning of the novel Nazeen is very shy, naive, and over powered, but towards the end she becomes much stronger and much more incharge of her live. I very much enjoyed Ali's cunning sense of metaphors, and her play on ideas. Ali has the power to make her audiance physically sense her writing: I could smell the spices and feel Nazneen's disgust when observing Chanu's sloppiness and large gut. In addition to her nice descriptions, Ali wrotie about several things that one could relate to. However, even though the writing was superb, i felt the plot moved too slowly. I felt Ali dawdled too much beforing getting to the heart of the book. It could have easily been half the length of what it was. Even though the climax of the book was thrilling there was too much dead space proceeding it and thus it wasn't a book one couldn't put down. Plus i felt the letters between Nazeen and Hasina were pointless, they didn't at all affect the plot line or the development of any characters. Overall, i felt the book was pretty mediocre, but as i said before the actual text was first-rate."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Here's one of those books that gets terrific reviews yet comparatively few readers -- and, I predict, will be completely forgotten, say, 10 years from now.I look forward to Ali's next book. She clearly has talent. But it's not put in service of a great story here. It sounds like it should be a great story -- a knowledgeable account of a world previously unknown to most of us, the Bangladeshi immigrant community in London. But Ali fails to give us a world. She only gives us one point of view. And that point of view, frankly, is boring.Nazneen has come to England after an arranged marriage. She knows no English and nothing of the culture. Slowly she learns about her new place and comes to understand her husband and the others around her. But because the point of view is so narrowly Nazneen, we as readers are trapped, for the most part, along with her in a gloomy little flat.You keep wishing Ali would let other characters take center stage, if only for a while. Nazneen's sister alone, left behind in Bangladesh, has a more interesting story to tell, if only we could read more than fragments. This is a consistent problem throughout the book. We want to know more about people beside Nazneen, whose final triumphs feel rushed and forced.Ali is often perceptive, but here, too, a little of what she chooses to focus on goes a long way. We learn what certain characters' posture or speech patterns say about their character -- and then Ali repeats the same points about the same characters ad nauseum.It's far from a terrible book. In fact, Brick Lane is close to a great book -- frustratingly close. Here is a book that could have used a wise (or maybe just pushy) editor."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This review is coming from a American Muslim Bengali's perspective, and I've got to say that the book captured the very essence of many Muslim Bengali Immigrants here in Michigan. The author did a great job in capturing the Bengali traditions and the clash they had upon the Islamic religion. I consider myself more of a American Muslim than a Bengali, having never placed foot on Bangladesh once in my lifetime. The fact that Monica Ali did not distinguish the actions taken by the &quot;mulla&quot; and Nazneen as being extremely forbidden by Islam rather than just a &quot;sin&quot;, irritates me. Monica does not have to further her research on the Bengali culture, rather she should base her research on the misconceptions Bengali's have regarding their religion and culture clash (touching the feet of elders for their blessings is hindu-derived, whereas many &quot;Muslim&quot; Bengalis follow suit, it is strictly forbidden by Islam to bow to any one other than the Almighty). Her conception of the citizens of Dhaka vs those of Sylhet is very true. Being from a Sylheti family, I can feel the pressure without having ever being there. Although she writes from a British perspective, the story she conjures into being, can(possibly already has numerous times) take place in the streets of Hamtramck and Detroit, Michigan today!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"In American culture, Nazneen, the Bangladeshi protagonist of Ali's debut novel, might be called passive aggressive. When displeased with her husband, she balls his dirty socks up and puts them back in the drawer. Or lets the razor slip when she cuts his corns, drawing blood. Not that he notices. Chanu, like many busy, ineffectual men, hasn't a clue.Nazneen lives her life by the precepts of her mother's favorite story of her: \\"How You Were Left to Your Fate.\\" She was stillborn, then breathed but refused the nipple. Her mother refused medical help, family advice. Instead, she waited. God would decide.In the first chapter, Nazneen's path is charted: \\"What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge. So that, at the age of thirty-four, after she had been given three children and had one taken away, when she had a futile husband and had been fated a young and demanding lover, when for the first time she could not wait for the future to be revealed but had to make it for herself, she was as startled by her own agency as an infant who waves a clenched fist and strikes itself upon the eye.\\"The story begins with Nazneen's arranged marriage at 18, after her sister Hasina's shameful elopement, to a man living in London. Ali, herself born in Bangladesh, skillfully conveys the loneliness and bewilderment of a village girl in a block of flats teeming with immigrants. Chanu wants her to live a traditional indoor life, though she has none of the traditional family support. She keeps her feelings to herself, finds ways to obey the spirit, if not the letter of his will. Her best friend is loud, cigarette-smoking Razia who defies respectability and speaks her mind out loud.Then her sister's \\"love match\\" collapses, and Hasina flees her abusive husband. A woman alone in Bangladesh is by definition in danger. Nazneen is desperate for her husband to act, but he does not. This bitter time, and her small revolts, further shape her marriage and Nazneen's inner turmoil is a secret from her husband, fostering larger betrayals.Letters from Hasina, though they sometimes read like a device for conveying the growing turmoil in Bangladesh, and a woman at the mercy of her patriarchal Muslim culture, further underscore the divide in Nazneen's marriage. But Chanu, though he may be an intellectual dreamer, incapable of action, is a good-hearted, kind man who loves his wife.Eventually, her daughters Westernized and rebellious, Nazneen gives in to passion, taking a lover from among the burgeoning radicals in the community - young people born to a Bengal culture in a new country. Torn between Western temptations and family traditions, beset by racist resentment and fear, they cleave to Islamic fundamentalism in a complex mix of anger, pride and preservation.When, at last, she asks Karim why he chose her, he says she is \\"the real thing,\\" a village girl who doesn't dance in short skirts or wear the burkha and \\"ARGUE.\\"Ali's eloquent, deceptively simple prose underscores the complexity of her world. Her dialogue is pitch perfect and her characters express themselves equally strongly in their silences, their gestures, their grooming, and their posturing. Her multi-faceted portrayal of post-September 11 reactions segues into a personal resolution that remains in doubt until the last page. A thoughtful, involving and beautiful debut."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Read this book! While it is not the \\"book of the century\\", it is a good reading.It is not necessary to dissect every character or situation; concentrate on small details that are some times perfect, almost visual (Nazneen in the butcher shop). Also I cannot get rid of the idea that some of the negative critics are due to the fact that we don't find the stereotype figures and situations in this book. Neither Nazneen nor her husband is what we accept of a \\"Muslim couple\\" in London. Whether these figures are credible -- I don't know, but I am sure we would not complain if Chanu were beating up his wife daily; if their daughters were hiding behind the veil, and if Nazneen were destroyed physically or mentally by her domestic chores. (Which she is not.) That would meet our worldview. Or maybe some of us didn't like Nazneen's friend Karim saying after 911: \\"I can tell you--no Arab nation benefits. No Muslim anywhere in the world. We are the ones who're going to suffer. You got to ask, who benefits?\\"However, I really disliked the ending; not giving out any clue: it is pathetic. Skip the last two pages then you will have a good enjoyable lot better than average book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Allow me to preface this review by stating that I really wanted to enjoy BRICK LANE; I have a weakness for literature from the Indian subcontinent and always enjoy the colorful quirky characters, but this book never delivered any enjoyment. The beginning was slow and Monica Ali's prose was disturbingly choppy and uneven. About halfway through I was ready to hang my hat and call it quits as the plot became more and more ridiculous. The only redeeming quality was the character of Chanu, the patriarch of the family, who was beautifully created and realistic. I wish that Ali would have focused more on him and put the wife to the background. Her letters from her sister in Dhaka were painful to read and made my eyes ache trying to figure them out. What literary purpose was it to write letters in that style? To put it mildly I was very disappointed with BRICK LANE and wonder how it even achieved the esteem of being on the 2003 Booker Shortlist? There are much better books in this genre that should receive more attention. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane focuses on the story of Nazneen who moves to a Bangladesh community in London when she is still very young. Her marriage to a man named Chanu was arranged and she had very little choice in what she wanted to do with her life. Her destiny as a housewife and mother seems to have been set, but one of the main focuses of this novel is questioning whether the individual can have a hand in forming his or her own destiny. This age old question is artfully contemplated as we follow Nazneen through a great portion of her life while she gives birth three times and cares for her husband. Much of the novel seems to pass in the calm routines of her daily life. However, now and then we are given glimpses of Nazneen's rebellious thoughts which signify that she is anything but a passive character. When she meets an attractive radical named Karim we are aware that everything could easily change.Brewing beneath this internal and domestic struggle is a conflict in the community of Bangladesh immigrants who are caught between assimilation to English life and reinventing a shared space where they can express their religion and culture. Many of these people came to England with the hope of earning a fortune and returning to their own country triumphantly wealthy. This rarely happens. Many have to renegotiate their sense of their own identities to survive in a culture that is alien and sometimes hostile toward them. Political groups form in the community. Things come to a crisis. It becomes evident that the community is not as threatened by groups outside of itself as by it's own internal divisions. The fact that many of these Bagladeshi people live their entire lives in England and still feel like outsiders is illuminated in a scene where Chanu takes his family on a hilarious outing to view London like tourists.Monica Ali gives tremendous dignity to all her characters. While many may feel a natural sympathy with Nazneen as a captive to her own household, the idealistic Chanu is drawn as a very complex and loveable character. He may be stubborn, unappreciative and lost in his own dreams. But he's also shown to be very loving, honest and loyal to his family. Throughout the entire novel Nazneen keeps in touch with her sister who lives a difficult life in Bangladesh. This gives a hint of the life she might have had if she had chosen not to obediently follow tradition and proceed with her arranged marriage. This novel is filled with humor and sorrow making it an extremely compulsive and delightful read. The familial struggles really transcend any national boundaries however formed they are by cultural traditions. Ali gives a truly universal story in a very specific setting."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane is an amazing story of Nazreen, a Bangladeshi female immigrant who moved to a Bangladesh community in London as a young woman and wife of an old man. Through her, the author successfully captured the Bengali traditions and the clash their contradictions upon the Islamic religion. The misconceptions Bengalis and many other Islamic people have vis-&agrave;-vis their religion and culture incompatibilities is vividly portrayed in this book. Hindu practices, traditions and culture are intertwined with Islam to give it a different blend.Like in Disciples of Fortune Other Stories, it depicts culture and religion in an amazing way.Nazreen gets married to Chanu through an arranged marriage where she had no choice, thereby cementing her destiny as a housewife. But then the reader soon finds that docile and obedient Nazreen's resigned life is interrupted now and then by her rebellious thoughts, a rebellious side that is unveiled when the path of the attractive radical named Karim crosses he path. This fast paced novel is rich in plot and has a fascinating setting."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Other than finding it a bit of a long haul getting through Chanu's lenghty philisophical pontifications, I thought this book was generally a good read. Ali certainly has a different writing style from others and that is fine, although sometimes I feel she works a bit too hard to be different. The book did however leave an impression with me and I doubt I'll forget it anytime soon. I felt I could identify with many of Nazneen's inner struggles of faith (although mine is a strict Christian background)and morality; I think Ali portrayed these sensitively and accurately. I actually liked the way she implyed Hasina's accent in her letters, I felt as though I could hear her speaking. I thought it added to the book's interest rather than detract from it. I am glad I chose to read it, it broadened my outlook."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"You know you are dealing with an acclaimed book when the critical praise blurbs run to four pages at the beginning of the novel. Monica Ali's BRICK LANE made it to no fewer than ten &quot;Best of 2003&quot; lists, including a nod from the editors of the New York Times Book Review. It won the 2003 Discover Award for Fiction and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. All of which makes it slightly intimidating to review. What if the emperor has no clothes?Luckily for me and the rest of the book buying public, the emperor is not only wearing clothes, it's an all-Prada outfit, complete with a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos.At the novel's outset, however, the protagonist, Nazneen, is about as far from Prada and Manolo Blahnik has one could get. BRICK LANE begins with her birth in what was at the time East Pakistan, soon-to-be reborn as Bangladesh. Born into a small Muslim village, a premature baby who wouldn't eat, Nazneen was Left To Her Fate. Frequent retellings of the story dictated the capitalizations; her Amma (mother) refused to take her to the hospital, leaving Nazneen's life in God's hands.Nazneen's fate becomes the central spoke of the novel as her parents arrange a marriage to a much older Bangladeshi man and pack her off, sight unseen, to London. Her husband, Chanu, who sees Nazneen as an &quot;unspoilt girl from the village,&quot; is himself a mass of tics and insecurities, as full of puff and blather as he is devoid of social graces. The walls of his flat are covered with his framed certificates of achievement. &quot;This one is from the Centre for Meditation and Healing ... Here's one from the Writer's Bureau ... This is not actually a certificate ... it's just directions to the school, but that's all they gave out.&quot; As is seemly in her culture, Nazneen submits herself silently to his theories and his many needs, including using a razor to slice the corns away from his toes. Not surprisingly Nazneen spends time forcing herself to accept this new way of life. &quot;Every particle of skin on her body prickled with something more physical than loathing. It was the same feeling she had when she used to swim in the pond and came up with a leech stuck to her leg or her stomach.&quot;As time passes and the two weather various crises, Nazneen learns to view Chanu with a bit more acceptance. They have two daughters, one of whom (Shanana) battles constantly with Chanu, mainly over her assimilation into British culture. The other daughter, Bibi, craves stability and acceptance. &quot;It was like walking through a field of snakes. Nazneen was worried at every step ... It was up to her to balance the competing needs, to soothe here and urge there, and push the day along to its close ... It took all her energy. It took away longing.&quot; Adding to Nazneen's worries is the fact that her sister Hasina still lives in Bangladesh, and Hasina's letters present a life even harder than Nazneen's.In an attempt to earn a little money, Nazneen agrees to take in some sewing projects, turning out garments in a sweatshop-like arrangement. Her projects are arranged by a young man, Karim, with whom Nazneen launches into a torrid love affair. She moves outside her passivity and forgets her fate. &quot;It was as if the conflagration of her bouts with Karim had cast a special light on everything, a dawn light after a life lived in twilight. It was as if she had been born deficient and only now been gifted the missing sense.&quot;Living in a post-9/11 world fills Chanu with conflict. He worries simultaneously that his daughters are becoming too English and too Muslim. His solution? Move back to Bangladesh. But can Nazneen accept this as her fate?Ali's characters are a study in subtlety. It is to her credit that she can create such a vivid world with someone who rarely even speaks as its centerpiece. It is a tight, compact story that adds a new dimension to the immigrant experience, evoking the line they all walk between two cultures, between fate and responsibility, between duty and freedom. Nazneen, above all, understands this.&quot;Bibi always asked for stories. She wanted the words because the words stitched her mother close.&quot;&quot;Tell us the one about How You Were Left To Your Fate.&quot;&quot;Not that one,&quot; groaned Shahana. &quot;It's boring.&quot;&quot;True,&quot; said Nazneen. &quot;I'll tell you a better one.&quot;--- Reviewed by Shannon Bloomstran"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"A review should always try to address its subject in its own terms. The purpose, after all, is many-sided, to summarise, paraphrase, contextualise, all with the express intention of informing a potentially interested participant of the nature of the experience on offer. Any proffered review that merely says I did or did not like it is thus entirely specious, since it conveys nothing of the work in focus, only the doubly-uninterpretable reaction of a dismembered, effectively anonymous opinion.So in the case of Brick Lane by Monica Ali a dutiful list of the elements must begin with the setting. For the majority non-Londoners, Brick Lane is a market street in East London. It is just up the road from the eastern fringes of the City of London, the financial centre that boasts gleaming towers and vast wealth. (Or perhaps it once did!)But over the years Brick Lane has been a magnet for new migrants, communities marginalised by both origin and destination. It has also been a centre for political action of all shades. The current occupants of this social clearing house are Bangladeshis and the street, in particular, has become a centre for Bangladeshi culture and food.So, at the centre of Monica Ali's novel is a Bangladeshi woman, Nazneen, who arrives in Britain to meet her husband, Chanu, an apparently slobbering slob, imbued with more social manners than domestic. But arrangement suffices, as Nazneen learns to cope with married life in a foreign place in which she has no ties and little communication.Nazneen's experience in London's Brick Lane is juxtaposed via an exchange of letters with the parallel experience of Hasina, her sister in Bangladesh. The two women's experiences eventually diverge as local pressures demand decision and action.The contrasts, along with the considered tensions between white working class racism and Muslim identity promotion in east London ought to provide a powerful vehicle with which to explore worlds of culture, experience, relationships and ideology. Brick Lane, unfortunately, falls short of every destination. Unfortunately again, the characters are weak, the artifice feels false, the vibrant location is portrayed as dull and the passions of ideological difference are confused and politically limp or naive.Brick Lane was an ambitious project, but it began confused and lost direction as it progressed. It does have its moments, but its hours are long, and not a little tedious."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"As I curled up in bed with Brick Lane in hand, I prepared myself for a tale of what I thought would be a conflict between love, morality, and responsibility. I was expecting a battle between races, a story of desires, independence, and subordination. What I discovered in the novel was a more weakened version of those themes than what I had hoped for.When the story began I was intrigued with the idea of fate and destiny. Since Nazneen's survival of a seemingly terminal illness at birth was deemed the result of fate, would a lifetime of marriage to a churlish and repulsive man be similarly ascribed? Or would the destiny that had saved her in the beginning also rescue her from her somewhat oppressive husband? I initially felt a strong connection to Nazneen; I hoped that fate would take her away from the husband she so loathed. However, this passionate desire for independence that I shared with Nazneen, slowly deteriorated as the uneventful and sluggish plot unfolded. The development of Chanu was inadequate. Vivid portrayals of his physique, with corns and a flabby body, convinced me of his repulsiveness. Yet I never believed him to be domineering enough. He never hurt Nazneen and she was never truly bound to spend boring days in their flat. On the days when she would break away from her dreary routine, Chanu never knew and never cared. Rather than hoping for and anticipating Nazneen's escape from her \\"imprisonment,\\" I found myself searching for ways to abhor Chanu, which I was never fully able to do. And because I never came to detest Chanu, I could not sympathize with Nazneen.I think in order for Brick Lane to have been a more pleasurable and meaningful novel, each part of the story needs to be made stronger, more jarring, and more present. Chanu should have been developed beyond a man solely focused on himself and his studies; he should have been cold and cruel. Hasina should have been more than a few unintelligible letters placed annoyingly throughout the book and Karim and the Bengal Tigers should have been more than some delivered pamphlets with seemingly random messages. I think the book was filled with wonderful and captivating ideas. However, while alluring on the outset, it left me hungry for any real substance."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is just another depressing book about South Asians. I have to admit I only got half way through, so maybe the end was better, but I tend to doubt it.I got the book on CD - listening to the whiney South Asian woman reading it was painful."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Introducing Nazneen, an 18-year-old who has just moved to London in an arranged marriage with a man twice her age, this story sets the stage for many interesting conflicts and adjustments. How will Nazneen, accustomed to living a quiet life in a Bangledesh village, deal with the challenges of a huge city, largely filled with white people raised with different values from her own? How will she deal with Chanu, her fat, lazy husband who fancies himself an intellectual, an unrecognized prince among paupers? More importantly, how will Nazneen deal with the tragic loss of her baby son, the only thing that really tied Chanu and herself together?Meanwhile, Nazneen feels for her younger sister Hasina, who eloped in a love marriage that ended badly. Throughout the years, she keeps track of her sister's whereabouts through poorly-written letters, which leave Nazneen to read between the lines. If only she could bring Hasina to their home in London!While all these issues are addressed, it happens in too plodding a way...almost like a villager in Nazneen's homeland, taking a slow walk around the land. Perhaps that's the way Ali intended it; after all, the course of real life is rarely, if ever, concise and action-packed. But in a novel, it takes a real talent to pull it off. After a while, the reader just wants to know what's happened, and move on.Not being overly familiar with Bangledesh, with Muslims, or with immigrants in London, I found Ali's details and insight into their lives fairly interesting. But, overall, even that wasn't enough to capture and keep my interest in this book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This book is about the immigrant experience, and to a smaller (and perhaps unintended) extent, also a very compassionate study of adultery. A Bangladeshi woman is transplanted into Brick lane following her marriage. She brings with her the South Asian beliefs of \\"accepting\\" what happens to you, and so must win small everyday battles to assert her identity. The ultimate showdown happens when her husband Chanu decides to move back to Bangladesh- now Nazneen must choose between creating a future for herself and her children or accepting whatever is fated for her. Ali scores in this slow motion study of Nazneen's liberation, and her family's struggles and dreams.I only wished it was a 100 pages shorter. Omitting several of Chanu's discourses, as well as the boring narrations of the meetings of the Bengal Tigers would have made the book much more intense."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Initially, after reading reviews by critics and seeing how it was a runner-up of the Man Booker Prize, I was pretty interested in reading this book.The beginning of the book showed definite promise. I thought that the book was going to submerse me into the world of an immigrant coming to England for the first time, coping with married life and learning more about herself, her limited freedoms and how she deals with her newfound reality.Instead what I got was writing that didn't make any sense to me in many parts of the book, were extremely boring [didn't anybody tire of Chanu's constant philosophical rantings?] and no attachment whatsoever to the characters. I felt like i never got a clear picture of who the characters really were and therefore i really found myself struggling to sympathize with any of them.As I continued reading, i thought the book would maybe get better--perhaps the climax would be exciting. Boy was I wrong. To me, the book was one long really boring soap-opera. This book totally does immigrant life and adjustment to a new country stories injustice.If you're looking for good stories about immigrants and themes similar to this horrible book, read Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri. Instead of long, horrendously boring passages that leave you baffled and yawning, Lahiri present picturesque portrayals.This book is one of the worst i've ever read and boy do i regret spending 3 hours reading it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Just really never got in to the characters and I felt the book jumped all over the place. Also, thought the relationship w/the young man Nazneen meets would be more exciting or refreshing -- a total let down.I didn't care about the characters at all and felt overwhelmed by all of the \\"letters\\" regarding Hasina, Nazneen's sister.Really didn't enjoy it at all."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Since most of the reviewers have already shared the storyline of this novel, I will spare the reader any more- much as I wish Monica Ali had done. The novel is 300 pages too long...Read Jhumpa Lahiri instead."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"The main story, told from the perspective of a Bangladeshi immigrant in London, is wonderfully written. Unfortunately, the other big thread of the narrative is told through the letters of her sister back in Bangladesh, who is supposedly uneducated; and to convey this, the author unwisely chose to have these &quot;letters&quot; written in a horrible, unreadable broken English (it felt almost along the lines of &quot;me tarzan, you jane&quot; at times). These sections were so unreadable, in fact, that I was unable to finish this book. A pity... the London bits are truly beautiful prose, but averaged out to a 3 due to the awful broken English letters."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I read this for a literature course. Had I not been required to read it, I would have stopped long before page three-hundred whatever.Personally, I found it too long for the low quality detail and plot Monica Ali gives us."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This book is ok but it didn't wrap me up like some books do. I really had to slog through it. It is about a Bangladesh womans adjustment of moving from childhood in Bangladesh to being a married wife in England. Very good book about an imigrant trying to adapt to a new lifestyle."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I'm not yet through reading this book - I'm keeping the last chapters for tomorrow after I devoured two thirds of the book in a few hours. I walk around the house with the feelings described by the author pasted to my skin.Monica Ali's writing is simple as are simple the characters of the book - gathering Dostoyevsky's challenge for writers to bring simple people to the fore of their literary art: the world is not made of exceptions but of rules, not of geniuses but of common men and women.The main character's view of the world is restricted by culture, religion and lack of education to little more than a keyhole. She spies life and does not live it. She feels it, but cannot analyze it. It passes by as she waits, she suffers, she questions and censors her own questions.Yes, there are contradictions, there are passages that have a limp logic, but only inasmuch as the character is limp in her thinking, for her ignorance, for her fear. Compare the forceful letters of the sister, who faces life head up - a totally different style, respectful of the character's psychology.All the other characters are equally well portrayed and since two days ago have given bright colors to the images of my dreams, almost too much...Finally, what is a good book? One that makes you want to rush to the end, but also to sip it slowly, to enjoy unwrapping it. One that uses a rich vocabulary with no pretense if not the pleasure of writing - or reading. One that helps you untangle the complexity of the world, allowing you to know it and to love it just a little bit more.A great first novel."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Very poorly written....badly needed an editor.

I tried to force myself to keep reading, and finally last night I decided it is time to start reading a new book. I have read 150 pages. The book never got better. Just because someone writes about a different subject doesn't mean the book is good. The writing is really BAD. I kept trying to reread sentences. The grammer was really bad. A friend told me that once she started reading the book faster, it was easier for her to read.I picked up \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" last night. I have read the first 30 pages so far and am really excited about the book. I can't believe I wasted the last week trying to continue reading \\"Brick Lane\\". I really can't see why people like this book. If I write about a different subject with no writing experience, will I win awards also?She writes similar to Chitra Divakaruni's writing which is very chopping and is probably a good first draft. They should hire someone to clean up their writing."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I don't know much about Bangladesh culture or what it's literature should portray. I do know that this author received a wealth of hype when the book is filled with &quot;cliche after cliche&quot;. Sorry Monica. I do believe there is some talent there. But if you don't know the culture you are writing about, do extensive research, research, research. Perhaps your characters might have been more authentic if you, yourself, really knew/know the culture. Do you? I don't feel you do--at all---nor do I feel that whatever research you did helped you know enough. I don't know about Bangladesh culture, but I do know cliched, super fast, quickly rushed writing and poor research. I hope your next book lends to your readers a lot more of what you do know. Brick Lane is not terrible, but it's too darn formula-ic, wrought with passages that really don't say anything about the characters other than that they are A,B,C,D'ish."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I have never read such a trashy novel! Unless you know the true society of which the story is supposedly to be in, you will realized this book is based on the imagination of the author- not in reality."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"What a bore. This book does not live up to the hype. Its incredibly slow to start and it doesn't get any better. It just drags along. I didn't actually finish the book. That's how terrible it is. All that I can say is that this book is terrible, and if you must read it please don't buy it. Go to your local library."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I came upon this book at Costco yesterday, but I haven't read it yet. The cover looks interesting and it sounds interesting so I am looking forward to reading it. It sounds similar to Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane was very much hyped indeed and it did sort of live up to it's hype. The book's start is intriguing and I was drawn by that. I'm usually drawn to stuff like that because I like to read about intimately local cultures. The book's plot revolves around Nazneen, an Bangladeshi girl and woman, quiet in her soul and her spirit, her move to England, her marriage, work, family and her transformation through life.I found bits of the book slow and tiresome and think a lot of pages could have been done without.Interestingly, the strength of the book rests in its supporting characters. They fleshen out the book and make you hunger for more of them. The dream chasing, harmless Chanu (Nazneen's husband), the avaricious and 'sickly' Mrs Islam, the extremely uptight Dr. Azad, the idealist Karim, the effervescing friend; Razia, strong willed Shahana, meek Bibi(Nazneen's daughters) and Nazneen's sister; Hasina for whom life has been a constant battle but who is determined to overcome. Her letters from Dhaka,Bangladesh to Nazneen in England added substance to the book and I loved reading them.The descriptions of Nazneen and Chanu's cooking were very colorful and vivid. The writer's use and ease of language throughout the book is both simple and stylish.Another flaw the book had was that it could have done with the fleshing out of some of the supporting characters like Shahana,Bibi and Dr Azad's home life, and it seemed the death of Nazneen's first child was glossed over. Also, the ending felt somewhat unsatisfactory.In all, it is an indeed a praise-worthy effort by Monica Ali"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews. I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak. Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This book is well-received and I really wanted to like it. I really wanted to. But compared to other India/Middle Eastern immigrant novels, it just left me cold. Head and Dust, Namesake, and even The Kite Runner were more compelling for me. Still, many readers may get something out of this book. It's not without any merit.Brick Lane centers around a young Bangladeshi woman who marries an older man living in London (also Bangladeshi) as part of an arranged marriage. She is brought from her small village to the big city of London where she slowly evolves from a young, sheltered, and shy child to a woman who knows her mind and can assert herself.Part of you wants to yell, \\"You go girl!\\" It can't be easy for a Middle Eastern woman for whom repression has become normalcy to break free. And for that, I enjoyed the book. It also taught be about the Muslim religion and point of view, particularly surrounding the 911 attacks. For that, it also has value. Somehow, in the middle of it all, though, I just stopped caring about any of the characters. The characterization was better than average -- the plot somewhat predictable but interesting nevertheless. And yet.One of the problems I had with the book was that somewhere in the middle, the main character's journey becomes muddled, the plot goes off on some tangents, and the power of the book's message becomes diluted. Surely, it shows a sampling of a life repression for females in her situation and the Muslim's community's conundrums in London. However, the book is not streamlined with quite the adeptness it needs to carry off the complexities and layers that it had the potential to reveal. I had many of the same issues with The Kite Runner. The Kite Runner had a more compelling plot, though. Would I recommend the book? With reservations. To whom: To those interested in the immigrant's journey. To those interested in learning about the complex Middle Eastern / Muslim perspective. To those who enjoy an interesting story unriddled with philosophical waxing. Did it change my life? Surprisingly, yes... though not because I love the book. I found the perspective on those of Muslim faith/background extremely informative and crucial to my gaining an understanding on world politics. It's a not a bad book. It's just not what I consider a great one. If I had been motivated (and should have been) to learn about the political aspects of the book, I could have done so by reading articles and non-fiction books."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is a superb novel - and that it is a first novel augurs much. Over and over Ali's images and use of language caught my breath and stopped me on the page. Every now and then I had to stop and immerse myself in an unbelievable passage. We experience Nazneen's first baby as the most wonderful baby there could ever be. \\"His face this last month had turned from awed to quizzical. His features were not fully drawn, but they were more than sketched. When he looked at her now, he was always on the point of asking a question. Behind the question was a very big joke, and he looked as though he would let her in on it.\\" Nazneen has been married off to a man much older than her and sent from her Bangladeshi village to London to live with him. We follow her navigations in this new culture, rather narrowly circumscribed by her apartment walls and a few blocks surrounding them, and by language. Ali is a strong and confident writer and has a delicate and loving understanding of people. I strongly recommend that you treat yourself to this novel."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Readers of this book will not be disappointed with their time invested in this wonderful and poignant story of an arranged Bengali marriage and her life in the projects of London. The story is not writ large but a personal story told through the passage of years as Nazneen,the Bengali bride, learns the ways of her new husband, who is under employed and seemingly adrift in a society he does not enjoy. His fantasy life about his station in life causes friction between him and his wife. The story is charming and poignant. The author has done a brilliant job bringing this family to life."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Say SLOW and say it SLOWLY. It gets two stars because it's about 200 pages overwritten, and the author deserves a star for all of that extra work.This was one of the most excruciatingly slow books I've ever trudged through. Can you imagine a book in which a devoutly religious woman has an affair and you can read about the whole thing without batting an eye? All of the emotion is told- you don't feel anything. When the affair had ended, it had all of the spark of cold water. They practically ended by saying- \\"it was nice to have met you have a nice life.\\"Would you take pains to read a book in which one of the main characters daughters is so insequential that when her name is mentioned you want to say...who is that again? Everything she says can be cut out of this book and you would never know the difference.Let's not even start on the half English letters from the ghost sister Hasina!There is a story somewhere in here. The book is 369 pages, and in all honesty it probably could have been effectively written as a novella of 100 pages. The rest is fluff, smoke, mirrors long laborious passages. Why wasn't all of this mentioned in the praise and accalades?If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I read this for a book club and really enjoyed it. it's kind of chick-lit-y and exciting and it moves quickly, yet it's moody and deep and intellectual at the same time. monica ali is a very gifted storyteller. she has an impeccable feel for mood. I gained a fresh understanding for the immigrant experience. my only complaint is that the novel seems to bog down a bit at the end with several long anecdotes about the protagonist's native country of Bangladesh, as though Ali were trying to cram these into the book somewhere."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali pulls off something amazing with this novel. It was amazing how she intertwined the theme of fate with seemingly unlikely events that occur in Nazneen's life. Truly engaging--give it a shot."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I think what distinguishes Ali's novel from similar ones is the realism. The main characters seem real - they are neither excessively perfect (yet Nazneen remains remarkably captivating) nor excessively evil. This applies, very interestingly, to Chanu and Kasim, the sympathy for the first which grew while the latter declined as novel reaches closure. It applies to the choices made by Nazneen, her sister and her mother. And it applies to the background of the Muslim community in which the story takes place. Until the very end, we are surprised by the decisions and fate of the main characters, some of which are \\"un-heroic\\" or \\"un-romantic\\" but all of which are very \\"human\\". I think that it is this realism and sensitive handling of ambiguity that made the novel worthy of Booker Prize consideration."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"There is some kind of resentiment towards any kind of modern discourse, especially one considering gender roles, and multiculturalism, but somehow I stumbled upon this book (don't remember was it actually recommended to me or I just picked it of the shelf but it really isn't so much important).Monica Ali is considered to be one of the most promising authors of \\"female\\" and \\"cultural\\" discourse writing in english language today. That kind of tagline, which imposes itself every time you hear or talk about Monica Ali, a priori clouds ones judgement, and somehow, you just cannot read book without that kind of narrow view.But, if you manage to find your way trough very popular modern custom of putting everything in the same bag, you'll find very challenging book, which challenges mostly by its deep sence for its characters, which live their own life full of misery and pain. Though somewhat black and white (especially her male characters) and much influenced by some kind of forced struggle towards human rights and intercultural empathy, Brick Lane is very fluentous book in a way of not having an aggressive discourse, thus not forcing its reader to challenge every sentence written there.Maybe somewhat naive in a last few chapters, where \\"western spirit\\" finally finds its way trough mists of tradition, this book gives its reader fair ammount of intelectual and moral puzzle which became very dominant in last few years.While its romanesque form may suffer for that, it is unfair to judge Monica Ali as an \\"unworthy writer\\" that slides with the tides of her time.This is the book, which will keep ocupied every reader out there, a bit longer than just one reading."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I usually enjoying reading novels pertaining to other cultures, especially Asian cultures. However, I found this book rather dry. I constantly found myself re-reading because of the complex, upon complex sentences. At one point, I almost didn't want to finish the book because it wasn't one of those books that you want to run home and read."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I have a problem with abandoning a book before finishing it because I can't give up the hope that there may be something worthwhile at the end. If I were the type to cast an unfinished book aside, I would have done so with Brick Lane. There came a point in the novel when the main character, Nazneen, began attending political meetings, which is perfectly interesting in itself, but the story gets bogged down in the political details and becomes boring. I found myself disliking Nazneen's choices at the end of the book. I also didn't like Nazneen's children. While characters in novels are almost always flawed, these flaws are supposed to endear us to the character. These characters just didn't seem to have enough redeeming qualities to be likeable. The one character I found that I liked was Nazneen's husband, Chanu, who irritated Nazneen, but I couldn't help seeing how good of a person he really was."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This read was a huge disappointment. There were so many opportunities to draw the reader in, yet the author failed to make the catch. Developing a feel for these characters was difficult at best. As emotional events unfolded in the life of Nazneem, the author failed to take the extra step of connecting with the reader. At one point a significant loss occurs, yet the emotional aspects of such a tremendous loss are completely neglected."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I had the biggest problem with the way the novel jumped around. I agree with the reviewer who wondered about white people in England- as much as I love reading about other cultures and the nitty-gritty of the way immigrants live, I began to feel kind of claustrophobic after about 50 pages. The characters aren't always convincing. Ali's style is likely so highly regarded because it is solid. It lacks the flair of Zadie Smith and Jhumpa Lahiri, though. The novel is kind of subdued from beginning to end, which isn't exactly suited to what Ali tries to do with the plot. Overall, this book is better than 80 percent of what's being published today, but I think that's the only reason people are so quick to praise it."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is a book with a lot of interesting details, but unfortunately is little more than colourful bric-a-brac lacking sufficient contextual integration to make the narrative an engaging read.Ali's prose style is effective and tidy, and she addresses an important issue about what the point of education is beyond collecting certificates and degrees with respect to Chanu, who becomes embittered because his intellect has such little value. This is a major concern with all ethnic minorities that regard education - in broad terms- as a ticket to better living.This book is okay, but does not merit the publishers overly indulgent hype."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This noble is complete garbage. There are so many immigrants Indian novel emphasize Indian immigrant's economic contribution and upheld Indian culture as a whole. On the other hand Bangladeshi immigrant novels, drama, short films must depict Bangladesh in bad way and do an insult to our culture. I often wonder why. I mean immigrant writers from both origins are looking for their 10 minute of fame. That is totally fine. But why you have to pull out some bad smell from closet to do that? You think Indians don't have an ugly story to tell about themselves? But are they saying it to the world? Why would they? I understand that you can just ride along with the tide and make few bucks on the side. You say something bad about Bangladesh, you would get an award. You say badly about India, no one would buy your book. So the incentive is there.Apart from my political view, this novel is not a representation of Bangladeshi culture: not of Bangladesh, and definitely not of Bangladeshi immigrant in UK. I understand that a writer is free to pick her character from extreme example or even beyond imagination. That's fine. But when you write a novel about a specific community (or you know that it will be portray as so), you must write something in the side to upheld the real picture and to do a fare judgment to that community. It is very fare to say that she knowingly ignore that part.Here is a reader's comment \\"Monica Ali appears to be telling a story about what she knows best in her novel, Brick Lane. Monica Ali was born in Bangladesh and grew up in London. Most of us do not have background knowledge of Bangladesh, and this book gives us insight into that land and culture.\\"Imagine that!!"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I can understand all the hype about the book, but it just didnt have anything to lead up too. After about page 100, it's just repeats of characters actions and stuff, it gets kinda lame. And the muslim group part makes the book sooooo slow, you gotta skim it. But then you can't help but feel pity, the way the author throws emotions about how Nazneen feels is almost real. if the book was only had the first 100 pages it would've been cool, but at then end you're just like, dude, this book blows."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Bought it after reading the hype and proceeded to be extremely disappointed. Just goes to show you that slick marketing by publishers can suck you in."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"My cute wife screens many books for me after she reads them. She told me not to read this one. I read the back of the book and it sounded great to me. Against her advice, I started reading the book. I absolutely loved the first 115 pages. (I could not understand why my wife told me not to read it. I complained to her and wanted to revisit all the other books that she told me not to read. I thought she knew my tastes very well ... Or did she? Maybe, I thought, I should have a serious talk with her.)Book begins with a story of a woman from Bangladesh who is married off to a man 20 years older than her in London. Ali does an outstanding job developing Nazneen (the protagonist) and Chanu's (Nazneen's husband) character. Then the book takes a drastic turn on page 116. Ali proceeds to summarize about 13 years through Hasina's (Nazneen's sister who still lives in Bangladesh) poorly written letters. The letters make up one chapter which is only about 20 pages long. There are more letters spread throughout the book later. I found reading those letters extremely awkward and painful. Later on in the book I resorted to skipping the letters altogether. After that painful chapter, the book never picks up. It is as if a new person starts writing the book. Nazneen starts having an affair and we hear a little about her 2 daughters. Ali did a poor job making the reader understand what the daughters were all about. I found the affair quite unrealistic. Worst of all, the book became boring.I just finished the book but I should have listened to my wife and never started the book."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I was eager to begin this book as I love to read books set in and about people from that part of the world. But this one was a huge disappoitment.Others reviewers have echoed my own feelings about this book so I won't go into the details here; and others have said how much they loved it so this seems to be one of those books readers either love or hate. Certainly, it seems to have struck a nerve with many readers, who seem to have been deeply moved by it. I was simply - bored.Feelings aside: I do believe it is seriously, objectively flawed on account of the letters written by Nazneem's sister.While they provide a bit of variety they were an agony to read. And the question remains as to why they were in broken English; where did Hasina learn English, and why should she write in English to Nazneem, who did not speak a word of it? But if they were written in Bangladeshi, why \\"pijin\\" Bangla, when that was their native tongue?The mistakes Hasina would have made - assuming Ali wanted to recreate the lack of formal education - would have been in spelling and grammar. Thus the correct correlation would be misspelt, ungrammatical written English - not the foreigner's English that we were given.Whether one loves or hates the novel, this aspect of it - which after all forms a major part of the novel - is a huge defect and I wonder why the editor let it pass. Especially as it makes such unnecessarily difficult reading.That said, I will certainly read Ali's next novel and give her a second chance."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This is not a prescriptive book. I tend to look for the underlying morality of books I read, and you'd be hard-pressed to find it here. It simply describes life Nazneen as she emerges from the cocoon of defined femininity in Bangladesh. There are letters and dreams interspersed throughout, but the entire novel feels dream-like, as Nazneen is trapped in a life that is only as substantial as a dream. She begins to awake through pain and suffering, rather than simply enduring fate as masha'allah, the will of God.I didn't find myself identifying strongly with any particular character, despite how real they are drawn. Rather I felt pulled into an alternate reality, one that I do not and could never share, but had become real under the pen of Monica Ali. She vividly paints how men and women have been trapped in respective spheres of influence, and how difficult it is for any to break out of what has become Truth. This is theSugar Streetof Britain, showing the culture through the political events of the 80's, 90's, and Noughties- and more than culture, individuals struggling for identity within myriad cultures.The reader should be aware that at times the book slowed down, or was difficult to read. This was particularly true of the small-print italicized mailed letters, and in respect to British terminology, which I wasn't always familiar with."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Nanzeen's development from a sickly infant who barely survives her first few days to a self-actualizing adult is the focus of this novel. Married off at a young age to a much older man and carted off to live in London, Nanzeen is initiated into the joys and sorrows of motherhood while still a child herself. Her husband struggles to control his household and make a living in a society that seems to place no value on his education. As feckless as he is, he is a surprisingly sympathetic character, more bewildered than offended by his wife's growing independence. Also well-drawn characters, their two daughters are vividly flesh and blood as they try to make their way in a western culture with immigrant parents they love, but can't really fathom.Nanzeen's development doesn't come in flashes of objective insight, but through trial and error, through having to deal with everyday situations. Ultimately, she assumes responsibility for her family's life, reconciling her family's teachings for women to be passive and accepting of their fates with the necessity of taking action for her family's sake. She grapples with the contradictory lesson her mother taught: if you take action, you are messing with your fate. She decides, almost by default, that she has nothing to lose by steering her own ship.The novel sheds light on ethnic tensions in London and immigrant experience. The reaction of the Islamics, trying to lead normal lives in a foreign country, to the shock of 911 is particularly poignant.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"In her first novel Monica Ali does in brilliant job in placing her characters in their larger context. Typically novels of this genre are very demanding on readers who do not have much insight of the other culture. Monica Ali manages to interpret the complexities of Bangladeshi culture, especially Bangladeshi immigrant culture and make them fairly approachable to western readers.The author takes up the issue of women's position in Bangladesh and in the immigrant community in Britain without giving it obsessive importance. She shows very adeptly how the young Bangladeshi immigrants born in the UK are struggling with their identity and struggling between the lure of white affluent drug pushers and religious extremism. The visions of \`home' creeps up constantly like a ubiquitous spook.The choice of the name of the novel and the characters is brilliant. She seems to suggest that all her characters, the kindly yet bloated and ineffectual Chanu, the perceptive yet uneducated Nazneen, Dr Azad with an English wife, the ruthless usurer Mrs Islam, the natural born leader and man of action Karim and Nazneen's sister Hasina back 'home' in Bangladesh are walking in their narrow lanes and facing brick walls on all sides. Hasina takes control of her fate, as does Nazneen in the end. Monica Ali exposes a lot of malaise in both societies yet Nazneen and Hasina, central to the two poles of the narrative never lose a sense of hope and wonderment. This is very poignant against the increasingly disillusioned resignation of Chanu.Highly recommended as this book is at once perceptive yet innocent and compassionate."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This was a very interesting glimpse into a culture I have very limited familiarity with. I certainly feel more enlightened after finishing it. Intense at times, it was a slow thought-provoking read. The characters are very likeable, but also difficult for an American woman such as myself to truly relate to, especially the female characters timidity and submissiveness. I thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic and not very satisfying."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali's debut novel is a good, but not great read. Normally I devour novels such as these that have roots in Eastern culture, but this story although it opened well seemed to drag along in the middle section of the book. To me it seemed as if the story was drawn out in order to fill pages. The essence of the story, for me at least, was lost in the middle part of the novel. Fortunately the thread of the novel was found again in a triumphant conclusion."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"While this novel tells the tale of a young woman from Bangaladesh brought to London through an arranged marriage, at some level it could be a story of any woman. Monica Ali's poignant selection of events in the life of the featured character as compared to the story of her sister who continues to live in Bangladesh, could be seen as a commentary on the potentially suffocating life of an Islamic woman in an arranged marriage. But instead, both the featured character's and her sister's transformation through the years of learning to live with a marriage partner and raising young children, into confident, self-aware, mature women has a universal quality. A side benefit in this novel is the introspective description of life in Brick Lane, a street in London known to London residents and tourists for its Indian restaurants."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This was an excellent read. Very informative and realistic. Shows the immigration to England of a young women from a small town in Bangladesh for an arranged marraige. How she developed over the years and how she was able to change for the new environment. The difficulties she had in adopting to the new environment and culture, were not shared with her daughters. They were been educated in London and therefore had a different perspective about Banglsdesh. Her husband was not able to change to the new environment and thus lived with an ideal vision of what Bangledesh really was. When he returned home alone to Bangledesh the realism was somewhat different."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"An unspoilt girl from the village, new bride Nazneen is brought to England to live in London's tower blocks. She stares out now at a very different village, through windows soiled by grime. Her husband finds her \\"satisfactory\\" and no one asks what she thinks. Meanwhile Nazneen's sister has married for love back in India, and no one seems to care what she thinks or experiences either.Clipping nostril hair and corns for her spouse, cooking meals, learning to live with neighbors who each in their own very different way accommodate to a new world, Nazneen dreams of helping her sister and of staying true to herself. Meanwhile her husband dreams of riches and returning home in state, while he lives in unfulfilled failure.Under the skin, whether it be burned away by acid and fire or rendered transparent through the eyes of an author who sees what lies beneath, we're all of us the same. Debates on Brick Lane as America's towers fall aren't so different from elsewhere in London, even if the debaters are mostly Muslim. Brick Lane's defeats as drug money flows, Brick Lane's lonely women at their sewing machines, and Brick Lane's disaffected youth all come to life... The tattoo woman hides her skin under pictures till the weight is too great, and Nazneen hides her soul under images of Fate. When Nazneen finally wakes to a lover's touch, will she be anything more than an unspoilt village girl after all these years?Filled with bitingly honest humor and searing pathos, Monica Ali's Brick Lane describes not only the immigrant experience, but also the belated coming of age of individuals and society, the lies we hide behind like colored tattoos, and the many layers that make up truth. A long, powerful, enthralling novel with a pleasing strength in its ending, this is a tale of culture with as message of self-determination and a musical score that will keep you longing for more.Disclosure: I borrowed a copy from a friend during my visit to England."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"We chose this book for our Book Club, and the overwhelming response was negative. The common thread was that the letters in the book actually distracted from the story, were difficult to read (poor language flow), and in general did not enlarge the understanding of the characters. In addition, the characters in the book did not engage and in some cases, actually enraged, the readers."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane focuses on the story of Nazneen who moves to a Bangladesh community in London when she is still very young. Her marriage to a man named Chanu was arranged and she had very little choice in what she wanted to do with her life. Her destiny as a housewife and mother seems to have been set, but one of the main focuses of this novel is questioning whether the individual can have a hand in forming his or her own destiny. This age old question is artfully contemplated as we follow Nazneen through a great portion of her life while she gives birth three times and cares for her husband. Much of the novel seems to pass in the calm routines of her daily life. However, now and then we are given glimpses of Nazneen's rebellious thoughts which signify that she is anything but a passive character. When she meets an attractive radical named Karim we are aware that everything could easily change.Brewing beneath this internal and domestic struggle is a conflict in the community of Bangladesh immigrants who are caught between assimilation to English life and reinventing a shared space where they can express their religion and culture. Many of these people came to England with the hope of earning a fortune and returning to their own country triumphantly wealthy. This rarely happens. Many have to renegotiate their sense of their own identities to survive in a culture that is alien and sometimes hostile toward them. Political groups form in the community. Things come to a crisis. It becomes evident that the community is not as threatened by groups outside of itself as by it's own internal divisions. The fact that many of these Bagladeshi people live their entire lives in England and still feel like outsiders is illuminated in a scene where Chanu takes his family on a hilarious outing to view London like tourists.Monica Ali gives tremendous dignity to all her characters. While many may feel a natural sympathy with Nazneen as a captive to her own household, the idealistic Chanu is drawn as a very complex and loveable character. He may be stubborn, unappreciative and lost in his own dreams. But he's also shown to be very loving, honest and loyal to his family. Throughout the entire novel Nazneen keeps in touch with her sister who lives a difficult life in Bangladesh. This gives a hint of the life she might have had if she had chosen not to obediently follow tradition and proceed with her arranged marriage. This novel is filled with humor and sorrow making it an extremely compulsive and delightful read. The familial struggles really transcend any national boundaries however formed they are by cultural traditions. Ali gives a truly universal story in a very specific setting."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"I bought this book months ago during a book-buying frenzy and just got to it this month. The beginning of the book is so much better than the middle and the end. I never really got to know Nazneen well enough to care what happened to her. The book dragged way too much: the prolonged speeches by Chanu were unnecessary. Once we (the readers) figured out that Chanu liked to talk on and on and on rather than take action, all his subsequent speeches are unneccessary (so I skipped them). The long letters from her sister Hasina are also very annoying. The broken English (which I guess is supposed to be broken Bengali) really dragged the story down. When faced with 20 pages or more of italic printing (Hasina's letters) my interest waned. Not a good way of showing the passage of time. To better show the contrast of lives between the sisters, the author should have written chapters alternating between the two sisters' lives. That would have made Hasina seem more real to me, not just another annoyingly long letter I had to skim through. Also, because the description of the book tells the reader that Nazneen gets involved with a young man, I was looking forward to this event and was (again) ultimately disappointed. The love affair doesn't seem very intense and I don't see how it changed Nazneen at all. Although I applaud Nazneen's decision regarding the direction of her life, it seemed to come about it a rather ho-hum type of way. I found the book less than thrilling and am amazed at the 2-4 pages of quotes inside the book from critics (and other authors) deliriously declaring that this book is genuis and beautiful and worthy of tears of joy upon finishing it. I think they are crazy. I have read books worthy of shouting and crying, but not this one. If you want a good read by a new author, read The Time-Traveler's Wife. It is wonderful."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"A peek at a Bangaladeshi female immigrant's experience in the big wide world of London is what Ali provides us readers in Brick Lane. Raised as the docile and obedient daughter, Nazneen accepts an arranged marriage to an old man who takes her from Bangladesh to a Bangladeshi community in London. There, for the first time, she comes in contact with (or at least observes) the freedoms of Western women in The Land of Opportunity. Within the tight Bangaladeshi community, author Ali gives us all degrees of the immigrant experience through Nazneen's eyes. This unsparing look into a world of suppression that few of us can imagine is very gracefully rendered."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Monica Ali's &quot;Brick Lane&quot; doesn't in my opinion merit the overflow of critical accolades heaped upon it. It isn't even a particularly outstanding novel about immigrant lives in the land of milk and honey. I've certainly read better.To begin with, the book is over 400 pages long and grossly overwritten. The plot is gruel thin - there's no narrative momentum to speak of, the story goes nowhere - and the prose is for the most part curiously flat. While it's a huge relief to know that not all young novelists feel the need to write in the manic style so favoured by contemporary writers of today, Ali's writing simply lacks spark. She makes the further mistake of making Hasina write to Nazneen in laboured broken English. I developed a headache reading it. It would help if I half understood it.Thematically, it's also too conservative. Ali doesn't stretch out far enough. Sure, you experience the intergenerational conflict of immigrant families, wonder at the irony of Chanu's romantic homebound longings and so on but isn't it incredible that we don't get to meet a single white person in a story about life in England ?Ali succeeds best with her characterisation. Nazneen is a picture of docility, accepting whatever Fate doles out to her...until Karim the young local-born firebrand walks into her life. Chanu is a lovable buffoon - pure bathos - but one that wins our sympathy - he is as much a victim of traditional values as Nazneen. Mrs Islam, a bloodsucker masquerading as friend and Razia, Nazneen's one true friend and source of her deliverance are full bodied and wonderfully sketched characters. But why does Karim seem so underdeveloped and skeletal in contrast ? Maybe Ali didn't bother because he's only the catalyst for Nazneen's transformation, nothing more. In any case, Nazneen's affair with Karim is perhaps the least convincing aspect of the story. It has a false note about it and for that reason, I never bought it.&quot;Brick Lane&quot; isn't a bad novel. It has its moments but these don't justify the huge praise lavished on it. It is in my opinion possibly the least worthy candidate for last year's Man Booker Prize. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"At the outset, I was drawn in by the mythological quality of the story of Nazneen's birth. The question that it put forward - should a person be left to their fate? - was a meaningful and intriguing one. I was interested in the kind of impact her mother's unusual philosophy would have on Nazneen. However, I was never satisfied by the book's attempts to reveal the inner workings of its characters. The book disappointed me with its predictability and shallowness. The setting the characters were placed in, and the texture of the characters themselves had a lot of potential, but it was never realized. The book gave me some insight into what felt like the stereotypes of Bangladeshi, immigrant culture (gossiping housewives, confused children, and emasculated, insecure men), without providing an honest, gritty perspective on it. Nazneen never leaped off the page; she remained weak, simple, and unsympathetic. Ali's depiction of Nazneen and her sister, Hasina, came off as contrived and one-dimensional. I could feel Ali trying to depict Hasina and Nazneen's desperate situations instead of feeling the characters' plight. This is demonstrated in the way that Hasina's letters were written in bad grammar; Ali was surely trying to make Hasina more pitiable and accurately portray her circumstances, but it ended up sounding formulated and clich&eacute;. Ali could've depicted both Chanu and Nazneen as complex, multifaceted people, but she didn't. I wanted to see Nazneen's weakness as well as her strength, her predictability and her inconsistency. Ali's vivid and simple style of writing and portraying made the characters appear unreal and made me unable to relate to them. Ali painted a clear picture of Nazneen as a meek, dissatisfied housewife, and Chanu as a slovenly, insecure failure. Even though I understood the characters, I only understood them because they were stereotypes, not because they became real to me. The ending of the book, which ties in Nazneen's fascination with ice-skating that's mentioned in the beginning, confirmed my classification of the book as trite and banal. Everything had fallen into place perfectly by the end, with no interesting ambiguities remaining. The image I was left with, Nazneen sailing across the ice without a care in the world, was reminiscent of a bad Julia Roberts movie, and evoked no feeling in me. Overall, the book only touched the surface of it's subject and failed to engage me emotionally or intellectually."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"This was the first book that I read by Ms. Ali and she instantly became one of my favorite authors. I love to read and learn about different cultures and countries. Ms. Ali did not let me down. From her descriptive prose, I have been able to create an image of Bangladesh (and later London) - one that feels very real, including the sights, smells, dusty roads, etc.... As the characters developed, we were given glimpses into Bangladeshi and Muslim beliefs along with the Bengali people. It presented a nice introduction for the sheltered American. The story was simple: girl enters into arranged marriage, leaves her family behind, becomes the submissive partner, realizes her own self worth and finally stands on her own. Unlike some readers, I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read. I recommend to those interested in immigrant life and those wishing to expose themselves to different cultures.I also recommend:Alentejo Blue: Fiction, The Namesake: A Novel,The Almond Picker: A Novel"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Brick Lane's protagonist, Nazneen, is a survivor. She came into the world prematurely in 1967, and was thought to be stillborn. She did not breath. Suddenly, the infant surprised her mother and aunt by beginning to howl with life. Rupan, Nazneen's mother, refused to assist the baby in growing stronger. She was adamant, \\"let fate take its course.\\" \\"My child must not waste any energy fighting against fate. That way she will be stronger.\\" In her East Pakistan village of Gouripur, (back then Bangladesh was East Pakistan), Nazneen frequently heard the story of \\"How You Were Left To Your Fate.\\" The girl bought into her mother's beliefs that she must accept the Grace of God, for \\"what cannot be changed must be borne.\\" Women play a secondary role in society and must be dutiful and obedient to survive a life filled with unpredictable happenstance. Hasina, Nazneen's beloved sister, is beautiful, strong-willed and does not believe any of her mother's philosophies about a woman's place. Unlike Nazeen, who is stoic and fatalistic, Hasina rebels against adversity and tradition.At age eighteen, Nazneen is thrust into an arranged marriage with a man old enough to be her father. She passively accepts her family's wishes. Her husband, Chanu Ahmed, is fat and balding, but an educated man who lives in London...\\"the place where rich and successful emigrants make their place,\\" explains her father.She is transported to a tiny, cluttered flat in London's Tower Hamlets, a Bengali Muslim enclave. Husband Chanu may be literate, but he is also a pompous lout, seemingly oblivious to the realities of everyday life and devoid of social graces. He appears to have no common sense, but does possess an enormously inflated ego. He thinks of himself as a frustrated intellectual. Nazreen endures, remembering her mother's words, \\"If G-d wanted us to ask questions, he would have made us men.\\" Her life, at first, is confined, no shopping and no going outside alone. She speaks little English, and what she does see of British culture bewilders her. Her female neighbors are supportive but they also spy on one another.With time, and the birth of two daughters, Nazneen learns to be more accepting of her husband. The older daughter, Shahana, is a rebellious adolescent, who acts-out and wishes their lives were more Westernized. The pre-teen vents her anger against Bengali Muslim traditions and longs to assimilate into British culture. Nazneen also bore and lost a son when he was a mere baby, and this is a constant source of sadness for her.Her relationship with her husband is complex, as he is a much more complicated man than originally described. The author develops both characters brilliantly, and demonstrates their growth and their burgeoning mutual affection. Yes, Chanu is a bumbler, who loses job after job, and comes up with ridiculous schemes to make money, borrowing from a notorious load shark. However, he displays genuine affection for his wife and possesses a gentle humor. One feels pity for his failures, crushed hopes and the gradual awareness of his own shortcomings.For many years, Nazneen's only real pleasure is corresponding with her sister, who has not followed the path of duty and obedience. Hasina struck out on her own, married for love, and now lives in Dhaka where she struggles to eke out a living as a factory worker. Her life is full of disappointments, and her love-match is the biggest disappointment of all. Nazneen struggles to send her sister money and dreams of the day when she can bring her to London.One of her neighbors, and dear friend, Razia Iqbal, is a forward-thinking, independent woman who sews at home for a living. She encourages Nazneen to buy a sewing machine and get work. A financial crisis motivates Chanu to allow his wife to buy the machine and get a job doing piecework, finishing blue jeans. Thus, a new door to life opens for the lonely woman, and also introduces her to Karim, a man who picks-up and delivers the sewing. He is young, handsome and confident, an active leader in community politics. Disaffected Bengali youth from the neighborhood, who try to assimilate but remain adrift in a world where Anglo drug sellers infiltrate the housing development, look up to Karim. He longs to bring these young people back to more traditional values. As his relationship with Nazneen intensifies, she begins to question her philosophy of life and challenge the status quo.I so enjoyed reading \\"Brick Lane.\\" Monica Ali's writing is wonderful. She constructs and developes her characters carefully and believably, especially Nazreen, Chanu and Karim, as well as the novel's interesting minor figures. They change and grow continuously, gaining in depth, throughout this multi-layered novel. The relationship between Nazneen and Karim is also one of many complexities, which the author explores most thoroughly. She also examines the political environment during the time period when the story takes place. One can actually feel the tensions within the community as the residents witness and react to the Oldham Riots and 9/11. I was especially fascinated by the community political meetings, where members discuss global jihad and local injustices. Monica Ali possesses a light, comic touch which prevents the storylines from becoming too heavy. This is most apparent with Nazneen's inner dialogue. I recommend this novel highly.Jana PerskieThe God of Small Things: A NovelOf Marriageable AgeThe Writing on My Forehead: A NovelKartographyBombay Time: A NovelHolder of the World"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"Add my voice to the chorus of praise for Monica Ali's Brick Lane. I especially enjoyed the way she stayed focused on Nazneen's life, but also deftly expanded the story -- through time, with memories of her family; and through space, with letters from her sister in Bangladesh.The parting of Nazneen and her hapless husband was done very well: her genuine affection for Chanu and his acknowledgement of his own failure were shown with great delicacy, in very moving language."},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"For me, the real story in Brick Lane is the incredible insularity of Nanzeen's domestic existence. Setting the story in a poor and dilapidated housing development, Ali envelopes us with the sites, sounds and smells of urban London, along with Nanzeen and Chanu's familial home. Brick Lane is an absolutely realistic immigrant story and the reader really gets a feel for what it must be like for new immigrants, many of who are from poor countries such as Bangladesh, who are trying to make homes for themselves in a new country.Caught in an arranged, passionless marriage to the bombastic, idealistic Chanu, Nanzeen longs for something more. She stares out at the full moon late at night and wishes most of all for a secure place in the world, and a security she has tried to seek but just cannot find. She suffers terribly from homesickness and holds onto the memories of her childhood in Gouripur with her sister - she remembers the vibrant colour, the torrential rains, the golden land, deep green paddies, the snowy cranes, the drying rice stalks, and the village women who clean the large, bloody fish. Frustrated, frightened, and longing for independence, Nanzeen falls into a passionate relationship with Karim, a young local activist. The affair, while awakening her sexually, forces her to make life-changing decisions that reverberate throughout her family.The first half of the novel is perhaps the most engaging as life in London is veiled though Nanzeen's eyes. Walking the streets of London with her sari and headscarf on, she's conscious of everyone watching her, and is startled by the differences in Western women - their short-cropped hair, and their propensity to wear trousers. Nanzeem is overwhelmed by London - the cars jamming the roads, the fatty smells, the people weaving in and out of the sidewalks and the tube stations There are some wonderful scenes describing the richness and vitality of immigrant life - the Wentworth Street Market, with its stalls lining the road, cloths draped on wire hangers in the windows, Jamaican patties on sale, and tinned foods at 40 percent off.The story abounds with mouth watering descriptions of ethnic foods - the dal, chicken wings spread in a paste of yogurt and spices, chickpeas and tomatoes stewed with cumin, and hard boiled eggs glazed in a curry seal. So much detail is given to Nanzeen's apartment life - the papers and files, the glass showcase, the pottery tigers, lions and elephants, and a copy of the Qur'an in its special ledge. There are lots of issues raised in this book - racial unrest, the cultural clash, and the disenfranchisement of immigrant communities. Ali packs the narrative with so many concerns, that the story can be a little overwhelming, and interestingly much of the local ethnic tensions are framed against the events of 9/11. Brick Lane is an engaging and involving story, full of passion, drama and humour; it is well worth the journey.Michael"},{"Title":"Brick Lane","review":"In light of the July 7 London bombings I read this book because I wanted to have another perspective into the lives of Muslims in Great Britain. Monica Ali makes a provocative and rewarding leap in her first novel about Nazneen a young Bangladeshi woman who comes to England to marry Chanu, an older man of questionable intelligence. Throughout the book Nazneen comes to terms with her racial, gender and religious identities as a Muslim woman in comtemporary London. One can see the gap between the younger, second generation Bangladeshis, who want to shake up the racist, elitist system and while the older immigrant generation don't want to rock the boat. Feminism also plays a major role in the novel and all the female characters try to reconcile Islam and Eastern traditions with Western realities. The time span of the book revolves around before and after the 9/11 tragedies and Ali does a tasteful job of how each character reacts. This is a great book about a group of people who are still misunderstood in the post September 11/July 7 era."},{"Title":"The Night Before the Night Before Christmas","review":"My kids really enjoy this book.

I bought this book, planning on brushing up some more with my &quot;North American Spanish&quot; (the type an American learns in School, which is essentially a mix of numerous dialects, and depends on who your teacher learned from). The problem is this book teaches hardcore Castillian Spanish, which sounds slightly different and doesn't have the traditional flow that an American is used to. Regardless, this book simplifies grammer greatly, and is able to explain some of the easiest concepts of survival Spanish with relative ease. This book is clearly for begginers though, because it only teaches Usted, which is the formal word for you, for most of the chapters only introducing the informal &quot;tu&quot; later. This seems rather absurd because they make it seem extremely informal, although this is just to cut down on the verb endings, but one needs to learn them all at once instead.Besides all these mistakes though.

Examples work well and relevant."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"The good thing about this book is it teaches you concepts, rather than technicality (which you can browse from Struts' website). It starts with the crucial paradigm that every Struts developer has to fully understand: the Model-View-Controller pattern (aka the Model 2 architecture). Chapter 1 provides you a very good example on MVC, presenting one achieved with servlets/JSP and one with Struts. Once you're comfortable with it, Chapters 2, 3, 4 explain about actions, action forms, and how to configure your Struts application.Subsequent chapters talk about the Validation framework, an important feature that makes Struts the most popular MVC framework. With Validation, you can validate user input both on the server-side as well as the client side, or both. No need to write Javascript functions as they are generated automatically. This is really a cool feature. The discussion of Validation in this book is more detailed than in other books.This book also covers Tiles very well. You use Tiles to help you lay out the components in your Web pages. Tiles is dynamic and make it easy to achieve consistent look for your application. Changing the look involves only editing a single file. Again, I feel I have a good grasp of Tiles after reading this book (I've previously read a similar chapter in Manning's Struts in Action book)After you understand how to program with Struts, the second part of the book talks about design. There are a number of important J2EE design pattern discussed, all of them in plain language.If you've never learned Struts before, this book is definitely for you. If you've been using Struts, you might still be interested in the design topics which is quite advanced to even seasoned Struts developers."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"This is a very clear, concise introduction to the Struts framework.It' s up to date, and present the subject with a learn-by-example strategy. I appreciated the fact that the various aspects of Struts are presented with many little independend manageable examples intead of the typical \\"example application\\" that many book use to \\"put it all together\\". Overall an excellent text to understand the whys and hows of Struts. Be warned you will not find material on the more sophisticated aspects and usages of Struts, but a good foundation upon which you can build with working experience and more advanced books like \\"Struts Recipes\\". Anyhow you can just make up your mind by going to jtutedotcom and checking the entire book online!"},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"Excellent book... After reading three other Struts book, this book has several examples that really broke Struts down to where I could easily understand."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"The basic motivator is the use of Model - View - Controller as the design basis for a servlet and JSP project. Struts is an instantiation of MVC. The book shows how you can take it and develop a fully fledged servlet package. Elegant formulation.To be sure, the code examples are sometimes verbose. But that is just a fact of life. Keep a focus on the underlying principles.The book is not just confined to Struts. Related issues, like using Tiles Framework for factoring out a consistent presentation of web pages, are explained, showing how they interoperate with Struts."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"I've used the book to teach struts to my development team. As a Software Factory Company we need the fastest response from our employees even those don't know struts. Is easy to understand struts if you use this book from beginning to end. The JSTL chapter is a great aid and also the persistence chapter. If you want to learn struts get this book, then to refine your skills, buy the one with de horse in the cover."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"Before reading this book, I was always confused with some of the tags in the Struts HTML library, especially options and optionsCollection. This book explains not only how to use the components, but also how they work in the background, so you know how to program them correctly. As to options and optionsCollection, according to the author, your array or collection can come from many different sources, such as the application object, the Session object, or even the form itself (depending on the situation). Understanding this makes me code more efficiently. This is the only book I recommend if you're starting Struts or want to grasp the technology better."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"Struts itself is not very intuitive, especially for people new to developing web applications.This book is nice because it covers topics outside of the Struts domain in order to better explain what is going on with Struts and how it interacts with other technologies like Servlets, JSPs, tag libraries, etc.The author claims that this is a tutorial book, meant to be reader cover-to-cover, but I disagree. At times, there are many details that you might not ever need that can be skipped, but these could make a good reference someday.Overall, the general concepts are pretty nicely explained, considering the weirdness of Struts, and I can safely recommend it for a beginner or intermediate web app developer."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"I just bought this book, looking at the reviews. I must tell you that this book is worth all the 5 stars. I have always tried to read about struts from different websites, and even after understanding the concepts had a bit of fuziness. But the author has a very well understanding of the framework and has written the book, such that a reader does not get overloaded with irrelevant information and understands the concepts one step at a time."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"first off, I don't know the authors, and am not connected with the book in any way.----------------------------This book is great. I know Java, and JSPs. Servlets are new to me, but there isn't much to those.This book got me up and running pretty quickly, especially considering I'm using eclipse to develop the app, and OC4J to compile stuff.This book obviously didn't have the details for implementing on those platforms, but it had all the info I needed for the other parts.It has good explanations for the way pieces fit together, and even some very helpful warning tips that keep you from common misunderstandings.Thanks to the authors!"},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"Mr. Kurniawan has filled a gap in the literature covering the Stuts framework. Of the 5 Struts books on my shelf, this is the only one that is a tutorial: it covers maybe 70% of the technology, demonstrating very brief, but adequate examples.Of the 21 chapters, the ones dealing validation, application resources and i18n, and pagination were better than most. Also, the author covered 2 Struts topics that usually, at best, only get a mention - file downloading and uploading.I did not give score the book full marks, because I felt, perhaps subjectively, that it should have spent a few pages on Struts modules, ExceptionHandler, and DispatchAction.As an aside, the book's jacket declares that the book covers version 1.2. Perhaps, it would be better to say it works with 1.2; the only 1.2 points that show up are the new validwhen validator and the use of ActionMessage(s), replacing the use of ActionError(s) in the Struts actions.For a Struts beginner, I would start with this book and then download the now free Stuts Survival Guide, by Srikanth Shenoy."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"I read O'reilly's Struts book to learn Struts, and have read some others. So far this is the best.First of all, the author consistently teaches the recommended styles of programming, e.g. use JSTL instead of Bean and Logic tags, not use Java code in JSPs, etc.Second, this is a very well written tutorial, meant to give you the concepts, rather than technicalities. Read the first 5 chapters, and you will understand what Struts is and how to program with it.The author did extensive digging to cover validation, including explaining validwhen and providing examples on it, which you don't find in other books. Another thing, this is the only Struts book that covers file upload and file download adequately.In addition, after you are familiar with Struts programming, the second part of the book teaches you design techniques, such as the DAO pattern, Transfer Object patterns, Decorator pattern applied to servlet filters, etc.Best value and recommended. For programmers and architects alike."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"You can save lot of time on browsing Internet on finding tutorials on struts, yes this book gives you everything that you need to know on programming struts.Best buy for both the beginners and the experts, also serves as a handy reference.This book serves more than a tutorial on struts.Even though you can find lot of free short online tutorials, this book made a great deal on putting together explaining every concept of the framework in a precise and down to earth manner.You don't have to refer other books/sites, because each chapter is fully driven with examples, screen shots of application output framed on a browser, screen shots of webapp directory structure and the code snippets.I particularly liked the chapters that covered the tasks like file upload, dataacesss,l18n and paging-sorting.I also liked the table listing the attributes, type and a short definition of every tag.The example codes were made ready to use with complexity on configuring and understanding the package structure.(A little work is needed anyway).Overall this one of the effective struts tutorial available in the market now."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"It was a bit difficult for me to write a review for this book because it is good in so many ways. First of all, Budi is an author with a talent for explaining things clearly, correctly, and succinctly.Some other technical book authors (whose works I've had the misfortune to read) like to technobabble their way around a subject while cramping as many pointless pretentious words as possible in a sentence to appear smart or erudite. Not so with Budi. His prose is clear and to the point. It is quite clear that he has put a lot of time and effort into this book so that you can get up to speed on Struts as fast as possible.Despite the speed by which he introduces Struts to you, he doesn't leave the foundation hollow. I like the way Budi uses simple examples that don't distract you from understanding the very concept in discussion. To me this is a much preferable way as opposed to how some other authors do it: dream up and build a full-blown J2EE stack just to demonstrate a simple concept used in a tiny piece of the app itself.Another important one is that Budi is not an author who misses things or leaves things as \\"an exercise to the readers\\". All of us know those annoying authors who are generous with examples of straightforward and simple cases and leave the real interesting parts (read: the parts we'll use in the real world) as an exercise to the reader. Budi is thankfully not one of them.In short, you can't go wrong with this book. I've read many Struts books over the years, and this book ranks at the top along with only a few."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"The other reviews say it all, but I wanted to throw mine in because this book helped me learn and effectively develop Struts so well. It's been about two months and I feel like I have a very good understanding of Struts, largely due to this book. Furthermore, several of my co-workers have bought the book they've borrowed mine so much and I still use it as a reference frequently. The only shortcomings I've found are a few small topics that weren't covered in the depth I would have liked, but a few pages would have filled those gaps.Clear, concise, well-written, easy to skim, good for learning, good reference."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"I bought this book based on the very positive reviews on this forum and I was not disappointed. I read the entire book from cover to cover and tested the sample code that can be downloaded from the publisher's website. With the exception of a single chapter (13), I was able to run all applications successfully with Tomcat. Note that there are a few errors in the code (not syntax but logical, so you don't see the desired result on the web page once you hit submit on the initial page) but these can easily be fixed. This book has a load of valuable information on Struts. While you do need patience to read it, it does not get boring at any point. Well deserved kudos to the author for doing an excellent job explaining Struts. Highly recommended to any one wanting to learn from Struts. If you have no experience with J2EE but you have experience with Java, do not start with this book as it might get too hard at times. Instead start with some thing more basic such as Head First Servlet and JSP and then move on to this book. If you already know JSPs and Servlets, then this book will teach you pretty much everything you need to know about Struts."},{"Title":"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial (A Tutorial series)","review":"I am shocked at the number of positive reviews for this book.

In addition some parts of the book just seem to be incomplete - sometimes you just want to grasp something and you can't because there is lack of information - you turn the page in hope you'll find what you think should be there and... there's entirely new subject there,- some examples are not printed in the book so if you want to read them you have to turn on you computer - i don't like it.Pluses:- nice layout - chapters are arranged in a logical and intuitive way, the most simple and general ones at the beginning, the most exceptional at the end. I suppose it will be fast and easy to find something if there is a need to recall it,- a lot of simple examples - even if you are not able to understand the explanations of some subjects you can easily grasp them by reading the examples.In general - this book can help you learn Struts but you have to read it very patiently and carefully.

She wanted to be a pilot, but became a photojournalist--the first woman photographer to get accredation to cover the war in the Pacific in World War II. After that, she was present at nearly every noteworthy conflict or event there was--if something was going on, Dickey wanted to be there, and usually got her way. She worked for Life, Reader's Digest, National Geographic, and many other magazines and papers. She was killed in 1965, while with the Marines in Vietnam.Her personal life was not always smooth sailing, and I find it incredible that she achieved all she did.What I found most interesting about Dickey was her spirit--she didn't let conventions or anybody stand in her way. She was a trailblazer in her field, and I'm glad that Roberta Ostroff wrote this book--Dickey certainly deserves recognition for her courage and and heroism."},{"Title":"Fire in the Wind : The Life of Dickey Chapelle","review":"I was actually a bit annoyed to find this book, since I didn't know anyone had written Chapelle's biography, and I had thought of doing it myself. That said, Ostroff has written it much better than I could have. While what drove Dickey Chapelle to her achievements and disasters remains a bit hard to grasp, Ostroff has done an excellent job of tracing her cliffhanger career. There are nitpicks: Ostroff puts herself in Chapelle's head at times, as if she knows exactly what Dickie was thinking, and there is no mention of Chapelle's spiritual beliefs or lack thereof. Despite these slips, the book is an excellent tale, well told. I've recommended it widely."},{"Title":"Fire in the Wind : The Life of Dickey Chapelle","review":"Having heard of Dickey Chappelle through a Nancy Griffith song, I decided to Google her to find out if she really existed or was just a name in a song.

If you want to read about a woman who defied all kinds of odds, traveling the world to take photographs and write about military life, all while living alongside the heavily male population of the military, this is the book for you.

In Speer Hitler found realization of his artistic and romantic dreams, his only sense of real creation outside of the realm of politics and organization, non-threatening acceptance by the men of superior social upbringing based not on fear but on the profound unity of artistic mission. For Speer, Hitler of course brought the position of power, influence and the oracle of truth, possibility of realization of himself for which any architect would've been prepared for a Faustian bargain.From 1932 to 1944 Speer served Hitler with his heart and his soul. After the crisis in his personal life, illness and realization of the war being lost, came a time for Speer to gradually realize that he was serving and evil man. As always in the relationship, this was colored in profoundly personal terms, and due to his calling and upbringing matched into romantic showdown (I am referring to Speer's famous confession in the bunker on the eve of the demise of the Third Reich, which the author implies might not even had happened.) At Nuremberg, Speer was the only defendant who accepted a principle of collective responsibility unconditionally, versed however in smart and carefully terms which might've saved his neck in the long term. There we see the beginning of the personal struggle with guilt and a difficult road to truth.Gita Sereny's analysis is touches on all aspects of Speer's life - childhood, love life, upbringing, social conditions for the upper middle class German of his generation, his years in the helm of power, 20 years in prison and 15 years as a writer, researcher and apologist for his own past. A picture of profoundly disturbed man emerges, a man who becomes \\"morally extinguished\\" as the horror outside unravels. Speer was serving his sentence for the rest of his life, unable to live anywhere but in his past, partially lamenting, partially horrified by it, unable to relate very well to his family sacrificed perhaps as a part of his bargain. Profound conflict in Speer's life, his inability to admit or even realize that he was aware of the Final Solution and have done nothing, a horrible mistake of omission hunted him for the rest of his life.This book is a fascinating read, all 750+ pages of it. Some of the material is a didactic repetition of events in Speer's life which can be gotten from his books, but I would not suggest skipping it since Sereny often compares multiple drafts and cross references it with other sources. You have to be committed to this book, but once the commitment is made, you are up for a treat! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I have never seen an author come close to Sereny in her ability to portray and accept the complexity of human nature, which she does with this Albert Speer book to the nth degree; it is a work of art.This book is never dry and never didactic. Unlike like some historians, Ms. Sereny never forgets that at the root of her story lie human beings, and righfully they should be at the center of any story of human history. She always relates it back to the human being.I find Publisher's Weekly's assertion that she was his apologist to be laughable; she never, ever lets him off the hook. One feels that she is a very moral human being.This 700+ page book is never dull. The portrait she etches of Albert Speer and the people of his time is indelible; I doubt you will ever forget it. And if you live with your books the way I do you will find yourself thinking about your own morality when you are through.I read her \\"Marybelle\\" book a few years ago and was bowled over by it; it is as fine a book as the Speer book though much smaller. In this country where we are having a field day charging and sentencing children as adults it is a necessity to read.Let me end this by saying Gitta Sereny is of the caliber of Hannah Arendt, though the better writer!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"In the course of his interviews with Gitta Sereny, Albert Speer remarked that had she been a prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, he would have hanged.How many biographers have had the opportunity to actively challenge their subjects' veracity? Not content to leave even the (seemingly) most minute details to chance, Sereny conducted exhaustive archival research and background interviews with Speer's family, friends, former associates, and enemies. This allows her to face Speer on equal footing -- and thus reveals new insights on the most enigmatic of Hitler's ministers.While the central theme of the book revolves around the question of what Speer knew about the Final Solution, and when he knew about it, the story of how one man could be almost wholly seduced by evil is also investigated. The reader will learn that Speer, unloved as a child, came under Hitler's influence in the way that many young men with lacunas in their souls will come to misidentify membership in a collective enterprise with their own self-worth.In fact, if, as William Manchester said, Speer's 'Inside the Third Reich' &quot;takes us through the looking-glass,&quot; then Sereny's book represents the adventures in Wonderland itself. The history of Hitler's Germany is seen from the unique context of the Hitler-Speer relationship. Far from relying on one-dimensional oversimplification, though, Sereny explores just how masterfully the Nazi hierarchy came to power and prosecuted a war -- proving once again that evil is not always overt and monstrous, but subtle and palliative.Was Speer a dissembler? Was he sincere in his attempt to atone for his particpation in an evil regime? I will leave the reader to his own conclusions. However, it is worth noting Sereny's charitable conclusion about this truly historical figure: &quot;It seemed to me it was some kind of victory that this man -- just this man -- weighed down by intolerable and unmanageable guilt, with the help of a Protestant chaplain, a Catholic monk, and a Jewish rabbi, tried to become a different man.&quot;This is perhaps the most fascinating one-volume account of Nazi Germany to appear in recent years, and will enrich our knowledge of that particularly dark time in history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"While it is intriguing to speculate whether Speer knew or did not know about the extermination of the Jews, that is only the smallest part of this vast work of scholarship. Gitta Sereny came to the conclusion that Speer was neither moral nor immoral, but rather &quot;morally extinguished&quot;. That is a somewhat ambiguous term, but from what I read in Speer's books and from what Sereny reveals in this one, I take it to mean something fairly simple: Speer was aware of people being imprisoned and killed, but really didn't pay much attention because he was too busy with his career.He noticed Jews being lined up at the Berlin train station to be taken somewhere; he didn't have the inclination or the time to find out why or where. He noticed that his boss had started a war; he was too busy to wonder whether the war was justified--he was an architect and any number of projects had to be attended to. His boss ordered him to assume leadership of armaments production for the war; refusing the order was not an option. He discovered that armaments production was accomplished largely by slaves, who died in great numbers at their work. Perhaps he heard of work areas where very little work was done and very, very large numbers of people died, of causes unrelated to work. Perhaps he did not. Sereny's book is largely a probe into whether he knew about the extermination camps or not.Of his repentance after the war there can be little doubt. He quarrels in Spandau with the other Nazis over whether they did anything wrong. He is mocked by one of his closest former Nazi friends for his &quot;public mea culpas&quot;. He speaks with a chaplain in Spandau about his desire to make himself a &quot;different man&quot;. He exchanges letters with Rabbi Robert Geis, a tremendously moving encounter--the Jew forgiving the Nazi. Just the fact that he would sit down for numerous interviews with Sereny, an author of books on death camps, speaks of his consciousness of the crimes he was associated with, and his desire to confront them.What I found most compelling was the glimpse Sereny's interviews afford us into a society that had gone completely over the edge, taking not just soldiers and guards and politicians, but also a great many children. It's easy to forget that many of these murderers had families. Speer had five children. Goebbels had six, all given names beginning with H. There is a photo in the book showing a number of these children arranged around Adolf Hitler on his birthday. Speer himself was a very young man when he first came under the spell of Hitler.In following the thread of her investigation into Speer, Sereny arrives at Posen Castle, October 6, 1943, where Himmler is addressing an assembly of gauleiters: &quot;...think for a moment how many party comrades have addressed one of those petitions to us in which was written that of course all Jews are pigs, but so-and-so is a decent Jew who should be exempted...I daresay that according to the number of such petitions...there must have been more decent Jews in Germany than there were Jews altogether...each of you, in your own province, knows good respectable National Socialists, each of whom knows one decent Jew...&quot;The irony is really remarkable if you stop to think about it: the minister in charge of genocide complaining that he is overwhelmed with requests from Nazis to spare Jews. He goes on to say how he made the difficult decision to kill not just the men, but also the women and children, and congratulates himself on his foresight: &quot;I did not think I was justified in exterminating the men, but to leave their children to grow up and take revenge on our sons and grandchildren.&quot; The bland and practical tone is that of a civil engineer: I did not think I should put a sidewalk there because that would not leave enough space for the cars to park.He continues, slipping into the stilted and delusional diction that is more common to Nazi speech: &quot;This order was the most difficult one we were ever given...I think I can say that it has been carried out without damaging the minds or spirits of our men. The danger was great and ever present.&quot; (Of what? Of damage to the spirit?) &quot;...the difference between the two possibilities...to become cruel and heartless and no longer to respect human life, or to become soft and succumb to weakness and nervous breakdowns...the way between Scylla and Charybdis is appallingly narrow.&quot;One wonders if that would have been Himmler's defense had he survived to Nuremberg: &quot;I exterminated the Jews in order to keep myself from having a nervous breakdown.&quot; Here is what is at the heart of my fascination with Albert Speer: unlike Himmler and Goebbels and the rest, he was not a lunatic. Sereny includes this passage from Posen Castle because there is an unresolved question as to whether Speer was present for Himmler's speech, and hence informed of the policy of genocide. But I don't think it matters. Speer was accessory to so many monstrous crimes that his knowledge or ignorance of the most monstrous one becomes moot.The more interesting question is how a man with the capacity for technical brilliance and decency and remorse, and a host of the other attributes that are best in mankind, could be a party to, and indeed a powerful engine of, one of the humanity's most ghastly episodes. This book doesn't entirely answer that question--no book could--but it is an absorbing and engrossing effort toward doing so."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"The issue raging over the veracity and accuracy of Albert Speer's self-serving recollections of the infamous Third Reich and his participation therein have been going on and on for well over thirty years. yet, as anyone unfortunate enough to have experienced a bitter divorce can testify as to the degree to which two otherwise intelligent and perceptive human beings can violently disagree as to what the truth is regarding matters both witnessed and had been parties to. So it is with our continuing fascination and absolute incredulity regarding Albert Speer, an otherwise intelligent and perceptive soul, who just so happens to have been a willing participant in one of the most horrific administrations in the history of the 20th century, the Nazi Third Reich.In two quite absorbing but incredibly self-serving books, Speer argued that he never understood the full extent of the Nazi war crimes nor the degree to which his own actions were complicit with those horrific aims. He first argued this at the war trials in Nuremberg, but did so in such a way as to admit his own culpability based on his rank and his actions as Chief Of Armaments Production, during which he employed slave labor in service to the German war effort. By being the only defendant at Nuremberg to show any semblance of remorse, he saved himself by admitting his own guilt, though largely guilt by association.Careful readings of the trials transcripts show that he was, in fact, fairly forthcoming in his admissions, although he always contended that he lacked specifics regarding the so-called 'Final Solution' or even of the fact that the concentration camps in Poland and elsewhere were being used to systematically annihilate millions of Jews and Gypsies. In fact, he was an incredibly sophisticated human being who was expert in 'toadying up' to whomever he needed to. The fact that he was convincing enough to the Allies to escape the death sentence speaks volumes about his persuasiveness and ability to read into the possibilities any situation offered.It is the author's contention that Speer must be held accountable for having allowed a tyrant like Hitler to rise. Yet Hitler was well in place before Speer ever met him. Speer is a man of stunning contradictions, someone of education, culture, and breeding who succumbed to the siren call of power, fame, and riches. While he eventually became expert at fashioning a defense both for himself and his actions both during and after the war, the truth of the matter is that most of what he argued in his own defense was (and is) preposterous. No one could have walked in the circles he did, have acted in concert with the aims and goals of the Nazi regime with such success and energy, and yet have been as totally naive and ignorant as he always claimed he was. What he recalls more than anything is the old adage Hitler was said to have coined; 'Tell a man an outrageous lie often enough for long enough and even he will come to believe it' I think Speer proved the accuracy of that adage, believing in his own lie. This is an absorbing and provocative book, and one I can heartily recommend to the student of modern history. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I've read a great deal about Albert Speer, including his own works, and this is the best, most thoroughly researched and well-balanced work I've read. The author's abilities to break down the essence of the Third Reich into human, psycho-social concepts is incredible. This is a great book to help understand human behavior, even if one isn't terribly interested in Speer or the Third Reich. Life's journey is rarely black and white, and the author masterfully presents the dynamic and challenging human dimensions with \\"truth\\"."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Sereny's insightful look into the life of Albert Speer raises more issues than she puts to rest. Given the subject matter, that might be the ultimate compliment. While when I picked up the book I was hoping for a complete admission of Speer's guilt for the Holucaust and for the other crimes of the Nazis, after finishing the book I realized that such insight was impossible. Moreover, the lack of a complete admission was understandable.Given Speer's position within Hitler's heirarchy, his contribution to the war effort, his role in the entrenched slavery that was part of the Third Reich and his intelligence he could have hardly not known about the crimes that he atleast enabled. However, for a person to hold himself responsible for these monsterous crimes and to still go on in any ordinary way would be next to impossible. The true are mutually exclusive. This is espically true given the fact that Speer was no monster. That he was not evil man, but only participated in evil acts.Sereny go along way toward explaining how Speer was able to live with accepting guilt for the Holoucaust but still not acknowleging that he knew about the Holocaust during his tenure with Hitler. While this is a subtle distinction it was one necessary for Speer's survival.There is no attempt to white wash Speer's role in supporting Hitler. Sereny is no apologist for Speer, but when necessary a harsh critic. The fact that Speer enabled Hitler to continue his campaign against humanity, and for so long shut his eyes to Nazi crimes, cannot be excused. However, since Speer was no Himmler or Gobbels, it can be understood.What is the center of the book and Speer's motavation is his relationship with Hitler. Sereny presents a Hitler, through Speer, that is kind to his close associates, a gentlement to the women around him, and who enjoyed being around their children. A Hitler that loved art and was able to converse with Speer for hours about architecture. That this doesn't jive with the author of the Final Solution is of course obvious. But this is the Hitler that Speer formed a close bond with.That Speer was unwilling to equate the Hitler that he knew with the Hitler of history becomes understandable when put into the above context. However, understanding does not equate with lack of responsibility.The book is well written and researched. Sereny writes nonfiction as if it was a novel and holds your attention throughout most of the book. This is an essential read for anyone who wishes to go beyond the surface of the Third Reich."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Gitta Sereny's monumental work 'Abert Speer: His Battle with Truth,' is a book of major importance about a man and an era that the world must never forget. Albert Speer, first Hitler's architect and later his Minister for Armaments and War Production, will remain forever an enigma. Did he know about the Holocaust? To what extent was his involvment? Should he have been hanged at Nuremburg? Was his apologetic manner in later years sincere? These are the questions that Sereny asks and attempts to answer, often arriving at conclusions that make even the reader uncomfortable, forcing him or her to realize that the Nazi system, at the time, could have held as much appeal for them as it did for Speer and for all of Germany. Sereny's intervews with Speer, her numerous interviews, and her exhaustive research all contribute to this masterful book. Of particular interest are the people whose lives were affected most by the madess of Hitler. Sereny's talks with the son of Martin Bormann are both chilling and incredibly moving. I do feel as though this book, along with Speer's own works, 'Inside the Third Reich,' and 'Spandau: the Secret Diaries,' (his thrid book, 'Infiltrator,' is one to be missed,) are essential reading for any serious student of Nazi Germany."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Gitta Sereny's\\"Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth\\" is the most comprehensive biography of Hitler's architect and minister of armaments to date. Aside from Speer's own writings, which Sereny proves to be deliberately misleading in a few crucial areas, it is probably the most insightful account of Speer's life and of his involvement with the Holocaust.Sereny's investigation of Speer draws upon numerous interviews she conducted with Speer himself, his friends, family, colleagues, acquaintances and scores of other individuals and authorities. Although Sereny explores many fascinating aspects of Speer's life, such as his tormented childhood, his desperate need for Hitler's approval, his perspective of the infighting among key members of Hitler's inner circle, his genius for organization, and his surprising emergence as a possible successor to Hitler, the central focus of her investigation is Speer's knowledge of the Holocaust.Sereny provides overwhelming evidence that within months of Speer's becoming Hitler's minister of armaments it was impossible for him not to have been aware of Nazi genocidal policies including the murder of millions of Jews. Sereny concludes that during his years of service to Hitler, Speer did not \\"officially\\" know about the Holocaust, though in reality it was impossible for him not to have known. Speer managed to translate his official ignorance to a claim of actual innocence at Nuremburg, which saved his life.Meticulously researched and superbly written, Sereny's book is enjoyable as an historical analysis, a biography, a psychological study, and as an ethical investigation."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"As someone who has been interested in the events surrounding the Third Reich, and who was also born into a disjointed political system, it was fascinating to read about the manner in which a despot went about to mobilise an entire nation in order to achieve his goals.What Gitta Sereny's book clearly illustrates, is that Hitler's magnetism was not only limited to the general man in the street, but that Germany's obsession with Hitler engulfed German intellegentsia as well. Albert Speer was one of those. Sereny puts forth an extremely detailed account of the extraordinary relationship between Speer and Hitler, the reasons for their mutual admiration of each other, and also attempts to explain why a man of his esteem and intelligence was able to ignore the inevetable consequences of the Fuhrer's rule. She attempts to probe Speer on the reasons and nature of their relationship, which she cites as one that &quot;...bordered on love.&quot;Speer's description of Hitler's last days and the chaotic time immediateley after the war must be one of the most compelling pieces of WWII literature ever written. What makes Sereny's book outstanding, is that it is the recollections of one of the most important men in Germany during that period, and Sereny questions Speer on many subjects, including the holocaust. She offers arguments, and he replies, but at he end, the reader is left to make his own judgement.I would recommend this excellent piece of work to anyone wanting to understand the reasons why a whole nation was prepared to follow Hitler to the grave--and this through the eyes of someone Hitler described as indespensable, Albert Speer. Sereny succeeds brilliantly to weave Speer's personal story with that of the Reich, and her style makes the book a delight to read."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I have a soft spot for 2 historical Giants, Frederick Cook and Albert Speer. After having read many books about WW2, Nazisim, the Nuremberg Trials and Speer's 2 best sellers, I had to find out how a competent writer like Sereny viewed Speer.The book is highly entertaining. What I appreciated most was that we could learn about what was left out of \\"Inside the 3rd Reich\\" and \\"The Secret Diaries\\". Speer's relationship with Casalis for instance, completly ignore in \\"The Secret Diaries\\", is central to the evolution of his sense of guilt.Sereny takes pains to verify and validate almost everything Albert admits or states. Verifications are made with Wolters, Annemarie Kempf or others surviving actors of the 3rd Reich days. Speer's guilt or knowledge of the extermination of the Jews hovers around his presence at the horrible Himmler speech in Posen and his visit to Dora, the underground labor camp. Sereny works around those topics time and again in hope to extract a confession from Speer.That confession comes on page 707, but I'll let you read, and weight, what it means in the larger context of the man. Finally, I don't see how Sereny's work can upset, or disturb, those who find Speer and honest and moral man. Yes, he did run slave factories, he must have knowed about the massacre of the Jews, but in the end, he did the right thing by admitting guit and responsability. He paid for it with 20 years of his life and took upon his shoulders the task to leave us an honest and full portrait of what it was like to be around a crew of madmen."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Sereny approaches history through individual perceptions, which are what really define history, to understand how the holocaust could have happened. I've never read anything else quite like it."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Herr Sperr, a cultured and civilized German,came from a well to do German family and had a promising future as an architect.If this is true, why did this civilzed, cultured German become a Nazi and use slave labor to build Hitler's Third Reich.We are told that he sensed some things were wrong with Hitler's conduct of the war,but Herr Sperr maintained that sensing was not knowing. When Speer was asked to explain how the sudden influx of apartments belonging to the hundreds of Jews he saw at the train station became available,he said they were being sent abroad for the war effort. When asked to explain the miserable working conditions in his factories, he said he was not in charge of personel. The greatest hoax occurred during the trial when he convinced the world that he alone was guilty because he should have known the fate of the Jews.Had he not worked side by side with Hitler? Herr Sperr claims that he was overpowered by Hitler's personality and was unable to be free of his spell. The author's narrative is excellent,detailed and still allows the reader enough room to come to their own conclusions about Herr Sperr, the &quot;good Nazi&quot;. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"During the summer of 1995, while vacationing on Nantucket Island, I first saw ALBERT SPEER: HIS BATTLE WITH TRUTH displayed in a shop window. I mentioned to my wife that I must read this sometime, for it appeared, upon cursory examination, an excellent insight into the mind of Albert Speer. That Christmas, it appeared under my tree. I devoured the book within the week and came away not fully satisfied.Gitta Sereny is at her best when relating her personal conversations with former Reichsminister Speer and the conclusions drawn from those conversations. However, I felt, by the end of the book, that I had not only read her book, but re-read INSIDE THE THIRD REICH (Mr. Speer's book) again!Ms. Sereny proved to me what I have suspected for years, after reading many first hand accounts of Herr Speer's demeanor shortly after his capture in 1945 and up to the Nuremberg Trial: he said what needed to be said to save himself. His heart did not let him accept culpability in the horrible deeds of the Third Reich, his analytical mind did!She presents convincing evidence that Alber Speer fooled himself for years concerning his culpability, yet also knowingly fooling the general public. I find this attitude not unique. While living in Germany in the early 70s, most Germans I met from that generation continued to rationalize their part in Nazi Germany when the theme came up.The Poznan conference speech by Himmler and her ivestigation into Speer's presence of being there or not was brilliant.The book, even with the large lifting of segments from Speer's book, is, I think, too technical for the novice reader of this time in history to be of much help. To the educated, she could have gotten to her point in a book half as thick without losing any of its spectacular points."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"The book Albert Speer: His Battle with Truthwell documented account of the man who was closest to Adolf Hitler. Speer comes close, but does not fully comprehend his role and actions during the Second World War. He tells Gitta Serney a very emotional account of his life and his own personal trials and tribulations. This fantastic account of Speer's life makes the reader feel as though: I have actually meet this man. But you know you have not. Although Speer is not hear to take questions about this book, Gitta Serney gives the man a sence of justice. Gitta uses basic question to stir and jog the memory of the aging Speer and her account of this interview is a wonderful insight to the man who was closest to Hitler."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Speer was a dominant figure in Nazi Germany and he combined a closeness to Hitler with a remarkable independance. Without him the war would have ended sooner and because of him it ended slightly less badly than it might have. He escaped the noose at Nuremberg and lived long enough to get to know his family and discover sex at the end of his life."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I have read some of Sereny's other works and have been disappointed but she has done a good job on Speer.Speer is a fascinating study. A troubled but troubling man, he is also brilliant, charming, and articulate. But \\"Albert Speer: His Battle with the Truth\\", is well named. I was especially impressed with the way Sereny has pulled all the threads of Speer's life into a coherent, readable text. It's a long book and it does drag in places but the underlying sub-text - just how much did Speer know about the murder of the Jews - leads to a surprising and intriguing last couple of chapters?I also thought it was especially appropriate that a female wrote this book. Women can look at this good looking distinguished man, and dare I say it, see the senusal side. I think only a woman could capture with the right touch the sterility of Speer's relations with those closest to him. Sereny's insights into Speer's sense (or lack) of empathy, compassion, and ultimately, passion, are spot on. Women are intuitive with these things in others; us guys less so.The book can be tedious mid-stream but read on. It's worth the wait."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I had high hopes for this book but left feeling somewhat let down after reading it.

The conclusions she draws are based on very thin ice indeed, few of them based on fact. But the biggest disappointment to me was with all the time she spent interviewing Speer she hardly touched on the work he actually did. This is a real pity and a missed opportunity as he is now dead. Speer was famous for turning around the German wartime economy/production, his actions probably lengthened the war between one or two years. Sereny hardly touched on how he did this, about one or two pages out of 700 odd.Instead we get 600 pages of her whining about the jews and did he know or didn't he, well of course he did, so what?"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Interesting facts about those times. His family lived across from my family home in Heidelberg, Germany."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Albert Speer was a man of talent and strength. He was also ambitious for power, and seduced by evil. What Sereny makes clear is that Speer's inteligence kept him from plunging onto the suicidal path other Germans took. By striving to save German industry he showed faith in a German future that could exist. Whereas many Germans fought to the last, Speer took the hard way out in helping to build a future for Germany.The book itself provides many fascinating facts about the lives of Germans before and after the War. Especially amusing are the antics of Rudolph Hess and the other War criminals held in Spandau. Speer' eventuall release and subsequent writing career show how a man can pick up the pieces of his life after being out of society for over twenty years.

From a childhood devoid of love, to his first fateful meeting with his 'Fuhrer' until his eventual trial and rehabilitation back into society, Sereny has seen Speer as few others have been able to do.

Instead, it was a biography, interspersed with recollections about personal exchanges during the in-depth interview process. It was only in the last chapter that she said she did not believe his adamant refusal to admit to knowing about the holocaust until AFTER the war. She did not really offer any evidence that backed up her belief, it seemed to just be her opinion, without any supporting foundation. I have to say that I was disappointed that the book did not deal more with Speer's \\"battle with the truth.\\"The book did offer an interesting view of Speer's life after his release from Spandau as well as his dysfunctional relationship with each and every member of his family. It also was the time I read about his affair right before his death.

I could hardly put the book down. The research is thorough and comprehensive. The author has interviewed almost every living person who knew Herr Speer, including extensive interviews with Speer himself. The story never drags inspite of its more than 700 pages. This book challenges the reader to look beyond the simple historical facts. Speer was truly a remarkable personality. The world is better off that he was not executed after his Nuremberg trial. His intimate knowledge, organizational skills, and willingness to document and talk about it, has enabled us to understand and learn valuable lessons about this period in history that would have otherwise been lost forever. This book helps explain how an entire nation and many good people were seduced and strung along on the tide of Hitler's leadership. The lesson for all citizens of every nation is to be aware of government actions, and to not permit the government to control the media."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"What an incredible book! Sereny helps us to see what it was like to live in Nazi Germany, and explores how an individual was sucked in to the lies, intrigues, and politics of the time. Yet she never forgets that the subject is, regardless of what was done by him or around him, a human being. That's the overlooked factor in most explorations of the Nazi genocide. Much as we might hate to admit it, these things were done by people who started out just like you or I. It's less a history of Nazism or Speer than an exploration of his thoughts, hopes, and fears during that time, and the struggle he has faced in the ensuing years to reconcile what he believed then with the things he knows now. A stunning mix of history, psychology and confession, Sereny has written a towering, important book."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This book is a historical, psychological and spiritual look into the human soul. Mr. Speer, a man with a very high moral code, has been part of one's of history's most horrific crimes.

It gives us insight of what may be going on within these regimes and those involved in them."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"While this book is essential to anyone interested in Speer, it should be read also by anyone interested in the art or psychology of deception. For all his public breast-beating, Speer never really came 100% clean with the public, his friends, or himself. He knew more about slavery and murder than he ever let on.Since none of us are perfectly honest with or about ourselves, we can all learn a lesson here, even though, thanks be to God, we have nothing half so terrible to cover up."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This book, along with Sereny's earlier &quot;Into That Darkness,&quot; about Treblinka Commandant Franz Stangl, constitutes some of the most complex treatment of the Nazi genocide. Sereny relentlessly avoids oversimplification, and clearly attempts to come to terms with the character and the heart of Albert Speer. Many of the people she interviewed for the book were former Nazis, and Sereny always candidly describes her reaction to them now. Some seem to have genuinely repented, others leave her feeling quite uneasy. In the case of those who still seem to harbor many Nazi sentiments (particularly antisemitism) she generally lets their words speak for themselves. Though it is clear she is sympathetic to Speer (she admits as much in the first line of the book), she calls Speer on every contradiction, and does not simply accept his version of events. In the end, the reader is left to make up his own mind about Speer. I found this book to be simply overwhelming. It challenges the reader to get beyond simple emotional reactions to Nazi history and instead to delve into some of the most challenging questions about that era."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This is an endlessly fascinating book. I lost much sleep during my first reading because I couldn't put it down. The writing is vivid, personal, pitch perfect.

Sereny does a very good job of assembling a picture of Albert Speer from a variety of sources. These include personal interviews with Speer, his notes from Spandau, interviews with colleagues/friends/aquaintances and other historical sources.Where Inside The Third Reich is very much what Speer wants to tell you, Sereny's book often is not. I believe she liked Speer and in fact does not paint him as an evil man. Rather you get a picture of a man whoose morals were not strong enough to cast aside his ambition, Hitler's cult of personality and friendship, war, perspective and duty to country. It also shows many fo Speers good qualities, which many WWII historians like to forget.It is as complete a picture of Albert Speer as you are to find, save for perhaps reading his Spandau diary.

Gitta Sereny manages, through intensive interview sessions, to provide readers with a peek into the fascinating mind of Albert Speer. I put this book down and felt as if I actually knew Speer, the man, the husband and father, the Nazi architect. The text and various interviews are well laid out and the overall structure of the book is near perfect. With that said, however, I did not feel that Gitta Sereny ever conclusively proved or illustrated that Speer knew about the holocaust. I felt there was too much guess work towards the end of the book and not enough hard proof. Gitta Sereny refers to ambiguous wartime documents, vague military communiqu&eacute;s and other literary works on the holocaust, but never proves, with hard evidence, that Speer had absolute knowledge of the existence of the extermination camps. Oddly, much of what Speer mentioned in his interviews, concerning his knowledge of the holocaust seems plausible.Gitta Sereny makes too many assumptions at the end of the book, and this devalued my overall judgement of her work. However, this book is so powerful and so well written, despite its flawed conclusion I would recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Gitta Sereny -- Your book is wonderful. Thank you for your prodigious effort!!! Ever since visiting Germany in 1978, I have become one of the many trying to understand how the WWII Nazi crimes against humanity could occur in such an educated and advanced society. I have read most of the books on Nazi Germany, Hitler and the like but none more compelling than Gitty Sereny's book. Her years of research; dozens of interviews; understanding of the magnitude of Hitler's crimes have brought forth a book I could not put down or stop reading. As one reviewer mentioned, Ms. Sereny's transitions are often abrupt but her style is most readable. The second reading provides much more insight into Albert Speer. By then, the reader is familiar with the people surrounding Speer that Ms. Sereny interviewed and introduces throughout her book. I thank Gitta Sereny for giving the world a fairly unbiased look at a most remarkable man, Albert Speer and I believe she finds the truth about his guilt. READ IT TWICE!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Albert Speer is the greatest mystery among Hitler's circle. He was unlike most of the others. He was educated, he grew up in a civil enviroment, not warm mind you, but close to \\"normal\\". He probably survived the Nuremberg Trials cause the men trying him could identify with him. He admitted more guilt than any other person at the trial, but why did he go along with Hitler. Gitta Sereny examines Speer in this book. She spent a fair amount of time with him and obviously was charmed by him, but was able to ask of him questions that were beyond the questions he wanted to be asked. Sereny puts together Speer, piece by piece. She examines his beahavior, talks to people who knew him and experienced many similar things, or at least people who faced the same moral dilemmas. She tries to put together why Speer, an educated man, not a crude or pedantic man like many of Hitler's cronies, was so seduced by Hitler. Sereny is a writer and reporter who is able to uncover what is hid beneath, she did the same thing with Fritz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, in her book \\"Into that Darkness\\". She succeeds cause she was able, as I said above, to ask the questions she wanted to ask, not the questions Speer would have wanted her to ask. Many people see Albert Speer as the \\"good Nazi\\", the main reason he is seen like that is that he was given the chance to tell his story and shape it as to make him seem guilty but not so guilty as others cause he had a conscience. This book will debunk much of that, but there will be sympathy with the man always, in that he did seek forgiveness, which Sereny discusses also, and understanding."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"In the December issue of American Spectator there is a \\"Books for Christmas\\" list of recommendations that I always use as a guide for my reading in the upcoming year.James Rosen (Fox News White House correspondent) recommended this book as \\"the best nonfiction book I have ever read on any subject.\\" And while I don't necessarily agree entirely with this characterization I can heartily recommend this book as one you will not soon forget. Sereny is an Austrian native who actually saw the 1934 Nuremberg rally which was captured unforgettably by Leni Reifenstahl in her Triumph of Will.Sereny gained the confidence of Albert Speer over many years and had basically unfettered access to him throughout her research, and it shows. The insights thus gained allow for an unusual glimpse into the inner workings of the Third Reich and all of its principal players.Sereny conducted interviews with numerous \\"players\\" in the life of Albert Speer and the Third Reich. Her meticulous research methods and eye for detail allow for a glimpse into the heart of darkness the likes of which you will likely never again see.She avoids the pitfalls of many who succumb to the temptation to oversimplify, mis-characterize, or accept the prevailing facile dismissals of those who participated in the \\"Final Solution.\\" She attempts, at least partially successfully, to gain a broader understanding of just how such evil as occurred in the Third Reich came about. But she fails, as we all must eventually, in penetrating this odious darkness.At the end of the day, the light of her analysis falls upon the black hole of evil which absorbs nearly all attempts to understand it. I enjoyed this book tremendously, but it is difficult slogging. Of one thing there can be no doubt however, Albert Speer did obviously have knowledge of the evil that surrounded him. That he could have remained oblivious to all that transpired is simply not credible. Even the effort not to confront this evil was, in itself, a tacit acknowledgment of what was transpiring. He used forced labor in his enormously successful efforts to keep the German war production going despite overwhelming losses to Allied bombing.My wife, who reads to me on road trips, could not bear to read this book. It is not for the faint of heart. But it is well worth the effort. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"As a German born in 1944 and leaving Germany at the tender age of 13, I was always ashamed of being German. Gitta Sereny's book allowed me to reflect and think about the times, the people, the mood, the conflicts in a way that was not too overwhelming and hurtful. Her writing style is beautiful and the truth contained in this excellent biography made me want to read more about this shameful period in Germany's history. No longer hesitant to learn what happened, thanks to Gitta's book, I am also much more attuned at what is happening in other parts of the world where genocide takes place in small isolated instances but where we can make a difference in stopping it by letting those in power know &quot;never again&quot;. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how people, like Speer, can ultimately become connected to an evil plot against humanity."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I found this book to be fascinating. Ms. Sereny provides a great deal of additional information not given by Mr. Speer in his Inside the Third Reich and Secret Diaries. I would recommend reading Mr. Speer's books first then this one. Her research is exhaustive and thorough and the book provides a great insight into the mind of Mr. Speer."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Unfortunately, Sereny has failed to enlighten us as to howSpeer finally discovered what was going on in the concentrationcamps. It was near the end of the war when a staff officer took Speer aside and asked him if he knew about Auschwitz. Speer said\\"Yes, it's a work camp. Why?\\" \\"Don't ever go there\\" the officerreplied. That drove Speer to investigate and find out about thecamp and the human exterminations. Later he showed up at Gen. Henrici's command post and showed him the pistol he planned to use to kill Hitler, having decided that poison gas into the intakes of the bunker wouldn't work - they had repositioned them too high in the air. He finally realized that he wasn't a killer and never carried out the plan. The Nuremberg trials could only convict Speer for using slave labor in the factories that he oversaw, but those laborers fared better under Speer than they would have elsewhere. He should never have been convicted of anything, along with several other defendents who were tried forthe \\"crime\\" of disliking Jews. A prosecutor might well try to convince a jury that Speer is not to be believed, but their are plenty of historical facts that contradict Sereny's claims. A history should be investigative in its orientation, not prosecutorial. Let the facts speak for themselves. This was Sereny's greatest blunder and unfortunately it infects all of the text. The author simply isn't an historian here; she remains the prosecutor, but without a defense attorney to check her more outlandish statements."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This book is an outrageous lie. Sereny writes,\\"Speer, I was already convinced, had never killed, stolen, personally benefited from the misery of others or betrayed a friend. And yet, what I feel neither the Nuremberg trials nor his books had really told us was how a man of such quality could become not immoral, not amoral, but somehow infinitely worse, morally extinguished.\\"Speer never personally killed, stole, or benefited from the misery of others. He instead caused millions of people to be murdered, robbed of all they owned, and live as slaves.Speer, by ordering the forced vacation of Jewish apartment in Berlin, was directly responsible for the first step in the deportation to Poland of thousands of Jews. He admits he requested that Sauckel kidnap hundreds of thousands of slave workers (\\"forced labor,\\" he euphemistically calls them). He visited one of the Dora work camps where thousands died. There he noted dreadful conditions, then ordered the construction of new above ground jails and better food for the slaves.Amoral but not immoral. Sereny is a fool who was conned by a master liar."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"A brilliant analysis of history and one man's role in it. Excellently researched material fused together in a relaxed but meticulous literary style so unique to those few really good journalist in the world. Me. Sereny has the talent for retaining her moral stance whilst letting the material tell the story largely by itself. Never does she patronise the reader with self appointed sweeping moral judgements. Delightful in its scope and truly remarkable in its attempt to understand the moral and psychological workings of a very complex and special individual like Albert Speer. Although the work deals with Herr Speer it is in the final analysis not about him. Rather it raises the age old questions of the nature of guilt and innocence, good and bad, truth and lie and love and hate to a new height of intensity and quality of debate by using Herr Speer as a medium to explore in fascinating ways the full complexity and ambiguity of these concepts in 21st century society. Her handling of the issue of guilt and accountability is masterful. Her descriptions of the relationship between Hitler and Speer had a profound affect on my concepts of love and is an invaluable document for those trying to understand not only the motives of the Nazi organization but also of Der Fuhrer himself. Anyone interested in the workings of the Third Reich and/or morality and love in general must read this book!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I have found, in my recent fascination with Albert Speer, that most books (including the ones Speer has authored) on the Third Reich, Nuremberg, and Speer in particular are biased, in that they start from a particular assumption of Speer's character and then set out to prove that assumption. After a while of reading such books, I had begun to despair of reading anything truly objective in its approach to this controversial subject.This book, therefore, came as a pleasant surprise to me. Sereny starts from no assumptions about Speer (except the assumption that Speer did in fact know about the Jews), and through a series of in-depth interviews with Speer, his family, and just about anybody who had ever encountered him in his lifetime (both favorable and unfavorable), shows perhaps the most comprehensive and (I believe) accurate portrayal of Speer that it is possible to achieve, as told by people who are in a position to know.Despite the fact that it is occasionally difficult to read (there is often a lack of transition), I would recommend this book, above all others, to anybody who wishes to learn the truth about Speer and his writings."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Gitta Sereny is not only a prodigious researcher, she also writes beautifully. This is an amazing book, the product of years of interviews with Speer, who heretofore had been regarded as a sort of &quot;good Nazi.&quot; Sereny exposes the truth: that he knew about Nazi genocide and was the mastermind behind German's brutal slave labor between 1941-45.Sereny beautifully weaves her story, throwing in wonderful ancillary observations about the Nazi hierarchy. She includes Speer's disingenuous criticisms of Hitler (whom he actually worshipped), as well as his opinions on Goering, Goebbels and Hitler's other minions.Sereny includes details of Speer's love affair late in life with a much-younger blonde woman and the dumping of his long-suffering wife after 50 years of marriage.Most important was Speer's assiduous and desperate attempt to disguise the fact that he knew about Auschwitz and successfully (until Sereny) hid it from the world.Sereny deserved the Pulitzer for this book. Read it and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"The entire book centers on Gitta Sereny's search for the truth: When and if did Speer come to know exactly when the Third Reich was slaughtering the Jewish populations of Europe? And, if and when he was aware why didn't he protest either by resisting, sabotage or resigning? Is Speer guilty of genocide? There is the secondary truth being search for throughout the reading: Is Speer lying by denying knowledge of the Holocaust or subconsciously denying the knowledge because his mind refuses to acknowledge it? Was Spear's denial a conscious plan to save him from the gallows at Nuremberg, or a natural human reaction to do whatever is necessary to live? Certainly Speer was intellectually brilliant. His production numbers in the final year of the war are incredible considering all the allied bombings aimed to destroying military related targets, especially in the East, so they would not fall into conquering Russian hands. Is the truth that important? Gitta does a lot of research toward answering these questions. What I found fascinating is the odds and ends of the life and death of the Third Reich, the behind the scenes descriptions of characters and events. I like becoming the \\"fly on the wall\\" as t'were. One of the best books about the Third Reich that I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This book is an incredibly insightful look at the WWII leader Albert Speer. More than that however it is a haunting portrait of the entire generation that stood by. To me the most chilling portions of the book came not from Speer himself but rather from the many interviews the author conducts on her research. Time and again we hear from the many people, often high ranking, who had no idea that anything was amiss. The statements that these people make always concede how difficult life was for Jews, how Jews were denied their rights, denied their jobs, and eventually carted away \`to the east'. Speer himself is a man willing to assume responsibility for the actions of the regime but who simultaneously seems to have no actions of his own to regret. We are allowed to look into his life and meet the many people in whom he inspired great feelings of loyalty. By and large this becomes a long list of people that the charming Mr. Speer uses and discards at his conven! ience. From his college friends to his assistants during the war years, to his own family during the spandau years. But never fear the book does have a happy end, after a few more betrayals Albert is able to look back on his life with the satisfaction of knowing how he single handedly dragged the war on for months beyond when it should have lasted."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"A very scholarly work from Gitta Sereny, detailing a man of considerable charm,intelligence and resourcefulness. Gitta Sereny goes some way to explain this complex individual, his relationships with his parents, his wife and children, as well as his place among the elite of the third reich. A man who 'conned' the war crimes commission at Nuremberg, and continued to do so to the rest of the world after the war. Why did his deputy hang and not he? A complex answer despite the evidence. A great read, an insight into the shadows of a totalitarian regime and the place of one man within it."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"Sereny captures a man dancing with the truth, and inviting the author to join him. He is an old master at this game - the dance saved his life at one time; yet the time has come for the last dance on the card.I find Sereny's personal observations of Speer most compelling, even more so as this is one of the few (if only) biographies of Speer penned by a woman; therefore we feel his legendary charm and coyness come through. Sereny is uncompromising in her approach, yet one cannot but feel that she does come away with some closeness to the old man.Above all; one reads this excellent book and at the end does feel that the truth - finally - has come out. Her revelation about the South African Connection and his inherrent admission was mindblowing; even more so when one considers that he was such a carefull man, such a slip must have been pre-mediatated.As a scholar/playwright I warmly welcome any comment on Albert Speer, I am currently writing a stage play about him, and need all the information and comment I can gather; email me down here in beautiful New Zealand!"},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"I have a deep interest in World War II and read this book hoping to find out more about Speer's architecture and German war production, etc. The book doesn't get into that topic much but concentrates, as the title suggests, on Speer's battle with truth. Very good analysis of what Speer knew and when he knew it. Good insight into the top ranks of Nazi Germany and how Speer fit into it, even though he was not really into the politics of the movement."},{"Title":"Albert Speer","review":"This book is an incredibly insightful look at the WWII leader Albert Speer.

Readers of any of Albert Speer's books (especially &quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot;) will find it an essential addition to their library."},{"Title":"Outline of Buddhism","review":"Stoddart has beaten all records by writing a completely unsummarizable book: It is as concise an overview of the vast subject of Hinduism as could possibly be conceived of, providing tenderfeet with a quick but reliable introduction to the hindu pantheon, spiritual ways, scriptures and metaphysics, while coming in very handy for &quot;false beginners&quot; who wish to refresh their memory and to orientalists who feel the need for drawing clearer lines between Orientalism and Hinduism as such.The book in considerable part conveys the notions expressed in Frithjof Schuon's unsurpassable writings concerning metaphysics and comparative religion, but the clear-cut, delightfully didactic style is Stoddart's own, and so are the initial chapters on the nature of religion, orthodoxy and the classification of religions (in spiritual and religious matters - it should be added in passing - reproducing truths as adequately expressed by others has nothing to do with lack of originality).Only in the chapter on transmigration versus reincarnation does Stoddart stray from his serene path of succinct teachings, as if dealing with a more personal issue. The complexity of the problematic of &quot;the reincarnationism of renegade Christian pseudo-esoterists&quot; is a bit oversimplified and so I suppose there will be readers whose doubts (or beliefs) remain unanswered. This, however, does not detract from the value of the book.Stoddart's book on Sufism, also a very concise and enriching piece of work, is another highly recommendable item for anyone's private collection of spiritual literature."},{"Title":"Outline of Buddhism","review":"The prestigious British author was able to produce here a clear, simple and at the same time profound and comprehensive study of Buddhism, which puts first things first and each thing in its proper place.The book demonstrates that Buddhism is as much a religion as Christianity or Islam and offers a balanced panorama of the Buddhist religion, history and culture."},{"Title":"Outline of Buddhism","review":"This is a masterly synthesis of the philosophical and religious doctrines, rituals and culture of Hindu civilization.Apart from that, it clarifies some misunderstandings relating to Oriental doctrines, such as the idea of reincarnation and transmigration.Highly recommended to students of philosophy, religion and Oriental art and culture.

It is an easy to read book with plenty of illustrations and it has such a powerful message.If you follow the advice Aslett presents in this book you will most certainly accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible. There are some things I disagree with. I often wear shirts with button down collars, so I think Aslett maybe goes a bit too far when he suggests not having collars that button down so you can save time getting dressed. However, he makes a great point. Many little things we do each day that take time add up to a lot of time. So, if we learn to cut a minute here and a minute there off of ordinary routines, we will have more minutes for accomplishing our goals.Besides containing a lot of excellent time management advice, this book is also very motivating. Why Do More is a great chapter if you need convincing that accomplishing more makes you feel better. If you need some motivation, this book will give it to you.Page 66 has two words on the page in huge font - BE EARLY. The advice and reasons Aslett presents for being early are priceless. Just incorporating this strategy can save you tremendously.As I said, this was the first of Aslett's books I ever read back in 1996. Since then, I have read it several times when I needed a kick in the pants to get back on the productivity train. I just recently read a couple chapters again to assist with a presentation I was giving and to motivate me to do even more in 2008.Read this book and then put the strategies to work and you will accomplish more and feel great about getting things done.As someone else posted, this book was reprinted with the new title \\"Done.\\"Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From The School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"This is one of my favorite time management books. It's written in a straightforward, to the point manner, and focuses on not on cliches, complicated lists or 'feel good' fluff but offers some sound techniques ('be early' and dejunk' being a couple of them) and is interwoven throughout with good values and ethics as well (do right, read the scriptures, taking care of others is one of the most productive things on earth, etc.).I'll admit I'm still working on incorporating all these principles into my life with more or less success, but think this is one of the best basic expositions of the work ethic and how to have a fulfilling life (hint: you won't get one watching TV every night after work).I like too that he focuses not just on top tier executives or athletes, but on people from all walks of life showing that everyone can make the most of what they have.Recommended."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Unlike Don Aslett's other books, this one is short on specific advice. Worse yet, his tone is condescending throughout, implying that those who don't live according to his rules are worthless slugs. What you get is a preachy book full of useless and vague platitudes like \\"Productive people do more work!\\" (Duh!) He also advises questionable strategies such as getting less sleep and working in spite of illness. I found the book offensive and a complete waste of money and bookshelf space."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"If you want to become a Type A+ obsessive compulsive workaholic, who wants no time to stop and smell the roses, this book is for you. I resented Mr. Aslett's condescending, arrogant, narrow-minded and judmental attitude towards anyone who doesn't agree with his workaholic rules. He seems to see anyone who isn't a workaholic as worthless garbage. We would all like to have more time to do more, but as one of the other readers commented, it is important to enjoy the process, not just the finished result. A balance is what most of us really desire--being able to get more things done but having time for pleasure. You won't find any balance from reading this book. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I have found Julie Morgenstern's &quot;Time Management from the Inside Out&quot; much more helpful. She takes into consideration that we have different working styles and personalities, and gives guidelines into creating a time management program that works for you as an individual. She also addresses situations, like clincial depression, and illness, and how to manage time while under these circumstances."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Author preaches too much and emphasizes only the work result, ignoring the beauty of process. He doesn1t want you to stop to smell the flowers, or appreciate the beautiful scenery around you. Instead, he wants you to keep going until you arrive your destination. It is like driving from Utah and prohibit yourself from appreciating amazing landscape until you arrive the Grand Canyon. I do agree we have to be goal-oriented; however, when you don1t appreciate beautiful scenery on your journey, which I think is very tunnel-vision, you might not be able to enjoy that later, as many unpredictable things might happen any minutes.The way he works doesn1t apply to everyone who needs time management skills, at least not for me. Life shouldn1t be like that - working more hours and less sleep. His methods will, I believe, make people feel more stressful.Author puts much more time in working than being with his family. Like two readers who reviewed this book, I feel sorry for his wife. Furthermore, I definitely disagree his condescending attitude toward those who don1t practice his rules. Therefore, I returned the book right away, and kept other time-management books I bought at the same time."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Stick with me for my first few sentences as their relevance should become clear. Before reading Mr. Aslett's book,thank goodness I worked with a truly inspiring personal organizer. This person encouraged me when I felt overwhelmed and managed, in a matter of weeks,to help me find a workable system and shave hours off my days.I picked up Aslett's book in hopes of fine tuning my system.So I was horrified when I opened Mr. Aslett's book and found a \\"productivity test\\" which labeled some as being potentially \\"beyond hope \\". Huh?! I would have scored quite low on this test before working with an organizer and...if I had started with Mr. Aslett's book I certainly would NOT have been encouraged!Instead, I would have regretted spending money on a book which purports to teach readers how to have a 48 hour day and then classifies a certain number of those readers as possibly \\"beyond hope.\\" Why not warn them of this before they buy the book?There are also blanket statements that leave me reeling. Don't attend business related cocktail parties because they are a \\"waste of time\\"? Hmmm...tell that to two of my friends who made contacts which turned into better jobs at these events.And apparently skipping meals is a sign of \\"self-discipline\\" and total time spent eating,including family dinners,should take up no more than an hour a day! Sorry, but our family can frequently converse for 1/2 hour at dinner...and that would leave 15 minutes per meal for breakfast and lunch.Do you get excited or \\" worked up \\" when watching a favorite sports team? Mr. Aslett suggests your excitement might be so intense that you should stop wasting time watching sports. Ouch.Maybe Mr. Aslett's techniques make sense to you. As for me, I do not intend to count every minute of my life, watching for a wasted few seconds here and there. As trite as it may seem, life is too short to keep me from watching football or tennis...or whatever...and I can still have an efficient and productive life."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"A solid time management book. Not a lot of fluff. Plain straightforward language from an old farmer and janitor. I'd recommend it to anyone.Kind of what you'd expect to hear from your grandpa talking to you."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"This is not what I expected it to be. Aslett may be the guru of clean, but time management is not his forte. You have to be Type A, obsessive-compulsive to go along with his strategies. I feel sorry for his wife!"},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"I work a lot. I spend my day teaching and then return to the school and spend my entire evening preparing to teach. I write my own materials and do not rely on the textbooks at all.You can see something must have changed, because you are reading this. Clearly I have the time to write it.As I read this book, I was struck again and again by how much of it I already knew. I was also struck by how little of it I did. For example, some evenings, I would convince myself it was vital to get my desk organized before I started writing. Then, of course, I need to put away those test tubes, and I might as well brew another cup of coffee, and then...I still come back to school in the evening. Now I come back with a plan. I follow that plan. If putting away test tubes isn't in it, I don't do that. However, Aslett recommends combining jobs. So, if I need to grab a book off my shelf (which is near where the test tubes are stored), I take my test tubes with me.Aslett also recommends just simply doing the job. I despise correcting papers. Sometimes they can build up into a huge stack. Now, I just do them. Once they're done, I can do the parts of teaching I like.Another thing he points out is that the busier we are, the more we get done. That is true. I will accomplish nothing at home. Watching TV is a waste of time, so I don't have it. I realize how easy it is to sit down in front of it and do nothing. It is not relaxing.As you can see from my selection of changes in my life, there is nothing here that is new. What Aslett does is take what we already know and articulate it and force us to confront it. That is the power of his writing. He puts the reader in the spotlight and, no matter how much they squirm, they are forced to face why they are not productive."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Aslett's book is uniquely beneficial in my view. While most such books focus on some &quot;method&quot; of getting a lot done, Aslett focuses more on the obstacles to accomplishment, particularly people's common actions that waste time.What is truly unique, however,is that his book exhibits a certain &quot;philosophy&quot; of accomplishment. Some of this comes through directly in things to do in order to get a lot more done. But other such aspects are more &quot;between the lines,&quot; and in the end it really leads you a mindset that is keenly aware of how much more you could be doing.The book does not contain such things as sample schedules and prioritization lists. This is not a book of techniques and tips, but rather seeks to make accomplishment more of an &quot;inside-out&quot; process.The reviewer who complained that the book would make the reader into a workaholic if followed completely missed the point. This book is about doing more, but it's not about slaving away at the office. It does talk about doing your work quickly and well, but much more fundamentally, it talks about doing MORE THINGS, things you find personally fulfilling and important. It's for people who rather be doing something personally meaningful than smelling roses; most of the would-be rose-smellers will probably never &quot;have enough time&quot; to plant their garden anyway!In short, it's made a tremendous impact on the way I see and conduct my life -- I get things done, and a MORE of them, than I used to. And quite the contrary to being a depressed, bitter &quot;Type A workaholic,&quot; I am also much happier and more fulfilled than I was before!"},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"I love this book. It is an entertaining, easy read with lots of fresh information about how to produce more in limited time. The author doesn't pontificate--he just shares the methods that have worked so spectacularly well for him. Sure he's a workaholic. But if your objective is to actually get more ACCOMPLISHED in your limited time, then this is by far the best and most useful of the many, many time-management books I have read over the years.I particularly liked his innovative &quot;bulk&quot; approach to hacking through a To-Do list. I have never seen this method written up anywhere else, and it really does work! Also, the entire &quot;Be Early&quot; chapter is a gem that really hit home for a chronic procrastinator.It is a &quot;Type A&quot; world out there, and using Mr. Aslett's methods frees up more time for the important things--family, faith, personal enrichment. If you want a touchy-feely discussion of &quot;smelling the roses&quot;, then go elsewhere. If you want to see how it is possible to get it all DONE so you have time for a rich personal life, then this book will get you there.I reread this book every few months, and it has made my life better. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Welcome to Don Aslett's high-paced world! This and other books by Don Aslett have helped me, a mother of a 4-mo. old and a 2-yr. old, get my act together, get tons more accomplished, and be a far happier person. This book focuses on a common sense approach to time management and revives the idea that hard work can be highly fulfilling and joyful. Gone are the endless attempts at lists and complicated schedules I have seen in many approaches to time management. If you are creative, have lofty dreams, or have had bad luck with typical approaches to time management, this book is for you."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"I just read How to Have a 48 Hour Day again. It's authored by someone I interviewed several years ago, Don Aslett. I read it every once in a while to see if I am still following some of the ways to be more productive with my time. It is the best time management book I've ever read. The way Don teaches how to treat time is remarkable."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"Don Aslett has written a decent little (160-page) book in How to Have a 48-Hour Day. His primary point is that we often underestimate just how much we can do with our lives. Aslett shows his readers that they can be more productive and accomplish more by adopting a new perspective on time management. While I don't know that much of Aslett's advice is unique, I do think that he presents his material in an engaging manner.There are some negatives to this book. Most readers simply will not want to go to the extremes that Aslett does in order to enhance their productivity. In the book, Aslett recounts how he did several days of seminars in Oregon while so horribly ill that everyone agreed he needed to be in a hospital; he also advises readers not to take vacations so that they can get more done. Aslett comes across as a nice guy, but he also seems to be more than a little obsessive-compulsive about his work.I think that How to Have a 48-Hour Day is worthwhile for those want to become more productive. However, most readers will find that some of Aslett's suggestions are impractical. I would advise interested readers to take Aslett's advice with a grain of salt and choose those parts that work for them."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"THIS WAS, AS ALL DON ASLETT BOOKS, VERY GOOD. HOWEVER, IT IS VIRTUALLY (EXCEPT FOR A FEW SENTENCES) THE SAME AS 'DONE'. I READ 'DONE' FIRST, AND ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO READ THIS BOOK. BOTH BOOKS ARE GOOD BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME.

I wasn't just disappointed -- I was amazed at what Aslett considers reasonable in the quest for productivity. If we followed Aslett's guidelines, we'd never stop to chat with a friend, would work through meals even if we were hungry (not that the meals would be worth stopping for -- Aslett considers spice to be \\"food clutter\\" and recommends sticking to unspiced food), eschew coffee breaks because lifting that cup to your lips takes time, time, time, rise earlier, work later and generally keep our noses to the grindstone at the expense of relaxation, recreation or pleasure of any kind.This book reminded me of the old joke about the man who asks his doctor how to extend his life, and the doctor tells him to give up alcohol, women, and rich food. \\"You won't live longer, but it will seem like an eternity.\\" Aslett may be able to cram forty-eight hours into one day, but what a miserable day it is."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"I can appreciate some of Mr. Aslett comments and suggestions but I found the book &quot;wordy&quot; and vague. It might have been a better book if he'd have played it a little straighter with the reader. I found myself wondering once or twice while I read it if I couldn't save part of my &quot;48 hour day&quot; by not reading this book. There are some useful insights in the book however (I think his points on having direction are worth considering); so, for me, a &quot;fair&quot; rating is about right."},{"Title":"How to Have a 48-Hour Day: Get Twice as Much Done as You Do Now!","review":"I have to object to the \\"as fun as a hangnail\\" and \\"vague and condescending\\" reviews of this book. Sure, there is some extremity to his recommendations, but he's just a straightforward, massively Type-A person. The fact is that people (starting with me) are prone to lay around, procrastinate, remain unproductive for many years and then look back in bewilderment and say \\"Where have all the years gone, and what do I have to show for them?\\" I admit that some of his statements are over the top, but that shouldn't negate lots of helpful advice on how to become more productive.If a person is lacking in production and wants practical helps to change that - get this book. It greatly helped me with some advice that is now wired into my unconscious (the GOAL of any practical book - for guidance to become second nature).My wife and I do laugh at the picture of the writer on the back of the book. He's sort of making a half-smile/smirk and we joke that he's thinking \\"I don't have time for this picture - there's work to be done!\\"Anyway, it's cheap and helpful - buy it!"},{"Title":"Donahue My Own Story","review":"Phil Donahue, the number one syndicated television talk-show host in America, tells his own remarkable life story in this candid, entertaining, fast-paced autobiography, from his childhood in Cleveland during the 1940s to his present success with Donahue, the show watched daily by millions of loyal viewers in over 200 cities nationwide.Donahue begins by describing his mixed feelings about being a celebrity, examining \\"the special neuroses of famous people.\\" He recalls what it was like to grow up as an Irish Catholic in the atmosphere of pride and prejudice following World War II, writing humorously about his first fistfight, his first kiss (\\"the briefest and driest moment in all erotica\\") and his years at Notre Dame (\\"Living all week with George O'Donnell and being constantly surrounded by guys, at the 'caf,' in Cost Accounting class . . . everywhere . . . did more for weekend lust than a low-budget porno film\\").He recalls how for months after graduating from college he couldn't get a job in his field at all, and describes his early years as an announcer and radio and TV journalist in Adrian, Michigan, and Dayton, Ohio (\\"'. . . . Mrs. Nixon, you've had a number of proud moments in your life . . . ' and when I said 'proud' I spat right in her eye\\").Taking the reader onto the set of Donahue, he explains why audience participation is the most important part of his show, and talks about the moral contradictions of journalism and the realities of competition and success in the media (\\"In order to achieve in the marketplace you have to have a sizable ego -- I don't care if you are working for ITT, IBM, or GE. But it's especially true to that bunch of letters, CBS, NBC, and ABC\\"). He points out that the hardest lesson he had to learn in journalism was \\"the meaning of power on the job,\\" and is outspoken about the \\"TV Gatekeepers,\\" the men who run the over 700 stations in the United States and control what viewers see.Donahue is as candid about his personal life as he is about his career. He shares the pain of his separation and divorce, and his experiences as a single parent of four sons. He writes, too, about his disillusionment during the 1960s with the Catholic Church, and his discovery of his own inner faith and beliefs.Filled with colorful anecdotes about his show, Donahue is an intimate, moving and thought-provoking insight into the heart and soul of an immensely popular television personality who has a deep sense f compassion; a rare ability to grow, change, learn and admit to his own mistakes; great curiosity about people and ideas; and a burning passion for truth, human values and life."},{"Title":"Donahue My Own Story","review":"This is a sweeping look at a life spent confronting the most important issues modern man has struggled with.

Then I decided to search for \\"Phil\\" in the hopes of unearthing something more, or maybe something from before he went to Medical school and wasn't a Dr. (\\"Doctor\\") yet, when I unearthed this fascinating book about a person from television from before the current Phil. It is an enraging read and details his life from his early childhood and pets, through his rise through the ranks of local television up until his triumph and marriage to Rhoda from TV. Even though I was enthralled I was distracted by wondering what the real Dr. Phil was doing before he was a Dr. (detailed information is sketchy) so I was prevented from giving this the full 6 star rating. Even more interesting is that Oprah, Dr. Phil's best friend and confidante, apparantly ruined the television career of the earlier Phil, who originated her show. In a way, the triumph of another Phil must make Dr. Donahue proud. Buy this book. I got it for a penny, which is a decent deal to boot!"},{"Title":"The Secret Footprints","review":"Julia Alvarez has transformed the mythic Dominican tale of the Ciguapa into a lush, dramatic story for all audiences to appreciate. I was fortunate enough to hear Alvarez read her first children's book to 80 second graders at the Carol Morgan School of Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. The children as was this writer literally spellbound.The tale which is reminiscent of &quot;The Little Mermaid,&quot; is set in the Domincan Republic where the Ciguapas live in secret caves underwater. The Ciguapas, women with long black hair, only come out at night and walk backwards on land to fool their enemies. The littlest Ciguapa who is fond of humans, gets herself into a sticky situation and her &quot;secret&quot; is almost discovered by a young boy. Adults will not only learn more about these Caribbean &quot;creatures,&quot; but their children will learn more about tolerance."},{"Title":"The Secret Footprints","review":"There once lived a secret tribe of very beautiful creatures called ciguapas, underwater in &quot;cool blue caves hung with seashells and seaweed&quot;. They were terribly afraid of humans and came out on land only at night to hunt for food. They were convinced that if humans saw them, they would be captured, put in cages, studied by doctors and made to take baths and do laundry. They had one special attribute that kept them safe from humans. Their feet were backwards and when they walked, pointed in the opposite direction. Because of this, no human had ever been able to follow their footprints and their secret existence had remained safe. That is until one young ciguapa, named Guapa, became too curious and hunted before dark, meeting a surprisingly kind human family. And this curiousity almost led to the tribe's discovery..... Julia Alvarez retells a wonderful folk tale, that will charm and delight children of all ages. Her language, so full of imagery and magic, lets you feel the cool water and hot sun and hear the palms swaying in the breeze and the birds singing their favorite songs. Fabian Negrin's captivating, vibrant artwork compliments the story perfectly and takes you away to this very lush tropical island. The Secret Footprints is an enchanting tale, told by an accomplished storyteller and will make a wonderful addition to all home libraries."},{"Title":"Choices","review":"I thought the character development in Choices was brilliant.

And they were BAD.Awkward and amatuerish.There was one detailed illustration of an eye (showcased because I assume the author was proud of the drawing) and it was *wretched*. The eye was creepy-looking, the iris looked loopy, the pupil was lopsided and not round. (Irises and pupils are supposed to be *round*.) Come on. There is no excuse for an author of a drawing book to not understand this basic thing about the human eye. There's *especially* no excuse when this artist is writing a BOOK about drawing people! Give me a break. The other drawings of the face were also pretty horrid. Oh, I suppose they are marginally OK if you want to draw comic books, but *not* OK if you want to understand the actual anatomy and structure of the head.I don't doubt that there is some useful information about anatomy in this book. But I was completely turned off by the BAD drawings. So, only one star from me.There are plenty of other good anatomy books out there, written by artists who actually can draw well. (Burne Hogarth, George Bridgman, or Louis Gordon, for starters.) Try one of their books instead."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Really nice process for drawing the human body. Although earlier knowledge is necessary.Overall: Great book, a must have for every artist."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Like someone said before me, the problem with this book is that Hart never really fully explains to you, Okay, if this is in front of you, this is how you draw it step by step. Instead he disects the body parts and shows you his underdrawing and his finished drawing and says, that is how it looks. Which is isn't the worst way ever, but for a begining illustrator, he has skipped the steps on HOW to get there, which is the most important part. Also, this isn't the book to get if your going for photo realism. Many of his models reflect his work in the comic book industry and the faces definetly show it. The book isn't bad by any means and people can learn a lot from it (and the price is definetly right), but I wish he would have dived more in depth and shown us step by step how to draw from life. If your expecting that, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I was somwhat dissapointed in the artwork in this book.I guess I expected more from the artist. The instruction in this book is rather simple and straight forward,I did like that. However there was something lacking in the over all quality. This book is probably alright for the artist just picking up thier pencils for the first time."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Struggling with drawing the human figure and looking for easy answers I was suckered into buying this book by the positive reviews. It's one of the weakest drawing instructionals I've ever seen. It's style is heroic comic book. That's not bad in itself, as you can learn a lot of proportion and foreshortening from good line art. The problem, besides poor drawing, is the lessons(?) go something like this: draw a circle, now divide that into thirds and \\"poof\\", here's the finished drawing! No real instruction, no real system. I found this book useless and even embarrassing to have on the bookshelf. There is no easy answer to drawing the human figure except drawing the human figure and learning from your mistakes. Don't bother with this book, there are better instructions out there."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I have no idea why I bot this book. I thought it was going to be a good anatomy book at the least. Basically it's very cartoony, think Titan A.E. This person can't draw so well either, A normal Figure drawer is better. He seams to draw some people too stubby on the legs and the crotch area too low on women. He can't draw manga style either, he draws them to cheap or to stiff. The artist needs to go back to school and do some studies on human anatomy. It also looks like he needs some art lessons too. I would have given this book 2 stars and a half but I decided to round down. Basically as a figure drawer I would be embarrassed to draw like this person, I think he should study lighting, photography, Animation(So his characters wont be so stiff), and figure drawing. Basically if you want a real anatomy book I suggest you buy \\"Dynamic Anatomy\\" by Burne Hogarth and don't make the mistake like I did on buying this book."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This book is an excellent compilation of advice, techniques, and tips combined in a useful format that, simply shows how to draw the human body.Don't expect any repetitious &quot;boxes and balls&quot; lessons here. This is a book with detailed deconstructions of the nose, examples of eyebrows, advice on visualizing perspective, muscle groups, and more.This isn't a complete book, in my mind - you'll need some artistic skill and experience to get use out of it. However if you have that, or if you're studying a beginning-drawing book, this is an invaluable purchase."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This book is a very good exposition of human anatomy for the artist. It includes sections on skeletal structure, musculature, flexation, and how various poses are affect the illustrating of a human figure. This is not a book on how to draw a likeness of someone in particular but a good study on the human body and a foundation of it's structure and illustration. If you are looking to draw a likeness then it is still valuable as a basic understanding of anatomy but there are better choices.The book is a good buy for those who are interested in learning underlying anatomy in order to create accurate and detailed illustrations. It is a good buy and I'm sure will be a regular reference for me."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Christopher Hart's book can be an incredibly good way to begin one's study of anatomy. He describes everything VERY simply...for example the difference in the curvature of the male &amp; female forehead, and the relative thickness of the knuckle parts of the hand. I do not think that this book is meant to be used as the be-all, end-all of one's study of anatomy. But it is extremely readable and makes many significant points that stick in your mind very quickly.I REALLY wish I had had it in childhood, when I drew &amp; drew &amp; was wishing for instruction. I think that once one has absorbed this book, one is better primed for taking on other, more extensive anatomy books without becoming overwhelmed.But ultimately, it comes down to your own personal learning style. Some people would prefer to start right away with a very artful and extremely detailed approach. This book is more shorthand, but actually covers many essentials. And for me, this is the book that makes further study accessible. Remember that one could always go deeper &amp; deeper into the study of anatomy, many artists spent their lives on it."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy is a very good exposition of human anatomy for the illustrator.

If you are looking to draw a likeness then it is still valuable as a basic understanding of anatomy but there are better book choices. While the book is filled with illustrations that are very helpful they often fall just a little short of being as useful as they could be. For example, when drawing the human face it has some good metrics such as noting that when drawing the eyes the distance from one side of the head to the other is approximately the same as five times the width of the eyes, the eyes are approximately in the middle of the head and similar items. Yet it fails to not other very basic items. While it shows that the head is not circular it does not provide any metric for how tall it is in relation to width. Other books note that it is generally about 1.5 times taller than wide. In short it does a good job with what it has in it but just isn't quite as complete as it should be. Still, the book is a good buy for those who are interested in learning underlying anatomy in order to create accurate and detailed illustrations."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"As an amature artist, I picked this up to provide some instruction in drawing the human figure. The first quarter of the book (dealing with the face and facial features) didn't impress me. Too cartoonish for my taste, frankly. However, the following sections - especially on proportion and foreshortening, perspective, and negative space were extremely helpful. The book is not without its faults, but overall I have found it instructive."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"First, I would like to say that this book is aimed at the non-professional, amateur artist who needs to learn correct anatomy. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a 'how to' book. As an amateur artist myself, I have looked for a book that would help me understand the basic anatomy of the human body.With 520 muscles in the body, it seemed a little overkill to have descriptions of all of them - even the ones no one sees. Despite what some other reviewers have said, I personally have found Mr. Hart's book very useful and educational. There is nothing in the book that would cause anyone to pursue any particular style. There are no 'style' teachings in the book. Merely good depictions of musculature, skeletal structure and close-ups of problem areas for the average artist struggling with anatomy. I have reviewed quite a few anatomy books, some of them quite in-depth, and decided on this one for its ease of use and practicality.The drawings are very useful and the order in which the material is presented is well thought out. Granted, Mr. Hart is a cartoonist by trade, but he does know his anatomy. This book is easy to understand and makes anatomy a joy.If you want something more in-depth, buy 'Gray's Anatomy'. If you want something that will teach you the basics of anatomy without anatomical overload, do yourself a favor and buy a copy of 'Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy'"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This is definitely a good little book on anatomy for artists; I learned some new things from it, and I've been picking up anatomy tips a few years now. It's easy to follow and helps makes things less confusing. It also has some great concepts in here that a lot of beginners might not know about.However, though it's easy to follow, I don't think anyone should depend heavily upon it, or even start off with this book. The drawings are still very simplified (think Disney animation style, but with a bit more detail added), and some illustrations don't even look right to me (like the bottom illustration on p 103).But I think this would be a great supplement to Jack Hamm's book &quot;Drawing the Head and Figure&quot; and Ron Tiner's book &quot;Figure Drawing without a Model.&quot;This book also would have been improved by the addition of different body types, as well (as in Ron Tiner's book).But all in all, a recommended book -- just don't depend on it, kay?"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"...You are an artist who is looking to draw more realistic human figures. I've only recently purchased this book, but already I can tell that it's a wonderful resource for someone like me. I've been drawing for years, but have never studied human anatomy or figure drawing. I was looking for a way to make my human figures more life-like and realistic, and I think this book is the key.The author assumes that you already know how to draw, at least as far as making lines and shading. His examples are all done in pencil, though I intend to convert his lessons to a digital medium, which I think will translate nicely. It is really more of a quick resource book, with a lot of examples, breakdowns, and illustrations to help you visualize your figure. There's not a lot of text that bogs it down, just illustrations with simple explanations.The only criticism I have is that Hart uses the male figure, especially the face, throughout most of the book. It would have been nice to see more female faces divided into steps, just for reference.But all in all, 'Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy' is perfect for the intermediate artist who doesn't have the patience to wade through pages and pages of traditional anatomy, and is looking for a way to enhance what they already know about the human figure, though even beginners will find useful information on the building of the human body in two dimensions."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"My first impression of this book was not good. It looked too simple or dumbed down to be really useful. A second look gave me a different impression. This is a well done and well thought out book for beginners. If you are going to a real 4 year art school, I do not recommend this. But if you are looking to understand basic anatomy and the figure in motion, you'll find easy to understand anatomy lessons as well as a lot of tips and tricks for drawing that are often overlooked. These are the shortcuts that are really essential for amateurs and casual sketchers. A great choice for a beginners core library."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I got into drawing again and I picked up this book after reading a lot of other books that go into so much detail of the anatomy. Detail you don't really need. The drawings were easy to learn from and it allowed me to do my own thing and not feel like I had to copy what was in the book. The simplicity of the drawings allowed you to see the basics of the anatomy and give you the confidence to go out and draw someone else. But this book is more for the animator and cartoonist who needs to learn the basics of human anatomy before going into cartooning. If you're an artist and like that detail of lighting and shadows this is not the right book for you."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"The drawings are wayyyyy old school. Nothing like the comic book looks yyou see now. It reminds me of that old school superman show where he jumps on a trampoline and then flies into the air. So for the guys body it's very old school western muscular (so not very. not much of a six pack and stuff)i would have loved this book if he had used the drawing style of some of his other books!"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Hart omits a lot of the detail found in many other anatomy texts. But If you've found other artists' anatomy books to be too technical or light on practical advice then give this book a read. It strips human anatomy down to what's truly relevant for figure drawing and throws in many useful nuggets for checking your work. The result is very accessible and useful for budding figure artists.I almost didn't pick this book up because I haven't got much out of the (few) other Christopher Hart books I've read. I'm glad I gave it a chance. In fact, if I had a friend that wanted to learn figure drawing I would recommend this book as a first pick-up."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"The problem with this book is that you don't really learn anything about drawing anatomy. He just says 'This is what this looks like or 'This is looks like that w/o giving any real tips. Like all of Hart's books he just makes you &quot;think&quot; that you've learned something."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I found this book to be rather disappointing. It focuses on comic book style illustration which isn't bad in itself, but the book teaches almost nothing usefull about propotions, muscles, the skeletal struture, or how these affect what you draw.If your looking for an anatomy book along the same lines as this one(comic book style), I would recommend &quot;How To Draw Manga: Bodies and Anatomy&quot;."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"While I am sure that this book isn't the equivalent of years or artistic training, I recognize that it's not supposed to be. This book is amazing. Before I bought this book I had never drawn in my life and the first thing I drew using this book, a man's face turned out actually looking like a mans face! I had expected to be frustrated with the stick figure I would inevitably draw, but it was actually a good picture. Now as I get further and further into the book I can see my skills and understanding of the body improving dramatically. If you are looking to draw GET THIS BOOK. If you are an experienced artist of twenty years this book may not be neccessary, but I would take a look at it anyway espeicially if you are a teacher.Once more, GET THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"The trouble in finding a good &quot;tips&quot; book on anatomy is that they are so inexpertly drawn, and Christopher Hart's book falls in that category. It has a few tips, but the drawings are linear with no volume or texture. The worst is that the origins of the muscles are never right because the artwork isn't substantial enough. I agree with the first reviewer. I,too, was robbed of my money. The man can't draw!To have a first rate anatomy book, I recommend Loise Gordon's 'How to Draw the Human Figure: An Anatomical Approach' which delivers everything that Hart promized but failed to do. Gordon's drawings are simply the best in the field. Get the other two books by her, and your'e set to study anatomy seriously. In addition I find the book 'Artistic Anatomy,' by Dr. Paul Richer, a good reference manual."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I have read many books about drawing human anatomy and as the author states they are dry and complicated. I was caught in a rut and this book brought me out of it. I especially was impressed with the focus on drawing the face and the focus on the various muscles when drawing a full body sketch. Go out and get this book. You can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This guy is a one-note player! Oversimplified with too much of the artist's own personal style injected into it. It's a starter book, for goodness' sake, so there must be a bit more impartiality to the drawings to get the basics down! In addition, there are certain rules to drawing humans that are missed in this book. This guy is cutting artistic corners all over the place, drawing symbolically and not literally. It's on the level of bad 1990's cartoons. Come on! I was robbed (well, for a couple nights until I returned it)."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"this book isnt the worst but it isnt the best either, when i bought it i was just looking for a good anatomy book because i im a aspiring comic book artist at age 15 and i needed to understand the anatomy of the body.this book mainly assisted me on small simple things but it just didnt get into any depth or major detail so there were things incomplete in this book. if your a beginner this might be ok to start off with since its just simple.Or if your like me and you want to learn the anatomy full throttle than dont get this book get something more detailed. so two stars because its just ok the art is alright and the info is pretty informative (you can learn a little from this book) but id say get something with more detail for a better and more convincing understanding also more convincing artwork (oh and im a boy dont mind the name at the top)"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"this book is not helpful to anyone who is a serious artist. if you want to get good at drawing, want to learn more about anatomy, get an anatomy book. this book is suited for people who don't really care about anatomy, and just want to know enough to scrape by.I did not like this book."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I own this book for just 2 days, and after reading a first chapter I have to admit that IT IS AMAZING book! Right after reading I started to draw( I am not a proffesionall, and I do not go to art school, do not take any art classes, just started to draw about two month ago)and I CAN SEE the improvment I made. Everybody who saw what I draw said that I improveied. I suggest you buy this book before any other ones, and read it, and do not even think- yes, or no- just buy it and you will be pleased with all articles and illustration he put in this book. Very easy, and clear he explanes anatomy. Just what you need to know. Then, all you have left to do- is practising!!!!"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I love Chris Hart. And in a lot of his newer books he's much better than his old 2004 books. And since I love Chris' stuff, my mom bought me this or Christmas. And I've got to say this book is absolutely terrible. The first section was on the human face and it was really bad. The book didn't even properly focus on female anatomy, in fact it didn't at all, other than som random half nudes in weird positions. I suppose it's alright for details like male muscles and such, but I was looking for basic anatomy. I really would rather have his 'Figure It Out!' book because I need to know how to pose my characters, etc. I'm not a beginner, and I'm no professional, but my skill set is higher than the content of this book.I would recommend this as an accompaniment to another anatomy book for details, but you should not buy this for any other reason. I don't think it would help beginners or the advanced."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This book is wonderful for getting a good grip on the understanding of anatomy basics. My only criticism is that in some places the drawings were a little off - like a hand that looked like it was being bent backwards but was drawn like it was coming forward. But on the whole, the book was instructive."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This anatomy book is a great reference for understanding complicated anatomical forms so any artist can draw surface anatomy.This book takes the guess work out of the question what are all those details on the figure in clear, easy to understand studies.It is a must for figure artists everywhere."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I've taking drawing classes for while now, but this book was the most helpful and advanced me more then any other teacher or class.

I've overcome some creative roadblocks as a result of this book. The beauty of this is that some of the things I learned, I thought I excelled in.

Very enjoyable and challenging at the same time!"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Every summer I want to learn how to draw better, and I check out a truckload of anatomy books from the library. Of the ten books I checked out this week, this was the only one that I could read without falling asleep! Unlike the other books with descriptions on every tiny bone and muscle we'll never see in action in drawings, this book covers things that really matter. The first part of the book about facial features was not very real - everything was too cartoonish, especially the chunky noses. However, this part did have some useful tips, almost enough to make this section worth reading.There are some sections that could have been explained in more detail, as the book is mostly simple but effective drawings and descriptions or explanations in easy to understand words, but he makes concepts like foreshortening a little easier to grasp (which I love!)Overall, this is a nice book to have. If you're looking for something with longer descrptions and more detailed examples and diagrams, this might not be the book for you. I do recommend it though!"},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This is a great book to help a striving artist learn basic anatomy. Although I find it necessary to also have Burne Hogarth's &quot;Dynamic Anatomy&quot;, this book makes a nice companion for a simpler approach. It's more of a book about &quot;don't bother about ALL the bones and muscles, I'll just teach you about the ones you see when looking at a person and drawing them.&quot; I found it very helpful, but wouldn't use it alone as my only anatomy book."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"Chris Hart&quot;s book HUMAN ANATOMY MADE AMAZINGLY EASY is a invaluable resource to artists who need to know anatomical landmarks.

A great book."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This books has a very specific function, and is not for everyone. I would reccomend this book for any casual artists who want to draw cartoon or comic-book / manga style art, and need to reference a basic anatmony.This books is NOT for people who want to do realistic art. This books is NOT for someone who wants to draw a specfic style of art (i.e. how to draw manga). This books is NOT for people who needs to learn how to draw from the ground up.This books is best suited to casual artiststs / fan artists who already have an idea of how to draw, and already have their own style, but need a reference for simplified anatomy seen in comic books and manga."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I found this book to be a very good reference for everything below the neck. There are a few places where the drawing look a bit off, and also where the figures look very geometric from Hart's shading. The feet section wasn't particularly helpful. I learned more drawing my own foot, than trying to understand what he was teaching.The head section, although containing helpful hints, seemed rather complex, compared to what I've been taught in life drawing classes. Also, I don't think there was enough time spent on drawing the head at an angle upwards or downwards, or even tilted to one side. There were a few drawings, which weren't very well done, and some unhelpful tips, but nothing of any value.Overall, I'd give the head section a three, and the section on the body a five, but it's also not the most fabulous book on artistic anatomy. It is a valuable reference, but don't let it be your only one."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"I admit this book is a lot better than I thought it would be.I'm glad I didn't pay the nay sayers any mind.Though I have decent drawing skills not good enough to be considered a master but not a beginner either.I still think in order to improve your Artistic understanding of anatomy this book is a good start in the right direction though I still recommend you draw people who are willing to model for you or take a life drawing class if you are of age."},{"Title":"Human Anatomy Made Amazingly Easy","review":"This book is very helpful and educational. It may seem a bit advanced for some individuals, but can be enjoyed by almost anyone who enjoyes drawing the human body.The children learned about Leonardo da Vinci in school and wanted to experiment with the human body.

The pictures and the items featured in them are bright, colorful, large and easily decipherable. There is a certain amount of charm with the pastel style, abstract page design that makes up Milet. Topics in here are pretty basic for these beginner style picture dictionaries: zoo animals, body parts, furniture, food, colors, numbers, etc.If you're a parent that reads and speaks Mandarin or Cantonese and wants to read a picture reference book to your child, Milet is just a good a choice than Usbourne's 1000 First Words in Chinese. In fact, I can argue Milet is a bit better since the pictures are a lot larger and more simple compared to Stephen Cartwright's Where's Waldo style drawings. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen Cartwright and Usbourne's 1000 words/100 words series, but if I had a young child or toddler, Milet would be easier on their eyes and not as overwhelming with content.If you're learning Chinese as a second language, then the lack of pinyin may frustrate you but definitely give this book a chance if you're at a late beginner, early intermediate stage. You'll have to work a harder to memorize and recognize characters in the book, but you have to just accept that not all Chinese text are accompanied with pinyin and you will one day have to learn to walk without it. Yes, it can be frustrating but look at Milet not as a \\"easy to use\\" reference guide and more of a text you have to memorize and read off the page. This would be a good first step in building basic character recognition and expanding your vocabulary."},{"Title":"South of Haunted Dreams","review":"How do I type a sigh? If you I could figure that out, I would probably type two or three sentences worth. Since it looks like I'm the first person reviewing this book on Amazon, I might as well tell you what it's about before I comment on it.This is a work of creative non-fiction about a black man who grew up around whites in the North and decides to take a motorcycle trip to the South to find his roots and face the, what he initially believes, ongoing oppression of the black people by the white man. Even though he's never personally faced much racism, he feels the weight of a long oppressed people on his shoulders and is somehow compelled to go to the South and face it head on. The book is essentially a travelogue, with both a physical and mental journey going on, so we slowly see how his perceptions change as he comes to know what the South is actually like.That doesn't sound so bad, right? Indeed the idea of the story isn't bad at all, and the writing is pretty good too - it's no Steinbeck mind you, but it's easy to read and flows well. The problem is that the narrator is just so dang angry for most of the book. Quite literally, the first 100 pages are an angry rant of all the horrible things that have happened in the (surprisingly recent) past. Yes, some horrible things have happened and, yes, horrible things continue to happen, but we get the idea that you're pissed from the first 5 pages of the book - another 95 pages doesn't drive the point home anymore than it already has. Even when that anger has mellowed out a bit, it still seems to pop back up over and over. An example of this is the narrator meets some white folk, a number of different times, who he expects to be mean and bigoted, but turn out to be super nice to him, and even though he's like \\"I've completely changed my mind about what the South is,\\" he goes right back to where he was before at the beginning of the next chapter. It's not till the very end of the book that he really mellows out, and by that point you're just fed up with him.Another issue that I had is that the story is far too focused on the narrator's opinion of things. We're supposed to be going on this journey with the guy, but he seems more interested in convincing us his own personal agenda than taking us along for a journey of self-discovery. In fact, the story seems to be more of a personal soapbox than, well, a story.The thing that gets me, though, is that I really really wanted to like the book. The author actually came to our English class for a couple days and he seems like a really interesting person. He's not at all angry in real life (this book was written 20 years ago, so maybe he was angry back then) and it seems like he has all these great stories he could tell. Perhaps his more recent work is better - it's only published in France, in French, where he now lives - but I don't really have any interest after this book. Anyway, I got my book signed by him, which is neat, but I didn't really care for the book, which is too bad...Overall, while this isn't anywhere near the worst book I've ever read, it's still not very good. Perhaps some people will enjoy it, but I sure didn't.

The book Between Past and Future: The Revolutions of 1989 and Their Aftermath, edited by Sorin Antohi and Vladimir Tismaneanu and published by Central European University Press resulted from the excellent papers presented at that conference which, it may be argued, was the conference dedicated to the revolutions of 1989 and the first decade that followed. The names of the authors present in the volume reveal not only the high level of the debates, but also the scholarly interest in the events that put an end to a divided Europe. The book is organized on four major sections/topics and a concluding chapter: (1) \\"Meanings of 1989: Present Significance of the Past,\\" which contains studies and essays authored by Agnes Heller, Jacques Rupnik, Karol Soltan, Jeffrey C. Isaac, and Sorin Antohi; (2) \\"Winners and Losers in the Great Transformation,\\" with contributions by Adam Michnik, Martin Palous, Valerie Bunce, and Vladimir Tismaneanu; (3) \\"Vulnerabilities of the New Democracies,\\" with contributions by Katherine Verdery, Gail Kligman and Susan Gal, Kazimierz Z. Poznanski, Istvan Rev, Miklos Haraszti, and Ivan Vejvoda and (4) \\"The New Europe: Prospects for Cooperation and Conflict\\" with contributions by Karen Dawisha, Bartlomiej Kaminski, Ilya Prizel, Jeffrey N. Wasserstrom and Irena Grudzinska Gross. The final section, \\"Past, Present, Future,\\" is a concluding essay by Timothy Garton Ash. Considering the relative high number of contributions to the volume, a comprehensive analysis of each study/essay cannot be made. However, it is important to stress that the variety of the arguments, ideas, and demonstrations provided by the contributors reveals the theoretical richness and originality of the scholarship focusing on the 1989 revolutions. Those interested in the collapse of communism and the 1989 revolutions will find different approaches to the 1989 events and the subsequent transitions to a real democracy. Unfortunately, there is not a unique, valid explanation for what happened in East-Central Europe in 1989. As Garton Ash rhetorically put it, \\"Ten years on, what do we know?\\" His answer, \\"we know more about the consequences\\" contains the elements that make of 1989 a fascinating object of research. Although we now know a great deal about 1989, those events are still mysterious and captivating. The contributors to the present volume have succeeded in convincing us that the fascination of 1989 remains intact."},{"Title":"The Malvina Reynolds songbook","review":"My family and I had the privilege of attending a concert and meeting Malvina in 1975-76. She was a warm, friendly lady who had a strong opinion about the plight of disenfranchised people and unhealthy conditions in the United States. She sang about anything that adversely affected folks who felt they had no voice. Although she had earned her Phd (1936), she did not forget those who, for whatever reason, could not, or were afraid to, speak for themselves. Many of her songs became popular with the noted folksingers of America. &quot;Turn Around&quot; was recorded by Harry Belafonte; &quot;Little Boxes&quot; by Pete Seeger. Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Judy Collins recorded her songs. Along with the social protest songs she wrote many songs for children, one of the most poignant being &quot;Magic Penny&quot;, a simple song about sharing love. She wrote about giggleworms, turtles, rabbits, pets, the rain, etc. Its a great album, of great music, by a great lady. I would suggest to anyone purchasing this CD to also do some research about the great lady herself.6 March 2001"},{"Title":"Whales and Other Creatures of the Sea (Pictureback(R))","review":"This book has excellent pictures and information.

It deals with 3 Tennessee racers who make it to the big time stock car racing world by running at the first Daytona race held at the Speedway.The story kept my attention, and the history and characters, both real and fictional, held my interest.I can't wait for #3."},{"Title":"Road to Daytona (Rolling Thunder Stock Car Racing)","review":"I thought White Lightning was great, but the authors had to pack a lot into it to get to Jodell's first big race by the end of the book. With all that background out of the way, in Road to Daytona they can concentrate, for the most part, on the minute details of a single race. That level of detail really gives the reader the sense that they are there, watching the story unfold in front of them, instead of just reading words on a page.This book particularly gave me insight into the tasks the pit crew has to do. Before, on the rare occasions that I would watch a race, I would think it wasn't that big a deal, filling a car with gas as fast as they could. Novice that I was, I couldn't understand why the tires needed to be changed so often, or the pressures the pit crews work under. Now, when I watch the race, I'm almost as fascinated watching the pit crews work as I am when the cars are on the track.Just as welcome are the subplots dealing with the personal lives of the characters. Make no mistake: this is a series about stock car racing, but I find myself just as interested in seeing what happens to Jodell Lee and Cathy as I am in finding out who wins the race.Finally, I appreciate the way the authors work in historical information about racing without seeming overly pedantic. They make it seem like part of the story, rather than shoehorning in a history lesson.Overall, Rolling Thunder is a really fun series, and the authors promise that it'll just keep getting better."},{"Title":"Indycar 1995-1996 Official Yearbook: Off Ppg","review":"The Autocourse book series is the best coverage of indy car racing, without having to buy a ticket to the race. Each book has extensive team coverage, and the added technical aspects that each book includes is incredible. The 1995 book is the last issue, before the C.A.R.T./I.R.L split. This book includes what many consider the last great year of American based racing with all of its top drivers. This year was also the last before the Target race team dynasty started. Great information for any race fan"},{"Title":"Indycar 1995-1996 Official Yearbook: Off Ppg","review":"For those outside the loop of racing, NASCAR garners a great deal of attention. Lost in all the attention paid to that series is a great style of racing collectively known as \\"open wheel\\" or \\"Champ Car.\\" The series has evolved over the years but one thing has always remained. The races are fast, exciting and very competitive. How exciting? Put 800+ horsepower in a 1,600lb car that stands at knee level and enjoy the fun! If you are a fan - new or old - this series from Autocourse is a must-have. Autocourse started doing yearbooks 40+ years ago for the Formula One Grand Prix series and they have grown to include Champ Cars. They offer a tremendous amount of detail about the teams, drivers, cars, technical advances, etc. They also showcase the support series and the up-and-coming drivers in them. Each race is covered in detail with all qualifying times and finishing spots as well as highlights of the event itself. Photography is 100% incredible. That's another point. I enjoy doing my own photography and sometimes it's easy to lose track of things, especially if you don't get the film developed for a while. This book offers tremendous resource materials for someone maintaining photo albums of the events themselves. Basically, if you have a question about this style of racing, you'll find it in this book. On another note, this edition specifically covers arguably one of the greatest Indy 500 finishes of all time."},{"Title":"Sesame Street police station (Elmo's neighborhood)","review":"One in a series of board books that take Elmo through a number of varying adventures while he looks for the little lost black doggy.

This was on my Kindle so I don't know if the actual book itself has the same description but it gave away too much of the book. So the entire time I am reading the book I know how it's going to end and I keep thinking to myself, get to the point already.The second thing that I didn't care for was the overly done Norman Rockwellian descriptions of everything. Descriptions of people (at least two) down to their footwear. It seemed like all of this was done to paint a picture of a town and family that isn't realistic something more like a catalog picture of how things should look but never really do. The main character himself seemed shallow, in the book he is around the age of 27(?) and he acts more like a 17 year old, just very self absorbed.Sorry to pick apart this book...there are obviously others that really liked it but I just don't see the fuss."},{"Title":"The Christmas List","review":"This book was just okay.

This is a book that Machen cites in his classic, so it gives you a sense of how old it is, but it is quite useful. This is the smallest Greek text book I have ever seen (it literally fits in one's back pocket) but the font for a lot of it is really not too small, so it is a useful text to carry around. It contains all of 1 John, the Lord's Prayer and 1 Cor 13, so on top of everything else it can be used for a tYPE of portable NT Greek prayer book. It has the complete grammar and seems to actually use the same paradigm charts that Machen would later use. The exercises are all from the NT but are short and the glosses are kept to a minimum. I would recommend this as a type of review/portable resource for someone who already owns Machen or Mounce or Summers."},{"Title":"Le Balcon","review":"Dans un bordel de luxe, les phantasmes les plus scabreux des clients sont exauc&eacute;s par Madame Irma.

Having been born into the rural farm country of Wisconsin, many of Mr. Wright's architectural ideas emerged from that rolling country and its beautiful rivers and views.Many who admire Fallingwater will be intrigued to compare the views of the Wisconsin river at Taliesin (\\"shining brow\\" in Welsh) with the stunning sights in the Alleghenies. Mr. Wright was working at Taliesin when he sketched his first drawings of Fallingwater. The land is steeper at Fallingwater, and the waterfall at Taliesin was originally there to provide power. Many of the principles of the two sites are otherwise similar in striking ways that will give you a deeper understanding of Mr. Wright's work.The highlight of this book comes in the wonderful color photography that will probably inspire you to want to visit (in the summer time) to enjoy the hundreds of acres of grounds and the many architectural features that Mr. Wright designed there. Many may not know about his windmill tower that the local farmers predicted would not survive high winds, but which continues to beautifully grace the site.I was fascinated to see original photographs of Taliesin and its surroundings while Mr. Wright was working there, as well as the views from today. Like a lot of Mr. Wright's work, the romantic idealization of his vision has proceeded quite far. But we will still enjoy it, even if it has evolved from the original.Having seen this book, I have decided to make a pilgrimage to Taliesin. I have been to Taliesin West many times, and have enjoyed that wonderful Wright work very much. Taliesin West is located in Scottsdale, Arizona and was Mr. Wright's refuge from the cold Wisconsin winters in his later years.After you enjoy the beauty and the history of Taliesin in this fine volume, I suggest that you think about the place where you were born. How has it shaped your vision? In my case, my home was nestled in a small valley surrounded by enormous mountains. It was natural to want to aspire to climb to great heights upon considering that monumental view every day.Take the best from your heritage and share it with those whom it will help!"},{"Title":"COBRA","review":"&quot;Cobra - the most deadly guerrilla warriors mankind has ever produced.&quot; The Cobra series are based on the lives of the Moreau generations. The first book, &quot;Cobra&quot;, is about the life of Johnny Moreau, one of the first Cobras.The alien Troft forces have taken over the colony worlds of Adirondack and Silvern. Outnumbered and on the defensive, the humans on Earth make a decision to not atttack the aliens from space, but on the ground. Thus the Cobra units were created, a guerilla force whose weapons and other devices are surgically implanted, invisible to the human eye yet deadly. When Johnny Moreau signs up for the army, he is surprised to be among the few to be made into Cobras. He is sent to Adirondack to fight the Trofts. But being a Cobra isn't at all what Johnny expects it to be, and must learn the uses and abuses of his abilities. From Trainee to Warrior, Veteran to Loyalist, then finally to become from Politician to Statesman, Johnny will learn what it really is to become... a Cobra.Timothy Zahn is truly one of my most favorite Science Fiction writers and &quot;Cobra&quot; is a truly good example of one of his best books. I love all the twists and turns in the plot, so many surprises at every corner. And I really liked the character of Johnny Moreau. He is smart, thoughtful, and always tried to help others. I felt so sorry for him when he returned home after the war. Everyone was afraid of him and despised him for being a Cobra. Another of my favorite characters in the books is Cally Halloran, another Cobra from Johnny's unit.As I said, this is the first book of the Cobra Series. The next books are &quot;Cobra Strike&quot; and &quot;Cobra Bargain&quot;. &quot;Cobra Strike&quot; is about Johnny's son, Justin Moreau, who becomes a Cobra and is sent on a dangerous mission to an unknown planet. &quot;Cobra Bargain&quot; is about the daughter of Justin whose dream of becoming the first woman Cobra comes true. Though these books are very hard to find, if you can get them, I'm sure you'll love them!"},{"Title":"COBRA","review":"This 1985 military science fiction novel introduced the cybernetically and biomechanically-enhanced \\"Cobra\\" soldiers, and is the first book in a series of six - two trilogies written a quarter of a century apart.The first trilogy consists of:1) Cobra, published 1985, story begins in 24032)Cobra Strike, published 1986, set a generation later3)Cobra Bargain, published 1988, set in 2474.Much more recently Zahn has revisited this series to produce a second set of three books known as the \\"Cobra War\\" trilogy, which is set another generation later (the heroine of \\"Cobra Bargain\\" is the mother of one of the main characters in the Cobra War books). This consists of4)Cobra War Book 1: Cobra Alliance5)Cobra War Book 2: Cobra Guardian6)Cobra War Book 3: Cobra Gamble(Due for publication in 2012).\\"Cobra\\" and \\"Cobra Strike\\" were also published together in one volume as \\"Cobras Two\\" and the first three books are also available in one volume as theCobra Trilogy.As this book begins, some four hundred years in the future and many light years away on the frontier of human space, a group of human colony worlds are under attack from an aggressive alien race known as the Troft. The first planet they attacked was over-run in only three weeks. In a desperate attempt to stop the invaders, the Dominion of Man creates the enhanced \\"Cobra\\" guerillas: the name stands for COmputerised Body Reflex Armament.The Cobras are indistinguishable from a normal human from the outside, but with a whole host of computer-controlled weaponry and enhancements built into their bodies and their very bones. These soldiers are deadly in combat but the process of turning a normal human into a Cobra is irreversible - which means that those who survive the war will have all manner of problems returning to civilian life afterwards. The novels examine some of the personal and social consequences of turning people into supermen - have they given up their own humanity to save humankind?\\"Cobra\\" tells the story of Jonny Moreau, who is one of the first generation of Cobra guerillas, from the point when he joins up as a young man a few months after the first Troft attack, through his time as a front-line solider, until thirty years later, as a senior political leader on his home planet, Aventine, Jonny has to make a choice - whether to buy peace at the price of cutting both the Cobras and the world of Aventine off from the remainder of the human race.This book and the other two novels in the original \\"Cobra\\" trilogy are reasonably well-written, entertaining, and exciting. Having been published in the eighties during the early days of Timothy Zahn's writing career, I don't personally feel that they are in the same league as the best of the brilliant novels which he has produced over the following decades.If you read the first three Cobra novels expecting anything like \\"Warhorse,\\" \\"Deadman Switch, \\"The Icarus Hunt\\" or any of the \\"Grand Admiral Thrawn\\" books set in the \\"Star Wars\\" universe, you may be disappointed.Nevertheless if you are into Military SF it is extremely likely that you will enjoy these books, and you will also find that some of the ideas in them appear to have inspired a number of more recent books by other popular SF writers."},{"Title":"COBRA","review":"Book Info: Genre: Military Science-fiction Reading Level: AdultDisclosure: I received the 6th book in the series (or 3rd book in the 2nd trilogy) in exchange for an honest review; I have purchased these earlier books on my own, but am happy to provide an honest review anyway.Synopsis: Earth's only hope was the COBRAs.The colony worlds Adirondack and Silvern fell to the Troft forces almost without a struggle. Outnumbered and on the defensive, Earth made a desperate decision. It would attack the aliens not from space, but on the ground - with forces the Trofts did not even suspect.Thus were created the Cobras, a guerilla force whose weapons were surgically implanted, invisible to the unsuspecting eye yet undeniably deadly. But power brings temptation...and not all the Cobras could be trusted to fight for Earth alone. Jonny Moreau would learn the uses - and abuses - of his special abilities, and what it truly meant to be a COBRA.My Thoughts: Timothy Zahn follows a fairly typical military science-fiction meme in this story - the military creates a superman to win a war, and when that superman goes back home, he's ... not welcomed. He's considered dangerous, and then the government has to find a way to keep the superman out of the view of the ordinary citizens who, of course, want to destroy that which they do not understand.I know military science-fiction is not for everyone, but it's a genre I've learned to enjoy. There is always a lesson buried underneath the action - or not so buried, in the case of Zahn's work. Although every time the soldiers are called Cobras I had to giggle a bit, thinking of G.I. Joe. I wasn't sure whether to be offended or amused over the fact that, apparently, even in the 25th century Zahn couldn't see women in the military. Being as I hate being offended all the time, I decided to be amused at his old-school ways.An interesting and well-written piece of military science-fiction, taken into account the fact that it was originally written in the mid-1980s. If you enjoy military science-fiction, then be sure to check out Zahn's Cobra series."},{"Title":"COBRA","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, and I consider it to be one of the best SF books (series) I've ever read.

First, it stands as an insightful series of performance criticism; she is especially illuminating in her dissection of the cultural and sexual implications in the uncovering of the Rose Theatre, in which Christopher Marlowe often had his plays performed. At times, however, the book itself becomes a forum for performance itself, most vividly and movingly in &quot;Shattered Skulls&quot;, where, as many times in the book, the narrative turns into a first person perspective, although this first person is not quite Phelan herself. With the juxtaposition of thses two elements, Phelan effectively traces and exposes the inherent performance tropes which both infuse and infect out everyday relations.This meager review cannot adequately describe the shimmering beauty of Phelan's prose and her laser-sharp insight. I cannot recommed it highly enough."},{"Title":"Faith Killer","review":"Josh Webster, Faith Killer (Zebra, 1991)The best thing about this book by a longshot is the title. If you pick it up, just stare at the cover for a while, then put it down and walk away. Because once you're inside, you'll find there's nothing worth having.Faith Killer is a serial killer novel written from the point of view of someone very, very heavily involved in 12-step programs. So much so that his characters veer off into long mental dissections of how horrible their lives were before coming to 12-step Nirvana. So much so that the good guy and the bad guy actually have a confrontation on treatment methods for addicts. No, people, I can't make this stuff up. To top things off, the &quot;mystery&quot; of who the killer is is spoiled by... the book's title! A truly brilliant piece of marketing THAT was.Compared to [Leslie Whitten's] The Fangs of the Morning, however, Faith Killer does have some worthwhile elements. Webster is a bit better at drawing his characters, and they're actually somewhat realistic when they're not being warriors for Bill W. (Actually, in retrospect, they're realistic then, too; I've met a few of them IRL who really do talk and act like this.) The action does move along well enough most of the time, and when you're not waiting for the inevitable recovery-spiel shoe to drop, there are a few absorbing parts. Unfortunately, they all lead to predictable places; guess what happens to the alcoholic cop? heh. * 1/2"},{"Title":"The Humanistic Tradition (Books 1-3)","review":"I highly recommend this series of six books.

Simply put, I wanted to know when to add that extra horse to a trifecta ticket or when it made financial sense to leave off a vulnerable favorite in a leg of the Pick 4. In contrast, however, Exotic Betting is styled more as an introduction to exotic bet structuring for the beginner, and could be described as simply an extended and more in-depth version of a pamphlet handed out a track explaining simple horizontal and vertical strategies. This is, by no means, intended as an insult to the book or to Crist, and is more a warning to the veteran/professional player looking for advanced treatment of the subject. Indeed, the book is geared more toward the reader of Handicapping 101(which, incidentally, is a great introductory book) who routinely boxes trifectas and three-horse exactas than the reader looking to apply the principles of Fooled by Randomness or a hearty statistics tome to their wagering.At its core, Exotic Betting contains a discussion of the basic strategies for both vertical (exacta, trifecta, and superfecta) and horizontal (daily double, pick three, pick four, and pick six) wagers. For the most part, the strategies are sound and provide a good, launching pad for deeper thinking about the exotics. In particular, Crist mentions the single, most important piece of advice for the exotics bettor: Exotics can not be used as a means to profit from an overall lack of clarity. This was a lesson that I learned in the early days of wagering, believing that I could use these bets as a replacement for difficult decision making. While you may occasionally reap the reward from this method, the bettor is typically not getting a return in accordance with the risk undertaken. And, at the core, that is what exotic betting is about -- finding ways to increase the return while managing risk -- all based upon your opinion and analysis of the race.Unfortunately, Exotic Betting does not delve deeply into this fundamental dilemma - one in which the handicapping literature desperately needs more work. Indeed, one problem I have had in the past with other handicapping books was the failure of the authors to explore the rationales underlying certain decisions and attempt to discern general principles from specific examples - a key ingredient in the rigorous pursuit of knowledge. While Exotic Betting serves an introduction to the subject, more guidance and detailed exploration of the relation between risk and reward is sorely needed in any future text dedicated to exotic bet structuring. In looking at Crist's work, we can see the questions that need to be answered in an advanced treatment of the subject. For example, in devising his tickets for the Pick Four and Pick Six, he normally divides his horses into four groups - A's (likely winners), B's (horses that can win if the A's fail), C's (horses that could conceivably win, but are unlikely) and X's (eliminations). Based on these classifications, he then creates tickets with various combinations of the non-eliminated horses to cover a vast range of possibilities. While Crist gives some examples of his \\"Chinese Menu\\" selection process (e.g. three from Group A with one from Group C), there is no discussion of the reasons why certain combinations are used. As a result, the reader is left wondering why he determined that financial rewards are best served by these combinations, and how to make these adjustments to their wagers. The same problem occurs in discussing the amounts to bet on certain combinations. In fashioning his tickets, Crist mentions that when he plays a Pick Four ticket with four A's (the likeliest winners), he buys it four times to compensate for the lower payoff. Yet, much like the earlier discussion regarding the selection of combinations, no explanation is given on why or how these amounts were calculated. To the participant in the handicapping life, there is nothing worse than putting out capital at an undue amount of risk for the range and likelihoods of various returns, and, consequently, the horseplayer needs theoretical tools to help him assess when he has either overplayed or underplayed their capital.Unlike the poker or chess player, whose shelves are filled with intellectual discussions of the finer points of the game, the advanced horse player looking for rigorous approaches to betting the game is still without much hope. Hopefully, in the coming years, an author - perhaps even Crist himself - will begin to develop the potential of the ideas in Exotic Betting, and bring much needed new insight to the advanced participant of the horse playing game. But, until that day, any player who finds himself boxing trifectas, baseballing exactas, or filling out a Pick 4 ticket with 2 horses in each leg, would be wise to pick up Exotic Betting to begin the process of deeper critical thinking."},{"Title":"Exotic Betting: How to Make the Multihorse, Multirace Bets that Win Racing's Biggest Payoffs","review":"I recently read this book. Even though nobody is going to read it and say, \\"Eureka!

(You probably think you already know that. &lt;G>) I think more than a few people will see where they are going wrong and, perhaps, how to correct their approach.I buy just about every horse racing book that comes along. The $20-30 is not important. It is what I may learn from a book versus the time it takes me to read and digest it.

The book not only explains the different types of wagers, it also tells you the smart way on making these bets.The book is a very easy read. I especially enjoyed the chapter on the pick-6. This is a bet that I only seriously tried to tackle once (I got 4 out of 6 on a $128 ticket). This is a bet that the average horseplayer should avoid, however if you must, read this book. Steve Crist normally spends between $400 and $1000 dollars (out of my league)on the pick 6, and has spent substantially more on the Ultra Pick 6.The new exotic bettor (and smaller bank rolled) however should stick with the other exotics covered in the book. Crist does a great job on these wagers too. Although nothing ground breaking, the inexperienced horse player will find it very useful.

If you have been around the track for even a short time you know what they are called and have a general idea of how to play them. For me it is not realistic to try the strategies because my pockets are not that deep. I can't bet hundreds of dollars per race. The theory is good but the amounts to be bet are not realistic for me, yet. For now I need to work on my handicapping skills and leave the more advanced \\"exotics\\" to the pros."},{"Title":"Exotic Betting: How to Make the Multihorse, Multirace Bets that Win Racing's Biggest Payoffs","review":"I thought this was a pretty solid book on the proper ways to construct exotic betting tickets. I found Crist's discussions of exacta and trifecta plays to be particularly interesting. Specifically, Crist tells the player to get away from the boxes (and other \\"chance plays\\") and go for big payouts by trusting your handicapping skills. Anyone can throw five longshots into a $1 exacta box and get lucky once and a while. Crist's philososphy, and that of many professional players, is to play less combinations at a greater price. Key your top horse over your second choice for $10. Then the top horse over a longshot play for $5. Crist encourages the player to structure bets in a manner that will reward them the most when their handicapping is spot on.....not just when they get lucky by throwing every longshot on the borad underneath and exoctic play. Why play four horses equally in a leg of the Pick 4 when you like two of them much more than the other two?This book, along with Steve Davidowitz's classic, is an excellent read for the intermediate player who wants to learn to take his bet structuring to the next level. My only complaint is that the book wasn't longer....I would love to be able to sit down with Steve Crist and talk betting strategies all day. The only caution that I would give is that this book is not at all about how to pick winners. In fact, this book is not going to be valuable at all to a player who does not possess solid handicapping skills. If you have trouble picking winners to begin with then its probably not a good idea to try and get creative with exotic betting."},{"Title":"Exotic Betting: How to Make the Multihorse, Multirace Bets that Win Racing's Biggest Payoffs","review":"Steven Crist has been a horse-racing columnist, CEO of the Daily Racing Form and is the author of three other books on horse racing. His latest book, EXOTIC BETTING, attempts to fulfill a need, he explains, to glean more profits from racing through \\"exotic betting\\" at a time when shorter horse fields and more information available to savier handicappers has made it harder to make money with \\"straight bets\\": win, place and show. In EXOTIC BETTING, Mr. Crist patiently and lucidly lays out the mathematics behind daily doubles, exactas, trifectas, pick threes, etc., the so-called exotic plays. At one time, these bets were exotic when win, place and show predominated. But now, exotic betting is a feature at every racetrack. EXOTIC BETTING focuses on intrarace exotic bets like the exacta and trifecta and interrace exotic bets like the daily double and the pick three. Mr. Christ offers betting strategies for each of the exotic bet types. While I have seen most of these ideas in different places elsewhere, Mr. Christ brings them all together in one reference and explains them in very readable prose. Using the principals presented in the first part of EXOTIC BETTING, he finishes by taking the reader through his actual betting at the 2005 Breeder's Cup. A few more examples of the strategies discussed could have been interesting if not necessary but, all-in-all, this is an excellent book and I highly recommended EXOTIC BETTING for the casual or more serious horse player who wants to be a better exotics player."},{"Title":"Exotic Betting: How to Make the Multihorse, Multirace Bets that Win Racing's Biggest Payoffs","review":"Very insightful on reasons and methods to break out of the Box/wheel mentality.

Getting 20 or so combinations for exactas or doubles or tris is just asking for trouble. With shorter fields these days the payoffs just don't justify the investment and risks.I've been playing, with marginal success, straight exactas or, at most, a 2 horse box. Even then, my 20-1 exacta payoff drops to 10-1 with the box. The combinations suggested in this book shrinks your payoff odds big time. If you have a bad day, and we all have them, you could lose a lot of $. And I'm not into sinking $20 into a pick 3 for a $50 payoff. No thanks.I guess with the big plays, like superfectas and super 7s, some of this might work. I don't know. I never play these. But I guarantee if you keep betting lots of combinations in the doubles or exactas, it's going to be a rough road.Pick who you think is going to win, find a good runner-up and bet it straight. Even with a 2-1 favorite on top, you could be looking at a 15-1 exacta. Not bad. A common scenario for me is a nice 5-1 shot on top of the 3/2 favorite with a payoff of $40-$50. No bad again."},{"Title":"Exotic Betting: How to Make the Multihorse, Multirace Bets that Win Racing's Biggest Payoffs","review":"For anyone interested in exotic bets, this book is worth buying.It is not about how to handicap horses. It is about how to construct exotic bets.The book is really in two parts. The first half is about exotic bets on one race (exacta, trifecta, superfecta). I think this part is a bit weak - I get the feeling that Crist does not really play the trifecta and superfectas. But I personally don't really like these races, so that is not a problem.The second part is on multi-race exotics (double, treble, pick-4, pick-6). And this bit of the book is terrific. He sets out a really interesting way of using multiple tickets to try to increase coverage in the Pick-4 and Pick-6, in particular how to add less favoured horses without blowing out the overall cost.Once you have read the book, and you should, you can also follow Crist's occasional blog at the Daily Racing Form ([...]) where he applyies the techniques in the book.

The main conclusion I disagree with is the author's repeated assertions throughout that exotics are not about trying to figure out who the two, three or four most likely finishers are and betting them in the order of most likely finish. Christ somehow thinks that there is more to it than that. But there isn't.If you find the winning horses in the order of finish, you will cash. Because that's precisely what the Exacta, Quinella, Trifecta, Daily Double, Superfecta, Pick 6, etc are all about: finding the requisite number of top finishes and the order of finish. He might have meant to say that figuring out the order of finish is a complex process which it indeed is, but the way he choose to express this in the text was really mind boggling. To argue that there is something else to it is - well - nutty.Despite this one flaw, Christ does get you thinking the right way in alot of areas. He does cover takeout and how that effects your betting decisions, the Win-Place-Show (WPS) pools vs. exotics pools and how they work, why box bets are losing bets, when not to bet and other information that is vital info for the newbie pony player.

Informative because the author explains common betting pitfalls that cost players more money than needed. His take on having an opinion on a race and betting accordingly is an excellent point and one that needs to be followed. Without the strong or hunch opinion, multi race or intra race bets are really no different than roulette. The book is complex because, while the author gives examples of how he did play a race card or how he might play a race card, the detailed thinking and math behind the actual wager can be hard to follow or even to appreciate. I somewhat disagree with his notion that to play the pick 6 with any chance of success one needs a big bank roll. His experience at the Breeders Cup 2005 where he prepared for days and wagered almost $10,000 and still lost the pick 6 undercuts this logic. My advice is if you are a good handicapper--get better, play your hunches, and go for a smaller pick 6 ticket.

If anything will make you rethink that paradigm, this book will."},{"Title":"For I Have Sinned","review":"Because this book is a collection of short stories, many of them are predictably lacking in depth. While I would have preferred a great deal more research and information about a select few of these \\"Godless\\" tales of woe, this is not to denigrate the entire book. The author correctly notes in the foreword that these \\"Men of God\\" often found their callings based upon the expectations of a ready-made career and a position that garners instant respect and oftentimes, power over others. It did not escape my notice that many of these priests, bishops, and ministers were the sons of fathers who chose the same path of serving God. Perhaps the often rigid expectations of their fathers were too much for these men who later fell from grace.Currently out of print, I would have recommended buying this book used anyway. I was particularly interested in \\"Twisted Sister,\\" the story of a former nun who committed murder, later claiming she was raped by the man she shot. Unfortunately, this particular story was disappointing. Was Sheila Ryan De Luca raped? Perhaps, but she had long ago abandoned any moral codes to which she once may have ascribed. She and the man she murdered were both heavily intoxicated and using drugs, both of which contributed greatly to the trauma that followed. De Luca, a married woman, met her victim in a tavern and then agreed to leave with him. I find it difficult to feel too sympathetic.Two of the more interesting stories include \\"The Sacrificial Lamb\\" and \\"Honor Thy Father.\\" In \\"The Sacrificial Lamb,\\" a respected pastor murders the church sexton, severing the head and the tatooed right forearm of the handyman. Seeking to stage his own death and begin a new life free from the expectations of others, pastor John Terry burned his own church to the ground, hoping others would assume the charred corpse of the sexton was his own. He was wrong. In \\"Honor Thy Father,\\" famed singer Marvin Gaye was shot and killed by his own father, a former bishop who eventually slid into an alcoholic haze punctuated by violence toward his wife and children. Spending the better part of many years locked in self-imposed solitary confinement in his own bedroom, Gaye's father also indulged his desires to wear his wife's underwear and clothing... sometimes choosing to sit on the front porch in a dress with a bottle of liquor. Always jealous and critical of his son, the former bishop eventually shot his son at point blank range while his wife screamed and pleaded for help. Even with the damning statements from his wife, the fallen bishop managed to convince investigators that he shot his son in self defense. His sentence? Probation - 5 years. Even his wife, who later divorced him, states she never saw any evidence of grief, regret, or remorse.Some interesting stories... some less than compelling. An easy read, I recommend this book for passing the time while traveling by plane, subway, or bus."},{"Title":"Karl Marx; his life and environment (Home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"Isaiah Berlin's impressive biography of Marx gives the reader a perfect view of Marx's philosophical, social and political ideas and writings. He also gives in depth comments on people who influenced him profoundly or opposed him harshly.InfluencesMarx drew heavily on Hegel (the dialectical process), Feuerbach (religious and secular ideologies provide ideal compensations for real miseries), Sismondi (the welfare State) and Saint-Simon (economic relationships are the determining factor in history).OpponentsHe was opposed by Bakunin (anti-State anarchism), Fourier (distrust of all central authority), Lassalle (State-planned economy controlled by a military aristocracy) and Proudhon (\`moral' approach to social problems).VisionMarx had a fundamental positive vision on man: \`all men are rational by nature'. But the individual doesn't hold the means for his happiness in his own hands, because his acts are not determined by his moral character, but by the socio-economic situation he lives in. This situation was capitalism, where a small privileged class laid its hands on the major part of the proceeds generated by the working class. This \`colossal fraud' was veiled by the ruling class through their ideology which blocked the spread of reason that would open the eyes of the proletariat.However, for Marx, history has its own laws of social development (like continued concentration of all the wealth in fewer and fewer hands), which are independent of man's will and consciousness. The ruling classes are doomed and a new free society will be created.Works\`Theses on Feuerbach': man eats before he reasons. Man is not amenable to rational arguments and will not voluntarily give up the power acquired by birth, wealth or ability to create a more just society. Man's acts are the product of his economic environment.\`Communist Manifest': the abolition of private property through nationalizations is the only way to a classless society.\`Inaugural Address of the International': the emancipation of the working class is the great end of every political movement.\`Das Kapital': there is only one class which produces more wealth than it consumes. This residue is appropriated by other men simply by virtue of their strategic position as the possessors of the means of production.\`German Ideology' (Historical Materialism): the laws of history indicate an irreversible gradual freeing of man.I. Berlin's criticismThere was no falling profit rate or decline in the general living standard. Marx underestimated the power of nationalism. And ultimately, Marx has always claimed that \`ideas' could not determine the course of history. His own ideas proved the contrary.For more fundamental criticism of Marx's theories I recommend K. Popper (The Open Society) and M. Djilas (The New Class).Hegel's dialectic has been torpedoed by B. Russell. The theory that man doesn't understand his situation is not exact. In Marx's times, man simply didn't have the (political, social) power or the (moral) strength to change his fate. Marx's vision of man (e.g., the proletariat) was far too optimistic, see D. Morris, K. Lorenz. More, Marx didn't consider the influence of demographic explosions, technological advances or social developments (trade-unionism).Isaiah Berlin's formidable analysis of Marx is a fascinating read."},{"Title":"NIV Wide Margin (US) Black bonded leather NIVWM202","review":"This is a great bible for general use.

Commissioned as a subaltern (2nd lieutenant) following the Japanese surrender, he served as a platoon leader in a Gordon Highlander battalion posted to the Middle East before being \\"demobbed\\", i.e. released from active duty. His experiences serve as the basis for THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN, initially published in 1970, a first person account by the fictional Dand MacNeill, subaltern of a platoon in an unspecified Highland battalion posted first to Libya, then to Edinburgh, during the period 1945-1947.THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is a work of wry humor, inasmuch as Lt. MacNeill describes the unintentionally comic situations encountered with his Jocks (men) during garrison life both in Scotland and abroad, mostly the latter. The book is actually a series of short stories, in which a common thread tying all together, besides Dand himself, is Pvt. McAuslan, the dirtiest, most slovenly soldier in His Majesty's service. As described by MacNeill:\\" ... he lurched into my office (even in his best tunic and tartan he looked like a fugitive from Culloden who had been hiding in a peat bog) ...\\"McAuslan may be the focus of a particular chapter, as when he is court-martialed for refusing an order to enter a pillow fight contest to be held during a gathering of the various Highland regiments. Or, he may make nothing more than a brief cameo appearance, as when he is upbraided by MacNeill for fighting one of the crewman aboard the coastal steamer ferrying the battalion's soccer team on a road-trip against the teams of neighboring British commands - a fight brought on by the sailor's comments regarding McAuslan's unsanitary appearance.The squalid presence of McAuslan notwithstanding, the central character of the book is Dand MacNeill, whether he's coping with the unfathomable questions of the officer selection board, pressed into command of an overnight troop train from Cairo to Jerusalem through unruly Palestine, mounting the ceremonial guard at Edinburgh Castle, or taking lessons in regimental piping history from the god-like Regimental Sergeant Major. Dand's narrative of military service is of such good humor and wit that it's evident his alter ego, Fraser, remembers his own time in uniform as an enriching life experience, despite the hardships of WWII combat. This positive slant on the book's theme, and Fraser's/MacNeill's fine sense of the ludicrous, make the volume one that I couldn't put down. (I've encountered so-called \\"thrillers\\" that were less absorbing.)Note: THE GENERAL DANCED AT DAWN is currently out of print in the US. However, it and Fraser's two sequels in the McAuslan series, MCAUSLAN IN THE ROUGH and THE SHEIKH AND THE DUSTBIN, are all contained in THE COMPLETE MCAUSLAN, available from Amazon.co.uk. This is a superb volume, worth to an Anglophile every pence spent in postage to deliver it across The Pond to The Colonies."},{"Title":"\\"The General Danced at Dawn","review":"These wonderful stories, written by Fraser when he was an officer in the Gordon Highlanders at the end of the Second World War are priceless. There is much sardonic humor and wit here. The characters come and go throughout the book. Each chapter is a self contained story in itself almost. By far the one character who appears most often is the unhygenic pvt. McAuslan. He seems to do for the Scots what some of the WW2 comic characters like Sad Sack did for the GI's. The author, who speaks through the voice of his nom-de-guerre relates many amusing episodes. Some are a little silly at times, and the constant unwashed antics of \\"Peking Man\\" McAuslan gets a bit tiring, but this does not take away from the quality or humor of the work.I like best when Fraser talks about the regimental history and lore of the Gordons when he's taking a break from McAuslan. There are some truly wonderful characters and events related here, all factual enough and displaying the honors and traditions which existed in old Highland regiments like the Gordons. Fraser is at his best when he talks of these traditions and one can see that he relished his hectic years with this famous Highland regiment.The downsizing of the British Empire and the changes this would wrought in the army as well as the world are the backdrop against which these stories are told. This is not a book about war, but about a time when national service was apart of nearly everyone's life. Some of Fraser's opinions may not be considered PC for today, but this in my opinion adds to the charm of these stories. The war and its aftermath left lasting impressions on those who took part. The Gordon Highlanders are sadly no more, having been downsized in 1994. In this book you will find many funny and amusing tales which made them the fine regiment they once were. Those who have followed Fraser in his Flashman series will find a different style here, but equally entertaining in its own right. The McAuslan stories form part of a number of works that were written about the post war years in Britain. \\"Tunes of Glory\\" is another more serious example by Kenneth Kennaway.The McAuslan stories have been recently gathered together into a triology which is not available from Amazon.com in the States. The book can be ordered from Amazon.com.co.uk and is well worth the extra pennies to do so.Here's to the Gordons! Long may their memory live!"},{"Title":"\\"The General Danced at Dawn","review":"It is time that you hear &quot;the sub-muckin', the whole cheese, the hail clanjamfry, the lot' about the Scottish Highland Regiment that served in Africa after World War II.George MacDonald Fraser has written the stories of this regiment and its most infamous soldier, Private McAuslan, in three collections: &quot;The General Danced at Dawn&quot;, &quot;McAuslan in the Rough&quot;, and &quot;The Sheikh and the Dustbin&quot;.Through the narration by platoon commander Dand McNeil, McAuslan comes alive as the dirtiest soldier in the world, &quot;wan o' nature's blunders; he cannae help bein' horrible. It's a gift.&quot;Yet McAuslan is one of the most loveable creatures in all of literature. He may be grungy, filthy, clumsy, and disreputable, but he tries to do his best. Through his many misadventures, McAuslan marches into the heart of the reader, right leg and right arm swinging in unison, of course.McAuslan, outcast that he is, experiences some infamous moments in his career: court martial defendant, ghost-catcher, star-crossed lover, golf caddie, expert map reader, and champion of the regimental quiz game (!). His tales, and the tales of his comrades-in-arms, are poignant at times, hilarious at others. These tales are so memorable because they are based on true stories.The reader basks in all things Scottish in the stories. The language of the soldiers is written in Scottish brogue, although Fraser says in his introduction, &quot;Incidentally, most of this volume is, I hope, written in English.&quot; Don't fret - a glossary is provided. (Reading the glossary alone causes some serious belly laughs.If you read only one book this year, read this one. And if you know any veterans, give them a copy. It's a volume that the reader will not soon forget."},{"Title":"\\"The General Danced at Dawn","review":"This is much more than a tale of post-war service in the British Armed Forces.... It can relate to any Army,Navy or Airforce indeed any Large Company of today. I served in the Royal Navy of the 80's and 90's and was cursed with TWO McAuslans! These tales are so well crafted and told...you know that these are real events with just the names changed to protect the innocent.

You will laugh until your face hurts--and if you have ever worn the uniform, part of you will cry, also."},{"Title":"\\"The General Danced at Dawn","review":"After reading the fine reviews already posted by others, one doubts whether another review will add much, but out of habit - near compulsion by now - here goes another - with an emphasis on reading connections.As did many, perhaps most readers of the McAuslan stories, I came to them by way of The Flashman series (My favorites so far:Flashman: A Novel (Flashman)andFlashman in the Great Game: A Novel (Flashman). I enjoyed the Flashman enough to give McAuslan a try. Both series are funny, relate to historical events, and display an ear for language and an eye for detail, but could otherwise be written by different authors. The McAuslan stories are told by the reasonable, sensible, compassionate voice of Lieut. Dand MacNeill and relate the trials of life in a Highland regiment immediately after WW II. In other words, MacNeill could hardly be more different from Harry Flashman. The stakes are lower than in Flashman. The McAuslan tales deal with the mundane life of a soldier waiting for demobe and not imperial crises. These stories read just like tales that actually happened - and something pretty close to them probably did.McAuslan plays less of a role in the The General Danced at Dawn thanMcAuslan in the Rough, but the stories are still a delight to read.The McAuslan stories lie at the outreaches of contemporary humor; pretty obscure stuff and the more fun because of it. A great kick in finding works like these is stumbling upon other works of equal merit and obscurity. It's sort of guided serendipity, if you will. Flashman led not only to McAuslan, but also to John Biggins'A Sailor of Austria: In Which, Without Really Intending to, Otto Prohaska Becomes Official War Hero No. 27 of the Habsburg Empire (The Otto Prohaska Novels)and toArtemus Ward, his book. With many comic illustrations.(not sure how the Ward connection occurred. Mark Twain called Ward the greatest American humorist of his day.).Highest recommendation and climb out on these other branches."},{"Title":"\\"The General Danced at Dawn","review":"This book is a must read along with McAuslan in The Rough by the same author.

With a draining six-year war just finished, the regiment is winding down in North Africa, and such is the way of the military that the men must be kept busy on a variety of more-or-less useless tasks. These they tackle in a hilariously bumbling way, aided to no small extent by the inexperience of their officer, who serves as the book's narrator.They play football well, but let the side down with off-field brawls and gambling, cause havoc on a night exercise and have trouble with their kilts when presenting to royalty. The title story is a tour-de-force, when a crusty, whisky-mellowed General thinks he can redefine the Scottish dancing tradition by turning an eightsome into a hundred and twenty-eightsome, with the assistance of Arab cooks and drivers.Fraser proves enormously clever in melding fiction with reminiscence and delivers a book that is essential reading matter for anyone with a sense of humour."},{"Title":"Advanced Java 2 Development for Enterprise Applications (2nd Edition)","review":"I expected this book to be as clear and useful as the Core Java 2 books by Hortsmann and Cornell...but it is NOT.

It is unsuitable for begineers as it does not cover anything with proper introduction and it is unsuitable for advanced readers as it does not cover anything in sufficient detail. Java is a vast technology and it is seemingly impossible to cover every aspect of it in a single book.

It does cover many important areas- Threads in Server Applications, Java Security, Distributed Computing Protocols (RMI, IIOP), Server Framewokrs and Architectures. I would even argue that the author had understated his accomplishment in writing this book. Which is why I decided to write this review.The book material focuses on design issues, their solutions, and the motivation behind them, but it is very down to earth and there are many helpful code snippets to keep you grounded. Each chapter presents the important concepts and introduce the subject at the overview level first and provide more detailed treatment of topics that are of advanced nature. Additionally, the book provides a very practical introduction to some non-technical aspects of the software development process, in particular- Project Management and Configuration Managament.Personally, I have found the book to be very useful. I post this paragraph as a revision of my initial review, because I myself was surprised as to how often I use it as a starting point of reference.

As well as comments describing the book as boring.Whether a book is boring will always be a personal matter. A fellow classmate in college once told me that The Epic Of Gilgamesh was boring. I remember feeling at the time that he did not appreciate its uniqueness, and I felt regret for him. Indeed, Nietzsche said Plato was boring! But it is true, that this is a personal matter.More concretely, the book's preface states its goals very clearly:&quot;...This book is not intended to be an in-depth treatment of all enterprise subjects. ... However, an advanced programmer needs to have a working knowledge of most aspects of a system in order to understand the entire system. For example, a developer working on a set of Enterprise JavaBeans does not need to understand all security issues in depth but does need to have a working knowledge of the security techniques used by the servers involved and the application. This book tries to provide a big picture....&quot; This is a book on architecture, and that is not a topic of interest to everyone.I am happy to report that I receive considerable fan mail regarding the book, and that has made the enormous effort worthwhile.

The book shows how to create a Limited Partnership with Limited Partners supplying capital and General Partners fulfilling the Syndication and Management functions of creating and starting the business.Normally you can raise capital by borrowing or by selling stock. The book shows you how to raise capital without selling stock or going to the bank. To my knowledge there is no other resource available that can do this. Not only does the book provide a road map of the process, it also supplies the actual Limited Partnership agreement that you can use to create A Limited Partnership. But because the book was published so many years ago, your attorney, or you, will have to check the wording of the agreement to make sure that it accurately complies with your state securities regulations. The references to California law will either have to be checked with the current California law or changed to correspond with your state securities regulations.This is a book that should be on the bookshelf of any entrepreneur.It is not easy to do what the book describes: the syndication of money from people you already know in a exempted securities offering. It may be beyond your capabilities; those who find it so can hire a promoter or funds syndicator and have it done for you. But in the book there is enough for you to do it yourself after you check state regulations to ensure that you are not in violation of state laws when you act as the promoter.The best part of a Limited Partnership is that you issue investment Units as opposed to shares of stock. Then when the Limited Partners receive back their original investment plus the return on investment they have been promised, the LP can be set up to terminate the LP at that time. Once your business has repaid the original LP investors, the LP Partners can be jettisoned as the Limited Partnership terminates. This leaves you, the entrepreneur, with all the stock, with no debt, and the total company.One disadvantage of buying the book is having to type all the forms in your word processor..it is a process that takes weeks or days, not hours...I strongly recommend this book to anyone trying to start a business that is substantial enough to support a Limited Partnership format for raising start up capital"},{"Title":"How to Attain and Practice the Ideal Sex Life: Ideal Sex and Love Relations for Every Married Man and Woman","review":"This book is a translation by Norman Haire, CH.M., M.B., from \\"Das Sexualleben in seiner biologischen bediutung\\" It is intended for circulation only among mature persons, TWENTY-ONE YEARS OF AGE OR OVER!

I have dear memories of the loneliness of the environment and I have been reading about its history ever since.John Lorne Campbell owned Canna before he donated it to the National Trust for Scotland. I like the idea of now knowing the persons living in the manor house that is so visible from the harbour. The manor house owned most of the penny lands. These are small farms stocked with seven cows and two horses. The arable land was fertilized by carrying seaweed onto it. Most inhabitants lived at subsistence level. The people in the manor house usually were the only ones on the island who were literate. This is a well written and complete history starting 4000 BC and carrying us through Columba, the Vikings and Culloden into modern times. Like the other islands and mainland Scotland, people lived in a social system called servitude until very recently. Their life at subsistence level became unacceptable in modern times and many inhabitants emigrated from the overpopulated island. There is a high degree of personal involvement from the writer who clearly loves his island and its Gaelic culture.

This one covers all of the bases!"},{"Title":"Glove Affairs: The Romance, History, and Tradition of the Baseball Glove","review":"DECEMBER 2012 UPDATE: DOWNGRADING MY EARLIER REVIEW (BELOW) FROM 3 1/2 STARS TO 1 STAR BASED ON COMMENTS LEFT BY THE AUTHOR, WHICH FOLLOW MY REVIEW. IT'S TOO BAD; THIS WASN'T A BAD BOOK.This is an interesting book to be sure. It's full of baseball glove lore, history, and stories from the majors. You'll pick up some helpful tips on glove break-in and repair, and stories about specific players' relationships with their gloves.My gripe? The book relies almost entirely on secondary sources. It appears the author went online or to the library and searched for any existing interviews of major leaguers who mentioned their gloves, then strung these snippets together for the book. It makes for splintered writing, as if the author's only goal were to make it to the next snippet. There appear to be no primary or first hand player interviews, no trip to the Baseball Hall of Fame to research the history of baseball gloves or interview the curators there, no direct contact with Rawlings or Wilson for input from the companies, etc. For these reasons I felt the book was a little flat and could have been improved.Still, a nice book on a subject lacking coverage elsewhere."},{"Title":"Glove Affairs: The Romance, History, and Tradition of the Baseball Glove","review":"This book received many nominations for the 2003 CASEY Award.

Hodgson himself saw it as being part of a \\"trilogy\\", along with \\"Glen Carrig\\" and \\"Ghost Pirates\\". He was probably too close to his own work to see that ALL of the later, better material, carried the same oppressive message: we are shielded from malign outer forces by the thinnest of barriers, that what we would like to think of as \\"reality\\" is a tissue-thin wall separating us from entities whose very existance and purpose lie far beyond our ability to understand, much less deal with.\\"The House on the Borderland\\" is probably the most accessible of the four novels Hodgson wrote, especially since it eschews the \\"archaic\\" language device and sickly-sweet \\"love interest\\" that make \\"The Night Land\\" so difficult. It is a crisply-written narrative whose power still grips after repeated readings. \\"Canacki the Ghost Finder\\" is a more familar \\"occult detective\\", somewhat along the lines of Blackwood's \\"John Silence\\", but he reaches incredible heights of tension and sense of dread, especially in \\"The Gateway of the Monster\\" and \\"The Whistling Room\\".The remaining eleven short stories vary in quality, but none of them is a \\"dud\\", and none of them has been available in anything other than obscure, expensive, and now out of print anthologies.Beautifully presented in dark blue with brilliant silver stamping, this and its companion volumes don't just LOOK good, they're **fantastic** values. Absolutely my highest recommendation. Reading this, you'll see that \\"fantasy\\" and \\"horror\\" writers of today scribble in the shadows of giants."},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","review":"This odd, deeply atmospheric novel is undoubtedly the masterwork of the eccentric Edwardian English wrtier William Hope Hodgson. It presents the haunting story of an old recluse who lives in a weird borderland between ordinarly reality and unspeakable horror. The tale is presented through the experience of two friends who discover an old manuscript in the ruin of a mansion while camping in rural Ireland. The papers describe the strange visions and terrifying experiences of the recluse who, together with his elderly sister, was the house's last living inhabitant. The story is powerfully evocative of the different kinds of evil that can befall a human mind. It should appeal to anyone who likes Lovecraft or Poe, but goes far beyond the limits of the horror genre in its imaginative power and artistry."},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","review":"I'd guess that if you are looking at this review you probably already know that William Hope Hodgson is one of the masters of 20th Century Fantasy Horror, and a huge influence on all who came after him in particular HP Lovecraft. Whether you know anything about Hodgson or not, this volume is a good place to start reading. It contains two of his masterworks 'House on the Borderland', with its truly brooding sense of cosmic despair, and the stories of Carnacki the occult detective. It also has quite a few other stories I have not seen before which while generally not of the same quality are definately worth reading.The production values of the book are excellent, with decent size font, sewn binding and rather irrelevant but interesting illustrations. My only vague complaint is that the backing boards are of a plasticky nature and probably will not last as long as cloth, but this is a triviality.I will definately be getting the others of the series as they come out, and will probably not bother hanging on my copy of the old Arkhan collection of novels. There is no better recommendation."},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","review":"as a teen i read hodgson's &quot;the nightland&quot; and &quot;boats of the glen carrig&quot; with the former impressing me strongly. i could never find &quot;the house on the borderland&quot; and was unaware of his short fiction. hearing of the release of hardcover editions of his collected works led to an enjoyable reread of &quot;boats&quot; and the short fiction in the 1st volume of the series.(also thank you to my teen son who suggested i seek out &quot;house.&quot;) i preordered this 2nd volume months ago, and the wait was well worth it. &quot;house&quot; is a match for any work of fantastic horror (lovecraft, derleth, king, etc)and a book almost unbelievably inventive for its time. the short fiction in this volume is as much of a treat as what was in the 1st volume. the last story is a chilling comment on the danger of the western mind misunderstanding the thought processes of the east (certainlyly pertinent today) and all the short fiction has something to offer. this was strong work and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","review":"I just received this book from Amazon and will be buying the other editions in this collection as my budget allows.

It takes an effort to really get into Hodgson's prose style, but if you slow down and let your mind be lulled, his stories become quite engaging. The Night Land is flawed by his tendency to dwell too much on how many hours the central character walks or crawls, how many hours he sleeps, how many food pills he eats, etc., similar details of which we are spared in The House on the Borderland. Hodgson also has a romantic infatuation with simpering girl-women, whom he describes as \\"My Own\\" and over whom the narrator is the \\"master.\\" This is outright cloying by modern standards. I am also struck by the interesting parallel of the quest in The Night Land to Tolkien's later narrative of Frodo's pilgrimage into the land of Mordor."},{"Title":"The House on the Borderland and Other Mysterious Places (The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Vol. 2)","review":"WOW !

What's your take?"},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","review":"William Somerset Maugham was 45 years old when he went on a trip to China in the winter of 1919. Always an astute observer, he jotted down notes, elaborated them, and finally had them published as a book in London. Fortunately, this small volume is now available again as a Vintage Classics paperback in the UK (and in the reviewer's favorite Shanghai bookstore). &quot;On a Chinese Screen&quot; is an appropriate title for the book because it depicts mostly English people against the backdrop of China at the beginning of the century. In 58 short sketches, the longest of which fits on just nine printed pages, Maugham portrays English missionaries, officials, army officers, adventurers and company managers. Maugham gently mocks their narrow-mindedness and indifference towards the country in which they spend a major part of their lives. &quot;On the whole,&quot; he remarks, &quot;it made little difference to them in what capital they found themselves, for they did precisely the same things in Constantinople, Berne, Stockholm, and Peking . . . China bored them all, they did not want to speak of that; they only knew just so much about it as was necessary to their business.&quot; Their attitude towards the Chinese was one of &quot;mistrust and dislike tempered by optimism,&quot; and they did not bother to learn the language.Whereas Maugham is agreeably malicious in his portraits of the English and their wives, he can get outright scathing and sarcastic when he describes the hypocrisy of protestant missionaries. The Catholics have a better standing with him, which explains why Graham Greene calls Maugham a writer of great dedication. Maugham has a healthy disregard of professedly religious people whose deeds do not live up to their words, no matter whether they are English missionaries who behave as if they were in the civil service or whether they are Chinese farmers who perform the rites &quot;like an old peasant woman in France does her day's housekeeping.&quot; Maugham's depiction of the Chinese countryside leaves no lasting impression, yet sometimes he creates images of sheer beauty: &quot;the yellow water in the setting sun was lovely with pale, soft tints, it was as smooth as glass.&quot; The focus of his observations are people. Maugham senses the human beings who peek out from behind the roles they play in the scheme of the British Empire. Though he appears to be detached from the hardships of the Chinese, one can feel the effort it takes him to stay aloof when he observes the coolies, the &quot;human beasts of burden&quot;, and remarks that their &quot;effort oppresses you. You are filled with a useless compassion.&quot; Maugham's most heart-wrenching piece is a story with the innocent title &quot;The Sights of the Town&quot; in which he tells of a so-called baby tower used by the peasants to drop unwanted babies to their deaths. Spanish nuns in the nearby town try to save at least some of the unwanted newborns by paying twenty cents for every one because, as they say, the peasants &quot;have often a long walk to come here and unless we give them something they won't take the trouble.&quot;Maugham, as skeptic and acerbic as he can be, also has a great sense of humor, freshness of observation and unconventionality of comparison. Summing up his impression of an opium den, he writes it reminded him &quot;somewhat of the little intimate beerhouses in Berlin where the tired working man could go in the evening and spend an peaceful hour.&quot; Well, I would not compare opium so non-chalantly to beer but his tongue-in-cheek British snobbery is definitely enjoyable. As is his mockingly spiteful aside towards Americans whom he regards to be such extremely practical people &quot;that Harvard is instituting a chair to instruct grandmothers how to suck eggs.&quot; My favorite funny piece in the book is Maugham's explanation why democracy gets flushed down by the Western sense of cleanliness. In his words, &quot;it is a tragic thought that the first man who pulled the plug of a water-closet with that negligent gesture rang the knell of democracy.&quot; Just check it out. Even if he were not kidding, it would be a side-splitting theory.Some of the things Maugham observed eighty years ago still apply. For example, &quot;one of the peculiarities of China is that your position excuses your idiosyncrasies.&quot; And you can still see people getting their heads shaved on the sidewalk by old barbers. However, I can not report that &quot;others have their ears cleaned, and some, a revolting spectacle, the inside of their eyelids scraped.&quot; In general, the life of the Chinese was as impenetrable to Maugham as were the Chinese houses with their monotonous expanse of wall broken only by solid closed doors. Only in the portraits of an old Chinese philosopher (who impotently dreams of the old and better China) and a young drama professor (who lacks any broader vision of China) we get a glimpse of the inner lives of the Chinese.The back cover of the Vintage Classics paperback edition shows a photo of the middle-aged Maugham. Turning his head to the observer, he has a look of weary curiosity in his eyes and a tiny smile in the corners of his mouth - as if he wanted to say, &quot;that is how it is. What do you think?&quot;"},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","review":"In \\"On a Chinese Screen\\" Maugham has written 58 beautiful yet astute caricatures of people he met and places he visited during his journey up the Yangtze River in 1919/20. Each small tale is a perceptive observation about a time of day, a person's character, a place or an event. Maugham's writing is eloquent and beautiful. He doesn't waste words. \\"For\\", according to Maugham, \\"in writing the important thing is less richness of material than richness of personality.\\" The richness and perceptiveness of Maugham shines in each story. Each sketch holds you to the end.Maugham's most astute observations in \\"On a Chinese Screen\\" are reserved for the people he meets. For example, when talking about consular employees and their indifference to their surroundings he observes \\"it made little difference to them in what capital they found themselves, for they did precisely the same thing in Constantinople, Berne, Stockholm, and Peking.\\" And after speaking to a Chinese official who was lamenting the loss of China and traditional values in the youth, and the disrepair of the temples, Maugham notes that he (Maugham) \\"knew all the time that he [the official] was a rascal.\\" And of an Italian missionary who had been in China for 50 years he writes \\"the passion of his eyes bespoke the battles long fought out in the uttermost depths of his heart, and his soul cried out in them, vanquished and bleeding, yet triumphant, and he exulted in the unclosed wound which he offered in willing sacrifice to Almighty God.\\" Brilliant!Maugham writes compassionately about the plight of the locals. He describes the bearers' burdens and notes that admiration for their strength and perseverance is not allowed. He writes compassionately about the foreigners who find themselves out of place and struggling to adapt. He writes with tragic sadness about the tower from which mothers throw their unwanted babies. Yes, with sadness, deep sadness. Without doubt Maugham is an astute observer of the world, of the people around him, of circumstance, of his time.I am glad this book is available again. I first saw it in a bookstore in Taipei in 1999. At that time I didn't have money on me to buy and thought I could buy it the next day. Alas when I went back it had already been sold. I looked for it on Amazon but no copies were available and from that day forward, every time I went into a bookstore I asked them if they had a copy. In 2002 I remember asking a store in Hong Kong if they had it in stock. The assistant laughed at me saying they last had it in stock more than five years ago. I eventually found it at another store in 2004 on a brief visit to Hong Kong. It was worth the wait and I have not been disappointed. Needless to say, it never gets lent out.If you are a lover of literature and a lover of travel then this is a must read. Very seldom are such deep perceptions captured by travel writers and very seldom do travel writers write with such depth, clarity and beauty. It's a small book, can be read in a day and can be re-read countless times. One never gets bored of the prose, of the ideas, of the thoughts, of the descriptions. One of the stories, \\"The Old Timer,\\" describes the colorful life and travails of a 76 year old English Captain who had been in China for most of his life. At the end of the story Maugham writes: \\"The dying of the day made him think, he (the Captain) knew not why, of his long past and of his great age. He regretted nothing. \`By George,' he muttered, \`I've had a fine life.'\\" I'm sure Maugham could have said the same."},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","review":"W. Somerset Maugham is my favorite author, and I have read almost all of his books and every one of his short stories. But On a Chinese Screen is not only his best work [in my opinion], but also one of the ten best books I have ever read. I have to wonder why this book is not required reading in any 1st year college writing class.The book is not a story, nor is it a short story. It is best described as a series of very short [1-5 pages] vignettes that describe some character, scene, setting, place, or event as Maugham travels through China c/1919. The writing is magnificent, and the insights are compelling. Any aspiring writer should read this book to catch a glimpse of a master story teller's ability to state succinctly the essence of a character, event, place or setting."},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","review":"My comment is on the format, not the content. I was disappointed with the quality of the printing (Classic Reprint Series). This book is a scanned reprint of an old copy of the book, and that's exactly what it looks like. This is not obvious from the \\"preview\\" pictures of the book here on Amazon. To get an idea, go to the publisher's homepage [..] to see some samples (the vertical blacks lines do not appear in the book though). It's a bit like a bad photocopy - little pieces of each letter are missing, and in some places, some (scanned) pencil underlining of the original also show up. It's readable, but despite the large font size it's tiring for the eyes, because the mangled letters give you the impression of looking at an out-of-focus picture. If I had known the print quality would be this bad, I would have paid more and gotten another edition or the hardcover."},{"Title":"On a Chinese Screen","review":"i love maugham, but not this. the book is a group of short, 2 to 4 page, writtings, like ideas to be used in an up coming book or something. there was never anything you could get your interest. of course it showed his fantastic ability to put a thought into words and his great descriptive writting. that said, i still did not like it."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"I've read through this book 5 times and I don't recall the part where Mr Packard says to spy on the board of directors!"},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"They say engineers (myself included) are generally poor writers; then David Packard must be an absolute genius. David Packard's book (as has his company been one) is an important contribution and a must read for company executives. But it does require patience and dedication -- like the one he and Bill Hewlette had to endure to make HP a success! Once you get through the first 6 or 7 chapters the book becomes and absolute GEM. Until then -- and unfortunately you almost have to read the first few chapters -- the book is a positive cure for sleeplessness. HP's dedication to innovation, its financial frugality (which shows up in Dave Packard not hiring a good ghost writer or editor) and the importance of Management by Objectives, Decenterlized Organization, and Management by Walkign Around, Expected Returns on R&amp;D are only some of the Gems hidden in this book; but you do have to mine to get to them and IMHO it is a worthwhile pain to go through. What also comes through is how HP slipped their biggest chance of dominating the chip and computer market by not taking the risk and cancelling the OMEGA project. Reading David Packard's fatalistic justifications is worth 10 times the price of the book. Also little credit is given to the inventor of the calculator that made HP a house hold name, and no mention is made of procurement of Appolo(until in Appendix 2)!!! Admittedly, I am at fault for having difficulty with this book. I read it after reading &quot;Hard Drive, Bill Gatees and the Making of Microsoft Empire&quot; by Jamve Wallace and Jim Erickson. These gentlemen are professional writers/journalists that know how to grab ones attention and keep it. Reading them before &quot;The HP Way&quot;, which incidently and surprisingly was rated the best business book of 1996 by Amazon readers, is like watching the movie Titanic, and then going home to suffer through 6 hours of Mr. Rogers!!! But I do still recommend the book not to mention that I am more inclined to one day work for the comapny!

This book surprises you with its simple down to earth account of how it all began and how they built this tiny garage shop into the multi billion dollar company that it is today. They did it not only with a strong belief in new and innovative products, but in the people that helped build the company. This simple belief built the foundation into the HP way of corporate greatness.The book was simply written, but it is this style that allowed me to understand the friendship between David Packard and Bill Hewlett and the corporate culture that they developed at HP. I would recommend this book to anyone that is a manager or executive to benchmark the corporate culture that HP established or applaud yourself if you have already embraced the HP Way.

David Packard and Bill Hewlett created one of the great American companies and that alone is worth knowing. That it is one of the great foundations of Silicon Valley is another reason that you need to know this story. However, as far as I am concerned, the most important reason to know this story is the set of principles these two men used in founding, building, and running their company.While they were technically brilliant men, they were also geniuses in gathering and grooming talent. However, their ability to inspire amazing loyalty in their employees is something that seems all but lost in our modern age of disposable firms and transient employment. They pioneered open plan offices (few walls and no doors), management by walking around, and much more. They had profit sharing from the very beginning. Not only did they have annual company picnics, they also bought a camp for use by employees. I know there are many reasons for the transition to where we are now, but I still have to ask if we really are better off today than we were then. Well, are we?The stories about the development of various products are all interesting, but the stories are all in the service of illustrating the principles he is trying to get across. His emphasis on conservative financing is well aware of the use many companies make of leverage. The rejection of Wall Street's focus on the present quarter is heartfelt, and primacy of sound business principles and corporate culture resonate strongly in our time and its emphasis on simply winning in any way possible. The pictures also add to the story.The recent book, \\"Bill & Dave\\" provides background material and fills in some of the gaps you will notice in reading this book, and I recommend it, as well. Still, this is the original and written by the man himself (well, by his staff with his supervision, right?) and deserves our attention.A must read.

Some of the unusual aspects of that mystique came to the forefront when the merger between HP and Compaq was reaching the final stages. One of the children of a founder launched a lawsuit against the merger because, among other things, it would lead to large number of layoffs, and that was \\"not the HP way.\\" Good corporate citizenship and care for the workers are fundamental principles laid down and practiced by Bill Hewlitt and David Packard as they grew from a garage to a multi-billion dollar company.This book is the story of that growth in the words of one of the founders. It is a tale of challenges, management strategies that were and still are unusual, corporate honesty (imagine that as a management strategy), opportunities seen and tenaciously pursued, occasional mistakes, but always remaining focused on success. The strategy of management by walking around is still one of the most successful tactics that can be used to manage people. Even a few minutes spent observing and conversing with an employee can show you more than any above the fray approach could possibly do and is an incredible morale booster for the entire staff.Over the years, I have heard many of the stories associated with HP, and after a time, began relegating some of them into the area of company \\"myth.\\" However, after reading this book, I came away even more impressed with Bill Hewlitt and David Packard. Books on how to manage companies are far too numerous to mention and many are thick enough to be of use to a bodybuilder. Small enough to be lifted by a toddler, this book contains more practical knowledge about how to start and manage a company than the majority of the heavyweights."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"This book has trouble deciding whether to be a history of the company or a management philosophy book. Ultimately the book comes across weakly on both fronts. As a historical book, way too many critical details were glossed over. As a management philosophy book, it deals too much with widely scattered specifics rather than focusing on the principles involved. From what I could discern, it appears much of the success of the HP way can be attributed to similarities to open-book management. I thus would recommend \\"Open Book Management\\" by John Case over this book."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"This book is a good overview. Its interesting to read how Hewlett Packard has grown from the little garage shop to the large conglomerate it is today. However, there are a few aspects that are clearly missing.First, it would be nice to see what motivated both Bill Hewlett and David Packard to pursue starting up Hewlett Packard and even providing more detail in why they chose an engineering path. David Packard knew he did not want to follow his father's lawyer career path but he does not say why. He does mention his like for conducting sicentific experiments but does not ellaborate on what caused such a curiosity. Als, why were Bill Hewlett's grades so questionable that it took hi father's teching record to get him into Stanford?Also, when David Packard talks about the many Hewlett Packard products he explains them in a manner where only someone familiar with Electronics Products would truly have a clear understanding of what he is talking about. And the writing style is overly to the point here with little in the way of pizzaz. The glossary helps a little bit but I should not have to find out at the end of the book, what I wanted to know at the beginning.Packard does overglorify his involvement in political affairs. He puts himself a little too high up on the pedestal with this and that Hewlett Packard was the innovator of the work/personal life balance that many other companies have today.None the less, the parts which Packard details the management style are explained in a good level of detail. Most readers will get the impression that David Packard was a fair boss who liked to insure that each of his employees was important. This is hammered home with an incident he had with a machinist. Also, the Management By Walking Around style is a detailed nicely through the example of corporate visits, departmental presentations, and company picnics.Generally, this is worth reading especially if you can pick it up at your local library. Its just too bad that there are some missing details and a lack of excitement in the writing style. But the end result basically meets its intentions."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"A great story of two men who, having grown out of the depression, created a company that wanted to make a social impact as well as making money.

The beginning chapters may be confusing to some (the synopsis of Bill and Dave's early life stories). However, I found a subtle message: the importance and benefit of a work/life balance to one's well being. This component seems to be slowly draining away from corporate cultures, and I'm positive that the results will be disastrous. I'm hoping we don't get to that point. The work/life principle, along with others, forms an incredible methodology for leadership.

Sometimes these types of books can be filled with justifications for mistakes, or can be written just to serve the ego of the author. Not this book. This book was honest and sincere."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"This book offers the most skeletal outline of what Packard learned and how he applied it to help found one of the most successful corporations of all time. The lessons in it are very simple and basic, such as talk to your engineers and service people because sending written materials will not get things executed properly. Packard covers many very interesting developments, such as the HP Way of 6 and then 7 items (starting with profit, but including community concerns as well as providing good career options for employees), but it comes off rather dry and lecturing. What is covered is indeed valuable and he knows whereof he speaks.However, in spite of some interesting details, such as Packard's debunking of the myth that HP's first big sale to Disney enabled the company to make the Fantasia soundtrack (it actually just offered a lower-cost alternative), this book does not have much flavor. It is also minimally revealing about the personalities of the founders - there is none of Packard's legendary irascibility on view and none of his notoriously conservative political views, and this lessens the interest of the story a great deal in my view. This is no Father, Son, & Co. about the founding Watsons of IBM. But it is a good solid introduction to a remarkable story. Moreover, little insight is given into the current difficult place that HP finds itself, as the company attempts to evolve in the rapidly changing business environment. It is written well.Recommended as a starting point, but you will need to look elsewhere to undestand the company as it operates today."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"If you thought that companies become admired by magic then think again - or better still, read the book.Bill Hewlett and David Packard created one of the worlds most admired companies and it has never stopped going from strength to strength, now with the likes of Carly Fiorina who has taken HP forward into the new millenium by going back to HPs roots.This book describes the start-up HP company and some of the aspects of its rapid growth and global expansion. There's not too much detail in this book but it does make for interesting reading - although the style is rather dry - for someone who holds up HP as a benchmark against which other companies can and should be measured. If you like me, like HP, then buy the book.Carly Fiorina has been quoted as saying &quot;in this new world we must always remember that technology is only as valuable as the use to which it is put.

Most every business in America owns at least one product from this company. From its humble beginnings in a Palo Alto garage, HP has grown into a massive electronics machine, racking up more than $45 billion in revenue for the 2001 year.As far as the company itself goes, Hewlett- Packard is definitely a success story and it's a respectable company from most every standpoint. William Hewlett and Dave Packard deserve credit for running an ethical organization that pays attention to its surroundings and strives to treat others fairly. However, this book, \\"The HP Way\\", is somewhat lacking in its coverage of the company and as a source of business inspiration. Dave Packard wrote the book by himself, with a little help from two friends who provided some editing assistance. Packard might be outstanding as a businessman, but he is not a professional writer. And his choice of two amateur editors doesn't help matters. He really should have hired a professional to help him compose this book.Packard gets a little sidetracked at times, too. The book starts out as a timeline, recounting important events and achievements from the past. Then, it strays from that course and starts talking about business planning and the ingredients for success. There's nothing wrong with this approach to writing a book, but Packard doesn't write in a smooth, continuous way. Instead, he reminisces about his times with Hewlett- Packard as though he is trying to cram as many tidbits of facts into one short book as he possibly can. Instead of providing the reader with stories about business struggles, personality conflicts, and resolutions, the book jumps around and includes snippets from events in the past. Because of this, there is no suspense at all in this book. It's basically just a summary of facts.Hewlett- Packard is a very large U.S. corporation, with a strong presence in both domestic and foreign markets. This book is just over 200 pages in length. In my opinion, this is far too little space to adequately cover an industry behemoth like Hewlett- Packard. The large- size print makes the book a quick read, but it also contributes to its inadequate coverage of the company.Dave Packard, and his partner William Hewlett, are legendary in the high tech business world. They built a huge corporate empire, starting with a simple electronic device assembled in a garage. The HP Way attempts to present the story of Hewlett- Packard and its rise to the top, but it fails to keep the interest of the reader, due to its unfocused style and lack of continuity. A corporation like Hewlett- Packard deserves better."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"Hewlett Packard is a now disgraced company that has severe problems to face in the future but this book will take you back to the HP of old.

As was Alfred Sloans book. Compare Packards book with Tom Waton, Jr.'s Book and you can see that the HP Way is mostly fluff. I will say that its a nice feel good story and I want to point out that I think Packard - as an engineer - wrote the book he thought he was supposed to write rather than the book he wanted to write.Its a shame that modern companies dont really have people like this running them as even this book clearly shows how the PC companies are sad and pathethic - imagine if Michael Dell, anybody at IBM, CSC, EDS or MicroSoft's Balmer and Gates would be like these guys?

Wonderful history."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"As the title indicate this book is about the story of Hewlett Packard as told by one of the founding partners David Packard. This book offers a corporate history of how the company started from the infamous garage into a global enterprise, but more importantly focuses on the guiding principles on which this company was built - the HP Way.What stands out in the HP Way is the deep commitment and belief in values and principles. These radiate from the founders and affect everyone and everything at HP. The HP Way covers all aspects of operations within the company and with external stakeholders (customers, shareholders etc.) in a way that transcends time and specific technologies (see below excerpts). Almost half a century later most of what is discussed is just as relevant than as it is now.HP is currently in a desperate need to revive the HP Way and transform itself in order to turn itself around and succeed in the future. A highly recommended read.Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1- \\"...it has been a guiding principle in developing and managing HP. Get the best people, stress the importance of teamwork, and get them fired up to win the game.\\"2- \\"We published a second version of the objectives in 1966 and they are as follows...1) Profit: To recognize that profit is the best measure of our contribution to society and the ultimate source of our corporate strength...2) Customers: To strive for continual improvement in the quality, usefulness, and value of the products and services we offer our customers...3) Field of Interest: To concentrate our efforts, continually seeking new opportunities for growth but limiting our involvement o fields in which we have capability and can make a contribution. 4) Growth: To emphasize growth as a measure of strength and a requirement for survival. 5) Employees : To provide employment opportunities for HP people that include the opportunity to share in the company's success, which they help make possible. To provide them job security based on performance, and to provide the opportunity for personal satisfaction that comes from a sense of accomplishment in their work. 6) Organization: To maintain an organizational environment that fosters individual motivation, initiative, creativity, and a wide latitude of freedom in working toward established objectives and goals. 7) Citizenship: To meet the obligations of good citizenship by making contributions to the community and to the institutions in our society which generate the environment in which we operate.\\"3- \\"An important element of the HP Way has to do with the company's relationship with its shareholders and the investment community. A primary objective in this area is to provide consistency in our corporate performance, including steady growth in earnings and equity.\\"4- \\"At that time our policy at HP was to regard increased market share as a reward for doing things well - for providing customers with superior products and services and keeping our costs down. This has been a basic policy from the very beginning of our company, and we expect it to continue in the future.\\"5- \\"The key to HP's prospective involvement in any field of interest is contribution. Our objective is to expand and diversify only when we can build on our present strengths, and with the recognition that we have the proven capability to make a contribution. To meet this objective, it is important that we put maximum effort into our product-development programs. This means we must continually seek new ideas for new and better kinds of products.\\"6- \\"The fundamental basis for success in the operation of Hewlett-Packard is the job we do in satisfying the needs of our customers. We encourage every person in our organization to think continually about how his or her activities relate to the central purpose of serving our customers.\\"7- \\"...gains in quality come from meticulous attention to detail and every step in the manufacturing process must be done as carefully as possible, not as quickly as possible. This sounds simple, but it is achieved only if everyone in the organization is dedicated to quality.\\"8- \\"It's imperative that there be a strong spirit of helpfulness and cooperation among all elements of the company and that this spirit be recognized and respected as a cornerstone of the HP Way.\\"9- \\"Although we minimize corporate direction at HP, we consider ourselves one single company, with the flexibility of a small company and the strengths of a large one - the ability to draw on corporate resources and services; shared standards, values, and culture; common goals and objectives; and a single world identity.\\"10- \\"I should point out that the successful practice of management by objective is a two-way street. Managers at all levels must be sure that their people clearly understand the overall objectives and goals of the company, as well as the specific goals of their particular division or department. Thus, managers have a strong obligation to foster good communication and mutual understanding. Conversely, their people must take sufficient interest in their work to want to plan it, to propose new solutions to old problems, and to jump in when they have something to contribute.\\""},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"The book talked only about the success but did not give explanations on how HP failed in some of its decision makings."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"This little book should be seen as a core text on modern management techniques. David Packard was obviously not the life and soul of the party. His writing style is plain and dull, and you may find that you learn more than you really need to know about resistance-stabilized audio oscillators (Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard established their business in the late nineteen-thirties in their now world-famous garage in Palo Alto, California, making electronic measuring instruments.)What shines through this book, however, is Packard's essential decency: a thoughtful, hard-working man with strong principles concerning a company's responsibilities, both to the community from which it springs and to the people whom it employs. The refreshing thing about Packard is that he is not in any sense paternalistic. He is crystal clear on the fact that the aim of the company is to make a profit - but in pursuit of the company's overarching aim: to make a contribution. Packard wants to make a product that improves people's lives and advances society. He wants to contribute something to the institutions of the community in which the company works - because without these institutions it would be harder for the company to do its job.Packard's management philosophy is simple, but seldom practised: decision-making should devolve to the level that is closest to the customer and to the real world; employees should be given a wide latitude of freedom in working towards established objectives; employees should, in every sense, share in the company's success; talent should be nurtured; employees should be offered job security where possible; people who buck the corporate trend may not necessarily be wrong; innovation is key, and it starts at the grass roots; the people who actually manufacture the goods have an important contribution to make as to how they are designed.In following these 'enlightened' management principles, Packard and Hewlett created a company that by 1997 was ranked 16 in the Fortune Global 500, with a turnover of $38 billion and $2.6 billion in profits.I was sceptical about the passionate support that some people express for 'The HP Way'. I read this short book, with its admitted lack of pace and verve, and it proved that the ways in which we have hoped that the corporations of the future might be managed are not only possible, but potentially hugely successful.There are potential pitfalls, however, in how such principles may be interpeted once the founding fathers of the corporation are no longer involved. When Hewlett and Packard retired from active management, John Young took over as the first professional manager of the company. A later CEO and Chairperson, Carly Fiorina, was famously dismissed in 2005 after six years as at HP. One of her concerns had been that HP had become '1000 tribes' and that the various HP sub-brands no longer had any coherent identity. Greater focus on what consumers wanted from HP (and huge cost-savings) could be achieved by bringing these tribes together. Fiorina said that creating this horizontal collaboration was not the same as centralising control.Was this an esential act of modernisation and market focus or was Fiorina abandoning the founders' core belief in devolution and 'The HP Way'? Probably the former, though Fiorina seems to have failed to persuade key figures at HP - especially key members of the board and the sons and daughters of the founders, who were also significant shareholders - that it was not the latter."},{"Title":"The HP Way: How Bill Hewlett and I Built Our Company","review":"This book chronicles Packard's account of the rise of HP. The company launched from Hewlett's garage to a become a Fortune 10 global giant with a $50B market cap in sixty short years. While his writing style displays all the tender compassion of an electronic oscilloscope, David insists that HP's values are the true core of the company's success. It is not what he and Hewlett did that caused the enterprise to triumph; it is how they did it, which Dave calls the \\"HP Way\\".After the dramatic past five years of rotating CEO's, board scandals, financial propriety concerns, it will be fascinating to watch new CEO Meg Whitman deal with the challenges of the new economy.

I was immediately dissapointed; each and every book was filled with generalizations based on anecdotal evidence and weak extrapolations from history and language. Although Haru Yamada's book is an exception in that it actually has real data in it, that data is merely the analysis of a three-person American meeting and a three person Japanese meeting. That is hardly a representative sample.The first thing you have to learn when attempting to interact with another culture is that culture does affect the way we communicate, and that bad experiences are often the result of misunderstanding. For someone with no experience with Japan, reading a book like this might be helpful. \\"Oh, OK. These are the things that I should watch out for.\\" But there is always the danger that people will take the contents as gospel. In my experience, expecting that the Japanese will act a certian way only increases frustration and actually impedes progress. Its much better to start off on a clean slate, and to keep in mind that culture might throw off your \\"gut\\" impressions, so give people the benefit of the doubt.What I would desperately like to see is a real linguistic study with hard conversation-derived data that merely attempts to discover what people DO, rather than how they ARE.

However, the way to adjust for them might be different. This book is only for those who really want to understand...."},{"Title":"Different Games, Different Rules: Why Americans and Japanese Misunderstand Each Other","review":"The very first page of this book made me wary. In an anecdotal style representative of the book as a whole, the author tells of her surprise at learning of the &quot;American&quot; version of Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper (cicada) in which the ants turn the grasshopper away during winter because he played all summer. She offers an alternative &quot;Japanese&quot; version in which the ants invite the grasshopper in to join a party because they worked so hard during the summer doing their &quot;role&quot; singing. She uses this to justify two polarized paradigms of communication (though not merely communication) for each culture: Japanese are interdependent and Americans are independent. (For some reason she never uses Westeners or even English speakers but always Americans). Interesting story but I thought it sounded suspicious. Well, guess what? After interviewing DOZENS of Japanese people from a variety of backgrounds and asking them to finish the story, I have YET to find anyone who can even believe the &quot;nice ant&quot; ending much less anyone who had heard it previously or offers it. Even when asked to brainstorm alternative endings, this ending never appears, however, grasshopper/cicada raids on the ant community do. Yamada disingenuously offers this footnote &quot;I have been told that a more literal translation of the original version exists in Japanese where the rejected grasshopper sadly walks away at the end of the story.&quot; Exists? Have been told? It doesn't merely exist but is the only version anyone seems to know. Furthermore, somehow she interprets this story as showing idealized American independence and &quot;the importance of fending for yourself.&quot; According to her, &quot;the point is that each person is responsible for his or her destiny&quot; while the Japanese version shows &quot;everyone has a role in society.&quot; Really? How can one justify that? How is the work ethic of a collective ant colony about fending for oneself? It would seem much more apt to describe some kind of socialist system. If this kind of interpretation of endings is valid, what about the endings offered in which the cicada invades the ants' mound? Sounds like Manchuria to me. The first page is indicative of the whole book. Things are overly stylized and distorted for academic symmetry. Anecdotes are highly spurious and sometimes only tenuously related to the point at hand. After the first page I simply couldn't accept any of them so that now looking back at the points of this book requires a pillar of salt. In fact, one gets the very distinct impression from the personal anecdotes given that, despite being a trained linguist specializing in cross-cultural communication, Yamada often just doesn't get the REAL point behind what people are saying or the genuine motivation for their actions. Exaggerations, misrepresentations, and stylizations abound obscuring what would otherwise be interesting points. Nonetheless, the book reads like an article from Ophrah's magazine (or what I would imagine they read like) if you inserted a bunch of romanized Japanese words with constant parenthetical translations (also the subject of some disagreement for many of the native speakers with whom I spoke). You finish the book almost as soon as you start. In particular, the &quot;quotes&quot; of parents instructing their children in each language were amusing. I have heard very similar things myself. The notes from the business meetings are interesting (particularly the Japanese section-head meeting) but watching her dissect the American meeting raises doubts in my mind about the validity of her Japanese analysis. She does introduce some interesting points but the sample is so small one feels distinctly disappointed in not getting to see these &quot;principles&quot; at work in other situations. It reminded me of the perfunctory &quot;labs&quot; that might go along with a Junior High science class. One of the things I enjoyed most about the book is the abundance of Japanese present. I actually learned a few useful words from this book, however, as most things in the book, they too become stylized. The discussion of AMAYAKASHISUGI (too sweet), WAGAMAMA (spoilt), TSUMETAI(cold), AND KATTE(selfish) is a good example. No one I spoke to agreed with the sharp opposition she set up among these terms. While this did provide for many interesting discussions, she should not have introduced these as terms defined merely by nurturer/nurtured over/under indulgence. For example, AMAYAKASHISUGI, to my understanding, might be better thought of as &quot;doting&quot; and used almost exclusively for parents. WAGAMA is not merely spoilt in the taking sense that we normally think of. In fact, the first situation I was given defining WAGAMAMA had a person giving a gift in expectation of a certain response and being disappointed not to receive it. Not what we expect exactly. TSUMETAI and KATTE simply aren't polarized in the way defined in the book. KATTE is not merely selfish but also snobbish. I was told a KATTE person may even get mad at the rain. TSUMETAI is used not only for under indulgent nurturers but also for the nurtured. Of course, a lot of the time nurturing is not the correct metaphor for the relationship and so this whole system breaks down anyway. Overall I found the book worth reading but not because it gave me answers. Quite the opposite. I found that it made me ask questions. Unfortunately, if you don't happen to have access to a large group of Japanese people to discuss these propositions with, I don't think you'll get nearly as much out of it. I actually think the central conceit of the book is correct, namely that Japanese communication grows out of a culture of interdependence and American communication from a culture of independence, however, the support for this thesis is mixed and often counterproductive."},{"Title":"Different Games, Different Rules: Why Americans and Japanese Misunderstand Each Other","review":"Ms Yamada has written an excellent reference book.

But the low stars goes for the mean spiritedness in this family. The low rent sister-in-law maybe a greedy gold digger but please--who said the children should pay for the mother's sins. The scathing treatment of the children is horrible. They are treated like her low rent offspring when they are also half the so called upper crust brother's. The upper crust brother who drinks, gambles and won't even buy a proper home to house his ever increasing clan. Even a new born baby is condemned as a devil's minion--no wonder they turn out 'witchy' when their own daddy showers more attention on the nephew and they get treated like dirt from the get-go.

Dorothea Frank writes of quirky characters and lush Southern environs in a way that anyone can enjoy the trip. The human foibles are not limited to the low country of South Carolina but her story gives a warm peek at that lifestyle. The story explores the relationships of Moms and daughters, complexities of sibling love, and coming to terms with the roots of one's own personality. I'm sure the Southern readers will love it - but don't hesitate if you are from elsewhere."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I was intrigued by the book and could not put it down. I love this author and cannot wait to read more of her Lowcountry tales. DBF truly captures the beauty of the region and the lacal character. Her descriptions are wonderful and her dialogue rings true (mostly).That being said, I had few &quot;issues&quot;. The main character, Caroline is not that likable. I was disapointed that while she was devasted that hew husband cheated on her, she condoned the affair that her brother carried on....The treatment of her sister-in-law Frances Mae was really appaling. Clearly this family had great wealth, class and style. However, ther were so snobbish to look down on Frances Mae because of her background. When Frances Mae gave birth on the side of the road the first htought was of the disgrace she bought to the family, not sympathy for the poor woman. I just felt that since Caroline was supposedly so lovely, she should have exercised greater compassion. I also found the last hundred pages rather melodramatic and all of the voodoo stuff (in great detail!) got a little old.As I said, this was worth the time to read and I lov ethe author. Sullivan's Island was definately better!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Oh if only Dorothea Frank had bothered to check her facts!! This author tried to add a sense of reality by adding so many incorrect \`local' tidbits to this string of incredibly saccharin 10,000 words that it becomes painful. For example, set in present day South Carolina one of the character's relatives goes to jail for writing a bad check for property taxes. Folks, in South Carolina that ain't a crime. Stupid, yes. However, in South Carolina it won't land you in jail (Hmmm...but it probably should). The word \\"bubba\\" is bandied around quite a bit. Funny, I've lived here a little over half my life and never heard the word \`bubba' in conversation. The word \\"beaux\\", yes. Bubba no. One of the characters worries yet another relative will \`wind up at the bottom of Lake Murray.' If only our author had taken the time to glance at a MAP. A swamp, maybe. Lake Moultrie, or Lake Marion, perhaps. Lake Murray? Kind of a haul from where the story takes place. These people eat GUMBO for cryin' out loud. These South Carolina purebloods are eatin' Cajun? Really? Whatever happened to good ol' shrimp and grits, Beaufort stew or any of the many low country specialties?Basically, this story plays on every stereotype of the gentility of Southern life while conveniently forgetting all the murkier and darker issues, such as race relations. Just string a few of them together in your mind, throw in a sickly sweet ending, and you've saved yourself an afternoon.At least Pat Conroy gets his facts straight."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I can't help but wonder if the previous readers and I read the same book.

WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! I did enjoy it, though, when DBF had the two characters meet up toward the end of the book-maybe someday she will write a book mainly about their friendship. I liked Caroline's character &amp; how she finally got up the gumption to leave her cheating, lowlife hubby &amp; take her son to stay at Tall Pines. I can't decide which character was my favorite, Caroline, Lavinia or Millie-all are good, strong women &amp; they keep you turning the pages. All in all, a terrific story that I highly recommend.

Can Caroline be the next Queen of the Tall Pines Plantation? Does she want to be?PLANTATION gives readers a first person glimpse into the life of Caroline after she leaves the plantation for the big city and the very eventful return some sixteen years later. As Caroline tells her story, readers will be thrilled with bits and pieces of Miss Lavinia's journal, plus Miss Laviana's thoughts as they talk to the reader in first person.Ms. Frank does a wonderful portrayal of the plantation, events, and the people in this southern state. At times, I could almost smell the fresh cut grass, hear the siren song of the winding river, and bask in the shadows of the tall pines. Even though Caroline's family is dysfunctional, the first person narrative and the pages from Miss Lavinia's journal, make this a must read of the summer.Grab a glass of iced tea, put on a jazz CD, and enjoy the yarn of a true southern family.Debbie GilbertReviewer for Romance Reviews Today"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"There were many interesting social/spiritual issues to address--all written in a captivating style.

It was very funny though... yes, it has many Southern cliches, but cliches start somewhere. I just wondered when Ms. Benthon Frank came to supper at my house to get ideas for the white trash sister-in-law, that was one hilarious dinner around chapter 10. One thing I would mention is that if you are having trouble with PTSD in light of Sept 11th, save this book for later. There is one horrifying chapter involving a plane crash, explosion, burning body, and ashes and body parts everywhere. I might be ultra sensitive because a FDNY captain is very important to me, but it was a very hard chapter to read and set off some PTSD episodes for me. Still an enjoyable book...

The foreshading was too obvious, and the characters stereotypical. I think perhaps it would have been an ok read if there wasn't so much filler in between the story. I couldn't make it to the end.

I love reading about the low country,something so captivating about the South. This story is great,and keeps you interested all the way through.I never regret reading any of her books."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Why, oh why did Ms. Frank's editor let this book go out with the first 250 pages as they are? This would be a great book if you start at page 250 and get someone to tell you briefly what is in the first part. More people in the South will sympathize with Fannie Mae than with stuck-up Caroline. Siddion's had the right formula with classy-girl-from-poor-family. This looks like no-class family does a sudden and unbelievable turn-around."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I hated this book. It is, from cover-to-cover, chock-full of cliches. The faithful black family retainers; the silly, southern belle best friends; the wacky mother (Lavinia);the conflicted main character (Caroline).I also found the book a little anti-semitic in that the most vile character in the book is Caroline's Jewish husband who tells her he will come to see her mother \\"after she's dead\\". Caroline's brother, who treats his wife and children like second class citizens, however, is given all sorts of excuses for his behavior and given a pass on an affair, all the while Caroline is criticizing her husband for his sexual proclivities. Ridiculous.I thought Lavinia's illness was a cheap shot plot point to garner the reader's sympathy. I just kept wishing for Lavinia to die already.I also found that \\"yanh\\" southern dialect for \\"hear\\" EXTREMELY annoying, as it was on every other page.It is mystifying to me that so many people gave this book 4 and 5 stars. Evidently a great number of people have never read good literature"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"With her second book about the Lowcountry of South Carolina, Dorothea Benton Frank showcases her flair for describing Southern styles, recipes and family traditions. Whether fact or stereotype, her depictions of Lowcountry life teem with hilarity and exquisite scenes from nature. The river Edisto comes to life in all her majesty under DBF's pen. Her characters are well-formed, truly interesting and captivate the reader from page one. I didn't think she could outdo Sullivan's Island, but apparently DBF proved this reader wrong.'Plantation' revolves around the Wimbley family of Tall Pines Plantation and its mistress, Miss Lavinia. When her daughter Caroline moves home to Tall Pines after leaving her husband, Miss Lavinia is thrilled. Caroline must readjust to Lowcountry life after living the last fifteen years in New York and urge her son, Eric, to get to know the family. Interesting is an understatement when it comes to this family! From Caroline's hard-drinking, fishing-crazed brother, Trip, to Millie, the pseudo estate manager and resident hocus-pocus expert, DBF is an unending well of characters full of vitality and Southern sass.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys witty prose, and especially anyone who grew up with a southern mother. Keep 'em coming, Dorothea, yanh?"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"WOW!!! What a great book! Ms. Frank made us wait for her wonderful story of a crazy southern family but it was worth every minute of it!!! I just didn't believe there could be another exciting story to tell after Sullivan's Island, but Plantation is terrific!!!From the very first page to the last word, it was truly the a most entertaining story that does not follow the typical plot of so many novels-thank you Ms. Frank for the spicy twist! I loved each and every character and felt a part of that crazy family. (A Southern thing). Reading this book is like taking a wonderful summer vacation!!!I reccommend Plantation to everyone that needs a little summer fun..."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I am enjoying this book but it will not be an all time favorite but do love Miss Lavinia's Journal!!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"A love story, an escape to discounted, a personal family experience.

So glad there is a sequel that I will start tonight. The story kept me intrigued all the way. I could so relate to the mother, daughter, and even daughter in law.

I am huge fan of southern authors and the descriptions used in this book made me feel like I was there."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"The book told a good story. The characters were very interesting and I found the book to be very entertaining."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"This was my first introduction to Dorothea Benton Frank, but it won't be the last book I purchase from her.This is an endearing and charming tale about a family that is ultimately brought together through a very difficult time. Ms. Frank has the ability to weave humor, folklore, history, and just plan fun throughout the story. I truly found this book to be amazing!One of my favorite authors is Pat Conroy. I have read all of his books. Ms. Frank seems to share his ability to tell a story and keep his/her audience totally engrossed and comitted to the read.There are funny, sad, intelligent, nasty, good, sweet, innocent, and centered characters in this book. Ms. Frank has a marvelous ability to bring each character to life and to make the reader feel that this is either someone already known to them or someone you would love to know.I can't say enough about the beautiful writing that is in this book. I actually cried and am not one to do that freely. So that surprised me a lot. It was worth it. A great author and a great read!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"After returning to the Plantation, Ms Benton Frank really hits her stride with passion and knowledge of the ACE basin in the Gullah Low Country of South Carolina. By mixing life stories from all facets of this particular plantation, the reader is drawn into a comforting fold of Southern Life, making you one of the family. The book is so enjopyable, I felt as if I was a vouyeristic member of the family peeking in on all the secrets.I read this book AM and PM, and was only dissapointed that it ended. Ms Benton Franks writing is evolving into a much crisper, more joined together style than Sullivan's Island, with a better grasp and flow of the wonderful story of rediscovery of ones true heritage and inner self.I loved this book, please keep 'em comming!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Here is a book to hold to your heart, it is that good. And before I even get to the fun, lively and irresistible plot, let me just say that we know on page one that Miss Lavinia, our own Low Country Auntie Mame, has passed away. And yet at the end, when we have finished getting to know her and attend her death and funeral, I was crying like a baby. And I don't cry at books!!The plot to this book is true to Dotty Frank's genre: displaced Low Country gal comes home, gets mesmerized, and slowly regains her roots. In this case, the woman is Caroline Wimbley Levine, married to a cold and smug psychiatrist, Richard, and living in equally cold luxury in New York with their beloved son Eric.When Caroline hears from her brother Trip that their mother, Lavinia, is losing her marbles and must be put in assisted living, Caroline grabs Eric and goes home for what she thinks will be for a few days. And there she is caught up in the gullah magic; the Low Country mystique (in which I thoroughly believe, thanks to Dotty's wonderful books) and a chance to become, once again, the \\"real\\" Caroline.This might be the best of the four books Dotty Frank has so-far written. I cannot praise it highly enough. Grab it and lose yourself in a truly wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Great summer read, yanh!If you are looking for a great summer beach book, try Plantation by Dorothea Benton Frank. Even better than Sullivan's Island, it is such great fun reading this lowcountry tale. The family is dysfunctional enough to be Southern, eccentric enough to make you laugh out loud, and human enough to make you cry. The matriarch, Miss Lavinia, is a hoot! I was torn between cringing at her antics and yet wanting to be like her in my old age. The battles between Miss Lavinia's daughter, Mrs. Caroline Wimbley Levine, and her perpetually pregnant low-life sister-in-law rage on while the crown prince son drinks on amidst gambling, infidelity, and a cast of zany supporting characters. All of the ordinary story elements are here -wealth, marriages in crisis, parenting, the struggle to be independent balanced against the need to go home. However, Dorothea Benton Frank has made the characters come alive in such a delightful way that Thomas Wolfe is proved wrong - you can go home again! After weeks of searching for the perfect summer read, I finally found it! Any book with a chapter titled, &quot;Miss Lavinia Would Like to Have a Word with You&quot;, just has to be read!"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Caroline Wimbley could list a million reasons for untying herself from her flamboyant mother Lavinia's apron strings and escaping to New York City to marry herself off to the first unsuitable man who looked her way. She's hasn't felt close to Lavinia in eons--ever since Daddy died and Lavinia simply quit being a mother.While the passing yawn of years has not played out as passionately as Caroline once hoped, she considers herself well married, happily self employed, and deliriously happy with her bright, but somewhat academically challenged young son.Going home to the Queen of Tall Pines Plantation where she and her brother Tripp were raised did not occupy a high spot on Caroline's list of priorities. Fate rears her fickle head, cackles noisily, and sets her sights firmly on Caroline's life.A rare phone call from her brother Tripp suggests the possibility that mother Lavinia has taken leave of her senses. Caroline rushes home &quot;to see about mother.&quot;From the moment Caroline sets foot on the grounds of the plantation,little appears to have changed. Everything is just as beautiful as she remembers. But Caroline soon realizes that surface appearances mean little. Unflattering family secrets lurk in every branch of the Wimbley family, and promise to wreck havoc in everyone's lives.The only that the only thing that is for certain is that Lavinia, while as eccentric as ever, is perhaps the only member of the Wimbley crew who is in full control of her sanity.Plantation is both bust-a-gut funny and chock full of low country wisdom. Ms. Frank's ability to entice her characters to get up and dance off the page makes this endearing novel more than just a story. It is a tribute to the south I grew up with, where what is said, what is done and what is felt seldom means the same thing. This tale is rich with southern familiarity, and our infamous tawdry secrets.Frank's spellbinding ability to spin a yarn nudges the reader gently along as we each come remember the ties that bind us to family. Anyone who's ever both loved and hated a mother will leave this story yearning to feel safe in Momma's care just one more time.Bravo, Dorothea Benton Frank. You done good, you did."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I was excited to find Plantation on the last day of my beach vacation and couldn't wait to get home to start reading it as I had thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Frank's debut novel - Sullivan's Island - and knew what to expect from this gifted storyteller. Plantation was another wonderful read, full of both endearing as well as dysfunctional characters who literally come to life on the page. I read a lot of novels and occasionally one touchs my soul; Plantation was such a book. I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. Hopefully we can look forward to more books from this very accomplished author."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"&quot;You know those pivotal moments in your life that you don't see coming? The ones you wished arrived with a timer going off so you'd know this is it! Well, when the phone rang in February, you couldn't have convinced me that six months later, Mother would be in &quot;the box&quot; and I'd be wearing her pearls, twisting them around my finger exactly like she used to do.&quot; So begins &quot;Plantation&quot; the tale of Caroline Wimbley Levine and her flamboyant mother, Miss Lavinia, &quot;the ACE basin version of Auntie Mame.&quot; Add to that a practicing psychiatrist husband with more bats in his belfry than the Sistine Chapel, an alcoholic, gambling brother with a perpetually pregnant white trash wife and three uncivilized kids, and you have a book you can't to put down. But Dottie Frank, best selling author of &quot;Sullivan's Island,&quot; was not quite satisfied with her cast of characters. She created an intelligent, organized female plantation overseer who sees that the entire family doesn't jump headlong into the Edisto River. Not done yet, the author then puts life into a young dreadlocked Kama Sutra lover who makes Caroline &quot;twitch in places she didn't even know were nerve endings.&quot; Caroline has been living in New York City for fifteen years when she is called home by her brother, Tripp, who fears that Miss Lavinia, the Queen of Tall Pines Plantation, has popped her cork. As the only daughter, it's high time, so says her brother, that Caroline gets herself on back home to see about the situation. (Situations are what the Wimbleys call family trouble.) Like any good daughter, Caroline flies south to tend to Mama and by doing so, once again becomes involved in the dysfunctional family antics that sent her dashing off to New York City in the first place. Plantation is delightful. As a former South Carolina Low Country woman myself, Dottie Frank's words were so beautifully painted on the page that I could almost feel the cool, dark waters of the Edisto River and smell the dirt that surrounds it. Southerners will love the richness with which Benton Frank writes of family secrets, tantalizing the reader to become as enmeshed in their &quot;situation&quot; as Caroline, Tripp, Millie and the ever zany Miss Lavinia. This bright new star on the literary horizon writes from the heart. You will put the book down for only one reason: to wipe the tears of laughter from your eyes."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Caroline Wimbley Levine was reared in southern tradition, on a plantation that her family has owned for generations. Her brother Trip has strayed a bit but is still part of the \\"good ole boy\\" generation that sips their bourbon freely, and never speaks of financial matters or politics when the ladies are present. Miss Lavinia is the Lady of the manor and is about to leave things in the questionably competent hands of her children.The author gives us characters that ooze with substance and strength. She is luminous in her presentation of family ties and the love between siblings that miles or years cannot erase. There are some amusing secrets to be uncovered as the author weaves a wonderful story of family loyalty and expectation.I was pleased to find yet another wonderful adventure from the Southern Low Country. After Thoroughly enjoying SULLIVAN'S ISLAND I couldn't wait to pick up another book written by this author. I was not disappointed. I have placed Dorothea Benton Frank on my favorite authors list and so should you. 12/27/01"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"For every daughter who has lost her mother to a terminal illness, this is a MUST read. For every reader who revels in the upper-middle-class Southern life, this is a MUST read. For everyone who enjoys a novel with humor, distinctive local color, and amazing insights into self-discovery, this is a MUST read.The story begins at the funeral of Miss Lavinia and her daughter Caroline takes us on a tour of pivotal moments that led to this day. The family relationships that bind us, the heritage we can run from but never escape, the unending parade of people who leave their prints on the canvas of our lives, are all examined with wit and passion. Dorothea Benton Frank is remarkable in the way she draws you into the story and makes you a part of life with Caroline. In New York or back at Tall Pines Plantation, I felt like Caroline's shadow, suffering every indignity with her, rejoicing in every happy event with her.Caroline's journey of self-discovery leads her to some revealing truths about the nature of mother-daughter relationships, the misunderstandings that bruise hearts, the reunions that make us realize no matter how our lives differ from our mothers, we are forever and thankfully so our mother's daughter, her true and lasting spitting image.So curl up with Caroline and her nearest and dearest: Trip, her hard-drinking brother and quintessential Southern good ole boy; her trashy sister-in-law Frances Mae; her surrogate mother and housekeeper Millie; her precocious son Eric; her repulsive husband Richard, and most of all Miss Lavinia, the larger-than-life mother Caroline must come to terms with before she can become the person she was destined to be."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Caroline Wimbley Levine is a South Carolina native living in New York City, married to a Jewish psychiatrist, mother of a darling young boy, running a decorating business, and about to turn 40. Life has been pretty good to her. She thought.When Caroline answers a call from her brother, Trip, saying their mother needs to be placed in assisted living, she makes a trip home to the Low Country of South Carolina to check things out. Her mother, Lavinia, a flamboyant but oh so well bred matron, seems like the same old Lavinia to her. The problem seems to be Trip's trashy wife, Frances Mae, pregnant again and longing to live at Tall Pines, Lavinia's ancestral home. Satisfied that Frances Mae's designs have been nipped in the bud and Lavinia is fine, Caroline heads back home to New York. It isn't long, however, before her marriage goes South and, at loose ends, she packs up her child and heads back to Tall Pines.More than the story of Caroline &quot;finding herself&quot; and growing up at the age of 40, this is a witty, intelligent, sensitively written tale of home and family and relationships. No matter who you are or where you live, you are sure to see glimpses of yourself, your friends, and your family as we watch Caroline learn to date, discern the difference between love and sex, mend fences with her only sibling, and discover the woman beneath the facade of her mother. And don't we all have a relative somewhere who needs a good, swift kick kick in the pants?! It is a pleasure watching Caroline grow enough backbone to send ol' Frances Mae down the road to her comeuppance.The novel enters its most poignant phase with Lavinia's diagnosis of melanoma. It is during Lavinia's illness that Caroline finally finds her mettle and comes into her own. It sure made me think about my own familial relationships and strengths and how I will handle these trials when they come. And they will. This book is a wonderful treasure trove of wisdom and lessons, and I am richer for having read it."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I love this book.

I found myself alternating between not being able to put this book down and wishing it wouldn't end. The story and it's characters were quirky but believable. I have recommended (strongly!!) that the members of my book club make this their next reading selection. The characters are so memorable and I found myself thinking about them even when I wasn't reading the book. I know they will make for great discussion. I may have been born in the north but I must have a southern soul. Having been to the Charleston area several times it was great fun to be able to relate to many of the places identified in the book.

Living on the Gulf Coast, it is easy to slip into the Lowcountry especially the way Frank paints it. And what a cast of characters she serves up.

This one is a winner."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I read Sullivan's Island sitting on the beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and just loved it. I loved it so much that I looked on Amazon.com to see if Dorothea Benton Frank had written anything else. She had not...disappointed. When I found Plantation also on Amazon.com around Christmas I was excited. I have a stack of books to read, but when this one came, I started right in on it. I was NOT disappointed. The book is wonderful. Ms. Frank has a wonderful way of making you vizualize everything. I seem to be able to see this Planation and all the people in the story. I finished it three days ago, I have recommended it to about 20 people...please Ms. Frank, hurry and write the next GREAT story."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I bought this book because I live in the Lowcountry. I should have learned something from buying the first one. I can think of only one or two local cliches that were left out. The character of Caroline is so thoroughly unlikeable that at first you don't realize she's the very same character as the heroine of the first book (Sullivan's Island) in a different setting. I think Ms. Frank can probably do a LOT better if she will just write about the characters without trying to get every single nugget of Lowcountry trivia within the pages of one book. Maybe this would not bother someone who is not from around here (or is it &quot;yanh?&quot;). It makes me feel like anyone who reads it gets a very distorted picture of what folks here are really like. Most of us don't worship our ancestors, lie about them, go to the Cotillion or have an African American mother figure to bring them up. Just plain silly. The breathless internal monologue of the self-absorbed Caroline made for some awfully tedious reading, and hardly changed from the first page through her father's funeral, her divorce, her bedroom escapades. I so hope the rest of the country will not judge us by this book or the previous one. This is truly not who we are."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I have read her books before and really enjoyed them. This one is really good too.

Though it will become a tried and true formula for her in subsequent books, the heartfelt telling of this story and the genuine affection that the reader will inevitably feel for the characters made \\"Plantation\\" stand out for me.

She thought she was better off for leaving her roots behind, but a call from her brother leads her back to Tall Pines, where she grew up. Her brother and his low life wife want to place their wealthy mom into a home so that they can take over her Plantation. Caroline discovers her mother better than she ever remembered her, and soon she finds her old life might suit her better than the one she's created.Caroline goes home to New York, only to face the truth about her deeply disatisfying marriage. She returns with her son \\"home\\" to South Carolina to live in her childhood home. The bond developed between Caroline and her mother is heartwarming and strong, as is that with her brother. The family pulls together to pull him out of his bind.Although this story has its share of sadness and unfortunate events, the family's ability to pull together and come through makes it more uplifting than depressing. Miss Lavinia, Caroline's mother, is a particularly spirited and enjoyable character. Her friends and helpers -- especially her estate manager Millie, a woman who claims special powers -- are also pertinant and effective people in the story. All of the characters are well developed, and help make this story one you will crawl right into."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I read Sullivan's Island last year and recommended it to every reader I know. I never thought Frank could maintain her record with her sophomore effort but was delighted to find I was wrong. Frank combines Anne Rivers Siddons' deft portrayal of eccentic Southern families and the ties that bind (or strangle) and Conroy's loving depiction for the Lowcountry and its lyric beauty.. Plantation is a wonderful book and I loved every minute of it. Absorbing but not heavy."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"OK, so maybe I'm biased because I'm from South Carolina and knew where and what the author described. But even without the bias, this author did a jam up job. This is the first novel I've read by this author and was thoroughly impressed. And in reality I picked up the book at a grocery store because I needed something to read and it looked better than my other choices. But it turned out to be a great choice. Benton draws the reader in with her southern dialect and her conspiratorial tone. One of those novels , that although not highly suspenseful, the reader still has a tough time walking away. I highly recommend it to anyone from anywhere. If you haven't had the opportunity to visit the lowcountry in Charleston, SC read this novel and get an inside look of the beauty and culture. And if you've been a visitor to this beautiful area you'll enjoy this colorful tale even more."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"If you love a good story about the south, or even if you just love to laugh out loud when you're the only one home you've got to read Plantation. My mother and I bought this book at the same time and we just love to get together and discuss the delightful, zany characters and their equally zany lives. The story revolves around a woman,Caroline, who had moved from the ACE Basin of South Carolina to bustling New York City for college to escape her cantankerous mother, Lavinia. When Caroline's brother calls to tell her that &quot;Miss Lavinia&quot; has tried to shoot him, Caroline rushes home to &quot;see about Mother&quot; only to find that life on Tall Pines Plantation has not changed one bit, but that maybe she has. Be prepared to sit for hours with this book as you won't want to put it down for fear of missing one of Lavinia's episodes."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"PLANTATION by Dorothea Benton FrankPLANTATION is the second book I've read by the author Dorothea Benton Frank. I was not thrilled with her first book, SULLIVAN'S ISLAND. But I already had PLANTATION in my pile of books to be read, and many have told me that this book was much better than her first. So, I read it.PLANTATION, like SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, is a story that takes place in the \\"low country\\" of South Carolina. This area includes Sullivan's Island (outside of Charleston) as well as the ACE basin, the area where the Ashepoo, Combahee, and the Edisto Rivers join at St Helena's Sound. It's a picturesque area of beauty that only nature could create, and it is near the Edisto River on a plantation called Tall Pines Plantation that the bulk of this story takes place.Caroline Wimbley Levine's search for happiness is one of the main themes of this book. She's married to a man that was once her professor in college, and while at one time in her life she loved this man with a passion, she is now at a point where she needs her space.The plot though is not as simple as that. Caroline is fighting demons in her head. She's grown up almost hating her mother for a past that started with her father's death. When her brother Trip asks her to come home to check on their mother's mental stability, Caroline does just that. After being gone for so many years, the memories come flooding back, memories of her father, the only parent she thought she loved, and a mother that abandoned them emotionally after their father had passed on. She becomes reacquainted with her brother and his wife, the lowly Frances Mae, who seems so uncouth that she embarrasses the entire family, including Trip. Through it all, she finds that she can come back home again, finds that she has bonded with her mother again, and returns to New York a much happier person.However, things in New York have not changed. Upon returning she finds that her husband has been unfaithful to her, and the scene where she confronts the two of them is something I will never forget. Now that her marriage to her husband Richard has failed, her mother's warnings about marrying Richard haunt her. It seems that no matter what she does, her mother never approves. She can never live up to her mother's high expectations. Now, with her husband left behind in New York, Caroline hopes to start a new life in South Carolina. With her son Eric, she moves back to Tall Pines Plantation with her mother.Another theme of this book is the unforgettable character of Miss Lavinia, Caroline's mother. She is a woman of southern class and is so outgoing and gregarious that she is almost a caricature of a woman of the Deep South. Lavinia is loved by all, and even Caroline cannot help but love her mother, who outside of her faults, is such a likeable person, but a formidable force in the family and amongst those who live their lives around her. As the reader learns about Caroline's past, we also learn about Lavinia's crazy life.The story is told in the first person, changing narrators between Lavinia and Caroline. Through this narration, we learn why Lavinia behaved the way she did and why she treated her children so horribly after losing her husband. We also learn about Trips internal demons, and how his father's death truly affected his life into adulthood. PLANTATION is not a simple story. It's a complex tale of a family that is falling apart, but through it all Caroline and Lavinia find a way to keep them together, and they both find the peace that they have been looking for all their lives."},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"Plantation is a heartwarming story of a woman who returns to her home to find herself and to find forgiveness.When Caroline gets a call from her brother, Trip, telling her that their mother, Miss Lavinia, is in need of assistance, she leaves her home in Manhattan and returns to Tall Pines. This is her ancestral home, which she left as a young woman.The book is interspersed with snippets from Miss Lavinia's journal, which describe her point of view in addition to the first person narration by Caroline. We learn about Caroline's marriage to an Englishman, who just happens to be Jewish.Throughout the course of this book, you get an idea of how strong a person Caroline is. She doesn't realize it until toward the end of the book. You also get an idea of the strained relationship between her and Miss Lavinia, and Trip, her brother.Trip plays a part in the story, although the predominant characters are Miss Lavinia, Caroline and her son, Eric.The relationships are well developed and well thought out.Miss Frank has done a wonderful job of mingling some trivia regarding the ACE Basin in the South Carolina Lowcountry with a touching story and blends it with a bit of humor.I rate this book 5 stars. It is certainly one that I will recommend to my friends.Marguerite Nico 2/10/02"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"I read Sullivan's Island last year sometime and when this book came out in paperback, I thought I'd wait and read some more &quot;enlightening books,&quot; till my online reading buddies urged me to read this book. So I ordered it to read on a cold wintery day. Only the flu befell me and this was the best book to read in bed ~~ it is easy read. If I had to pick a book in between naps, I would pick this one!I have always been a fan of Southern fiction and this book has propelled itself to the top of the list. It's wonderfully saucy!!The book is written from Caroline's point of view. She escapes Tall Pines to New York ~~ only to come home years later to her mother when in the midst of marital woes. Originally, she escaped from her home and mother because she viewed her mother as this selfish woman when her father died ~~ only to realize that her perceptions of her mother isn't what she thought she was. And she begins to painstakingly restore her relationship with her mother and brother on her journey of self-discovery. This book is a wonderful exploration of a mother-daughter relationship set in the lush low-country of South Carolina.Frank writes with vivid descriptions of Tall Pines and it's proximity to the river ~~ and she injected humor throughout the whole book ~~ that even when you are crying, you are laughing too. It's a wonderful easy read and one that I would recommend for any mother with daughters to read. It may not be the best literary book in the world, but who cares? It's a book that allows you to escape for a short while into the characters' lives. And isn't that what a book is supposed to do once in awhile?"},{"Title":"Plantation: A Lowcountry tale","review":"This is the first Dorothea Benton Frank book I've read and I must admit, I'm hooked!

It is a brilliant story of a family's struggle to be themselves,to carry on the family traditions that are so important and shows a strong family bond of love and trustI can't wait for the next book from MS Benton."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"I'm a long-time fan of the \\"Schemer\\" series of books and was excited to receive my preordered copy of \\"The Reasoned Schemer\\" yesterday- It was supposed to be published in July but must have been held up until now...I have no relationship with any of the authors and just want to put my $0.02 in on it, since not many others may have a copy yet- I think it is absolutely FANTASTIC so far!The book itself is very much in the same style as the rest of the \\"Schemers\\"- A Q&A; style of exposition that helps your brain to absorb most of the essence of a new programming style without having to spend the time to write tons of actual code yourself to learn the basic philosophy.The main purpose of the book is to attach a set of logic programming commands to the core R5RS scheme that allow you to implement all kinds of cool things, such as constraint programming, pattern matching, nondeterministic programming, and PROLOG-like logical reasoning. The material covered is not too dissimilar from the material in the back of \\"On Lisp\\" or some parts of SICP. What distinguishes it is that the implementation used has been widdled down to its bare essence and uses a syntax modeled on standard FP scheme syntax. Plus, the subject matter is treated with a certain academic rigor that gives these new commands the feeling of a practical toolset instead of just a clever novelty. I could imagine incorporating these commands into my regular scheme code...As I mentioned, there is a list of new mysterious scheme commands that enable the logic reasoning abilities- They look superficially like the standard FP commands in scheme, but behave slightly different- They have names such as \\"conde\\", \\"caro\\", etc. There are also a couple of commands with no FP scheme analogue, such as \\"run\\" and \\"fresh\\". Using these new commands, logical reasoning can be mixed with standard FP scheme pretty seamlessly. An appendix at the end of the book implements the full set of commands- It totals about 150 LOC in length.I'm still only partially into the book, but just wanted to let folks know that this book has some really mind-blowing ideas and may be the answer to those, like me, who are still searching for a resource that will allow them to \\"get\\" PROLOG-like languages and want to learn how to incorporate such techniques into their programming projects with the least amount of fuss possible.[...]"},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"As the saying goes, if you like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing you'll like. The authors have extended the approach of their classic book _The Little Schemer_ to encompass what is usually called logic programming, but which they refer to as \\"relational programming\\" (a much better name, in my opinion). They extend the Scheme language with relational analogues of many constructs, notably lambda and cond (in many, many variations), and also provide extended versions of standard Scheme operations like cons, car, and cdr. Basically, the relational approach involves taking the result of a function call and making it just another argument, but a special argument that can get assigned to as the result of the computation. Big deal, so what? you ask. The important thing is that _all_ of the function arguments behave this way, so that you can specify the result of a function (relation) and ask the system to generate the arguments. For instance, instead of saying 2 + 2 = X and figuring out what X is, you can say X + 2 = 4 and the system will figure out what X has to be (in this case... ummm... oh yeah, 2). To do this, the system uses a mechanism called \\"backtracking\\" which systematically tries alternatives until it either finds the answer, gives up, or (if you didn't program the search right) goes on forever. If you haven't seen this style of programming before, this book will definitely open your eyes.The relational/logic programming style is usually learned by studying the Prolog language, which is how I learned it (though I'm no expert). Having a knowledge of Prolog will definitely make this book easier to understand, although the approach given here is more modern than Prolog in several ways. For one thing, the named relations of Prolog are replaced here by anonymous relations (analogous to lambda expressions being anonymous functions), and for another, the (somewhat brutal) \\"cut\\" operator of Prolog, which is used to control backtracking, is ignored in favor of more subtle approaches involving interleaving solutions and giving up after single results are found.I think the approach of learning-by-pattern-recognition that all the \\"Little X\\" books use is fairly effective here, though I think a lot of readers (meaning me) wouldn't mind a more extended discussion of the mechanics of the system.All in all, if you liked _The Little Schemer_ and are curious about new ways of programming, you should definitely pick up a copy of this book. It will stretch your mind like a Slinky, and when you're done you'll have learned a new way of looking at programming."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"So. I read the Little Lisper a couple of years ago and enjoyed it. I finally got around to buying this book last night for my new Kindle. BIG mistake. It is unreadable. The font size can only be changed for the preface, acknowledgements and contents overview. The actual meat of the book CANNOT be altered with any settings on the Kindle. It's not a PDF so I can't zoom and the font is soooo small (about a millimeter high) it is unreadable even with 20/15 vision!I wish I could actually comment on the book itself...Buy the dead tree version."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"Fans of the \\"Little Books\\" (The Little Schemer - 4th Edition,The Seasoned Schemer) will find an interesting introduction to logic programming here. I found \\"The Reasoned Schemer\\" unique in that it has no preconceptions of logic programming being \\"special.\\" It dives right into the subject! If you know some rudimentary Scheme or Lisp you will start \\"thinking logically\\" without even being introduced to old fashioned terms like \\"backtracking\\" or \\"cuts\\" (or, for over a hundred pages, even \\"unification\\").Some readers might object to the books use of a coding style that is not executable Scheme. To my surprise I found the source format a great help to readability. Translating the text into executable Scheme code was effortless even though the book assumes that you will figure how to run the code for yourself (search engines and a little experimentation should quickly lead you to miniKanren). Probably the weakest part of the book is an overly long and tedious development of a system of arithmetic, but that example does demonstrate how far logic programs can go. I was somewhat alarmed by the incredibly terse implementation note at the end of the book. I'd be surprised if most readers would just \\"get\\" the implementation strategy.While I enjoyed working through this book I had the nagging suspicion that it might not be the introduction to logic programming I would personally recommend. To check for an example I reopened my (unfortunately long neglected) copy ofParadigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp. I have to conclude that Norvig's 18 year old chapter on Prolog still seems a more succinct and complete introduction. But then I'm tainted by having programmed in Prolog before, and I also have to consider that \\"AI\\" is so unhip today that few newly minted programmers would go pick up that old classic. So go ahead, get yourself a copy of The Reasoned Schemer. It is a book that no truly curious programmer will regret reading. Not even those that unify every day."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"First a word about The Reasoned Schemers soul-brother \\"The Little Schemer\\":I read the Little Schemer from one end to the other, and I simply adored it. It taught me so much that I hadn't really grasped before, and it taught me how to program. I can't recommend The Little Schemer hight enough for persons who wants to know what programming is really about.The Reasoned Schemer builds on the same idea, and I was therefor very eager to get started with it. Unfortunately, even though this book follows the same recipe as The Little Schemer, the actual implementation of this recipe is very poorly conducted. Where The Little Schemer was careful in its stepwise built-up of knowledge, making certain no assumptions were left unexplained, this book seems to have been written more hurriedly - the author seems to have forgotten to clear his mind for all the stuff that he finds obvious, but which the intended group of readers is in fact only just beginning to learn. I think the basic idea behind these books really has something going for it. Reading this book, I realize a good recipe also need a good cook and good preparation. The author of this book certainly is a good cook, but, it seems he badly neglected taking the time it takes, to think this book through.Conclusively, I can in no way recommend this book. It is simply too poorly implemented."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"This electronic publication is useless.Can't read a thing out of it.

I don't know if this is the best format to present the material, as I often wished for a little prose or some sidebars to help me understand things. While I can certainly imagine other ways the book could have been written, I can say that as frustrating as the book can be, I was able to understand the concepts, and perhaps at a depth that my imagined alternative would have gotten me. Until such an alternative exists to evaluate, I'll recommend the Reasoned Schemer to anyone who wants to dive deeply into logic programming."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"I must say that I was expecting lesson on building logical system that this book completely lacks fallowed with examples of using it. But this book is only about using the Kanren logical system that authors designed. There is no ebook version that's completely inconvenient I was so frustrated with holding the dead tree and typing that I finally scanned the whole thing to keep my hands on the keyboard. The code in the book can't be just typed and tried but you have to apply substitution rules of the author weird symbols in your head. For example succeed is written as #s in the book but you should type succeed. Or run must actually take another argument like (run #f (q) while the author insists on writing (run (q). Neither pseudo code neither working scheme.Nowhere in the preface does authors mentions that I should download the source code [...] , BTW the implementation code is excellent, and some supported implementation in order to actually run the programs.When you add everything I wouldn't buy this book if I knew all this but on the other hand I'm not inclined to ask for a refund."},{"Title":"The Reasoned Schemer","review":"I guess this book is OK, but it could really be written in all of about 5 to 10 pages of text with half a page of implementation code - in Haskell.Main idea: use (potentially) infinite lists to represent (potentially) infinite streams of solutions to a problem. Have \\"goals\\" as procedures that work on (partial) solutions, producing new lists (empty/singleton/plural) of (more complete) solutions for each solution processed. Have a mechanism of combining these solutions streams. Now AND is just a sequential combinator and goal applicator; OR is a sequential combinator for parallel application; OR/i (for interleaving) combines its result streams in an interleaving fashion.It suffices to have these combinators binary, because any type of COND is anyhow broken down to these binary combinations, as in a typical COND rewrite with IFs - and that's what the book itself does too, in a somewhat complex Scheme macro syntax. Expressed in Haskell, the intent is clear and the meaning is immediately obvious:Sequential stream combination (\\"mplus\\" of the book):(1) [] ++: ys = ys(2) (x:xs) ++: ys = x:(xs ++: ys)Alternating stream combination (\\"mplus/i\\"):(3) [] ++/ ys = ys(4) (x:xs) ++/ ys = x:(ys ++/ xs)Sequential feed (\\"bind\\"):(5) [] >>: g = [](6) (x:xs) >>: g = g x ++: (xs >>: g)Alternating feed (\\"bind/i\\"):(7) [] >>/ g = [](8) (x:xs) >>/ g = g x ++/ (xs >>/ g)\\"OR\\" goal combination (\\"cond/e\\"):(9) (f ||: g) x = f x ++: g x\\"Alternating OR\\" goal combination (\\"cond/i\\"):(10) (f ||/ g) x = f x ++/ g x\\"AND\\" goal combination (\\"all\\"):(11) (f &&: g) x = f x >>: g\\"Alternating AND\\" goal combination (\\"all/i\\" of the book):(12) (f &&/ g) x = f x >>/ gThat's about all there is to it. If you're unfamiliar with Haskell, it's a type-inferencing, auto-currying LISP with unparenthesised syntax where \\"f x\\" stands for functional application, \\"[]\\" stands for empty list, \\"x:xs\\" for cons cell (x . xs), and parentheses are used for grouping of expressions. It is non-strict, so lazy lists are used throughout, and _everything_ is a delayed lambda, calculated on \\"as-needed\\" basis. Having finally produced a stream of solutions, we rely on Haskell to only calculate as much of it as is actually requested by a user (usually one by one, as in Prolog), thus in effect performing depth-first search of a problem space.It should be clear now that the actual nature of our solutions should be regarded quite apart from the mechanism of producing, combining and managing these infinite streams. Unification can then be viewed as just another \\"knowledge-enhancing\\" goal capable of rejecting the solution it's supplied with, by producing an empty list, or updating it, by producing a new list containing an updated solution(s). These solutions can be of any type, whether built-in or user-defined native Haskell type, and not just general symbolic structure capable of representing a kind of symbolic terms Prolog has, which is what's done in the book - where everything is represented through this symbolic structure, even numbers.Implementing arithmetical relations on top of that is a standard exercise in hopeless inefficiency. The book wants to add logic programming capabilities to the existing Scheme system. Surely we don't have to reinvent numbers for this, and in such an incredibly inefficient way at that!Instead of reusing blind structural unification of Prolog, the authors could discuss how it can be seen as creating equality constraints, then proceed to implement _them_ thus having truly added the relational capabilities ON TOP of the existing Scheme system, with its numeric functions working for us directly, hopefully.If this book had THAT, THEN it would have been a great book.Alas, no. The authors decided instead to stay at a fairly rudimental level, and be very verbose and inexplicit at the same time. And here I come to a point about their whole methodology in this as in their other books of this series, of presenting their material by examples only, making it unnecessarily obscure for a reader. It seems to me they've gone to the other extreme here from the pseudo-scientific type of dry presentation full of abstruse terminology. The golden path, as always, may lie somewhere in the middle - first presenting the material through examples and just playing with it (like they do here), but then proceeding to more precise formulation and discussion of the issues.This book is long on promise, but short on clarity and depth."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"This collection of Heinlein stories includes stories that originally appeared in various pulp magazines during the '40's and50's. These are not RAH's usual type of story, there are no resourceful adolescents, exotic aliens, or mischievious multicentarions to be found here. Instead these tales are darker, more macabre that RAH's more well known style.The first, and longest selection, THE UNPLEASANT PROFESSION OF JONATHAN HOAG, concerns a man, Hoag, who cannot remember what he does during the day. He hires a private detective team to follow him to discover what he fears is his shameful secret. What they discover is something far different that any of them ever could have imagined.THE MAN WHO TRAVELED IN ELEPHANTS involves a traveling salesman and his wife who have happily traveled across the country for years until death separates them, at least briefly.\\"ALL YOU ZOMBIES\\" is the most 'typical' Heinlein in the book and concerns time travel and paradoxes, rather reminiscent to THE DOOR INTO SUMMER.THEY is the most disturbing tale of the group. The hero is insane or perhaps not.OUR FAIR CITY is a charming bit of urban fantasy, in keeping with THE STAR BEAST.\\"AND HE BUILT A CROOKED HOUSE\\" the final selection, is a chilling story about other dimension and is perhaps a forerunner to THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.For serious RAH fans this is a very interesting book, showing facets of his writing that are not often seen. Fans of specific parts of his work, say the juveniles or the Future History stories would probably be disappointed.

The stories here are part of this very different group.\\"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathon Hoag\\" first appeared in the Oct 1942 edition of Unknown magazine, as by \\"John Riverside\\" (one of about six of Heinlein's pseudonyms). Mr. Hoag has a problem: in the evenings he finds a curious reddish residue under his fingernails, and no memory of what he was doing during the day to get that residue. So he hires a husband and wife team of detectives to follow him around and find out what is really going on. The trail leads to non-existent 13th floors, some very shadowy characters who are part of the Order of the Bird, and a conclusion that reality really isn't what we think it is. Some good suspense, reasonable characterization, but the final answer that Heinlein presents may leave you feeling a little let down, and I had difficulty believing in the scenario.\\"They\\", first printed in the April 1941 issue of Unknown, is a minor classic. Here is paranoia run rampant; the main character just knows that everything around him is just a setup meant to keep him ignorant of the true state of the world. Of course, it's only paranoia if such a belief is incorrect... One of his better early stories.\\"Our Fair City\\" first appeared in the Jan 1949 issue of Weird Tales, and is an out-and-out fantasy, with an intelligent whirlwind used as an instrument to bring down a corrupt city government. Mildly amusing but a pretty slight effort.\\"The Man Who Traveled in Elephants\\" was apparently written in 1948, but didn't get published till Oct 1957 in Saturn magazine. When I first read this, I thought it was a totally unremarkable, very quiet story, detailing a man and his wife who travel to all the various county/state fairs; the sights, sounds, and exhibits of such affairs. By the end of the story it is clear that this is the man's version of heaven. Reading this again, I begin to wonder if this story is actually a key to Heinlein's personal beliefs about both the hereafter and the reasons for living, and the story is actually quite charming and heart-warming.\\"...And He Built a Crooked House\\" first appeared in Feb 1941 issue of Astounding; as such it's the earliest work in this collection. It's all about an architect who designs and builds an 'exploded' three-dimensional version of a four-dimensional tesseract, then has it collapse into a real four-dimensional house when one of California's innumerable earthquakes strikes. A minor piece, though it will warp your mind a bit, and has some historical interest as the street where this house was supposedly built is the one Heinlein was living on when this was written.\\"...All You Zombies\\" is the newest story here, first published in the March, 1959 issue of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It's also, for my money, the best and most inventive story of the bunch, and possibly the ultimate in time-travel stories. Starting from a bartender listening to one of his (male) customers complain about how tough life is in the \\"True Confession\\" writing racket, it proceeds to be the complete answer (at least for one person) to the question of the beginning of everything and to the inherent paradoxes of time travel. Warning: this is not a children's story, some of the situations described within it probably make it unsuitable for anyone younger than mid-teens.As a group, these stories are a mixed bag. They show inventiveness in plot and theme, are all at least reasonably well written, but some cross the line of believability, others make too minor a point to be really good stories. Still, a very different set of stories from what some call the greatest science fiction writer, ever.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"Why in the world did they let this gem go out of print?Heinlein was often at his best in his shorter works, and each of thestories in it is a matserpiece of the genre. The ideas are totallyoriginal, the writing is spare and sharp, and the dialog is crisp and to the point. No sci-fi jargon, no talk of fusion drives and orbital mechanics.The title story, &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot;, begins with a simple premise- a man comes to a private eye and asks him to figurie out what he does all day. He can't remember anything of the day's events, and worries that the material he finds under his fingernails might be blood. It isn't; it's dirt, but something infintely more bizarre is waiting to be discovered.&quot;He Built A Crooked House&quot; is one of the wittiest, most imaginative short stories I've ever come across.

END"},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"This is the side of Heinlein that's not really showcased in his more traditional hard sf: Heinlein the mystic, as in some of his other early work like Assignment in Eternity, etc. This stuff should maybe be classified as horror. The title story is classical horror that stays with you; All You Zombies is an all-time classic time-travel story, but very disturbing. Them is even more disturbing - Stephen King never wrote a more elegant short-short. The sweetest story is The Man Who Traveled in Elephants - which is about death. Crooked House reads like a classical math-problem sf story - but what do they see out the window? Very, very interesting set of stories: a potential revelation for fans of the hard-sf Heinlein. You can really see the seeds that would later sprout into Stranger in a Strange Land and Job."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"This book collects some of Heinlein's earlier efforts in the fantasy vein. There's virtually no science fiction here, but there are some interesting ideas. The title piece is almost a short novel, and features a husband and wife detective team who are hired to find out exactly what their client does during the daylight hours. The answer takes them on a journey through the looking glass to a world of evil secrets that lie just beneath the surface of our comfortable reality. There are plenty of surprises and a fair amount of suspense, but Heinlein's hazy ending may leave some readers unsatisfied. The remaining stories in the collection are a pretty mixed bag, highlighted by &quot;All You Zombies&quot;, which is not about zombies at all, but still delivers a powerful punch. Without giving away the plot, the protagonist manages to recount the story of his (generally speaking) totally unique life. Although by no means prurient, this story has some sexual components that could lead to very embarrassing questions if read by the very young, so be forewarned. Equally solipsistic is the paranoid fantasy &quot;They&quot;, in which a mental patient questions the very nature of reality. Heinlein seems to enjoy this kind of philosophical rambling, but apart from the sharp ending, this story has little to recommend it. Similarly, &quot;-And He Built a Crooked House&quot; involves speculation of a more mathematical nature. An iconoclast architect designs, and then actually builds, a house in four dimensions, with what one assumes to be intended as comic effect, although having a stuffy dowager faint repeatedly seems more like an exercise in misogyny than in humor. Even sillier is &quot;Our Fair City&quot;, in which Heinlein shows how a nosy newsman takes down a corrupt city government with the help of a trained pet whirlwind. And &quot;The Man Who Traveled in Elephants&quot; is a wholly forgettable story about a man who spends his declining years visiting state fairs. Heinlein shows considerable inventiveness in finding utterly unique plotlines for these stories, but not all of them actually succeed. Still, this is a pretty entertaining collection, and should provide a welcome diversion for fantasy fans who are looking for something a little offbeat."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"Heinlein's 6xH is a collection of (would you believe it?) six of Heinlein's short stories ranging in tone from warmly optimistic and almost religious through paranormal mysticism all the way to hard core multi-dimensional (both space and time) sci-fi. Just as the tone and nature of the stories represent a wildly eclectic blend of plots and characters, the quality and credibility of the stories is all over the literary map as well! But, rest assured, it's all vintage Heinlein and will certainly appeal to Heinlein fans!The centre piece of the collection, The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag (***), is a 125 page novella that, in a fashion vaguely reminiscent of Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, tells us of Hoag's total inability to recall what he does during the day. When he hires a very earthy and yet very warm and loving husband and wife team of detectives to follow him, we are treated to a sparkling story filled with superb dialogue, terrific suspense and first-rate characterization. Sadly, like a poorly written episode of The Twilight Zone, the story ultimately dissolves into a conclusion of meaningless metaphysical bafflegab that left me completely deflated as a reader and asking what happened.The Man Who Traveled in Elephants (*****), in a remarkably small number of words, not only describes a positively astonishing cross section of 1940s American cultural snippets but also clearly delivers the message that happiness both here on earth and ultimately in a heavenly after-life is in the eye of the beholder. Warm, uplifting, charming, believable and well-delivered without a trace of religious or preachy overtones. Wonderful, indeed!In \\"---All You Zombies---\\" (**), Heinlein has prepared a racy, adult-rated time travel tale that opens with a bartender, clearly a time traveler and recruiter for other potential time travelers, listening to a customer's tales of woe over his beer. Once again, Heinlein's dialogue is crisp and realistic as is the characterization but (and how ironic is this?) the story has not stood the test of time. Heinlein completely ignores the issue of time travel paradoxes and, as a result, the story ends up unresolved in a most unsatisfactory fashion.They (***) presents a morbid, dark and probably realistic vision of serious mental illness, or at least debilitating paranoia from the point of view of the suffering patient. The twist at the conclusion of the tale, while entertaining, is perhaps just a little too predictable and, frankly, is not sufficiently resolved to be completely satisfying.A whimsical flight of fancy, indeed, Our Fair City (*) tells the story of an animated whirlwind that seems to know its own mind and makes friends with Pete Perkins, an elderly all night parking attendant. While treating us to some truly inspired slapstick comedic moments, ultimately this childish whirlwind dwindles to a limpid zephyr and then just hits the doldrums.On the other hand, \\"And He Built a Crooked House\\" (****), also clearly intended as a lighthearted fantasy with a bent towards comedy succeeds in a walk. Heinlein gives us an out on the edge California (where else?) architect with an extraordinarily imaginative idea for his clients - a new age house designed as eight cubes stacked in the shape of a tesseract. Imagine the confusion when, in the middle of the guided tour, they are jostled by an earthquake tremor and their brand new home somehow collapses into the fourth dimension and folds back up into a hypercube. At once, funny, mind-bending, tantalizing, novel and provocative.An interesting, collection of stories that must be read by and I dare say will even appeal to diehard Heinlein fans in order for them to say they've read it all. But, for my money, I'll call it a very average rating overall as science fiction goes and a disappointment coming from the pen of a master such as Heinlein."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"This is my favorite book by Heinlein that I have read thus far. It is actually a collection of short stories, with the title novella being the longest one. It is truly a good story. Not hard science fiction, but more of a mystery. SF fans and non-fans alike will like this story, it is very suspenseful and a real page turner.The other stories are The Man Who Traveled In Elephants, a throwaway; All You Zombies, a good story that is probably the weirdest story from an author known for weird storie; They, a very thought-provoking story, with feelings from the main character that I'm sure we've all felt at one time or another; Our Fair City, a hilarous short story that had me laughing out loud numerous times; and He Built A Crooked House, another grand tale that will leave Geometry experts saying &quot;Hmmm...&quot;.Read this book. It is one of those books that you will just find near impossible to put down, and you will regret it when you finally do."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"I have read just about everything Heinlein wrote. I love this guy. He is an author, like Vonnegut, best suited for young adults (15-25). I like to break his stories into two separate categories. First, his early work (Starship Troopers or Citizen of the Galaxy), these were intended for youngsters. They are great even as an adult, but you can see through the whimsical writing style as an older person. Then you have what I think of his post first encounter with mind altering drugs and his work like (Stranger in a Strange Land and The Cat who Walks Through Walls). Man these are dynamite stories. Lastly, he wrote just one or two books that dont fall into his usual writing styles. The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag is much more akin to a Philip K Dick novel than Heinlein.The story is out there. Its a melding of early noir private eye (think of the movies Maltese Falcon or the Thin Man) & if you have read him Philip K Dicks' unusual Twilight Zone style early stories. This sounds like it would be just about perfect, at least to my ears, but its dragged down quite a bit by Heinlein's overly dry prose. By dry, I mean a style of writing that lacks depth of character.The plot is pretty complicated and continues to get more complicated as it goes along. It starts off with a guy who hires a husband/wife private eye team to tell him what he does during the daytime. He can only remember what he does at night. The guy has two separate personalities.Pretty soon the private eyes are confronted with creatures living in alternate universes that travel through mirrors, other characters frightened by something so badly that they wont talk about anything dealing with the split personality guy, and more.For myself, its so odd to read this story, think that \\"wow, this was written only 70 years ago\\" and to see how much different society was then. Women had their place. Men acted a certain way. The writing conveys a totally different social norm than what we have today.I would suggest this story if you are a person who likes Heinlein, Twilight Zone, or Philip K Dick. This will be a fun read. Otherwise, if you have not read anything by either of the authors, I would suggest instead trying 'The Cat Who Walks Through Walls' or 'Now Wait For Yesterday'."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"\\"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag\\". If that's not an eye-grabbing title, I don't know what is. Unfortunately, the text within the covers doesn't quite live up to it. Jonathan Hoag remembers the mornings, and he remembers the evenings, but he doesn't quite remember what he does for a living during the day. To solve this mystery, he hires two private detectives to tail him and report his movements to him. The more they try to do so, the more confusing and seemingly impossible phenomenon they encounter. This novella keeps you reading just to see how Heinlein will wrap up all the contradictions in the end. Unfortunately, he doesn't. There is a conclusion that provides some metaphysical food for thought, but it's not really a satisfactory explanation of everything that happened. \\"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag\\" does boast distinctive characters, and crisp, clean, believable dialogue.The other flagship story in this collection is \\"And He Built a Crooked House\\". The story of an architect who won't take no for an answer and a suburban couple who get trapped in one of his designs, this little exercise in cleverness will delight the mathematically minded with its musings on higher dimensions and lower intellects. The rest is a hodgepodge. \\"They\\" is an initially intriguing exploration of paranoia, but the ending doesn't punch the way Heinlein wants it to. \\"Our Fair City\\" is an amusing but not particularly thought-provoking tale about a miniature tornado that gets involved in politics. \\"All You Zombies\\" is yet another pointless time-travel story.Lastly there's \\"The Man Who Traveled in Elephants\\". One of the master's more unusual stories, it explores the life of a quirky elderly couple who travel around attending county fairs. The point is to suggest that Heaven will be a carnival, complete with cotton candy and a parade of elephants. With no real science fiction component, it gives us instead an unusual take on finding your purpose on Earth. But for some reason I found it strangely unsatisfying in the end. Regardless, below average Heinlein is still above average fiction."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"Read by Tom WeinerApproximately 4 hoursBlackstone AudioMultiple Hugo Award winning author Robert A. Heinlein (1907-1988) changes his tone with the novella The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag. This audiobook seems much more like a Philip K. Dick story than a Heinlein story since it features none of the themes that Heinlein is well known for, like space travel, alien contact or time travel. Instead, we get an extra helping of creepy with a surprise ending that truly demonstrates Heinlein's ability to master a variety of styles.First published under a pseudonym in the now-defunct magazine Unknown in 1942, The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag features Ted and Cynthia Randall, a husband and wife private detective team based in Chicago. They are approached by a fastidious little man with a topcoat and silk gloves named Jonathan Hoag. He has an odd proposition - he offers them a preposterously large retainer to help him figure out what he does for a living. Mr. Hoag knows that he has a well-paying job that pays him cash, but he does not have the faintest idea what that job is. The crisis began while he was at a dinner party and another guest commented on the reddish stains under his fingernails and asked what he did for a living to leave such a residue behind. He was very bothered to find that he did not know.Ted and Cynthia agree to help him and find that this may not be as easy as they thought. They find that everything about Mr. Hoag seems to be a mystery and the more they interact with him, the more they doubt their own eyes and ears. Soon enough they discover that \\"the whole world might be just a fraud and an illusion.\\"The story suffers a bit from age, which is to be expected. After all, this story is nearly 70 years old. Some of the expressions that are used may have been very hip and stylish in 1942 but they sound a bit clunky to the ear nowadays. Also, some aspects of the story such as elevator operators and doctors making house calls may be totally foreign concepts to some listeners. That being said, the underlying story overcomes all of that window dressing. Rumor has it that a movie version of this story is in the works as well.Award-winning narrator Tom Weiner skillfully handles a variety of different voices throughout. He voices Mr. Hoag perfectly, catching his prissy, fussy nature throughout, but adding a different tone once we discover his true profession. His characterization of the story's bad guys (I am intentionally not describing them so as not to ruin their scenes) has the perfect amount of menace and mystery."},{"Title":"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag","review":"_The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathon Hoag_ (1959) is a collection of six tales by Robert A. Heinlein*-- not as many as those in _The Menace from Earth_ (1959); but I believe that they are of generally higher quality. None of the stories are Future History tales. Two of the stories-- \\"They\\" and \\"--All You Zombies--\\"-- clearly play with the theme of solipsism, though in markedly different ways. One story-- the title story-- plays with our feelings of paranoia. The remaining three tales are much lighter in tone. This collection is better balanced than many that I have read.Let us start, then, with \\"The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag,\\" originally published in _Unknown_ under the pseudonym of \\"John Riverside\\". Jonathan Hoag is an amnesiac who is for some reason terrified of dirt that appears regularly under his own fingernails. He goes to see the husband and wife detective team of Randall & Craig and asks them to follow him... and there follows an awesome amount of twists and turns. By the close of this short novel, you may be moving from your home and getting rid of all the mirrors in your house.\\"They,\\" also from _Unknown_, is the small classic about the man in the insane asylum who _knows_ that the world revolves around himself. \\"--All You Zombies--\\" is a classic time travel story in which a host of characters become a character. You and me and the rest of the world? Well, we are merely zombies. It is more tightly told than Heinlein's earlier time paradox classic, \\"By His Bootstraps\\" (collected elsewhere). It is the best story in the collection.\\"-- And He Built a Crooked House--\\" is an oft-reprinted story in mathematical theme anthologies. It's the one about the architect who designs a tesseract house with disasterous consequences. And it contains the lines:\\"Neutra! Schinder! What have those bums got? What's Frank Lloyd Wright got that I haven't got?\\"\\"Commissions.\\" (192)\\"Our Fair City,\\" an entry from _Weird Tales_, is the one about Kitten, the intelligent whirlwind who topples a corrupt city government. It is pleasantly told, but it is the least of the stories in this collection.When Heinlein chose to do so, he could tell a straightforward sentimental tale. Two examples are \\"Requiem\\" and \\"The Green Hils of Earth\\". Another is \\"The Man Who Traveled in Elephants,\\" about the good-hearted salesman who found heaven but didn't know it. It was especially appealing to me for its background of fairs, carousels, and parades.Heinlein's short fiction tapered off in the 1950s. I wish he had written a few more short stories in the sixties and seventies. I wonder... If he had, what would they have been like?* An alternate (and rather dreadful) title of this collection is _6 X H_."},{"Title":"Child behavior","review":"With four children and seven grandchildren, Gesell Institute's CHILD BEHAVIOR has become our constant reference guide. The book's &quot;Ages and Stages&quot; section was one we always anxiously referred to when one of our children was doing something unusual. It was reassuring to us to find out they were each very normal for their age. In fact, it almost seemed like the particular section had been written after observing what our kids were doing at that specific stage in their development. Today it is not unusual for one of our children to call us with a question they have about their kids. Even though our original copy is over 35 years old, the examples and descriptions still fit.

For some reason, the age diffence bothered me. So, I purchased a used book from Amazon due to my skepticism. But, the book turned out to be time-tested afterall. The authors mentioned early on in the book that children's behavioral cycle can shift on the age time-line, but that the order of the cycles are quite stable. I'm assuming that it depends on whether a child is more or less advance than his/her peers and what environmental issues are involved (i.e. parents getting a divorce, moving to a new location, switching schools, etc...). I've found the cycles to be quite accurate so far.I love the feeling of knowing what my kids are going through are a perfectly normal behavioral stages in their lives and that they will grow in and out of them. I feel calmer knowing rather than stressing over things that my kids do. My daughter is shy/reserved one year (i.e. won't volunteer during circle time or stand up when it's her turn for show and tell) and a major risk-taker who's outgoing the next (i.e. will run around the neighborhood ringing doorbells and phoning friends out to play). I guess God made us that way to balance us out (i.e. to prepare us to be more balanced adults.

The novel is inundated with British slang terms and what appears to be a number of invented phrases that aren't referenced or explained in any manner as to give them meaning. The first chapter was a particularly bad example of this with the book's protagonist mumbling away phrases that could be conjecturally connected with a rock group and some sort of a drug smuggling trade.Popular counter culture stereotypes abound including that the government is \\"the man\\" and all bad. At parts, I wasn't sure if the author was experiencing a drug \\"trip,\\" because the writing wanders in all sorts of odd directions that little to nothing to do with the story.Here's an example (Page 12):\\"He leered at a receptionist (who sat behind the keyboard of her input terminal as long-legged and unapproachable-by losers-any ice-princess).\\"UNCONNECTED PLOT ELEMENTS:In several areas, the author mentions plot hooks and develops them only to never bring them up again. I don't know why the author wrote so many possible fruitful plot hooks to abandon them. Good editing would have taken away these annoying and unproductive plot elements.UNEXPLAINED BACKGROUND:The author does little to explain how the IWG and IASR came to be dominant elements of his future universe or how them came to be in opposition let alone what other political forces exist in the universe. My theory is that the author simply borrowed plot elements from the newspapers of the day (the book was written in 1974 after the news headline stealing 1973 Yom Kippur War between the Arabs and the Israelis). At one point the author mentions that his protagonist at one time worked for the IWG as some sort of bounty hunter of terrorists.In an infuriating manner, the author constantly mentions future technologies and historical events without explaining them or even relating them to the plot. To cite one example, Harrison's \\"Chamber Gun\\" must be a fearsome weapon, but we never hear more than its' name. No mention of it's special effects or even working is explained throughout the novel.POORLY DEVELOPED CHARACTERS:The three main characters Captain John Truck, IWG General Alice Gaw, IASR Colonel Ben Barka are all poorly developed and suffer from stereotypes. Truck is the most believable character, a burnt-out drug smuggler, rock musician, and utter anarchist. I believe that the author inserted his own personality, beliefs, and philosophies into this character. Gaw and ben Barka are supposed to be \\"evil\\" representatives from the Israeli and Arab governments, but both appear rather to be petty stupid thugs. Neither shows any authenticity of Arab or Jewish philosophies and even their names lack a Hebrew or Arabic language touch. We never learn more much about either ben Barka or Gaw except that they are power-hungry meglomaniacs who are guilty of numerous violent crimes and are both seeking the doomsday to destroy the other. This plot might have worked out had Harrision spent much time developing either character into people.IGNORANCE ABOUT THE MIDDLE-EAST:So many of Harrison's plot details are poorly thought out and lack believability. Apparently Harrison must have a very poor understanding of Islam since he rarely mentions even the slightest detail about it. His UASR is apparently just a stand-in for the USSR. The UASR has more in common with communism than any Arab government ever has. Even Arab nationalism is rarely used. The closest he really gets to any Arab culture is to have a spaceship named \\"The Nasser.\\"I feel well assured that Harrison has never read the Torah, Koran, or Bible. He has problems applying ANY of the concepts from those books to his characters. Gaw for instance doesn't appear to have read the Torah or applied any of its' lessons to her life or actions. Ben Barka doesn't have the slightest idea about the Koran despite being an Arab and Muslim (Of course, it never really was clear that he was a Muslim despite commanding a ship called \\"The Nasser\\"). Truck also appears to be an atheist completely devoid of any religions, spirituality, or even moral ideas as well as an anarchist in the classic sense of that word.--------------------------------------------------I don't recommend this extremely poor novel even one iota.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"The Centauri Device","review":"First, I would like to mention that I'm a relatively easy reader to please. There aren't many books I haven't managed to enjoy on one level or another. That said, this is absolutely the worst sci-fi novel I've ever read, followed closely by \\"Armor\\". However, I did manage to finish both of them - how or why I'll never figure out. Complete waste of time I'll never get back."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"Wartime is the WWII memoir of the great Yugoslav dissident, Milovan Djilas. A leading prewar Communist activist and a high ranking member of the Yugoslav Communist leadership after the war, Djilas was expelled from the party and imprisoned (in the same prison where he had been jailed by the pre-war dictatorship) for his dissident opinions. During WWII, Djilas was a leading figure in the Communist (Partisan) resistance and participated in many of the major events following the German conquest of Yugoslavia. Written many years after the war, this is no panegyric but rather a stark and honest accounting enriched by Djilas' mature reflections on the outcome of the war and the subsequent development of an authoritarian Communist state in Yugoslavia.Wartime has several striking features. Violent death is a constant companion. Hardly a page goes by without a death or mention of someone who dies in the course of the war. While the Partisans did fight the Germans and Italian occupiers, most of the combat described in Wartime is fratricidal. Christians versus Muslims, Croats versus Serbs, Serbian (Royalist) Chetniks versus Serbian Partisans, ethnic Germans versus everyone else. In Djilas' description of war in his native Montenegro, its implicit that conflict followed the contours of traditional clan rivalries. The Partisan leadership were convinced Communists, though the intellectual Djilas was perhaps the only real student of Marx. Ideology mattered greatly to them. While the leadership tended to be drawn from the more educated strate of Yugoslav life and somewhat educated industrial workers like Tito, the mass of the Partisan armies were poorly educated peasants. This gives rise to incongruous features. An army led by avowed Marxist revolutionaries carries Orthodox priests on its staff and major celebrations include recitation of traditional folk epics featuring bandits and the struggle against the Ottomans.Djilas was a gifted writer. The often horrifying events in Wartime are presented in a matter of fact, quotidian manner that only emphasizes the grim nature of Yugoslavian life during the war. Djilas has a talent for the revealing anecdote and concise description of character. Djilas periodically interrupts his narrative to make rhetorically powerful statements about the nature of the events described. For example, of his native Montenegro he writes. \\"...Montenegro, where, from time immemorial, ideas found consumation in violence...\\"In its way, this book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"I read this book after I had served in Bosnia, for the US Army. This book gave real insight into the creation of the Tito-era Yugoslavia, and what came afterwards. I was surprised at the violence of the three-way civil war that was within WW II in Yugoslavia, and how it played out into the war of the 1990's. I highly recommend this book to others interested in a good account of the history of the socialist Yugoslavia."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"Djilas was Tito's 2nd man in the communist partisan movement in WWII. They fought against Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Royal Serbs (Tschetnizi) and national Croats (Ustashi) and succeeded. Often left alone by their allies (east and west), they faced death more than once. But this is not a heroic recount of that time, no pro-communist biased official praise.Djilan, who was arrested in the 50ies and 60ies for openly opposing comunism/stalinism here gives an evenhanded account on how things were, not sparing out the atrocities done by the partisans.The book is easy to read, but a little short on background information, so you'll have to check some facts, names, places yourself.One of the best books on WWII I've read."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"Milovan Djilas was a Communist ideologue and intellectual who became Tito's \\"number two\\" during the partisan war against the Germans during World War Two -- until imprisoned by Tito after the war.\\"Wartime\\" is (on the surface) the story of the partisan war. On a deeper level it is the story of Djilas's evolution from a dogmatic Communist to pragmatic conspirator in the evils of partisan warfare. By the end of the war, he is rationalizing crimes that, as a thoughtful intellectual, he knows are inexcusable.Djilas is a wonderful writer and storyteller. He honestly sets out the contradictions in his journey to the heights of power and then to prison. Still, even in this account, he excuses himself for his part in affairs as if he were a block of wood being carried along by a historical current.This is more than a story of war. In fact, it has little detail of actual partisan activity. Instead, it is a mesmerizing story of how one man participated in and adjusted himself to one of the most complicated and terrible stuggles of the war. This is, really, a sad story, well told, by by an author for whom one feels both sympathy and pity.To fully understand both Djilas and the historical perspective of \\"Wartime\\", I strongly suggest that his great book, \\"Land without Justice\\" be read first. I also suggest that the reader acquire a good map of the Balkans. The map in the paperback is poorly reproduced and only marginally understandable. Although many names have changed, a detailed modern map is very helpful."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"Excellent first person account of realities of war from footsoldier, officer, and government official, with progression from idealistic beginnings to jaded ending."},{"Title":"Wartime - With Tito and the Partisans","review":"The author gave a gipping story about how brutal a guerillia war can be and how the killing between the ethnic groups in Yugoslavia continue even when the unconditional surrender terms had been signed.It is amazing how the author did not know about the terribe camp conditions of the intern German minority until three years after the war considering the fact that he was one of the highest ranking Communist leaders after the war. You wonder if he knew about some of the terrible working and living conditions of the German POWs and that many of the them had died even though he stated that they were well treated. He doesn't explain why the German POWs were kept in Yugoslavia until 1949-50 when they should have been send home to help rebuild their country.The author stated that over 100,000 Germans were taken prisoners. I read a book about Tito (can't recall the title) and it stated that the partisans had killed about the same number of Germans during the final liberation of their country. You wonder how many Germans were actually executed even though Tito had forbidden killing of German army personnel after the Battles of Serbia and Belgrade and how many more were executed immediately or long after the Germans had surrender to the partisans. Besides, the partisans were in no mood to take prisoners and the Germans knew it so maybe Tito should have told the Germans, you can leave the country peacefully as long as you don't do a sorched earth policy. It would have prevent much needlessly bloodshed and killing. The only reason why the partisans took all those prisoners is because the Germans in Yugoslavia had no choice but to surrender to the partisans according to the terms of unconditional surrender that was signed in Reims and Berlin instead of being allowed to surrender to the British forces in Italy and Austria.A great book nevertherless."},{"Title":"A Short History of The West Indies","review":"This book offered so many fascinating insights into European and colonial history, the slave trade, the way nation states wage war, race relations--topics that are as relevant today as they have been over the last four hundred years. In the small stage of the West Indies you can see them all played out."},{"Title":"A Short History of The West Indies","review":"This is a very readable history of the islands in the Caribbean. There also is some supporting discussion of mainland British colonies. The material generally is informative and the writing generally is reasonably good.Probably the major advantage of this book compared to alternatives is the solid discussion of the political development of the islands in a way that is easy to follow and remember. With so many disparate islands being discussed, it is easy to get lost. The discussion clearly distinguishes between the larger and smaller islands and that makes it all clear.The analysis of slavery's development and its consequences also is quite clear.Probably the major drawback of this book -- or at least the printing of the 1987 fourth edition which I acquired in Bequia in the Grenadines -- is the large number of typos. Shame on Macmillan Caribbean. There probably is one typo every ten pages or so.I would rate this book as outstanding if it weren't for two drawbacks: the typos; and the writing style changes at the end because a co-author was added later. Neither of these compromises the high quality of the history itself."},{"Title":"A Short History of The West Indies","review":"THE BOOK IS VERY BORING AND NOT GOOD READING MATERIAL. I AM READING THE BOOK FOR A UNIVERSITY CLASS AND DISLIKE THE READING ALTOGETHER. THE AUTHOR NEED TO TO TRY TO DO AN UPDATED AND MORE INTERESTING VERSION OF THE HISTORY. HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND THE WEST INDIES AND VISIT THE SITE IF I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK... VERY VERY DULL!!!!!!"},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"\\"Zuleika and the Barbarian\\" by Bertrice Small. Princess Zuleika of Dariyabar spent her life expecting to wed her cousin Haroun, but he coldly informs her that since he no longer needs her as he will be the next sultan with her brothers dead, she will be given to the barbarian at the gates. Not even a wish with a genie could help the embattled Zuleika. Still rather than wait to become Amir Khan's gift, Zuleika offers the barbarian a sensual deal to save her people from his horde and her cousin's ruthlessness.\\"All the Secret Pleasures\\" by Thea Devine. Though their respective fathers wanted them married, Lady Corinna rejected her neighbor Simon Charlesworth to wed an older earl because his rank and wealth were at the level she expected of a spouse. By 1820 Corinna is a widow when she meets Simon for the first time in years, but this time he plans to get his beloved in his bed forever.\\"The Bedroom is Mine\\" by Jane Bonander. In 1880 Twin Hearts, California logging mogul Ross Benedict bets that he will never shave his beard off for a woman. His sister Sam arranges for homeless cook Lily Sawyer to stay in Ross' cabin. Soon Ross and Lily argue over who owns the bed before deciding to share it.The three battles of the boudoir novellas are well written with engaging lead characters even though the first two tales occasionally allow the sex scenes to forget there is the plot. Exotic romance fans will appreciate these fine novellas.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"I found this book to be delightful and disappointing. I loved the story by Bertrice Small, my all-time favorite romance author. She did not disappoint me with her decadent and delicious tale. Thea Devine's tale was not to my liking, as none of her writing has been, though I did actually manage to finish reading this story. Jane Bonander wrote a sweet tale of a sister trying to play matchmaker for her brother. It was a fun read. The book is worth the price for Bertrice Small's story. I only wish it had been longer."},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"I found this book to display some of the best aspects of romance stories, and the worst. The best being the emotional struggle for the characters in the Bonander story which was affecting, and the wort being the utterly shallow and insipid writing of Small. The Small romance had no detail of plot, character, or circumstance. It was as if the elements were chosen at random from a Arabian mad-lib, and strung together with lots of adverbs. The love scenes were especially disappointing, with mechanical explainations of love acts, having no purpose other than to be &quot;naughty&quot;. The Thea Devine story was a pleasant deviation from the tiresome girl-plotting-to-trap/impress-guy scenario, with compelling love scenes. One last thing; I didn't consider any of the men to be &quot;Rogues&quot;."},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"I thought this was a great book. I enjoyed it very much. Bertrice Small is my favorite author so anything by her is fine with me. I wish other romance writers were as acurate with history and details as she is. Keeps you coming back for more!"},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"In this uneven boudoir romance novella, maestro Bertrice Small easily outshines with her unconventional tale &quot;Zuleika and the Barbarian&quot; with its exotic Arabic setting. The tale excites with delicious cunning, pageantry and sorcery with Zuleika the Princess of Dariyabar outwitting his cousin Haroun to regain her hold of the throne. She strikes a bargain with her betrothed Amir Khan and with the aid of her genie Kansbar, she has to fend herself from the evil plots of the wicked harem mistress. Thea Devine and Jane Bonander choose a safer route with mediocre romances. &quot;All the Secret Pleasure&quot; by Devine is a tale that sees Simon Charlesworth convincing worldy widow Corinna Woodholme that she is to be his only choice in marriage; Bonander's simple tale is an encounter of love sparks between bachelor Ross Benedict and feisty Lily Charlesworth whose trust had been misplaced by her ex. Save for Bertrice Small's tale, this anthology is largely diluted and unexciting."},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"Bertrice Small manages to save this book with her story, but just barely. Certainly not Small's best work and the whole \\"genie\\" thing was really out there. Thea Devine and Bonander stories were completely uninteresting, not only the plot and the characters, but the sex scenes as well. Is anyone else convinced that Devine is a male? No woman uses words found in \\"her\\" writing. I awarded this book 2 stars only because of Small. In the future, I will avoid Devine's work at all costs."},{"Title":"I Love Rogues","review":"This book typifies my frustration with many anthologies - inconsistant quality. Small's story is horrid. 4-way orgies where the men share the women they supposedly love is not my idea of romance, and this will be my first and last work by her to be read. Devine's contribution is excellent, and why I sought this book out to begin with. Erotic and romantic, with excellent characterization for such a short novella. Reading it cleansed my soul of the dreck that Small exposed me to. Bonander's was pretty good, not as romantic as Devine's piece but at least this couple was monogamous and the plot was clever. So I recommend reading the last two stories, and skipping Small's unless you know, and like, her questionable style."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"I am a Spanish Teacher and I found this book so clear and streamlined that I can teach chapter by chapter and I see the fast progress the students make. My students enjoy doing the exercises and reading comprenhension activities. I have been able to teach succesfully at all levels. From beginner to intermediate learners is a great tool; and for advanced students to help them clear all doubts about Subjunctive, Preterite and Imperfect, this book is PERFECT."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"I am finding this book very useful. I am teaching myself Spanish, and this book sets everything out in a clear and logical manner and then provides exercises so that one becomes familiar with the concepts. I really like it!"},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"Having worked through the first two chapters, I am very pleased with the arrangement and scope of material so far. Vocabulary items are grouped thematically, grammar explanations are succinct, and the practice problems are simple yet effective. I should preface all of this by stating here that I HAVE studied and practiced Spanish before, so I do have some Novice-level proficiency in Spanish. Anyway, this text could be developed further with an accompanying audio resource. There is no audio here; only text! Therefore, the first-time student of Spanish should use this Text in combination with other resources such as CD-attached textbooks, Podcasts, TV broadcasts, etceteras."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"I knew effectively no Spanish before arriving in Costa Rica for an intensive language program. I brought this and 2 other books (Madrigal and the Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice), and though I started with Madrigal (it said \\"Magic\\" on it), I found that this book was the best in helping me go through the fundamental aspects of grammar and verb conjugation in a systematic way. I quickly set aside the other books in favor of this one. One week of reading this book helped me get into the intermediate intensive language class at the Univ. of Costa Rica.I highly recommend this for people who like to learn in a structured grammatical manner (i.e. categorization by present tense conjugations, adjectives, adverbs), without ridiculous photos.One note though. The 1 star review might be nit-picky, but I do have to say I've caught a number of typos already, and some of the answers in the back might be in the wrong order and/or missing something. Fortunately, the mistakes seem relatively clear, so I can catch them and not be too thrown off, but they could be potentially bad if you rely too heavily on exactly what's in the book.Notwithstanding the typos, I highly recommend this book for those who are starting with nothing but want to learn fast."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"This book looks like it would be very good, but starting on page 95 there is a font change, and this font change is accompanied by many typographical errors, replacing Es with null-set symbols, missing Os, and irregular spacing that makes the words difficult to read. When learning a new language, this is even more of a problem than it would be in a book in one's native language.It's a shame, because this seemed like it would be an otherwise very useful book."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"Hoping to perhaps retire to Mexico, I am endeavoring to learn Spanish on my own after 30+ years has passed since I had to take Spanish in college. Although it certainly is not sufficient by itself (because one needs to actually hear the language being spoken), I find it is one of the best books I've purchased for learning the Spanish language. The material is very well organized, and I concur with those reviewers who rave about the book.The vocabulary lists, especially, are very helpful to me. I find that, in browsing them as I work through the chapters, I can refresh myself on what I used to know and pick up new vocabulary. It's encouraging to realize that, even with my native English vocabulary, I forget the meanings of words I don't often use and a dictionary is always at hand if I don't understand something. I feel like less of a dufus, in other words. The lists in Fundamental Spanish are plentiful, but each list is not overly long, so I can literally review a list when I'm watching TV, when a commercial comes on, and pick it back up later. Having the book in Kindle format, of course, makes it very easy and convenient to always have the book with me, so I get far more instruction and practice than I would if it were sitting on a bookshelf.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). A favorite with Spanish students and teachers alike, this book is so enjoyable and streamlined that you will find yourself getting through it in record time. Easy to read, and very clear in delivering each lesson, the chapters deal with grammar, vocabulary and sentence structure in a no-nonsense, straightforward manner.Reading exercises give comprehension practice while the exercises reinforce everything that you have learned and help it to sink in. Practicing what you learn is the best way to make sure that you understand it, and these exercises let you apply the lessons of each chapter so that they are familiar.There are answer keys at the back of the book which allow you to check your work, identifying which areas you still need to work on and which concepts you have a good understanding of.All of the lessons are outlined clearly and with plenty of explanations for each concept and the chapters build on each other so that you are constantly learning more and reinforcing elements that you learned earlier.Accessible for beginners, the book also contains plenty of information for intermediate and advanced Spanish students, covering concepts in enough detail to ensure that you understand it thoroughly.The vocabulary is grouped by theme, to make it easy to understand and remember groups of related words. Supplied in easy to learn chunks at logical intervals throughout the book, the words and phrases sink in easily.The layout makes this book a good review and reference tool if you haven't used a particular subject or concept in a while and need a refresher course.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"This is not a bad book. It presents elementary spanish well enough so that the reader can understand it and teach themselves. The one qualmI have is that there is no dictionary at the end of the book, but I am glad there are answers to the problems.Some of the fill-in-the-blanks questions are really time consuming, it says something like \\"Choose from the list of wordsand fill in the blanks appropriately\\" and you have to go through each sentence to try to figure out which word is appropriate.The book is still good though, I like it and am learning adequately. I took a class at my local college where they useda terrible book that cost like twice as much as this one. This is a good book for people like myself who are more interestedin learning the grammar, vocabulary, and syntax first, and not just plunging into conversational spanish. i would suggest havinga spanish dictionary with you while you work out of this book because often times words will be presented which were not covered yet.If the author does a future edition, I would suggest giving more drill exercises and expanding the book and polishing the presentationa bit more. It looks like this book was written mostly in microsoft word."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"I am taking Spanish and we have a terrible book full of silly pictures.

As you can see from many of my recommendations, I enjoy reading stories in Spanish because I believe reading stories really makes the language stick in your head.1.Easy Spanish Reader w/CD-ROM: A Three-Part Text for Beginning Students (Easy Reader Series)I enjoy learning Spanish by reading because I believe reading helps make the language stick. Make sure that you get the version of this book that comes with the additional CD which contains recordings of passages from the book so that you can download them to your Ipod or mp3 player and improve your ability to understand the language when you hear someone speak it.2.Spanish Stories / Cuentos Espa&ntilde;oles (A Dual-Language Book) (English and Spanish Edition)This is my second favorite Spanish reader.3.Short Stories in Spanish: New Penguin Parallel Text (New Penguin Parallel Texts) (Spanish and English Edition)Another great book for anyone who likes to learn a language by reading.4.First Spanish Reader: A Beginner's Dual-Language Book (Beginners' Guides) (English and Spanish Edition)A very popular book for learning the language by reading that I also enjoyed immensely.5.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This fun and interactive software has been a tremendous help for me in allowing me to now master what was once the most hardest part of learning Spanish for me (learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs).6.Spanish for Reading: A Self-Instructional CourseThis book has done wonders to help my Spanish reading comprehension.7.Correct Your Spanish Blunders: How to Avoid 99% of the Common Mistakes Made by Learners of SpanishIf you are studying Spanish on your own and not with the help of a Spanish instructor, I strongly recommend that you get a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"Very good text book for all-age elementary larners (like myself).

It's also a great reference book for learners of all levels. For those who find it a headache to grasp Spanish basic grammar, this is the book for you.

I am teaching them from it and have noticed that it is a bit jumbled and not as orderly as I would have liked. The order in which it is taught is not how I remembered it in school. Also, I wish there was a word glossary in the back to look up words quickly. It will get the job done but, I was hoping for better organization."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"This book leans heavily towards a traditional grammar-translation method of language learning. What that means is that the grammar and examples tend to be divorced from context, and very contrived. Most of the sentences you come across in this book will never be used in real-life contexts. A prime example is the sentence, \\"&iquest;Cu&aacute;ntos vasos hay en la mesa a las siete de la ma&ntilde;ana en la casa de Ricardo?\\" meaning, \\"How many glasses are on the table at 7:00 a.m. in Richard's house?\\" When would someone ever need to say that? Surely there are more authentic sentences that could have been employed to better effect.I can't offer an alternative to this book as I haven't found one yet, but what I recommend for potential Spanish learners is a book that offers more authentic language in use, and also provides audio files."},{"Title":"Fundamental Spanish","review":"I got the book and after a quick peruse, it's exactly what I wanted. I look forward to using it in my studies.However - the book was in the box without anything to prevent damage, like bubble wrap or newsprint paper. It looked a little haphazard to me. The book was fine, but there was a risk that it could've gotten banged up. There was also no packing list included in the order."},{"Title":"The Plainswoman","review":"I picked up the audio version of this book, and found the story bland.

Destitute, penniless she is forced to eat garbage and to work as a servant and laundress until she finally lands a job making rugs. Eventually, she ends up out west where she buys acres of land and employs a handyman.I like historicals... But the execution of the storyline left me cold. There is a modern feel and attitude in this story. Amity's desire to go it alone seemed difficult to believe. I didn't feel immersed by the storytelling. Parts that were described were boring... Parts that she skipped over writing (such as her journey west, and her first nights on the homestead) were skipped. At times I felt I was being told the story rather than shown the story. I felt annoyed that the origins of Amity's amnesia wasn't explored more fully at the beginning since this seemed to be such a serious issue.I found myself bored after about 45 minutes of listening. Although I am intrigued about what happened to Amity and why she lost her job, I found myself not caring enough about the character or buying into the authenticity of the setting to care.2 stars."},{"Title":"The Plainswoman","review":"I truly enjoyed this book- it is a great example of historical fiction from the 1860's - 1870's era of the West. I enjoyed the strength of the main character Amity and how she overcame many obstacles and as a single woman, eventually owned her own land in Kansas, and got a position as a county school superintendant. I learned much about how folks lived in that period and how hard life was. Everyone made do with what they had and neighbors helped out when needed, without being asked. A must read for anyone who enjoys a good historical fiction read. Great character development and excellent description of the land and hardships."},{"Title":"The Plainswoman","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read! It starts off with a woman who wakes up and cant remember what happened and why she is thrown out onto the streets; this entices the reader to find out more about this pitiful and abused creature. It then goes to her struggles to obtain land and to keep it. She meets and falls in love with the newspaper man but has to find out about her past before she can go towards the future. The story was absolutely refreshing and I am happy that I came across it. For years I was wondering and thinnking up of books and I came across this book that had everything that I wanted. I urge and encourage all of you to read it."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I was enchanted with the escapades that Michael and Ella had in Europe. The book extensively journaled their whole trip and gave wonderful insights to the European way of life. The book developed a dream for me to also take a trip with my greyhound to Paris, France. A dream I've yet to achieve. However, with all the wonderful stories that Michael shared with us in his book I know I'm only closer to achieving that dream in the next few years.Thank you Michael and Ella for your wonderful book.Dana Provostand my lovely GreysRenoir, Cezanne, Sancerre and Paris"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"\\"Herr und Hund\\" - eine ganz besondere Konstellation in der Beziehung zweier Lebewesen, die bereits so eindrucksvoll von Thomas Mann, John Steinbeck und vielen anderen Schriftstellern thematisiert wurde. In deren Fussstapfen tritt nun der in Hollywood lebende Autor Michael Konik mit seinem englischsprachigen Reisebericht \\"Ella in Europe\\".Ebenso amuesant wie spannend geschrieben, erfaehrt der Leser, was Michael Konik und seine weisse Labrador-Greyhound-Mix-Huendin \\"Ella\\" auf ihren zusammen sechs Pfoten und was sie mit ihren vier Augen in Europa gesehen und erlebt haben. \\"Ella is just a dog, but she is my best friend, too,\\" betont Konik. Deshalb moechte er - auch in Europa - so viel Zeit wie moeglich mit ihr gemeinsam verbringen.Zum grossen Erstaunen des Autors und seiner amerikanischen Leser sind Hunde in Europa - anders als in den USA - fast ueberall willkommen, sogar in Geschaeften, Restaurants und Hotels. Davon koennen Hunde und ihre Besitzer im sonst so freien Amerika nur traeumen!Konik bewundert und beneidet an den Hunden, dass sie kaum in der Vergangenheit und schon gar nicht in der Zukunft leben. Stattdessen sind sie beherrscht von der Gegenwart und sind zufrieden mit einer Hand voll Futter. (Vielleicht sind Hunde die wahren Buddhisten!?)\\"Ella\\" wurde 1994 geboren und war acht Jahre alt, als ihr \\"Dad\\" Michael Konik mit ihr sozusagen als \\"Belohnung\\" fuer ihre jahrelange Treue im Jahr 2002 fuer sechs Wochen Belgien, Deutschland, Tschechien, Oesterreich, Italien, Frankreich und die Niederlande bereiste. Zahlreiche Fotos bereichern das Buch, das aus jedem Leser einen Hundeliebhaber macht, wenn er es nicht schon vorher war.Mit der englischen Sprache hatte Michael Konik in Europa sicherlich kaum Probleme, aber Hunde wie \\"Ella\\" sprechen ja sowieso ueberall die gleiche Sprache. - \\"Wuff!\\"Das Buch \\"Ella in Europe\\" war das schoenste und ruehrendste, das ich seit vielen Jahren gelesen habe.[...]"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I'm so glad I picked this book up on a whim. The author is clearly besotted with his dog and isn't ashamed to tell the world (or at least those who read his book). He starts out telling the readers about dogs he grew up loving and how much he missed the companion of a dog when he grew up and moved into areas where dogs weren't allowed (now why would anyone do that?!). Eventually, he finds Ella, a white lab/greyhound puppy and he's a goner. For the next eight years she gives him unconditional love and one day a bell goes off. Hey, maybe he'll share some of this loving and he enrolls them in a service dog program where they spend the next few years bringing joy to the sick, the injured and the mentally handicapped. When Ella turns ten, the author takes her on a trip through dog-friendly Europe as a way of saying thanks for being such a loyal companion.The book follows their adventures as they eat in fancy restaurants, visit touristy sites and shop for a Hermes scarf. This was a very charming, feel-good book only marred by a bit of repetitiveness here and there. Definitely recommended for dog lovers looking for a feel good read."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, Ella's story was very interesting and fun. I liked the authors writing style very much, and would recommend this book for any animal lover."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Reading this book with my two dogs nearby made the experience even better.Ella's ability to bring strangers, even those who spoke languages not understood by Ella's human companions, is one that anyone walking with a happy dog (or two) has encountered. What a way to connect with people while traveling! The author's reason for bringing his dog to Europe was that she could experience living in cultures where dogs were able to go to places that are \\"people places\\" in the USA. His experience proved that his travels were greatly enriched. I was also glad to note that I am not the only one whose dogs have middle names.And for once, a dog story that didn't leave me weeping at the end!Mag"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I just finished reading \\"Ella in Europe\\" and I couldn't put it down. I enjoyed the travelogue and the word pictures of the places Mr. Konik visited but mostly I enjoyed the story about an exceptional canine companion. It is obvious that Mr. Konik saw deeper that the surface of the animal that became his best pal and was able to utilize her talents and uniqueness in a way that both she and those who came in contact with her had great benefit. Ella and he were \\"in sync\\" in a way that sadly many never experience with their pets and usually it is because we are too busy with life to really live it. Mr. Konik decided that he and Ella needed to take time to stop and smell the roses and the gourmet foods and fresh air as well as experiencing the sights and sounds of living. We are not all able to take a trip such as they did but we can vicariously do so through this little book."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I don't know which is cuter: Michael Konik's heartwarming writing or Ella's beautiful smile. I love both of them. This is a \\"feel good\\" book for people who truly love dogs. Another recent bestseller about a guy and his dog seemed to be written by someone who doesn't really understand or appreciate dogs, but just puts up with them. Mr. Konik, on the other hand, is a real Dog Person. This is my favorite Dog Book of all time. Great photos of Europe also!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"We've been traveling in Europe quite a bit this year, and I can't say I've seen a lot of people actually traveling with their dogs, but this book shows you what is possible. The author is a responsible dog owner - Ella is well-trained and well-behaved, which is probably critical to such an adventure. Because of that, they (and we, by extension) get to see Europe in a new way. Traveling in such a way provides another entree into cultures different from our own by providing a \\"bridge\\" - in this case, a dog. I appreciated the author's candor when elaborating on his worries and concerns. They were similar to what I would worry about in a similar situation. He also knows that his dog is a dog, not a furry person. The end seemed a little \\"unfinished\\" but overall it was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"SO many times I longed to bring my 4 legged friends to Europe, but was unable to due to time or money restraints. Thankfully I can live vicariously through this book. That fact that he wanted to take Ella on the trip to thank her for being a therapy dog was great. Dogs just love being with their families and she would have followed him anywhere. The part that really got to me was where they went on a tour of the concentration camp. With so much evil in that one place, he needed Ella's goodness to balance out the universe. I feel that is why God gave us dogs. Really a great read for any dog lover."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book is a pleasure to read. It will frequently make you smile and is well worth your time and money. As I live in Europe, I keep thinking that I, too, should take my dog on vacation. We could even take the family car. Who knows what amazing things we would see and do? To start somewhere, we have begun to collect all shots necessary for a dog passport."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Ella in Europe is about dreams coming true, and in this case the dream is the author's ambition to bring his Therapy Dog to Europe with him for a summer where she can be treated like a member of the family. What I loved about this book was that it wasn't cutesy or gushy. I also liked that unlike some other dog books I've bought the author didn't actually make the dog have dialog, like it could talk like a human. It's very well written and easy to read. I think even my Maltese Ginger could understand it. Most of all anyone who likes dogs will understand where the author is coming from.Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Like the author I have had dogs in my life from a very early age and I have always appreciated the good things that they bring to life. I have a black lab mix (Porter) who I have always wanted to take with me on trips. Ella's travels in Europe are something that many dog people would like to do but don't because of cost or logistics. It's fun to read about a dog-lover who actually did what all of us wish about doing. I laughed out loud many times during this easy to read book. My Porter does some of the same things Ella does, like standing in between stranger's legs for attention and kissing when asked. I also shed a tear or two. This is a very moving book. I recommend it to anyone who has ever loved a dog. Warning: Some of the pictures are EXTREMELY CUTE!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"When was the last time you read a travel book which made you dig deep into your own emotions?

We're all enjoying a slow weekly trip to the continent with Ella and Michael, and learning a lot about dogs, families, friendships and cultures along the way.I don't know if I'll be able to say \\"no\\" to the annual request to get a dog when we're finished with this tale (no pun intended).I thought we got a travel book, but we got much more."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Miss Ella is my new hero. She got to go all around Europe with a handsome escort to show her the sites. What a diva.There were times in this story when I was simultaenously laughing and crying. It was like a good movie in parts. I could definitely see it up there on the silver screen with Ella playing herself and Ben Affleck playing her owner.Ella is not a lap dog in any way which is probably fortunate. She comes across as calm and that helped, I'm sure.This is a fabulous story that anyone who cares about a pet is going to enjoy."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book is more than a beautiful tale about a charming man and his elegant canine bestfriend, Ella, and their adventure together in the most exciting places in Europe. This would have been reason enough to be completely satisfied with this book, however, it is also moving story about an extraordinary friendship and loyalty. The loyalty Ella has to her master is endearing but what is more moving to me is the author's loyalty to his bestfriend. I laughed. I was fascinated. I was deeply moved. I highly recommend this book not only to dog lovers but also to those who are a fan of friendship, loyalty, beauty and life."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Ella in Europe is a moving and enjoyable read. I looked forward to reading about every place they experienced together. And what a joy to have your best friend with you in restaurants, trains, taxis, grand hotels and beaches. It really should help open the eyes of the U.S travel industry to be more accepting of our 4 legged, loyal and loving companions being accepted in their establishments.A truly touching book that had me laughing and crying at the same time. Mr. Konik is a superb writer whose vivid discriptions share what he and Ella experienced and the emotions felt from man to his dog. I look forward to their next adventure!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Once I started I couldn't put this book down. If you're a dog person you're going to love this. I've never been to Europe but I felt like I did after reading about Ella's travels."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book was so good I had to pace myself a few chapters at a time so I wouldn't finish it too quickly. I felt like I was along for the journery with Michael and Ella. At times I would catch myself telling my wife \\"We're in Venice now,\\" or \\"we just got on the train to Berlin\\" like I was there.This book is very sentimental. If you have ever loved a pet you will relate with the great bond between Michael and the amazing Ella. If you haven't, you'll probably wonder what all the fuss is about. I can tell you that I shed more than a few tears, and I found myself nodding along several times thinking, \\"yes, that's true. That's how it feels to love a dog.\\"I'm grateful to have discovered this little gem, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a delightful story told with real panache.The pictures are great, too!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This is one of the most heartwarming books I have ever read. A must read for dog lovers and non-dog lovers. It's wonderful to know that someone else loves his dog like my husband and I love ours. Our dog, Attorney, was abused before we got him and is unable to travel like Ella. Through this book I was able to imagine what it would be like to travel with our own beloved canine. Thank you Michael Konik."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"\\"Ella in Europe\\" is a must read for anyone who loves dogs. It's the story of Ella, a lab/greyhound mix, and her Dad, Michael, who decides to take Ella to Europe as a reward for her work as a therapy dog.Prior to their European adventure, we are privileged to see Ella at work. During her therapy sessions, Ella teaches her Dad a thing or two about life, about REALLY learning to accept others, about living in the moment, and being grateful for the many things that most of us take for granted.During their adventures in Europe, Ella, Michael and Sandrine enjoy eating in the finest restaurants, staying in swanky hotels, hobnobbing with the locals in pubs, etc. Ella is allowed to enjoy life to the fullest, something which dogs in the United States can only dream of doing.This book is written with great honesty, great love, and a great sense of humor. There are many memorable scenes and passages, but there is one in particular which strikes a chord in all of us who have ever had the privilege of sharing our home and our heart with a dog:How I dread the day when I'll have to say goodbye to my best friend. Everyone who's ever owned a dog knows how these magical creatures quickly evolve from mere pets and pleasant distractions to fully vested members of the family. They're our four-legged sons or daughters or siblings. We care for and fret over them as though they were parents or offspring. People who dislike animals don't comprehend the dog lover's devotion. They innocently wonder, \\"What's the big deal? It's just a dog.\\"Those of us who share our homes with dogs can't comprehend such a benighted viewpoint. To us, the love and transcendent light a dog brings into this world are a very big deal, indeed. Ella Guinevere is an extraordinary animal unlike most any other I've known. But in many ways, she's just like any other dog on earth.: They all radiate goodness into our frequently evil world. They all make us humans smile----and cry and laugh and sigh. They all make us feel. And for that we should be eternally grateful.Do yourself a favor and pick up this book. You won't regret it. It also makes a great gift for family and friends who are animal lovers."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I totally loved this book!

Smiling Ella on the front cover grabbed my attention and she stole my heart right from the start. The nursing home stories were especially touching. Michael Konik's writing is magical and his love for Ella (and Europe) is genuine. It was such a fun read, especially since I have visited many of the same cities (sans dog but with 2 kids and a hubby). I hope you will enjoy this wonderful 'love' story. I truly did."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I just loved this book. Ella is a magical and wonderful dog. Michael Konik is a great author and I felt as if I were in Europe with his descriptions of resturants and bars, hotels and the people throughout. He really loves Ella and so did the people in Europe.

It is so heartwarming to read a story about a guy who is as crazy about his dog as we are.I took this book on a trip to Europe with me and I enjoyed every moment. Ella is an inspiration and I can't wait to travel theglobe with my own dog.p.s. - we are now all teaching our dogs the junk food trick! You'll have to read the book to find out what that is."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I'm probably more of a \\"cat person,\\" although I like dogs also. I'm a big fan of great travel writing, and this book by Michael Konik has some of the liveliest and funniest travel writing I've read. His book about Scotland was a little darker than this one. Having his great dog Ella along seems to have made the author appreciate more the wonderful sights and sounds that Europe has to offer travelers. I especially liked his eye for detail in Paris and in Rome. Reading this very fun book makes me think traveling with your dog might be the way to go!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I am a fellow lover of travel, dogs, and jazz music. This book really hit a chord with me. I'm starting to have fantasies about taking my \\"very tranquil and educated\\" Labrador mix to France with me. I especially liked the author's goofy sense of humor with his dog - his silly nicknames and the goofy songs he sings her. It was very cute without being sappy or overly sentimental. I also enjoy travel books. This was a fresh look at all the great European classics."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I got to meet Ella and her dad the author last weekend, and I got a \\"paw-tograph\\" from her in my book. What can I say? She's awesome, and I can't imagine anyone who likes dogs not loving this book. It's a great story about a really nice doggie, which all of us who care for a four-legged companion can relate to. I literally laughed and wiped away a tear because the author is a very moving writer.Favorite moments include the restuarant in Paris and the rainy night in Prague, the Mozart visit, and of course riding on a boat in Venice. My only complaint is that I read the whole book cover to cover in one day. I wanted it to go on, maybe more countries visited, or more adventures. I hope there's a sequel!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I am a big dog lover who volunteers at our local SPCA. I have a Cockapoo (Tyler), an Akita mix (Farley), and a great Golden named Roxy. All of us loved Ella's story of traveling in Europe. We all wished we could be there together, going to restaurants and shops. Michael Konik writes about his \\"best friend\\" with sensitivity and real understanding. He's obviously a \\"dog person\\"! I don't travel as much as I would like to, because I hate to leave my babies behind. After reading about Michael and Ella's adventures I feel inspired to get my dogs over to Europe and have some of the same experiences. This book made me cry tears of happiness. It's really that good. As soon as I finish writing this review I'm ordering 5 more copies to give to other people who love dogs."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"As a Lab owner, I was very excited when this book came out. The best part of the book was when Konik met Ella. After reading about their adventure through Europe for a while, I was glad I checked this book out from the library instead of buying it. Don't get me wrong! I like Ella. She seems to be a good dog. But Konik's style of writing drives me crazy! Very very boring."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"A dog lover myself, I was intent on finding this book excellent. Unfortunately, too much of the writing was simply fawning over how Ella was \\"incredible\\" and loved. More of Ella's actual adventures would have made this book better."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I'm puzzled why most people rate this book so highly. Ella is a 'good dog', as the author repeats again and again, but it gets boring quickly being told that repetively. The beginning, when we hear how he found Ella is the best part of the book; after that all the chapters seem the same. How many times do we have to hear that the author can't believe that Ella is actually in a Italian/French/Austrian/restaurant? The travel sections only have three points: Ella is a good dog. Ella amazingly got to eat in restaurants/travel in public transportation,etc. Everyone who meets Ella loves her. Just scramble those three sentences and insert words like 'Venice' and 'Eiffel Tower' and you'll have read the entire book.That said, I do love how much this man adores his dog, and I wish America did allow dogs as much freedom as Europe does."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Ella in Europe is a sweet, heart-warming tale of the European adventures of a man and his best friend. Being a \\"dog person\\" it's easy to relate to Michael's one way chatter, the nicknames, and the pure joy he gets just from being in Ella's company.Reading Ella in Europe makes me realize just how disadvantaged we are in the U.S. by not allowing our dogs to accompany us on many of our daily outings. Hopefully in time this will change, but until then, I think I'll start planning a trip abroad with my pup!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book didn't work for me as a travelogue or as a portrait of the extraordinary relationship between a dog and her guardian. I believe that Ella is an exceptional dog and it is obvious that Konik loves her and recognizes the value of their relationship. Unfortunately his writing style is comparable to watching a friend's vacation slide show--mostly boring and repetitive, but with just enough random beauty and poignancy to keep you awake. I know that Konik and Ella shared a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I'm glad that he'll always have those memories. Perhaps he should have left it at that."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book succeeded for me on all counts: as a dog book, a travel book, and as just plain good writing. I fell in love with Ella, just like Michael Konik wanted me to, and I loved the author's mix of plain old-fashioned love for his dog and his ability to see outside his own besottedness. Traveling with dogs (and with children) opens up a whole new and different realm of experience, and he captures it perfectly. Okay, as one reviewer said, Michael Konik may 'giggle' and 'chortle' too much, but so did I as I read the book. I rank this up there with \\"Pack of Two\\" by Caroline Knapp, and Jon Katz's books, other modern classics about dogs."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This book's fun and lightness really helped on a turbulent plane ride recently. Konik captures the essence of \\"being in the moment\\" and the joys of the simple things in life in the many European adventures he shared with his dog, Ella, and human friend, Sandrine. Neat details of the different European environments that welcome dogs and accounts of the warm receptions they received from locals. Ella's content look (Konik's too) was captured well in some of the photos. What a trip for human and dog to share!"},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I'm USMC retired. I have seen many things in this life that could turn you hard. Still I have a soft spot in my heart for dogs and the good feelings they inspire in human beings. Mr. Konik's book captures this phenomenon better than anything else I have read on the subject. I'm not ashamed to say that \\"Ella in Europe\\" brought tears of joy to my tired eyes when I recalled the dogs I have loved and lost and the great friendship the author has enjoyed with his exceptional animal. I am proud to own this marvelous book and suggest you read it and see if it has the same effect on you."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"You've got to have a hole in your heart to not like this sweet story of a man, his amazing dog, and a once in a lifetime trip. I wish I could do the same journey with my Maxie, but I don't think she would behave in restuarants as well as Ella! Highly recommended for people who like travel books AND dog books."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"This is a book to have on your bookshelf and would make an excellent gift for a friend.Michael Konik is very talented at making you feel like you are along for the journey throughout Europe. I hope he decides to take Ella on a road trip across the USA so I can read about adventures in parts of the country that are dog friendly and those that aren't quite so hospitable."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"I have read everything Jon Katz has written about his life with animals, so when I saw how highly he recommended this charming book about Michael Konik's travels with his American dog Ella, I knew I was in for a treat. Boy was he ever right. This is one of the most eloquently written testimonies to the power of love that dogs can bring to our human lives. Konik isn't afraid to be sentimental and genuinely touching when he writes about his great four-legged friend Ella, a lab-mix with a real connection to people she meets no matter what foreign language they speak. Ella comes off as a character in her own right. She never \\"speaks\\" out loud but the author does a fine job communicating what he imagines she might be thinking or feeling. Genuine \\"dog people\\" like me will feel like Konik is speaking their most cherished thoughts about what it means to have a dog in your life. However, I believe that non-dog people will enjoy this book also because it is so gracefully written and it has wonderful descriptions of all the great European cities where the author and Ella visited. I am giving it this year as my Holiday Gift! Thank you, Michael and Ella for your touching story, which made me laugh and giggle and, yes, cry all at the same time."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Every dog lover's dream adventure celebrating the joy of man and dog!

I needed something to get my mind off of what had happened to me. I needed a mental \\"boost\\"... something to re-affirm my once strong belief that life still holds joyous moments. I found such a relationship of love and mutual affection in Michael Konik's newest book \\"Ella in Europe\\". For anyone old enough to have read Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\" in school, you will fall in love with this book. The humor, compassion, and travel lore will raise your spirits and wanderlust to new heights. Just when you think life is boring or full of the type of challenges one can do without, a book like this appears and suddenly you can almost feel that canine compassion, transmitted without a single word, telling you that \\"everything will be alright\\". Ella comes across as part clown, part lover, part therapist, and All American Dog! Don't let the summer go by without picking up a copy of this most endearing couple as they both steal (and even mend) your heart."},{"Title":"Ella in Europe: An American Dog's International Adventures","review":"Ella was ten when she took the Grand Tour. Maybe you think that is a little young to enjoy Europe, but not in dog years. Ella is a very special pet and also one who goes into the hospitals to comfort those who hurt. Ella takes their hurt away. I once had a cat which did that for me; I called her my medicine cat. Just last year, Tosca made a trip of her own to cat heaven; she was nineteen years old in people years. I saw her rarely the past six years as I had moved some two hundred miles away. But she was always there for me and spent a lot of time 'comforting' me. Tosca had arthritis and many ailments, and yet she held on as long as I needed her. Now, her granddaughter, Star (yes, cats do have generations in families who love them), is doing the same thing. We take care of each other.Ella dressed for the occasions as she traveled in style. In Vienna, she proudly wore her American flag scarf on July 4. I love the photo of her 'bonjour' to the denizens (bovine) in Belgium. Michael Konik, her human, had a grand time escorting Ella to places you and I have only dreamed of: the Danube, Monte Carlo, Paris (where she posed in front of the Effeil Tower), Italy, Austria, Prague, Amsterdam, even Berlin.This was a treat verbally and visually as we travel along vicariously with two handsome people, one canine. On Saturday, I unexpectedly came across a trio of real Greyhound dogs. The male, they said was not in good condition, but as I petted him and told him how pretty he was, the shy white girl dog decided maybe she could trust me after all, and let me pet her. In between was the lovliest of all, a tan sleek Greyhound with tan eyes. They were all precious. They are a part of the local Greyhound Rescue Foundation, and have rescued people in perilous places. We are near the mountains, The Great Smoky Mtns. on one side and the Cumberlands on the other. Inexperienced hikers are always getting lost. These canine (so fragile-looking) can make the difference between life and death.Ella had the time of her life!

I had to keep reminding myself that the author was talking about a dog and not his girlfriend or boyfriend. He paid a disservice to all dogs by humanizing every aspect of Ella (can he really believe she is Audrey Hepburn???!!!), not even allowing her the dignity of being a wonderful dog. Even if I could have gotten past his imagined gushing of all Europeans over his dog, I couldn't get past the author's continuous use of words such as \\"chortle\\" and \\"giggle.\\" I felt like I was reading bad creative writing from a 9th grader who just discovered a Thesaurus.

Perhaps a bit too much time grinning with Ella in a Belgium bar, in Berlin, in Prague, on the train, on the bus, etc. As an American dog's human, I do understand and appreciate the culture shock, but I wanted to read more about Ella. After the third chapter the journey hits its stride becoming a fun travelogue of man, human friend, Sandrine, and cherished furry friend, Ella. Some of the logistics of the trip within Europe are included along with descriptions of the sights and sounds of the cities they visit.My one suggestion for improvement would be for more information on how Ella got to Europe and how the hotels were selected (unless all European hotels accept pets). Nice to read if some of the readers would want to take their pup to Europe.Ella in Europe is a pleasant read. Ella is incredibly well behaved taking her throngs of human fans in stride right along with all the sights she gets to visit. She's a fine traveler and chaperone. The trip must have been awesome for the author. Ella's human is justifiably proud of her accomplishments.Ella and Michael are a good team and you can't help but hope there may be a second book of adventures with Ella that we can look forward to reading and enjoying.Those folks that enjoy Ella in Europe, might also like to read Lauren's Story: An American Dog in Paris by Kay Pfaltz and Spotted in France: A Dog's Life ...

Controversies in this field include theoretical contentions (e.g., do psychodynamic mechanisms like repression really exist?), diagnostic and phenomenological controversies (e.g., is psychogenic amnesia a common traumatic stress reaction?), treatment questions (e.g., are treatments like Eye Movement Desensitization really as powerful as their proponents claim?), and societal and political tensions (e.g., is it morally appropriate for scientists to disseminate findings showing that childhood sexual abuse is not as harmful as previously believed?). Each of these issues, along with many others, have been hotly debated, both in scientific journals and in the popular press. Although there are some rigorous, scholarly books in this field, there are probably more volumes of impassioned polemics, based more on vested interests and clinical folklore than on hard data. A welcome, scholarly addition is Richard McNally's new book, Remembering Trauma. This is a superb volume largely about the phenomenology, mechanisms, and modification of traumatic memories. McNally's book targets a broad audience - clinicians and the general reader - as is appropriate for a book on such an important, wide-reaching subject. The book focuses primarily on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can be conceived as largely a disorder of memory; a disorder in which traumatic memories exert their influence in a variety of ways, such as by repeatedly intruding into the sufferer's stream of consciousness, and by coloring the way the person experiences and reacts to the world.McNally focuses on the empirical literature, including the numerous experimental studies conducted by his research group. However, his book is also liberally sprinkled with clinical examples and anecdotes, which complement the empirical reviews to bring the material to life. McNally does a good job of demonstrating the relevance of laboratory studies, which are often dismissed as irrelevant by some traumatologists. He demonstrates how lab findings are quite consistent with data from other sources, such as the methodologically sound field studies (e.g., naturalistic studies of children's memories for stressful medical procedures vs. other events) and the better-designed of the case studies. McNally goes where the data leads him, regardless of whether his conclusions are unpopular among some of the deans of traumatology. Among his important conclusions are the following:* People remember horrific experiences all too well. There is little, if any, compelling evidence for the repression (inability to recall) of traumatic memories. Trauma survivors, compared to others, do not have a superior ability to banish upsetting memories from awareness; \\"The notion that the mind protects itself by repressing or dissociating memories of trauma, rendering them inaccessible to awareness, is a piece of psychiatric folklore devoid of convincing empirical support\\" (p. 275).* Some people do not think about disturbing events for long periods of time, but that does not mean that they were ever unable to recall the events. There is no reason to postulate a special mechanism of repression or dissociation to explain why people may not think about disturbing experiences for long periods of time - a failure to think about something does not entail an inability to recall it.* Contrary to the view voiced by some clinicians, there is no compelling evidence that repeated episodes of abuse lead to impaired recollection (repression or dissociation) of abuse. In fact, repetition strengthens memory for abuse, although the person may not be able to recall every specific instance of abuse.* Contrary to advocates of the concept of \\"recovered memories\\", there is evidence that many or perhaps all recovered memories are false memories of horrific trauma. Recovered memory therapies - involving suggestion and leading questions that the patient has been abused, along with guided imagery and hypnosis - can induce false memories. In turn, these memories can induce PTSD or other forms of psychiatric disturbance.* Contrary to some views, evidence indicates that very high levels of stress do not impair the formation of traumatic memories. With increasing levels of arousal, attention is directed to the central features of the arousing event, at the expense of peripheral features. A robbery victim, for example, may vividly recall the gun shoved in his or her face, but may not recall the face of the assailant. This is not repression or dissociation.* There is little convincing evidence that traumatic stress damages the brain. Preexisting (e.g., genetic) factors are the most likely explanation for the differences between the brains (e.g., differences in hippocampal volume) of PTSD sufferers compared to controls.The timeliness and importance of McNally's book is evident in widespread attention it has quickly garnered from the professional community and general public. In my view the book is among the best of its kind. McNally pulls no punches in shattering myths, and presents the reader with an accurate picture of the current state of scientific knowledge on the nature and consequences of traumatic memories.Although the book is outstanding, a limitation, at least for clinicians reading this book, is that the treatment implications could have been discussed at greater length. The pitfalls of \\"recovered memory therapies\\" are amply described, although I would have liked to have seen a discussion of other controversial treatments for traumatic memories, such as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and Thought Field Therapy. Proponents have made extraordinary claims about the efficacy of these treatments. Such claims do not hold up under careful scrutiny. McNally and colleagues have described some of the concerns with these treatments elsewhere, in articles appearing in scholarly journals. These important critiques deserve a wider, general audience, such as the audience intended for Remembering Trauma."},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"We usually do not think of it this way, but ideas on how people remember trauma have had a profound impact on our society. Just ask the Boston Archdiocese, which now worries that people will come forward with \\"false memories\\" of abuse, greatly adding to their financial liability. How are we to know who is telling the truth and who is just making it up out of greed? Feminism, moreover, has been advanced by some writers based partially on the idea of \\"recovered memory\\" of widespread sexual abuse of daughters by fathers. The vast therapy and mental healh businesses also have a huge financial interest in whether or not there is merit to the psychoanalytic idea of repressed memory. Concerned parents, further, wonder if stress from war on trauma and related television images damage our children psychologically. What affect might the bombing of Baghdag have on the citizens?With so much at stake in terms of money, politics, health care, and criminal court proceedings, scholars have been under severe pressure to lean this way or that even when writing in scholarly and scientific journals. So many controversies and professional attacks have been launched that until now it has been hard for people who need to know the truth to find an objective account of the facts about memories of past trauma and recent trauma.In his book \\"Remembering Trauma,\\" Harvard University Professor Richard McNally, one of the world's most distinguished behavioral scientist, has put forth a badly needed objective and balanced account of all major issues concerning how people remember traumatic events; he also covers postraumatic stress disorder and related issues. This is THE scientific, authoritative summary of what is really known about the psychological issues of trauma that have had political and legal impact in the last decade or so. Just the facts, no spin. The book is thoughtful, thorough, and deals even handedly with the major issues. The book is a must read for any thoughtful person with a professional or personal interest in trauma.What about, moreover, the people who say they remeber alien abduction?"},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"McNally's book is required reading for those interested in the controversies over &quot;recovered memories of trauma.&quot; His tone is even, sometimes wry, but never accusatory towards those who may not share his conclusions.Of particular interest is his attention to various studies that have been used by both &quot;sides&quot; in the debates. For example, in his chapter &quot;Traumatic Amnesia,&quot; a reader will find a sober evaluation of theories presented by such worthies as Terr, van der Kolk, and JJ Freyd -- here McNally drills down into the meat of the supporting data used to flesh out the theories, and in so doing, lays out the exact areas of dispute.Ms Crook's review makes one important error: The Freyd study she notes did not assess for PTSD, and so is not comparable to McNally's laboratory work."},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"Lynn Crook's review notes a Freyd et al (2003) study that relicated McNally's wordlist experiments, writing that the PTSD subjects experienced greater forgetting of trauma-related words. This is incorrect. No measures of PTSD were taken in the Freyd study. The measure was the DES (Dissociative Experiences Scale).See: &quot;Forgetting Trauma Stimul1&quot; http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jjf/dpfinpress.pdf"},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"Readers of \\"Remembering Trauma\\" should be on the lookout for the occasional overgeneralization beyond the data.For example, the author discusses two studies in which subjects watched videotapes of a simulated crime. The subjects recalled the simulated crime. McNally concluded, perhaps too broadly, that \\"exposure to a shocking event does not produce \`amnesia' for the event itself\\" (p. 51).McNally describes a directed-forgetting task he gave to three groups: child abuse survivors with PTSD, survivors without PTSD and subjects without a child abuse history. Subjects viewed a series of words on a computer screen, some words were trauma-related (such as \\"incest\\") and some weren't. The PTSD group recalled the trauma words as well as the other subjects.McNally concluded, again perhaps too broadly, that \\"if survivors were capable of forgetting memories of abuse, they should have been capable of forgetting words related to their trauma\\" (p. 269).McNally overlooked a critical element: trauma. Freyd et al (2003) introduced stress to the directed-forgetting task and the results were much different. The PTSD group recalled the trauma-related words less well.The occasional repetitions (151-268; 260-265-48; 21-237) are disconcerting. The phrase &quot;all too well&quot; (as in: people remember trauma all too well) appears often enough throughout the book to be distracting. I wondered if the original title was: &quot;Remembering Trauma All Too Well.&quot; Proper names are missing from the index. Hopefully the next edition will rectify these minor problems."},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"Dr. McNally's book systematically exposes and debunks the bogus claims of true believers in so-called &quot;repressed memory syndrome.&quot; He meticulously demolishes the entire &quot;trauma industry&quot; of healers and psychologists as an enterprise devoid of convincing empirical support, and one that resembles folklore at its worst.It is must reading for both the general public and therapists alike. One of the top books of 2003."},{"Title":"Remembering Trauma","review":"McNally wants you to think he is evenhanded and \\"professional\\" but he reveals his biases in the introduction by announcing that repression and dissociation are postulated rather than that they exist.The book is based on academic studies of vets, survivors, normal people, etc, etc, but it is not based on talking to survivors. How much of your deepest pain would you tell to a grad student in a white coat doing a study?In the 80's, when some of the books he cites so contemptuously, were written, survivors of trauma and their therapists were fighting to be heard. Denial of trauma was universal. PTSD had just been re-recognized in 1980. Gross Stress Reaction was the DSMI (1952) diagnosis, but that dissappeared in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual II, which came out in 1968. He's so evenhanded, he doesn't even mention that, nor that psychiatrists were trained to disbelieve allegations of sexual abuse and to think the child wanted it. Kids want attention, love and affection, not sex... Vietnam vets were being told that war hadn't messed them up, although in 1965 Archibald and Tuddenham had published a study about how WWII had messed up those vets. Battered wives supposedly liked it or they wouldn't go back... Only weaklings were affected by trauma.In my opinion, this is an academic book for academicians who want to insulate themselves from the reality of trauma and pretend that lab studies are the equivalent of traumatic events. Lots of tap dancing around reality. If you are looking for help or for realism, look elsewhere.Betrayal Trauma by Jennifer Freyd is a far better, more evenhanded book."},{"Title":"Blue & gray in black & white: Newspapers in the Civil War","review":"I enjoy books about the Civil War.

That does not stop me from endorsing the material though I reduced my rating based on the fact that this is hardly an enjoyable read and a downright unaccessable read (because of its dense, academic style) for of the vast majority of the public. Nonetheless (is that even a real word?), if one can slog through the first several chapters, Mannheim's attempt to identify the motivations and devices of knowledge and ideology create a esoteric bridge linking this achievement with Aristotle's \\"Metaphysics\\", Locke's \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\\", and later continued with Foucault's \\"The Archaeology of Knowledge\\". This is also an important piece when examined in the historical and geo-political context which existed in the 1920s. I would label this as \\"neccesary\\" reading for any graduate sociology student, any self-annointed philosopher, or anyone with extreme time on their hands--such as the incarcerated.

The book, in its authentic form, is a landmark collection of essays by Karl Mannheim which was first published in German under the title \\"Ideologie und Utopie.\\" Kessinger Publishing, LLC has mis-titled this volume by inserting the word \\"An\\" in front of the translated words: \\"Ideology and Utopia.\\" They have done this either because members of Kessinger's editorial staff do not know the real title or, more likely, because they figure that such insertion insures that their caricature will appear before any of the authentically titled versions on an Amazon search. For that reason alone this edition would deserve to be avoided--even if that left no alternative but to learn German and read the original. There are alternatives however. These range in price from dirt cheap for a used umpteenth printing to sky high for a collectible edition. Take your pick of those, I advise, but do not choose this Kessinger travesty.The work itself (in a respectable edition) stands as a highly readable and much discussed introduction to a specialized branch of sociology known as the sociology of knowledge. The two principal exponents of this specialized study are Mannheim and Max Scheler. A search on their names will produce an intriguing list of titles available on Amazon, but \\"Ideology and Utopia\\" is the right place to begin for anyone not already familiar with the literature. (Also, worth considering is the volume: \\"From Karl Mannheim\\" which contains selections from a broad range of Mannheim's writings together with editors' and translator's introductions that set forth the development and the interpretive tradition of Mannheim's body of work.) \\"Ideology and Utopia\\" includes a twenty page preface by Louis Wirth (one of its translators) which well serves the intention of acquainting an English speaking audience with the basics of Mannheim's approach.Today, the term 'Utopian' is achieving a new currency--this time as an element in the conservative characterization of left wing political ideas. Such reappearance of the concept of 'utopia' within the contemporary ideological contest makes it very timely to visit (or revisit) Mannheim's classic work of critique and analysis in which the originality of the author's contribution consists precisely in his juxtaposing the idea of 'utopian' to 'ideological' rather than, as is usual, to 'realistic' [or to 'realizable'].The following quote from one of the essays in \\"Ideology and Utopia\\" suggests (but does not fully encompass) Mannheim's idea of both the limitations on human thought and the possibilities for its advancement--\\"Strictly speaking it is incorrect to say that the single individual thinks. Rather it is more correct to insist that he participates in thinking further what other men have thought before him.\\"On the bottom line: consider the author; experience the work; but avoid the edition."},{"Title":"Ideology and utopia;: An introduction to the sociology of knowledge","review":"There is a warning on the first page that this might be a bad print, but I'd love it if I had known before buying it....

However, it doesnft mean its content is less correct. I like this translation more than the German version because it is easier to read.This book consists of three articles and the prelude. The first chapter is the same as the title of this book and the most interesting. It explains the term of the ideology in the context of the history of the epistemology. This term was derived from Marxism, which exposes the ideal as the legitimization of the individual interest to invalidate it. The sociological explanation inspired by this method, ironically speaking, makes the ontological existence of the class by Marxism relative as the historical production, and regards it as the particular epistemology determined by the history. It is succeeded by the Max Weberfs concept of the stratification, which means the epistemological constitution of the subject of the analysis.This articlefs aim is to make the concept of the ideology of Marxism more useful by generalizing it. The thesis that the consciousness doesnft determine the social conditions, but that the social conditions do the consciousness applies to anybody without any exceptions. Therefore, this thought is named as ethe sociology of the knowledgef or consciousness.The necessary for readers is the knowledge of the basic modern epistemology and the basic Marxism.

The recent Iranian protests are not aimed at dimantling the iron bond between Islam and the State but for less autocratic and restrictive secular rule and a better economy. The Republicans call for proactive US meddling in this revolt is in the radical tradtion of the last administrtion and will harm the potentional for internally generated change in Iran by its people and not by the Mullahs definied foreign devil. Republicans need to read a book a book or two like the Paris Commune to temper their radical dreams for Iran which may lead to an unwanted result much as the Hamas victory in the US sponsored Palestine election did not foster peace."},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"I'm a history buff and the period I love the best is 1900-1930 which is why I love Betsy Tacy so much.

While I liked the parallel lives demonstrated in each chapter, it wasn't important to me to know EVERYBODY in every book -- just the core characters were fine with me. It's a shame that Maud could not write &quot;Betsy's Bettina&quot; because she could not make life echo fiction (or the other way around). But this biography was greatly needed -- and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"We fans had been yearning for this information for years, and were hugely relieved to get this glorious compendium of meticulously researched information. If you have never tried the books, do, and then find yourself a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"As a big Betsy-Tacy fan, I eagerly awaited my copy of The Betsy-Tacy Companion, but I found it to be a disappointment. Sharla Whelan dissects every minute detail in the life of Maud Hart Lovelace, including floor plans of Betsy-Tacy characters' houses, comparisons of Deep Valley vs. Mankato street names and much other information. Do we really need to know that a particular date in Betsy Ray's life was a Tuesday, but that same date in Maud Hart's life was a Friday? I was hoping for a straightforward biography of Maud Hart Lovelace, but this book was tedious and sometimes downright boring. I'm considering selling my copy because I doubt that I'll ever want to read it again. One redeeming factor is the many photos of Maud and her friends and family."},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"This book represents an incredible effort that can only be described as a labor of love and a gift to all Betsy-Tacy fans. Sharla Scannell Whalen has done an impressive amount of research, interviewing people connected to the characters MHL wrote about, reading correspondence, examining old newspapers and county records, and recreating even the floor plans of old houses.Probably no biography could ever answer all of the questions of devoted B-T fans like myself. Short of a personal interview with Maud Hart Lovelace, nothing could probably satisfy our curiousity. Whalen's book, in many ways, is less a biography than a corroboration of the Betsy-Tacy books. In itself, that makes it precious to fans of the series. I liked knowing something about the characters' counterparts. Presumably due to the vagaries of historical research, we learn more about some (e.g. Carney/Marney) than others (e.g. Marguerite/Emily). A few of the episodes most important for understanding Betsy's character and growth (and thus, according to Whalen's well-substantiated argument, Maud's), are not verified - for example, the interlude in Betsy's Wedding when Joe's aunt comes to live with them, prompting Betsy to interrogate her own possessiveness and to expand her ideas of family.I loved this book, but unfortunately I think its appeal will be largely limited to Betsy-Tacy fans and people interested in children's books. I don't know that it would have been feasible for Whalen to do this, given her interest in documenting the similarities between Betsy's and Maud's lives, but I would have liked to see her set the overlapping stories of their lives in a broader social history context. How much richer the book would have been if we could have understood Betsy's and Maud's girlhoods against a larger picture of early 20th century adolescence. How unique was it, for example, that all of Betsy's friends attended high school, and many of them college, in an era when less than 20% of the school-aged population graduated from high school? This suggests important and interesting things about Betsy's/Maud's family and class background, the economy of Deep Valley/Mankato, and the social mores of her Crowd. This book is so readable that, if it had presented the B-T books not only as a window into Maud Hart Lovelace's life but into the lives of young women of a certain racial, social, and class background in the early 20th century, it could be a huge contribution to the field of women's history. In short, the book is long on description and documentation; I would have only liked to see more analysis.But there is limited use in bemoaning what a book does not do. What this book does is pretty tremendous. It's truly a pleasure to read, and invaluable to anyone who ever wanted to know what happened to Betsy, Tacy, Carney, Tib, Cab, and Tony after the end of the series."},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"&quot;I thought I was the only one,&quot; is the comment most often uttered when meeting another Betsy-Tacy fan. We make up a tight little society that can't be explained to those who have not read the B-T series and this Companion is a most welcome addition to the body of works. It helped me find the pension in Munich where Betsy stayed and the Casa del'Oro in Venice where she fell in love with Marco, even though we were all pining for Joe Willard. I fed the pigeons in St. Mark's Square just as Betsy did and this delightful, informative book helped in my search. The author has done a painstaking research job and I, for one, know that it was a true labor of love. Sharla has taken her rightful place on my bookshelf right next to all of Maud's other works. I can think of no higher honor."},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"This book is heaven-sent! While probably not very interesting to anyone who has not read the Bets-Tacy books, this book is a jewel for all those who have. It tells absolutely everything! If photos are what you're after, they're in the Companion. If you want to learn all the details of Maud's real life, you'll also find those. I love the clips of Maud's letters to her friends, and I sorely lament the fact that she burned her diaries. Would she have burned them if she had known how much she'd be loved? This book has all the answers to all the questions you've ever asked. I was ecstatic when I found it, and I hope many more people will find it. It's defiantly not worth ignoring!"},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"This book is a lot of fun to have around when you're reading or re-reading the Betsy-Tacy series! It tells the stories behind the stories, compares the events in the books to events in Maud's life, and includes wonderful pictures of the real people behind the fictional names.It is not intended to be a straight-out biography of Maud but rather how her life paralleled Betsy's. The research is detailed and voluminous, and very well done. This kind of a book could have been very tedious and boring, but I didn't find it that way at all. The writing was sprightly and included some humor, and I just really enjoyed paging through it as I re-read the series this summer!Any Maud or Betsy fan should own this book!"},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"After reading the reviews, I knew it was a must have! I haven't put it down yet! I can't believe the feelings I have since I have looked at the pictures...Tony really was handsome, and Joe looks just as Maud described him in her books. I can honestly say that this biography is everything that I had hoped for and more. Sharla has made a dream come true. I can't believe my visions of these characters have been brought to life through this biography. Well done, Sharla! It is wonderful to know that I am not the only fan!"},{"Title":"The Betsy-Tacy Companion: A Biography of Maud Hart Lovelace","review":"Betsy-Tacy fans, rejoice! Sharla Scannell-Whalen has written the ultimate book for those of you who want MORE! The author gives a wealth of information about the real-life counterparts for just about every character in the Maud Hart Lovelace classics. Interesting details about the history of the Lovelace family are also included. The many photographs add immensely to the reader's understanding. I had the pleasure of meeting Sharla several years ago and it was obvious that this project was her joy and her life - and the book shows it, too.

It's like loosing touch with an old friend, and you are left to wonder what happened to Betsy, Joe and the gang? Why was \\"Betsy's Bettina\\" never published?Did Joe come back from the war?Thanks to what must have been a time consuming and massive effort by Sharla Scannel Whalen, you can find out. This very thick hardback is crammed full of every minute detail relating to Maud Hart Lovelace's series that the author could find.The Betsy-Tacy Companion is divided into chapters that address each book in order. In each chapter she compares and contrasts characters and thier real life counterparts, as well as information about the homes and businesses in the real Deep Valley of Mankato where their adventures took place. There is an additional chapter that tells you what happened to as many main characters as possible after the series ended. The book includes photos, illustrations, and clippings in addition to the text.The format struck me as more textbook than biography. It can at times, seem a very dry read. It's a chapter at a time sort of read for me, as opposed to a straight through read. It's obvious that when Whalen was researching this book that sources of information were becoming increasingly hard to find. Although some information may seem unimportant or unnecesary, it's inclusion is worthwhile in that it keeps those bits of history from being lost forever. You get the sense that was very important to Whalen, this isn't just a book, it's labor of love devoted to preserving as much of the Lovelace legacy as possible.I may not sit down and read this through annually like I do the novels, but I will keep it and treasure it. More important, I hope someday my own daughters will appreciate having a book that will never be rivaled in detail and depth.

With a mixture of scholarship, organization and humor, the author has written a book that would make Maud proud. Although this is not a bio. that one would be likely to pick-up unless the subject is known and loved by them, it is a very good read. Besides all sorts of fascinating minutae, there is a great deal of information about turn- of- the-century life, as well as information about how to turn real-life into a work of fiction so real that literally hundreds of people familiar with Betsy, Tacy, Tib and their companions will never completely get over not having grown up in early twentieth century Deep Valley,MN. The material is well organized, each book in the series has a chapter all its own with lots of photographs of the prototypes of the characters. We also get to find out what happened to them.

The Betsy-Tacy series is a special one, and the companion goes deep into the magic of Deep Valley and Mankato without killing it altogether. Definitely a must have for anyone in love with Deep Valley.Oh and I was pleasantly surprised to see chapters for Emily of Deep Valley and Carney's House Party."},{"Title":"Michael Jordan Star Guard","review":"Michael JordanMy book review is titled \\"Michael Jordan Star Guard,\\" by Ron Knapp. Michael Jordan is a very special player, but he had to work to be in the NBA. When he was young he worked too much and skipped classes. Then his dad had a talk with him about getting good grades, so he stopped skipping classes. The reason Michael started playing sports is because he had a crush on a girl and he wanted to impress her. Michael Jordan's dream was to win a champion game in the NBA. But he didn't even make the high school team because he was too short. Finally, Michael won three NBA championship games. The most impressive thing about Michael Jordan was that he would not only make the most shots, but score winning shots. Michael would also play better with more pressure on him which made him more noticible.This is a very well put together book. The book is organized from when Michael was born to the present day. This book has chapter organization, an index, and a table of contents. It even has a note page that covers each chapter. The pictures and the special facts make the book even better. The pictures let the reader see what things looked like back when the picture was taken. The facts tell the reader about things that took place in that time. This book was so good that I can't think of anything to change. I would recommend this book to any athlete that is willing to work hard."},{"Title":"Montezuma Strip","review":"and add a little Southwestern flavor. Try it; you'll like it.

Heffner, is an excellent anthology of historic texts. Thefirst edition of this essential book appeared in 1952, and new andenlarged editions have gradually appeared over the decades. The textsin this book include many key documents that have shaped United Stateshistory.There is an emphasis on political and legal documents: theDeclaration of Independence, several key Supreme Court decisions,Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Clinton's 1998 State of the UnionAddress, and much more. There are also many texts fromnon-governmental individuals and bodies: the first issue of theanti-slavery periodical &quot;The Liberator,&quot; William Faulkner's1949 Nobel Prize acceptance speech, the 1966 Statement of Purpose ofthe National Organization for Women, and much more.As I said, thisbook has &quot;grown&quot; considerably over the decades. Aparticularly impressive enlargement marks the 6th edition, which adds100 pages of new documents. Among these new additions are BookerT. Washington's Atlanta Exposition Address, the Articles ofImpeachment against Richard M. Nixon, and the 1994 Republican&quot;Contract with America.&quot;The book as the whole is more thanjust a collection of documents. Rather, it feels like fragments from agreat epic story: the story of the United States. In this book you seethis nation and its citizens in all of our weakness and our strength,our foolishness and our wisdom. We see the struggles to deal as anation with slavery, war, women's rights, economic injustice, andother controversial issues. And we see the development of a UnitedStates &quot;tradition,&quot; a heritage of pivotal documents whichsometimes comment on earlier documents.Yes, I'm sure most readerscould name worthy texts that they feel should have been included inthis book; maybe some of them will appear in future editions. Afterall, this excellent anthology is truly a &quot;living book.&quot; Notjust for teachers and students, this book should be in the library ofevery serious citizen of the United States."},{"Title":"A Documentary History of the United States Sixth Edition","review":"I'll start with the good: all of the material up through the end of World War I is superb. The national vs. state power issues in the emerging republic, as well as the pre-Civil War debate, are both well-represented. The high point is the pair of essays back to back, one by Theodore Roosevelt and the other by Woodrow Wilson, which describes in detail the nature how excessively concentrated business interests working in collusion were a detriment to the freedom of opportunity, and outlines some progressive proposals to reform the problem.However, the treatment of the history that follows (at least on domestic issues) doesn't give an even-handed nature of the debate. Rather than reflecting a debate over the nature and degree of government intervention and regulation, the interruptions of and objections to progressivism (no matter how far it was taken) are treated as minor blips on the historical map. Calvin Coolidge is given scant little mention, the causes that turned the 1929 recession into a depression are not given their sufficient mention, and the New Deal is more glowingly presented than the actual results would indicate. If any one of these overgeneralizations were left out, it would be at least a little more fair in depicting the 20th century prior to World War II. But with all three of them together, it paints a picture of a population virtually uninterrupted in its desire for more government intervention, and it cuts off at the root any accurate portrayal of the opposition to the New Deal Revolution and beyond.In particular, when mention is made of the Reagan Presidency, the author includes Mario Cuomo's &quot;Tale of Two Cities Speech&quot;, which was little more than raw meat fed to the delegates at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. If there had been any mention of this kind of detail of the threat the New Deal was having on the balance of powers between the branches of government and to private enterprise, the tilt of the book would be lessened.There is also the matter of typographical errors, of which there were several. I wouldn't bring this up were it not for page 339, which tells the reader that the &quot;day of infamy&quot;, the day that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, was December 1, 1941(!).As a reference, I would recommend the book. The choices (with the one exception noted above) are fine, and the overall structure of the book lends itself to being able to read one chapter without having to read other material, which makes it handy to thumb through any part and be able to pick out important speeches and materials without having to read the 50 pages preceding or following the material. As a straightforward depiction of American history, I can only give the book muted praise."},{"Title":"A Documentary History of the United States Sixth Edition","review":"You can probably ignore \\"Teacher's\\" review. Heffner has, through seven editions, tried to maintain objectivity while including contemporary criticisms with the original documents. His book is neither Eurocentric, conservative or leftist. If you're tired of having Glen Beck spin the Constitution and other early founding documents for his own ends, get a copy of ADHOTUS and read the original, unaltered, unabridged documents for yourself and form you OWN opinions. This is essential reading for all Americans."},{"Title":"A Documentary History of the United States Sixth Edition","review":"Read the words that shaped the character of our nation and changed the history of the world. From the rousing Declaration of Independence to the inspiring speeches of our modern presidents, this book has it all. Students and scholars alike will find this an excellent reference tool. This book should be in the hands and minds of every American who loves liberty."},{"Title":"A Documentary History of the United States Sixth Edition","review":"The material presented here is both timely and important. The selection of documents related to the Revolutionary period are superb. In its updated edition, the book also contains the two speeches made by President George Bush following the events of 11 September. In terms of its scope, the book is certainly an excellent one-volume resource (the typographical error already related regarding _7_ December 1941 is disturbing, however).However, the editor's insertion of essays deliberately crafted to reflect only one side of the many controversial issues in American history to which the documents relate is both intrusive and unfair. In particular, the author's discussion of the 2000 election results is poorly crafted and serves only to further the agenda of his obvious party affiliation.Overall, the book is an excellent anthology of major American documents and speeches. The volume suffers, however, because of its editor's unwillingness to leave behind partisan politics in favor of a balanced approach to history. Because history and politics are both highly dependent on a balanced approach for any veracity, the book loses a great deal of credibility in its author's constant harangues against opinions he does not hold, but that are nonetheless valid."},{"Title":"A Documentary History of the United States Sixth Edition","review":"Unfortuntately, the first words of this textbook encourage a Eurocentric view of American history. The textbook from here does a good job of boring the student to death and avoids any attempt at truth, especially until the 1930's. Also, I noticed another glowing error. The grapabo review and the textbook suggests that the Civil War was fought as a states issues. However, Abraham Lincoln and the everyone else in the 1860's on both sides would disagree. Another example of perpetuating the Confederate Myth. I would not recommend this book to any of my classes."},{"Title":"The power and the wisdom;: An interpretation of the New Testament,","review":"Fr. McKenzie's book, The Power and the Wisdom, is a thoroughly unusual work. I learned about it from Fr. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, who is another unusual priest, and who owns to having been greatly influenced by Fr. McKenzie in adopting the uncompromising non-violence of both the Lord Jesus and Fr. McKenzie. Norhing dismays Fr. McKenzie; He sails ahead with his condemnation of the warmakers without a qualm; they of course return the compliment and sail ahead with their warmaking without taking any notice of either McKenzie or the Christ. War is too important for any such damn npnsense as McKenzie promotes. Or the Christ promotes. It has been a phony church since Constantine from the point of view of the McKenzies; it is now as phony in its war worship as ever. It would be interesting if the Church (I am thinking of my Church, the Cathoilic one) would take up Christ and non-violence. I do not expect it to happen.

I think the mother is pretty honest about her story, which is not easy to do as she was far from a perfect mother.

I go back and review it periodically just to remind myself of different aspects of it. I have two children whom I have raised to understand what equality is all about and how painful it can be to be different. Oddly, so many of us are different in so many ways, it's absurd to pick one group out and isolate them as wrong. Appalling really.This book reveals so much about our behavior and the harm we can cause, it's enlightening on many levels. Also, it's nice to be able to identify what to look for in kids that feels a bit different so we can support them. Gay kids are born all the time - telling them from early on that it's normal and wonderful and just a different way to express themselves is key to their happiness and sense of self.Chris & Marlene clearly have a very close relationship and it's comforting to know that throughout the book - you can see that everything she does is because she cares about him. Though she wanted him \\"normal\\", it was the time frame and the culture at that time. Really, what she wanted was for him to be happy, and she'd do whatever she could to achieve that....like any good mom.Wonderful wonderful wonderful!"},{"Title":"Not Like Other Boys","review":"I picked up this book in a store, never having heard about it before, and I read it in two days. This is a well-written account, with alternating chapters by mother and son, of what it was like to grow up as a gay male, and what it was like to raise a boy who was somehow different from the rest. There is a four-year age difference between myself and Chris Shyer, and our stories were in many, many ways similar, including my living near Chris' hometown. This book made me think of some of my own painful experiences coming to accept myself in a societal landscape where I was targeted as different. For that reason, this made it a sometimes difficult read for me but I still couldn't put the book down until I was finished. Very, very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"In Search Of Noah's Ark","review":"Great reading. This is my third copy of this book. I have read it several times, and I will read it several more. I never get tired of this amazing story."},{"Title":"In Search Of Noah's Ark","review":"This 1976 book by Dave Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, Jr. (who are also the authors ofThe Evidence for Heaven (The Faith Evidence Series),The Lincoln Conspiracy,Miraculous Messages/ Includes Book and Bonus DVD (Faith Evidence),Ancient Secrets of The Bible, etc.) was also a movie by Sun Classic Pictures,In Search of Noah's Ark.It must be observed that the film (and thus the book) is widely considered (even by creationist organizations such as the Institute for Creation Research/ICR) to have contained substantial amounts of misinformation, and even to be a \\"hoax.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"To this day no one knows exactly what gopherwood is---or was. We can only speculate.\\" (Pg. 122)\\"The Bible doesn't say Noah and his sons had to build the Ark without the help of hired men. The Biblical account leaves several questions unanswered. How did Noah finance such a project? How many men did he hire? Did he have trouble getting men? How many years did it take to recruit workers? How many quit because they couldn't take the ridicule? What about sabotage and delays? We can only speculate.\\" (Pg. 126)\\"'Two-thirds of the way up the mountain, its bow stood out, black on a background of light-colored rocks,' said (Ferdnand) Navarra. 'But, when we came closer, we found that the bow was only a spur of rock, the same one the monks pointed out from their monastery, without ever having climbed up to verify what it was. We had not discovered the real thing, but we had put an end to a legend.\\" (Pg. 170)\\"Recently in America, the University of California released results of a testing procedure conducted on the Navarra wood by means of measuring the Carbon 14 in the wood... All dates obtained varied between 1,250 and 1,700 years---a rather large fluctuation for tests on the same sample and far short of 5,000 years...\\" (Pg. 185-186)"},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold Death","review":"James Munro is a combination of Ian Fleming and Robert Ludlum. I read this book many years ago and I still remember its opening pages. The book opens with a catastropic event that forces a reluctant man to face incredible challenges.The book is action packed with a lot of surprises. Great suspense as well. I believe that The Man Who Sold Death compares favorably with Trevanian's Eiger Sanction and Loo Sanction written at approximately the same time.This book was the first book in a very realistic espionage series. Since James Munro was one of the Best writer's of this genre from this era it would be a shame for his works to slip into obscurity.Although I liked the early Ian Fleming James Bond Novels I thought James Munro's espionage series was even better. These books are true classics of the 1970's"},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold Death","review":"I have not had a chance to read the book, but I had read it in the past and found it to be an excellent story, for those who like these books."},{"Title":"Reading the Japanese Mind: The Realities Behind Their Thoughts and Actions","review":"Popular media, stereotypes, etc. have made great strides in misinforming the West about Japan. Japan is much more complex than sushi, martial arts, and electronics; and the people are more realistic than kamikaze businessmen and geisha girls. The Japanese have a very highly evolved social structure, and anyone who is interested in dealing with or studying Japan should read books like this one. Dr. March explains the Japanese pysche in a way that Westerners can understand. He doesn't dramatize their thinking as a sort of sage wisdom, nor does he go out of his way to discredit the Japanese.There are a few instances, however, in which March places too much emphasis on his personal experiences when drawing conclusions about the Japanese. It cannot be stressed enough that although Japan is a group-oriented society, the people are still individuals. One or two experiences certainly cannot be taken as a definition of the culture.One must also understand that Japan is changing rapidly. Even the concept of being Japanese is not the same as it was a few decades ago. Conservative people will always be around, but they do not necessarily represent today's Japan.All in all though, Reading the Japanese Mind is a good guide to the Japanese mindset."},{"Title":"Reading the Japanese Mind: The Realities Behind Their Thoughts and Actions","review":"Yes, yes, yes - I kept saying when I was reading this book. Seventy-five percent of the international students who had lived with me were Japanese. One of them sent me this book and I thank her forever for an extremely valuable gift. Until then I thought I knew about Japanese culture and habits, but this book was a true eye-opener. The examples were my students. The behaviors were those of my students. The attitudes were displayed by my students.I would like to give just one example. Before reading this book I took it for granted that when I gave directions and asked \\"did you understand everything?\\" and a \\"yes\\" accompanied by a nod of the head was the reply, my students would know how to get some place and back. But oftentimes that didn't happen, and they were lost for hours, much to my frustration. The need to please did not allow them to tell me they hadn't understood. After reading the book, I no longer asked. I had them repeat the directions and write them down. They no longer got lost.This book helped me to better understand and deal with my Japanese students. The knowledge allowed for better communication, assisting them with their culture shock experiences, their homesickness, their unique approach to family, friends, and community.Anyone considering travel and/or work in Japan or hosting Japanese students in their homes should read this book."},{"Title":"Reading the Japanese Mind: The Realities Behind Their Thoughts and Actions","review":"I've lived in Japan for many years before retiring. I am always looking for someone or something to continue educating me on the Japanese mind.... but, this book ain't it! Once you get past the fifty-cent words that only need to be dime-words...well, then you get a little bit of what might have some meaning. What the author says in chapters could easily be said in a few paragraphs. The author apparently has great experience \\"in country\\"...But for all the nationals I lived with, worked with or taught, all the different ages, all the different locations and socio-economic levels I've experienced, I'd never suspect them of having much of what he tries to tell us in this book. What is somewhat accurate of Japanese mind-set, is clouded and made dull by the author's style and verbiage!! Even my Japanese wife thinks this book is only good for a pompous reader looking for some-kind of imagined status.I was really disappointed... You know, I was going to give this a three-star rating...but the more I read what I've written and the more I recall how difficult it was to enjoy this book... I will now reduce that to a two-star rating."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"Davis manages to transform a recipe book into a fascinating look into the biochemistry of food. Her books are the only comprehensive description I've ever found of practical nutrition, and this one is no exception. The technical information is made accessible and interesting, even for the general reader. The recipes are detailed, easy to use and often delicious when prepared to her instructions. Many of her ideas come from the great cooking traditions of the world. Her procedure for making soup stock, for example, is classically French a la Julia Child and just as practical. The difference here is that you'll know what makes soup stock incredibly delicious, highly nutritious and what your body does with it. Ever wonder why vegetables are easily overcooked? Davis explains the delicate enzymatic and structural changes that take place during cooking that can make broccoli either an appetizing green forest or a puddle of colorless goo. All of her main points are backed by journal research cited in bibliographical notes. Fascinating! Everyone should read these books!"},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"This cookbook has serviced me well over the years. I had a paperback I bought new that finally fell apart, and I found a hard back at a yard sale for $3 so I was very happy.It is full of useful information in understanding the healthier way to cook foods and why, with some good recipes. The information on roasting meats is worth the price of the book. This book started me on my path to healthier eating years ago, and I depend on it still for information."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"I love this book as well as all of Adele Davis' books. She tells the truth which is like a breath of fresh air compared to some of the nutrition lies you read on the net and in some other so called self help books.I will always stick with Adele Davis. A great lady who wrote honest books on nutrition. Big Pharma and the other rip offs hated her and it is no wonder. lol lol I love Adele, NONI juice, Biotin for my dog and myself and family, Organic dairy and food all of which I get from amazon. Oh! I almost forgot, I love amazon too.Thanks amazon."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"I have been using Adelle Davis' book, Let's Cook It right for about 40 years. I am getting a replacement copy now as my old book turned yellow and the pages are cracking and falling out. The most used portion of the book is on slow cooking. Everyone says my roast turkey on Thanksgiving is very juicy and flavorful. I use Davis' formula for slow cooking and put it in the oven overnight. The timing is just right for an early dinner the next day. Davis explains that the proteins are precipitated at higher temperatures and meat becomes tough. She includes a chart for various types of meats with temperature and cooking times stated, both for normal and slow cooking methods. Her slow cooking method is a no-fail recipe. You cant go wrong with it. She is also promoting healthy eating way before it became so fashionable nowadays. Simple and easy to follow. But don't expect the softcover book to last more than 40 years; you'll have to get a replacement."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"My copy of this cookbook is old and tattered and much-used, held together by tape inside and out. I've internalized most of the suggestions on how to cook foods for nutrition, so I no longer have to consult the cookbook much, which is good, because I fear it might fall apart. Most of the recipes in this book are very easy to make and very quick to make, such as Chili and Spanish Rice and Cheese Blintzes, to mention just a few. The recipe for Sweet-Sour Red Cabbage is outstanding. I wish some publisher would reissue this cookbook in hardback."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"I had this book years ago and am familar with the recipes especially the whole wheat bread ,so I am thrilled to have the book again and looking forward to making bread.Follow the whole wheat bread recipe exactly .This is the best ever (NO BREAD MACHINE) my family loves it straight out of the oven ,however it is so good any time ,and I use only ingredients from the health food store .The book has so many healthy recipes it is fun to see what I can make that is really good for my family."},{"Title":"Let's Cook it Right","review":"I read this book when I was 20 and fell IN LOVE with it!!!

The author makes complex concepts so simple. Since it covers all the essentials of the Internet, I have recommended it to coworkers and now they are making this book required text for entry level techs! ***** However, be warned, I barely passed using only this book.

There were questions on the i-Net+ exam which were not addressed in the book."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"another great book from David Groth. the book is easy to read yet full of content. it would have been a better book if the author had discussed the Security, Business and Copyright section in further details.The first 75% of the book is very nicely written, however the rest seems to be written in a hurry!never the less, it's a good book for those preparing to take CompTIA iNet+ exam. Last note: i dont think this book alone will pass you the exam, i strongly think that you need to have a firm grasp of Internet and its concepts. If you are an experience Internet user, you'll be just FINE!cheers,"},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"Yes, I did check the errata on the website. And today, 2 weeks later, no word from the authors or technical editors. I'm really not impressed. And for the record, I passed W/O this book 846/900.For example, the PNG file format is not limited to 256 colors. In actuality, it supports up to 24bit color and an 8bit alpha channel.Or the fact that Spoofing was not covered in the book at all, nor even listed in the index, yet when I took the i-Net+ there were 3 questions about it.Now, aside from the numerous errors I found, this book is poorly organized. The information is not presented in a logical flow, but a scattered, haphazard manner which makes it extremely difficult for newbies. [In their defense, CompTIA doesn't really organize the domains for the i-Net very logically either.]You'd be better off using just internet resources to study for this exam:"},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"This is a great book to use if you want to pass the i-Net+ exam. After a week of studying this book along with the Exam Notes, I passed the test with an 87. All of the material that I saw on the test was adequately covered by this book. The practice test on the CD-ROM was so close to the questions on the test that I didn't see how Sybex was allowed to market it. Anyway, it got my my i-Net+ certification."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"I passed my certification exam about an hour ago with a score of 768/900 (655 required to pass). I'm not an IT professional; I was mostly interested in learning more about the Internet and showing it on a resume. Passing this test for me was more attributable to the study guide available at the link mentioned in glitteringolga's review (thank you very much for that by the way) and to looking up topics on my own.This book is just not worth your time. The organization is poor, the writing is disjointed and confusing (check out the horrible descriptions of X.25 and Frame Relay for concrete examples), the errors are numerous and most definitely NOT adequately addressed in the errata on Sybex's website, and priorities of what to give the most space to are totally askew. You will be given multiple graphics and very long, step by step processes about how to click on the &quot;File&quot; button on Netscape Navigator, while more esoteric topics are given express treatment, and in most cases do not contain concrete examples or detailed explanations.The review questions both in the book and on the CD are not helpful. They also are poorly worded (one question referred to adding a cache to my network as if it were a singular piece of hardware) and do not approximate much of what I saw on the exam today. If you want to take a practice exam, try the one on MCMCSE's website (same site that has the study guide). It's for the older exam version, but after taking it I would have to say it was more useful than the questions from this book and CD.Throughout the book I noticed oodles of basic punctuation and spelling errors that a high school freshman would have been able to pick out. I guess it's not so surprising that nobody proofread the text when even the content wasn't checked for errors.If you want to prepare for the i-Net+ exam, I would recommend using the study guide at MCMCSE, taking their practice test, and searching the web for anything listed in Comptia's exam objectives that needs clarification. I really can't recommend this book to anyone, even people who really prefer to have a textbook for reference. I am one of those people, and I was really disappointed."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"For the record I teach HTML/Javascript, Dreamweaver, Flash, and i-Net+ at New Century.

A free study guide is available at http://www.mcmcse.com/comptia/inet/ik0002guide.shtml, and I strongly recommend students use this site as: #1 its free #2 its accurate #3 covers more topics than this Sybex fiasco."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"The book is a solid introduction to the internet, but is not an i-Net+ exam prep. It had all the right chapters, but it didn't cover the subject matter needed or when it was covered it was not in-depth enough. If I only had this book to prep for the exam, I would of had a problem. This is a good example of getting to press first. Now if all you are looking for is an introduction to the i-net then this book was fine, well written and few typos. I was reviewing it to use in a class I am teaching, but because it is an i_net+ exam prep course I will not use it. I would consider it for an introductory class on the internet."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"I used the Groth study guide to prepare for the I-Net+ exam. Overall, I would rate the guide a 'B.' On the exam I took, I estimate that about 30% of the material on the exam isn't covered in the study guide. The exam I took assumed that I knew HTML fairly well, and the study guide covers that only briefly. As is the case with the Network+ exam, the I-Net+ exam I took contained several questions and possible answers that were vague and ambiguous. I would prefer that examiners test for the examinee's competency, and not for the examinee's ability to decipher and parse vagueness in language.The Network+ exam I took last year was actually easier than the I-Net+ exam I took a few days ago. The I-Net+ exam covers a much broader range of topics. CompTIA claims that the I-Net+ exam is targeted at novices, but judging from the exam I took, this can't be so.Groth does a nice job of briefly explaining the obscure art of subnetting, which most authors do not. Groth spends way too much time on browser clients. I don't remember a single question on the exam concerning browser clients. The section on Internet business concepts is weak.This study guide is okay, but only if used in conjunction with another study guide.Chow, and good luck."},{"Title":"i-Net+ Study Guide with CDROM","review":"Hi,i successfully passed out i-NET+ last week.Many many thanks to Sybex Study Guide.Its an excellent book for those who are from non-IT background.The best thing which i liked in this book is that the basics have been very well explained in simple understandable language and the definitions of crucial terminlogies are described up to the point which will not confuse the readers.Make sure that you read all the abbrevations and glossary quoted at the end of the book.But please note that its good for only those who aim to just pass the exam with around 80% score.There are many mistakes in the book,but can be corrected looking at errata.If you are looking for 90% and above, then maybe you will have to refer some more books.Before taking the test I went through the book around 4-5 times (word by word) which took me more than 1 month since i am working.I finished the exam in 1/2 hour(total of 72 questions).

I am also not surprised to see David Groth as one of the writers since he is considered to be an industry expert.In 600 pages the book has gone through several changes in order to be updated for the new exam, all this was done without sacrificing any information since every exam objective has been covered and there is information beyond the exam.This is the first book I have seen to cover the 1K0-002 exam and the first 45 p[ages take on the basics of networking followed up with the internet basics. While there is only 30 pages given to TCP/IP, which will certainly be enough o pass the exam, I think this section needs to be expanded.I was very happy to see the security section updated with the latest information as this section was well documented. Each chapter has review questions as well as a full practice exam in the book. One other section to expand should be the HTML coding and possibly the JavaScript section.Finally the cd has practice exams in a customizable format and well as flash cards for the pc and palm and finally an e-book.

This text, a skilful interweave of the root verses by Guru Padmasambhava and a commentary given recently on the US West Coast by the Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche, is exactly one such opportunity. As a long-term practitioner of the D&uuml;d'jom Lineage of teachings, and translator to His Holiness Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, I cannot too strongly recommend this book to all those who feel they would like to undertake the Buddhist path. The Ven. Gyatrul Rinpoche skilfully steers the practitioner - be they beginner or mature student - through the various reefs of hope and fear attached to such an undertaking, and brings them clear to at least a vision of the path that leads to the other shore, beyond, and back again. He is to be thanked profoundly for his great compassion, humorous skill and wisdom."},{"Title":"Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava's Teachings on the Six Bardos","review":"Padmasambhava's teachings on the six bardos is truly brought to life by Gyatrul Rinpoche's commentary, and B.

Here you will find the words of a master, whose words will engage you and urge you to change your life. Those who find this book and begin its practices are indeed fortunate.I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those involved in making this book availible to the public."},{"Title":"Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava's Teachings on the Six Bardos","review":"This book is a good follow-up to Gyatrul Rinpoche's commentary on portions of Karma Chagme's 17th century text, \\"The Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen.\\" The 2 volumes are entitled: \\"Naked Awareness\\" and \\"A Spacious Path to Freedom.\\" All 3 are translated by B. Alan Wallace and, I believe that, the introductions make the connection between the two original texts. \\"Natural Liberation\\" and is attributed to the earlier master Padmasambhava. However, even the 3 together are not a complete exposition of the Union. Chokyi Rinpoche also wrote a small commentary on Karma Chagme's text entitled: \\"The Union of Mahamudra and Dzogchen.\\" All 4 of these books are well worth reading. They are among the clearest and pithiest of currently available English translations of Mahamudra and Dzogchen texts and help one to not only understand their relationships, but more importantly to understand the underlying truths within them. They also provide considerable practical guidance for the practitioner. Mahamudra is contended to be the highest teaching within the Kagyu tradition (among the 4 Tibetan Buddhist traditions). Dzogchen is similarly regarded for the Nyingma tradition. Thus, such original works can be said to address the very highest Vajrayana (Tibetan Buddhist) teachings. It is obvious (even in translation) that both Karma Chagme and (the much celebrated and revered) Padmasambhava were great, enlightened masters. This volume contains a wealth of valuable material and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava's Teachings on the Six Bardos","review":"Comprehensive- well translated- and with extensive commentary, both erudite and pratical,by Lama Gyaltrul, on this famous Masterpiece of Tibetan meditation technology,a hertofor untranslated section from a large set of cannonical works known collectivly as Karma Lingpas &quot;Shi- Tro Bardo Rangdrol,{from which the well known Tibetan Book of the dead is also derived}A jewel of a Dharma book-brings one of the best Lamas and most highly qualified translators of 20th century(Gyaltrul and Wallace) togather with one of the finest works previous generations of Tibetan scholars and meditators so as to make this book a completly traditional,while at the same time up to date modern classic a welcome addition to any library,Buddhist or other."},{"Title":"Natural Liberation: Padmasambhava's Teachings on the Six Bardos","review":"Padmasambhava&#34;s teachings on the Six Bardos is not a publication you review per say.

First he puts out a message discouraging a certain type of person from reading the book, then he adds his opinions on abortion and current modern day ethical issues, and he adds his opinions on other current day morality issues.This is probably my 7th book on Tibetan Buddhism and the books I have read have been amazing at explaining the bardos, death, meditation, rigpa, karma, etc. They strive hard to bring the pure translation of these writings to a Western audience. I can say that I feel that those other books I have read have resonated deep within myself as ringing true. Kind of like when you read the Bible, you feel a blessing and purifying of the mind. This book however I can honestly say I have a nagging feeling, I feel like its \\"impure\\" or even a bit \\"polluted\\" by having the translator intermingle his thoughts, feelings, and personal beliefs/morality into the writing.I will keep reading the book, but so far I am disappointed."},{"Title":"Balzac: Le Roman De Sa Vie","review":"The fanatical obsessive drive of Balzac to master all human learning, and create or recreate the whole society and world he knew is at the heart of his life and work. Zweig tells the story of Balzac the writer with sympathy and understanding and great narrative strength. The personal life of Balzac is also driven by the passion for possession and Zweig also tells this part of the story in a fascinating way. This is a very good book about a great writer and his world. And like all of Zweig's work once you begin to read it you do not wish to stop until you finish it all."},{"Title":"Balzac: Le Roman De Sa Vie","review":"I borrowed an old edition of this book from the library, and finally got around to reading it a few days before it was due back. And how glad I was that I did! I was expecting it to be old-fashioned, but instead it turned out to be one of the best literary biographies I've ever read. I flew through the 380 pages in less than three days.Highly recommended to anyone with the slightest interest in Balzac's works. I haven't read any other biographies of him, but I can't believe they could be better than this."},{"Title":"Choppers Up!","review":"I can tell you without reservation, that this book affected me. And not all the memories were good, either. I did not wantto put it down when I started reading, but some of the scenes and action were hard to get through. I am a former Marine (1965-1969)and a pilot, but I didn't serve in combat. I did see planes crash (one right in front of me) and people were killed. This backgrounddid allow me to empathize with the characters of the book. I recommend this book if you want a hard look at what combat and militaryaviation (helicopters in particular) can entail. You can feel what it might be like to follow orders and at the same time have a gutfeeling that maybe you should be doing something else."},{"Title":"Josephus","review":"Gave me a new perspective on Jospehus.

This from what I read was someone's history about Josephus. I did not like it. There may be good research on the historical facts but the writer obviously came to the research with a prejudice against Josephus, and against the Bible and the information is therefore to me tainted. I did not finish the book."},{"Title":"Computer Simulation Methods in Theoretical Physics","review":"Heerman's book is very different from most simulation books: it short. This is achieved by only giving brief explanations of the ideas and methods. It covers most aspects of basic (and not so basic) Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo, and since it's so short you can always read it all and then choose what you want to do. It makes simulation look really easy, and includes all the fortran code you need to prove it. Integration methods are explained in a particular way that makes them really easy to use. If you want an overview of the methods and/or are in a hurry read this book. Otherwise go to Allen's or Rapaport's. If you are a beginner I suggest Haile's book, but then come back to this one, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"The steps up the chimney is a great book and no book about magic even comes close, that includes Harry Potter.

From there on in the story begins to unravel and the majician sufaces."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"This book is better than any other book ive read including Harry Potter, I stayed up past my bedtime reading it and the second i finished this one i started to read the second book in the series(The Door in the Tree).These books beckon you and persuade you to keep on reading till the end (unfortunatelyonly two books in the quartet are finished so far). It is not true(duh!) but it is more exciting than any book in the world."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"This book is something of a mixed bag, combining good suspense with uneven pacing and description. There were also a few threads that were, honestly, not necessary in this book.Three kids, in the manner of Alan Garner's books, are sent to their uncle's peculiar mansion, an old house with strange animals creeping nearby and a series of steps going up the chimney. Tension is rampant in the house, as Uncle Jack and his live-in, vegetarian girlfriend Phoebe are having a baby and are not married. At the same time, a mysterious, magical man named Steven Tyler is lurking near the house with designs on the people inside...Though the suspense in this book is pretty good, it often slams to a halt rather than building to a climax. The descriptive language when talking about nature and the outdoors is wonderful, but unfortunately we never get clear pictures of the characters or the inside of Golden House.I found that the whole subplot with Phoebe and Jack to be rather unnecessary, and an item that some parents may not want their kids to read about, as both characters believe that there's nothing unusual about cohabitation and single motherhood. It's a mature matter that somehow was jarring in with the innocent &quot;children on holiday encounter magic&quot; plotline. I also found it distracting that the girls spend so much time suspecting that Phoebe is a witch, then simply drop the matter when she has the child.The magician unfortunately lacks the majesty of such wizards as Gandalf, Merlin, Albus Dumbledore... he simply appears, talks, then vanishes again. The ending is uneven, as we have one climax, and immediately switch to another.This book appeared to need some editing, but is overall an interesting story."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"The Steps up the Chimney is the first in four books that accumulate into the Magician's House Quartet, revolving around three children who come to stay at their uncle's strange house, and Stephen Tyler, a time-travelling wizard who befriends the children on their stay at Golden Valley.In the \`Steps Up The Chimney' the children arrive at the house after already experiencing some strange events - Will has meet a stranger at Druce Coven station who mysteriously disappeared and a fox seems to popping up everywhere they look. Within the house and grounds however, things become even more strange - Alice finds footprints in the snow that end abruptly in the middle of a clearing and Mary notices an extra window in the house that shouldn't be there. By researching the house's near-ancient origins and searching high and low, the children eventually come across an amazing discovery - that there are steps up the chimney...These books are highly original - I am a big fantasy reader and there was little in these books that I had run across before in other novels. Among other things the books include time travelling, alchemy, animals that can communicate with the children and the more mundane occurrences of the children's relationship with their uncle and his pregnant girlfriend Phoebe. Although the entire story is set within the valley, the story draws on larger themes that are not only world-wide, but stretch throughout Tyler's time to the present day, the main one being the nature of greed and its evils.William Corlett shows a good knowledge and interest in English history, and is always adding in tidbits of information when describing the building or architecture of the house or grounds, which he no doubt planned and mapped in great detail.Characterisation is, on the whole, very good whether it be the somewhat dithery vegetarian Phoebe, the talkative historian Mrs Prewett or the wide variety of animals that roam the ground such as the fox Cinnabar, the owl Jasper or the dog Sirius (or as Alice calls him - Spot). The wizard however, far from being a main character flits in and out of the story very briefly - his role is firmly restrictive to that of teacher, and a distant teacher at that - there is no real warmth in the relationship between him and the children.Although the title of the book is captivating, many times the story itself falls slightly short of my expectations - often the narrative falls into meaningless history lessons or long-winded descriptions of the nature of alchemy, and much of the story structure relies on the reader having a good visual picture of the house and its features within their head. A map of the house and grounds can be found in each book, but a good idea would have been to include illustrations of many of the diagrams Corlett describes within the book and a family tree to keep track of all the Crawdens, Lewises, Mordens and Tylers that are so often mentioned throughout all four books.Likewise, I could find very little to like with Corlett's protagonists William, Mary and Alice. If Corlett set out to make them - especially Alice - irritable, annoying, whiny, bickersome children, then he succeeded. If he wanted them to be enjoyable, realistic characters than he failed. To illustrate my point, read the passage where the children are getting into Jack's car for the first ride back to Golden House - it spans only two pages but within it Alice and Will fight over the front seat, Will sits on Alice and Alice moans about not getting her way; Alice says to Mary: 'Oh Mary, the last thing we want is one of your history lessons. They're so boring.' and Mary says: 'They're always squabbling. And that's really boring.' Once inside the car Mary talks with Jack about the length of her hair and Alice says: 'Ugh! Stop flirting, Mary. Be careful, Uncle Jack. She's man-mad!'Mary: Honestly, you're such a baby, Alice.Alice: You're blushing! Mary's blushing!Mary: Shut up Alice!See what I mean? If I was Uncle Jack I would have stopped the car and left the little brats to camp out on the train tracks. How we are supposed to find the three of them sympathetic, much less likeable characters I have no idea, and they get even worse as the story progresses.These thoroughly horrible children aside, the books are thoughtful and original - though not the best of their genre, any fantasy reader should be interested enough by this opening novel to continue the story in the next book \`The Door in the Tree'."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"This is a classic English countryside mystery/fantasy/adventure with a slightly updated and modernized sensibility. The location, the atmosphere, the naturalistic writing style - all up to snuff. A vaguely menacing, slightly dotty magician/alchemist/spirit to instruct and harry the young adventurers - again, classic.But, and this is a huge but, the three sibling heroes are just terrible. A tense know-it-all, a whiny know-it-all and a juvenile complainer know-it-all compete to see who can be the most childish and quarrelsome. From page one to the final page the poking, griping, complaining, teasing, insulting rudeness and shallowness never ever lets up. Had I been Uncle Jack or Phoebe, the couple who's babysitting these kids for winter break, I would have put them right back on the train home.And the thing is, this problem could have been easily corrected. All of the superfluous whining could have been edited out. The basic characters are decent. The sibling dynamic could have been tweaked and toned down. Why wasn't this done? Don't know.So, you have a great location, a compelling master plotline, a novel approach to fantasy magic, very creative incorporation of animals and nature into the story and mellow but satisfactory pacing. Depending on how much allowance you can make for the character problems, this could be a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Steps Up The Chimney","review":"Maybe it's because I love this book so much but why does this not have better reviews??

I will never stop loving it!I first read this when I was probably 11 or 12 (I'm 21 now) and I very distinctly remember loving it so much that I would pray every day that I would wake up and be living the events in this book!!! Sounds so silly now but I desperately wanted this to happen to me in real life! Now that I'm older and wiser I wish that I could be the director for this movie, as I think it would make an awesome movie, and I wholeheartedly believe that no one could make it into a better movie than me (I have a vision!) since I'm sure no one loves it more than I do! :)Okay, now that I sound all crazy...go read it!"},{"Title":"Suing Judges: A Study of Judicial Immunity","review":"SUING JUDGES: A STUDY OF JUDICIAL IMMUNITYAbimbola A. OlowofoyekuOxford University Press(1993)\\"Suing Judges\\", unsurprisingly, is written for legal scholars and attorneys. But it is readily understood by us non-lawyer-types.Although Nigerian and educated in Britain, Abimbola Olowofowyeku shows a keen understanding of American jurisprudence. As shown by Akhil A. Amar's \\"Bill of Rights,\\" an author from a different social and legal tradition can often provide fresh insights that escape the natives. Reverse cultural imperialism, maybe?Most citizens--including attorneys--understandably assume that judges simply cannot be sued. After all, it was just six years ago that a woman successfully sued a judge--but only for &#65533;sexual harassment&#65533; and only after his &#65533;honor\\" had been impeached, convicted, and removed from office for &#65533;in-chambers&#65533; rape of her and at least four other women [United States v. Lanier, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1997]. Yes, Virginia, there is a way to pierce the sanctity of the judicial chambers. But only under the most outrageous of circumstances.Cynics might argue that such legal protections do not disinterestedly evolve. Judges do write the case law. And Olowofowyeku cites the cases that seemingly provide such invincible protections.But the author also shows the absurdity of bestowing such omnipotence on anyone in a democracy. Police, for example, are literally \\"under the gun\\" as well as the most visible targets for lawsuits. Nonetheless, they are not so favored with anything approaching blanket immunity--they can be sued and fired for professional misconduct.Public servants, admittedly, require some personal protections against the merely disgruntled when administering public policy. But granting absolute immunity to any official is simply a case of civic overkill. A fairer approach is to establish \\"limited\\" immunities.That&#65533;s why police are legally protected, in the line of duty, when they use reasonable and necessary force. Essential professionals, such as physicians, are &#65533;immunized&#65533; by &#65533;Good Samaritan&#65533; statutes and caps on pain and suffering verdicts for malpractice.Olowofowyeku then cites evolving law chipping away at absolute immunity for judges. At the very least, injunctive relief (i.e., petitioning a higher court to order an inferior judge to obey the law) can be granted against a judge's actions. Furthermore, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 explicitly permits recovery of legal costs from judges who violate one's Civil Rights.In fact, most European nations ( particularly Belgium) permit judges to be sued for damages caused by their decisions--although requiring a higher standard of proof.If \\"Suing Judges\\" becomes a best seller, American jurisprudence will, hopefully, increasingly reflect the European model--and simple justice.Reviewed by: Richard A.

So when I saw Slade's book, I wondered if this was the CLOS book I'd been looking for. Short answer: no, it's worse.It's not even clear what the book is trying to teach: programming, or Lisp, or object-oriented programming, or CLOS. He seems to be trying to do all of the above, but due to the huge scope, being unable to go deep into anything. He starts chapters with irrelevant quotes, which works if you're Knuth, but he's no Knuth. He jumps around a lot, and the order is bizarre: several important concepts are held off until relatively late. Other big concepts are mentioned only in passing, which an experienced Lisper will understand, but then, if you already know what he means, why would you read this book?No surprise that I'd not heard of this book: in a field of classics, there's just no point. If you want to learn programming, readSICP. If you want to learn Common Lisp (with lots of sample code), readPCL, orPAIP. If you want to learn CLOS, readAMOP; if that's too rough, get Keene.The back cover mentions \\"classroom experience\\", so perhaps it's written to accompany a course taught by Slade. If you had a couple hours of lecture to flush out the details of each section, it might be passable. If you're reading it as a standalone book, it leaves much to be desired.Finally, the back cover advertises that this book \\"introduces advanced concepts such as LAMDA\\". Yes, it misspells one of the basic Lisp symbols right on the cover. That's all you really need to know about this book. Stick with the classics."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","review":"Lisp provides an incredible amount of programming concepts. All the concepts are described in Steele's monumental &quot;Common Lisp, the language&quot; or the newer hypertext version on the web. The one gripe I have with Steele's book is that it lacks examples. Sthepen Slade provides all the examples of common usage that Steel might have provided."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","review":"The book has one chapter on CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System, pretty much the same as any other Lisp tutorial. As such, the title is very misleading, and the reader expecting an in-depth treatment of object-oriented programming in Common Lisp will be very disappointed. This book isn't bad, but Peter Seibel's excellent Practical Common Lisp is better in pretty much every respect. If you still want a dedicated book on CLOS, Sonya Keene's \\"Object Oriented Programming in Common Lisp\\" is a much better tutorial, and Kiczales' \\"The Art of the Metaobject Protocol\\" is a wonderful treatment of the CLOS internals, though not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","review":"This is a great introduction to Common Lisp for those who are looking for a complete, tutorial-style text book with lots of examples.

Graham's books make a good follow-up."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","review":"While taking a course in AI, I was recommended by the professor to buy the Winston and Horn book which I did. However, lucky for me, I had checked out Dr. Slade's book from the library.

Because if I couldn't figure out how to do something from Winston and Horn, I usually found it in this book (not that Winston and Horn is a bad book, just this book seems much better). If you need to know how to get something done in Lisp, I think this is the book for you. If you want to be an AI snob well then get the other book."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Common LISP","review":"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers about the haphazard organization of the book, and the fact that the title is somewhat misleading. But what bugs me the most is the appendix gives a link to a website with a bunch of LISP resources, most notably the source code for the book, of which there is a lot (so if you want to try some of it out yourself, you'll surely want the source code in electronic form), however, though the link may have worked in years gone by, it now redirects you to a newer website for the publisher and there's no sign of the source code or any of the other online stuff the book claims to provide. I asked for help from the publisher and all they could offer was that, yes, you're right, that stuff is not available on our website. So if you buy this book, have fun keying in any source code you want to try out for yourself."},{"Title":"Edinburgh","review":"bought this when we returned from visiting edinburgh. realized i had never actually read robert louis stevenson. only had seen movies of his work. so was great to find out more about a city we loved visiting, and great to experience reading his writing. found out why his works are classics - he's a really good writer! made me want to read more of his work."},{"Title":"So Many Tomorrows (Ulverscroft Large Print)","review":"I was gifted this book by a friend, after a workshop at Columbia U.

This is no small achievement, and can only be clearly understood examining his photographs.Griffiths is probably best known for his book &quot;Vietnam, Inc.&quot; (many of those photographs are included in this edition) but many of his greatest are contained in this superb volume, including some images of the weary, haunted faces of the children of Wales, his birthplace.Being Welsh, and on the recieving end of British expansionism, Griffiths clearly sympathises (and rightly so) with the Vietnamise civilians (on the recieving end of French AND American expansionism)whose pleading expressions demonstrate clearly how much Americans were &quot;helping&quot; them evade the &quot;evil grip of communism&quot;.If I were to own ONE book of photographs, I would without hesitation choose this volume, for it's images are not only an important documentation of one of the darkest pieces of American history, but an amazing and invaluable work of art."},{"Title":"Dark Odyssey (Aperture Magazine)","review":"Welshman Jones Griffiths is one of the world's foremost photojounralists, and it's hard to believe that this is first book in since his highly influential 1971 work \\"Vietnam, Inc.\\" This collection opens with a six striking early portraits from Wales and England in the 1950s-60s. The most memorable is of a litlte boy about to smash a large rock on top of a pian aso left in a scrap heap. These represent his budding career taking shots in his spare time, and are remarkable for the amount of expression he is able to capture, whether it's on the faces of weary coal miners, wary schoolchildren, or waiting mourners.Following a laudatory introduction by New Yorker writer Murray Sayle, the bulk of the book is comprised of Jones Griffiths' international work, undertaken as a member (and president) of the presitgious Magnum photographers cooperative. His photography is informed by a strong sense of compassion and empathy for the victims of opression and war. The compositions are strong and many of the images are loaded with stark symbolism. From the very front of the book we get shots of a fat white missionary in knee high socks standing amidst natives in New Guinea, scantily clad European tourists lounging with drinks by a river in Gambia, a white Rhodesian golfer considering her shot with three black caddies and the African savannah in the background.His series of ten photos from Northern Ireland in the early '70s is loaded with surreal and striking images: a soldier crouches behind a wall in a garden while a woman mows the lawn right behind him; another soldier is prone behind sandbags on a street while women push strollers past him; one of the best portraits in the book is of a grim-faced paratrooper reloads a CS gun. A middle section is scattered with a hodgepodge of images from around the world from the 60s to the early 90s.

I picked up The Hearing in hopes of getting some vintage Lescroart. I was not disappointed. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Lescroart built his usual compelling, page-turning work. For me though, taking this out of order allowed for Lescroart's introduction of a number of characters that I grew to know in subsequent books. This certainly was an unexpected added dimension and source of enjoyment as I went quickly through the book. As might be expected, Lescroart does a great job of bringing out raw human emotion in the characters in a way that adds complexity and depth to the story.

The best about this book are the characters, I want to read other books of John Lescroart because of them.'The Hearing' is an easy read, a great introduction into the world of the law and at the same time an emotional book.
