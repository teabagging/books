Yes, the ending is weak. I am confident that a sequel will be forthcoming. What disturbs me are the numerous reviews which cited the resemblance between Snow Crash and Gibson's Virtual Light. Let's get one thing straight. Snow Crash came out at least a year (I think it may have been longer) before Virtual Light. As hard as it may be to conceive perhaps the father of cyberpunk is not above common plagiarism. If you want Stephenson with more grounding in the real world check out the two books he wrote with his cousin (?) under the pen name Stephen Bury. Interface and The Cobweb. Both very fun reads."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"i found this book through recommendations from friends and the user reviews here.far from being a great work of science fiction literature, this book reads like a movie aimed at teenagers. i found the characters to be paper thin and not unlike saturday morning sci-fi adventure cartoon characters. the dialog is often too dramatic or cute.it's interesting, it has some good twists, it reads quickly. the author has done a fairly interesting job of creating his cyber-punk world. however, there's not much substance here. it suffers from a weak attempt to combine religion, technology, viruses, and ancient sumerian culture into a plot line, which eventually all falls flat into a laughable combination. the car chases and a sprinkling of sex with minors does nothing to help.overall, i'd have to say skip this book; there's plenty of great sci-fi and cyberpunk stuff out there, and this certainly isn't the best."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I do a fair amount of reading, usually 2 or 3 books at a time. I have a problem though in that I _RARELY_ finish books that I start becuase I find most modern fiction thin and the characters too underdeveloped. Snow Crash was just great, however, and the comic-book style Hiro Protagonist was surprisingly well developed. Hiro carried the storyline, but all the supporting characters were so vividly \\"drawn together\\" that the whole story was just a hilarious ride."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is by far the best book I have read in the Cyberpunk genre. The story flow is excellent, there are very few dull parts, the character descriptions and settings are reasonable, and the character development flows to the point they seem truly human.Neal Stephenson truly knows how to write a convincing story, and I must say the plot was well-wrapped and not too blatantly obvious. Compared to other books I have read in the same genre, this is the most plausible plot and the best developed characters. No post-nuclear holocaust here, just an extremely advanced form of Republicanism. The characters are described and seen through enough to provide an edge of personality to temper the realism. There are no super-people here, no cyborgs, and no in-depth description of cyberspace (which is very much like what we have now-not the lethal playground of the advanced hackers depicted in so many other books).There are a few downsides to this book, however. There is a very heavy correlation to ancient history dealing with religion that, for those many of us who are historically deficient mentally, is a bit overwhelming. Also, this isn't exactly a kiddie book, with many **ahem** colorfully described scenes and scenarios, as well as prolific profanity. For those of us used to modern society, though, this just adds to the flow and believability of the book.All in all a good read, and on a 5 star system it would get a solid 4 from me. As an explanation for the lacking of the 5th star, I am not truly fond of the cyberpunk genre, being from the digital age. It seems so many of the books in this genre were written before I was born, and I have seen the partial realization of some of the points, and the total failure of others."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Obviously this book has some sort of market appeal - I guess if you put enough 'cool' things like pizza, swords, hot chicks, skaters, etc into a book it makes it cool... It's like, the book is seriously bereft of ideas and style - but it does have pizza in it. Give it to your teenage brother/son - he'll probably love it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In Snow Crash, Stephenson is very playful with his language, and is often witty. Then again, he is often hackneyed and silly. The plot is very exciting from the beginning, but halfway begins to degenerate into unnecessary history recitals that last five to ten pages at a time, repeatedly. Ignoring these virtually unreadable portions, the story continues to entertain throughout, right up until the end. The conclusion is relatively sudden, extremely predictable, and does nothing to reward the reader for trusting Stephenson enough to plow through the pages of Library research.Prospective readers should be aware that toward the end of the novel, Stephenson describes in graphic detail a consensual sexual encounter between a fifteen year old girl and a forty-something year old man. The plot does not benefit from this encounter, but Stephenson's constant focus on the child's rear end every time she stood up made it almost inevitable. I found it to be distasteful.I would not recommend the book - it was enjoyable in parts, but there are many authors who research a novel, then craft a plot with skill from beginning to end, instead of attempting to cram in every bit of research into the novel."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In the words of Sir Isaac Newton, Stephenson's Snow Crash materialized as a result of Stephenson standing on the shoulder's of giants e.g. Gibson/ NeuromancerNeuromancer.

Cryptonomicon didnt live up to its ubercool name in my opinion."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Here's the tome where Stephenson describes the Metaverse that Second-Lifer's love to point to - as if it somehow justifies their world with a deep philosophical background. But we only get a description, not an implementation, nor is it particularly insightful on the implications of such a world. Still, credit for idea, especially the build as you go concept.As for the parallel universe where the real action takes place, it is a brutish but pragmatic place that may well be a logical step along the path of privatizing everything. The descriptions of YT's mother's work life are frighteningly close to home.Stephenson also goes down on Sumerian mythology with an interesting, though lengthy, tale about the Sumerians developing a lower level language on which our higher languages have developed. Resonates with the ideas around memes, which may be where he got the idea from.Speaking of which, a Metaverse world may have been described by the Habitat folks in the eighties, but no-one really noticed. Metaverse is the meme that has survived and thrived.Entertaining fun and some likeable characters.Read it? - Definitely. And if you want to chat about virtual worlds - this is your homework assignment.Buy it? - Yes, if you like people to look at your bookshelf. Otherwise it's a oncer - you won't be referring back to it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Amazing book. Hilarious. Reads like a comic book. The entire world is suburbs. China has franchise-suburbs in cities around the world. The CIA merged with the Library of Congress when the American Govt went away to be intelligence brokers(IIRC).

The main character is a pizza delivery guy who is also a martial arts expert, ex-programmer, half black-half Japanese, and named Hiro Protaganist."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This was the first book I read from Neal Stephenson, and it was quite an enjoyable experience and also quite easy to get into. (The Diamond Age was harder for me to get into)In terms of Cyberpunk, the only other book that comes to mind that I've completed sofar that could rival this is Max Barry's \\"Jennifer Government\\"The premise is an obvious mix of the absurd and the plausible: The Mafia operates the single largest (and de facto best) Pizza corporation in the world, which also happens to be one of the few places where the United States can compete with other nations, quasi-nations, and so on in the consumer market. The Metaverse on the other hand was an interesting idea that spawned many VR chatroom softwares in the 90s and 00s.Overall, the book was quite good, though probably not for most kids who haven't seen Terminator 1 and 2. (Not that they're related, but it's easier than giving an age.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I came to this book by way of reccomendations, and I can say it was a great read, if a bit short.One of the things I really like about a book written in the vein of high science-fiction is the detail that is placed on describing and predicting technologies of the future. I think Neal has done a great job of that in this book - not only plying his trade to create a plausible simulated reality but also allowing that reality to be reflected in changes to his characters and the societies that they live in. These alterations are many, and varied - but they are what give this work a unique character that might be off-putting for some but eventually grows on the reader as the pages keep turning.I found the book compelling, and enjoyed the characters immensely - I would have liked a little more detailed plot development or perhaps just more description in general (I was quite ennamored by the reality Imagined by Stephenson), but otherwise I had no complaints about the read.I did not like this works as much as Cryptonomicron, although the works are extremely different and both good in their own right.I'd recommend this book to my friends, so give 'er a chance!Dominic Ebacherebacherdom.blotspot.com060907.0206"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was recommended to me by a good friend of mine, and I have nothing but thanks to him for doing so. This was a very engaging and very intelligent novel. The author weaves religion, linguistics, history, and computers into a fantastic look to the future.Business has become all-powerful in the future as communities are broken into franchulates, which are basically community franchises. The Mafia has moved into the pizza delivery business and takes the \\"30 minutes or less\\" offer seriously. This is the world that Hiro Protagonist lives. He is a pizza delivery man and hacker, as well as the best swordsman in the Metaverse. He teams with a young Kourier named Y.T. to help save the world from a computer virus, which will result in wiping out hackers and uniting all others under one person's mind control.Although the story is engaging, I found myself drawn to the author's explanation of how the virus worked as well as its connection to ancient Sumerian. His view of the future and his explanation of the past links speculation with ancient myth, which is both entertaining and challenging. Before I knew it, I was reading more closely to follow how he was making the connections. This was definitely time well spent.I would recommend this book to science fiction fans as well as readers of ancient history."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In his acknowledgments at the back of the book, Stephenson writes that Snow Crash was originally meant to be a graphic novel. The careening plot, too-intelligent whacko characters, wiseacre dialogue, and wild action sequences give this story a comic book vibe. But what really shoots this book into sci-fi's higher echelon is the heady, mind-blowing hypothesis involving ancient Sumerian myth, linguistics, and modern computer code. Behind all the high-tech chases, kooky characters, and samurai sword fighting is an intricately developed idea that the human brain is a vessel to be programmed like a blank hard drive and that the Sumerian language was the first such programming wired into the human cerebral cortex (long forgotten and replaced with new programming in the form of varying languages and religion). Stephenson manages to make this wild idea seem almost feasible, and it's what makes this otherwise wild, overcrowded, crazy, and relentlessly entertaining novel most worthwhile."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Though not necessarily a Science Fiction conosuer, I am a computer geek and love a good cyberpunk novel. Snow Crash is my favorite so far; I'd even go so far as to call it one of my favorite books. It takes a seriously entertaining read to keep me engrossed, and Snow Crash had me coming home early from work to finish. Chalk full of incredibly interesting characters, brilliant and funny ideas, action sequences, and topped off with a good plot, Snow Crash flies! The heroe, Hiro Protagonist, is somewhat unsuccessful for someone who has really been very successful. After losing a friend to a knew computer virus that appears to affect the mind itself, Hiro embarks on a dangerous investigation and, ultimately, mission to stop those behind the virus. If you like technology, William Gibson, cyberpunk, Science-Fiction, fun reading, etc., buy this book and read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash, like all Neal Stephenson novels, is built on a very basic premise; Stephenson takes an technological topic (languange in the case of Snow Crash, Nanotechnology in the case of The Diamond Age, cryptography in the case of Cryptonomicon), and explores the implications of that technology through prose that reads like pulp sci-fi.Snow Crash tells the story of a computer hacker who stumbles into a plot to reprogram humanity by using language to trigger changes in the structure of the mind. The relationship between language and the brain (the software that runs on the hardware) is explored in great depth. There are also a number of good sword fights.Stephenson creates an enjoyable balance of action, intelligence, humor, and implication. I look forward to his newest book, Quicksilver."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read snow crash's beginning fast.But as I came to the future lineout with people living in a future internet-universe, with chaos, that were reflected in the real-world outside, I was slowing down the reading.It might very well be one outline of the future.

A guy riding around with a hydrogen bomb ?That is where I stopped."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is a great writer but seems to have the (unfortunate) tendency to cut his books off just as the final climax is occuring. I was looking for the next chapter when I realized I was reading &quot;About the Author.&quot;(WARNING: potential spoilers ahead). Although I enjoyed Snow Crash immensely, I was left wondering what the hell was going to happen to most of the characters at the end, namely: Raven, Uncle Enzo, Y.T., Hiro and Jaunita - or just about every major character in the book. I didn't feel their parts were fully played yet. For instance, what about Raven's nuclear bomb? Was he wounded when his knives shattered? Does Y.T.'s Mom still work at Fedland even though they almost got her daughter killed? Also, L. Bob Rife's character didn't seem very realistic to me and a few things about the metavirus were also sketchy. I had similar questions at the end of Diamond Age.Still though, the book was very funny, had interesting scenes, characters and high-tech gadgets and even with my questions, I'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes this (or any) type of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snowcrash was recommended to me by two different people on the same day and boy were they right. This book provides an interested,if sometimes disturbing, view of the future. Stephanson's prose are gritty, clean, and surprisingly smart. He knows how to write a fast paced and sophisticated book. If you like irony and juxtaposition this is a great book. Not traditional science fiction but a cross between SCI-FI and Techno-thriller."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of the odder books I've ever read- it starts sounding very much like a goofball Douglas Adams take on the Cyberpunk genre, and morphs slowly into a philosophical thriller.

He collects information, uploads it and makes money off of it if customers find the information he uploads useful. While Hiro is in the metaverse, a virtual reality 'Second Life' of sorts, he discovers a virus called Snow Crash. Snow Crash is no ordinary virus however; it affects people in real life - outside of the metaverse. It's Hiros mission to figure out more about the virus.Snow Crash moves at a break-neck pace. Stephenson has a very creative prose which makes this book almost impossible to put down at times. I found myself late to work more than once because I would attempt to read just a few passages before rolling out of bed only to find that I just couldn't peel myself away! This is one of those books that will put you in a time machine - you think you've only been reading for 20 minutes when in fact it has been an hour!One of the more common complaints I see in other reviews is how he tends to digress, especially when he talks about topics like ancient Sumerian culture. I didn't find this annoying at all, I actually found it really interesting how he tied everything together.This is an addicting read that I highly recommend! I can't wait to read more of Stephenson's work!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have no idea how I missed this gem. He uses concepts and coins words and phrases that did not exist until he wrote the book. The plot is absolutely ingenious, and even better.... plausible (if you are willing to stretch that imagination :))! I don't want to give any story away, just give my two cents that this is an important book to read in order to understand the cyberpunk genre and even more important to understand the direction of cyberpunk trends.One caveat - the grammar, phrasing, and vocabulary are typical cyberpunk.... if you are used to reading only the king's english - you might not enjoy so much! Otherwise, dig in!!I highly recommend this book!All the best,Jay"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"From what I heard, this was meant to be up there with Neuromancer, but it didn't even come close in my opinion.After [what seemed like] the first three or four times Stephenson explains to the reader that computers understand binary, and that binary is made up of 1's and 0's, I started to get a bit worried about this novel.I continued though, thinking that he was just educating the computer illiterate in the early chapters, but it just went on and on...The whole thing just seemed to be made up of a mish-mash of 'cool' images like hackers, samurai, the Mafia, skateboarding, etc, etc, etc... All just thrown into the mix for the sake of being cool.The only interesting thread of an idea in the book just sort of trailed off into nothingness, just like the rest of the story.I give it one star for the mythological storyline [which was the only thing that kept me reading], and for resisting the urge to write the protagonist from the first person. Everything else just annoyed me.If you're after a cyber-novel with genuinely creative ideas (not just a Neuromancer wannabe), try Permutation City (Greg Egan)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I wouldn't normally review a book that already has been reviewed by hundereds of readers, but none of the reviews on the first page seem to notice what utter nonsense Stephenson's ideas about language and viruses are (and I don't have time to read the rest of the 500+ reviews, so sorry to anyone who already has done this).You know there's a problem when a writer supports his conclusions about historical events with pseudo-historical anecdotes and Biblical scripture. (&quot;The Bible says it, so it must be true&quot; may work for Fundamentalists, but not so well for the rest of us.) Some of his central premises (Humans should naturally all speak one language, for example, or that there was no sickness in the world until a &quot;metavirus&quot;--perhaps from outer space? caused biological viruses to be created as well as making people susceptible to them) are so obviously fallacious as to be completely laughable. Inconvenient aspects of his arguments are just ignored. This pseudo-intellectual garbage so irritated me that I almost disposed of the book (and books are sacred in my family, ordinarily we do NOT throw them out!).That said, most of the actual plot-driven parts of the story are great fun. His satire of American society is spot-on. A lot of the book is just awesome head-on thrill-ride chase scenes. Those parts work! and I LOVE the character of Y.T.It's funny that all along, I envisioned the story as a cartoon (some things in it are just such broad caricatures, I couldn't help it). When I got to the end, I discovered in the acknowledgement section, that the thing was originally conceived as a graphic novel. I guess the ideas are kind of &quot;comic book&quot; -esque, you know--sort of like how getting bitten by a radioactive spider could give someone super powers.If you like a good action story, and you can ignore ridiculous ideas and gaping holes in logic, then you will enjoy this book!

I really really wanted to get into this but I just couldnt. The writer seems to be writing just to type something up. The descriptions are flowering and wordy.

When the professor told us about it, I thought this book sounded really interesting. I'm not a Science Fiction fan at all, but I thought this sounded like something I would like. I was wrong.It held my interest for about the first quarter of the book, but once Stephenson started getting into all the Sumerian stuff, I quickly lost interest. I had no desire to finish this book. I also don't think that the characters were very well developed at all. They all seemed like very flat characters. I couldn't relate to them, and I certainly didn't sympathize with them. This book is confusing in a lot of ways and Stephenson seems to be rambling and trying to impress the reader with how big his vocabulary is and how smart he is. Reading this book was a big waste of time. It seems like Stephenson couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a fictional book or a non fiction book.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and don't really understand why there is so much hype surrounding this book. To Stephenson's credit, the book is fairly easy reading. But I don't think that this book is ENJOYABLE reading, which to me is the first thing a book should be. Someone who is really into Science Fiction might really like this book, but most other readers probably won't. Don't buy into the hype surrounding this book. Skip it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"&quot;Liked Neuromancer? You'll love Snowcrash!&quot; I should have known better. The guy who uttered that recommendation was an idiot.

If you're looking for more Neuromancer, don't read this book. Read Cormac McCarthy or Tim O'brien instead; like Gibson, they are great writers first, genre writers second. Stephenson is a slightly clever SF hack, and that's about it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is full of fancy terminology and imaginary description, but that simply hides the fact that this book has no good plot behind it.

Stephenson is a visionary and an extremely clever story teller. This story specifically influenced the game and online industries in an amazingly profound way, not the least of which was influencing the founders of id Software who created the Doom and Quake franchises."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a book I've had on my to-read shelf for a long time. I think I bought this book in the 90's when there was a ton of buzz about it and when I was reading Science Fiction and Fantasy regularly. Why it took me so long to actually get around to reading, I'm not sure. It probably had something to do with a combination of high expectations and the size of the book. Finally, though, I bit the bullet and actually got to it through my Audible.com account. I love audiobooks.*Brief Synopsis:*A fast-paced adventurous romp in the near future. The cast of characters include a 15-year old skateboarding delivery girl, a nuclear harpoonist, a mafia kingpin, an advanced librarian AI, a religious hacker, and the main character Hiro Protagonist. The story revolves around Hiro, who turns out to be the second-baddest dude on the planet, though he starts out as a sword-wielding pizza delivery guy and part-time hacker. Along the way he partners up with YT (the delivery chick) and encounters all the other main characters while he discovers and tries to foil an intricate plot that endangers everything they hold dear.*Deeper Discussion*World BuildingOne of the great things about this book is the world that Stephenson \\"creates\\" in his near-future dystopia. Though the book was written in 1992, it still reads well in 2012 (20 years later). It has a great not-too-distant future feel. The concepts used involve the breakup of law and the corporatization of essentially everything. Sometimes it has a Mad-Max feel and at other times it feels like Gibson's seminal cyberpunk works (Neuromancer et al.) In this book, there are not one, but two worlds created. And done well. The Metaverse is Stephenson's online habitat, where users \\"jack in\\" to a computer-generated otherworld in which is greater in scope than the real world, but which still has programmed \\"rules\\" that make it interesting. Both the near-future and the metaverse are remarkably plausible and make for great plot devices. Needless to say, the author puts them to great use.Metaphysics and ReligionWhile the beginning and end of the book are mostly fast-paced adventure, the middle of the book gets a lot deeper with a venture into metaphysical concepts of language, religion, and viruses (computer and biological). I found it to be extremely interesting as a plot concept. Clearly there was a lot of research done by Stephenson, which allows him to put it all together nicely while not derailing the whole book. Briefly, he explores the idea of vectors (see the medical terminology) including biological viruses, thought concepts as vectors, language as vectors, and religion as vector and infected state. He takes this all the way to the hacker world by analogizing the way software viruses work (essentially these are language programs, after all). Bringing in some ancient-world religion and quite possibly real research into religion and tying it all together on three separate levels (biological, religious, and metaverse) gets pretty \\"deep.\\" I can see this being offensive to some people. It was borderline offensive to me.But just as you start to get worried about the discussion crossing the line, the author gets back to the adventure and finishes things up with a mad dash to the finish line.*Thoughts*This was a super-fun book to read. It seems rare to find a book that will successfully build worlds these days. Maybe that's just because I'm not reading a lot of science fiction anymore. But this book is exceptionally good in that regard, in my opinion. It's equally rare to see a book where the author will even attempt to touch on deeper subjects such as religion and metaphysics in what is a fun adventure. Honestly, this book reminded me of Dan Brown's The DaVinci Code in that respect. Maybe not quite as well researched, but with a similar \\"feel.\\" I would highly recommend Snow Crash to anyone who enjoyed The DaVinci Code.For some reason, I got the feeling that the wrap-up was a bit abrupt. Somehow it felt like the author would have liked about 30% more space to write in the book. Maybe to go a little deeper in the middle section. Maybe to flesh out the ending a little differently. I could be wrong. Despite this, it was still very satisfying and makes me eager to read Cryptonomicon.Who should read this book?* Anyone who enjoys science fiction or dystopian fiction. This is a key book in the genre of cyber punk. For that reason alone it is required for SF readers.* Anyone who enjoyed The DaVinci Code or that general type of fiction (adventure with some research) or even those who enjoyed the Indiana Jones flicks.Notes on the Audible Unabridged Edition:The narrator did an excellent job in his performance, conveying the story without doing anything that would cause you to think \\"what's up with the narrator?\\" Good, solid performance with clear speech and nothing unnecessary added to it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash had a bit of a slow start for me, but what a cool concept. By the middle of the book I was hooked.

As for the ever-changing cover situation? Well I don't know why they keep changing it but oh well. Its not the appearance of the novel that counts right?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"There are many thing about Snow Crash to like. The Hero (aptly named Hiro Protagonist) is a pizza delivering, dual sword wielding, hacker, bad-ass extraordinaire. He is supported by Y.T., a young, skateboarding, harpooning, wise-cracking, heroine. The characters and the dialouge are the big plus for this novel, especially good for this genre. There wasn't a single character, hero or villan, that wasn't totally believable. The plot was great, very rich and detailed, with a killer ending. So, why isn't it 5 star perfect? I'm sure Neal Stephenson finds ancient religious studies fascinating. He must because he fills about 200 of the 450 pages of this novel with it. I don't find reading about ancient Babylon and Sumeria particularly interesting, and to be honest, it only somewhat ties into the plot (meaning the plot could have stayed the same without all the ancient religious pretext). If you read this novel and skip all the chapters where Hiro has lengthy religious discussions with \\"the librarian\\", then you will enjoy the novel more I think.4 stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It is clear from the start that this is a book hat doesn't take itself too seriously.

Great book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"this book remains one of my favorite sci fi of all time. i credit it with making me a fan of the genre. better than the other Stephenson books i have read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Speaking to the novel, not the product. I cannot comment about this printing.***Snow Crash is a must read for those who partake of the science fiction genre. While most certainly it is a classic, it earned that location with a bold imaging of ideas and concepts that, while now commonplace, were bold and fresh at the time of writing.This is a novel that has aged... interestingly. While you may most certainly feel that it dates to the twentieth century, it does so without being a hindrance. In the same way a Golden Age story will miss some very basic technological/cultural advances and far overshoot others, so does this novel (to extremely pleasing effect). However, the disconnect is not so large as to detract from the story.As a personal recommendation, anyone reading this review has likely viewed more than enough spoilers and plot summaries, so I will avoid those. If you would enjoy an imagining of a 1990's future this is a pleasant read. Effectively all of the subplots are well crafted and mesh with the broader story, and the way the story is woven along with its original ideas make for a requisite read. As with well-done SF, try to avoid spoilers as much as possible: the more you can submerse yourself in the story the better the experience will be. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Looking at the negative reviews, you'd think that when the hero of the story (the \\"protagonist\\" if you will) is named Hiro Protagonist that people would twig that what's happening here is something...different. This is a book that's as much about how these kinds of stories are told as it's an actual story. It's a wild ride that, from the \\"look at me\\" prose to the reworking of every action/adventure shtick from the Mafia to \\"breaking your pard'ner out of jail,\\" is a complete hoot. It's not William Gibson because Gibson invented the cyberpunk genre and took it at face value. Instead, it's the genre (and every other genre) taken through a fabulous funhouse. Enjoy the trip."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"(3.5, really)While the term \\"cyberpunk\\" was coined as a genre label for William Gibson and others in the early 80s, it wasn't until Snow Crash (in my opinion) that a writer came along who really embodied the tag. Neal Stephenson is both cyber (familiar with computers, geek culture, and the spirit of hacking) and punk (sarcastic, irreverent, anarchic, and co-opting whatever influences he likes). And he's got the literary chops to bring the two together.Snow Crash is a novel that's equal parts messy and brilliant. Brilliant because Stephenson had an almost eerie prescience of many aspects of the future Internet, from its tawdry commercialism, to Second Life-like virtual worlds, to the divide between genuine hackers and dot-com sellouts, to the normalization of frightening levels of surveillance, to people's escape from reality into online lives and gated communities that cater to their own personal and political preferences. Obviously, no one writing from 1992 was going to get the specifics right, but the gestalt isn't so far off. And Stephenson's larger satiric vision of broken-down future America, which has outsourced all of its specialties except movies, porn, software, and pizza delivery, seems even more prophetic in hindsight. The idea of a nation parceled into corporate franchises and an ineffectual federal government, while a large chunk of the outside world slides towards piratical lawlessness (embodied by a giant flotilla of desperate refugees), could be a Tea Party dream run amok.This book also expresses Stephenson's considerable wit and sardonic humor at its fullest throttle. Not that he didn't maintain his madcap style in later novels, but his later works tried to expand his audience beyond graphic novel-reading, DOOM-playing teenagers and undergrads. Readers looking for the less \\"serious\\", more caffeineated Stephenson will find him here.However, plot and character development are not strengths of Snow Crash, which lacks the maturity and depth of his subsequent books. The story races from one breathless action scene to another, mixed with somewhat forced (though interesting) discussions of a speech-transmitted brain virus called \\"snow crash\\", which works like a computer virus and turns out to have been described by ancient Sumerian mythology. The main characters, other than a few defining Cool Characteristics, are pretty thin, and Stephenson's idea of a hip teenage female skate punk is about as painfully dated and cartoonish as Bart Simpson, right down to her catch phrases.In my opinion, this is definitely a book to read for its audacious foresight, for its cultural impact, and for putting Stephenson on the map, but as a novel, it's not quite a masterpiece. And much of its cutting-edge-for-1992 specificity does feel quaint now, unlike the electric glow it still had when I first read it in 1997."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I love Snow Crash. I've read it 3 times now. I bought the \\"Snow Crash (Bantam Spectra Book) (Paperback)\\" for my 3rd read.Firstly, I can see through the pages are so thing that I can easily read the print on the opposite side of the page--WITH the pages all pressed together (not with them held up singly). This makes reading that much less pleasant. It is very distracting and does, at times, slow me down a little. Not enough to make reading a word difficult, but enough to affect the speed at which it registers.Secondly, the typeface is very bad. The print is large and sloppy. There is a large gradient from one page to the next and it feels like a half the pages were printed with too much ink--so that letters with with curves at times look a little smudged.For me, both of these affect the pleasure of the read. Some perspective on my opinions; I normally don't pay particular attention to type face or paper quality because normally it is not an issue, but this IS one of the very few times I've found a printing to be unpleasant and of a deficient quality.If you are buying not just because you want to read the book, but that you want to keep the book as part of your personal library/collection/whatever do not get this paperback. Buy a hardback, or find different printing in a brick and mortar store."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The plot to Snow Crash has been covered in many other reviews, so I won't recount it in this review. I found Snow Crash to be excellent cyberpunk.Stephenson creates what is probably the most completely realized world in cyberpunk. The vision he has of a world where the United States has become balkanized, corporations rule civilization, and the virtual world rivals that of the real world in importance is painstakingly rendered. His prose flows off the page and makes Snow Crash a page turner. The characters in the book are well-developed and interesting.The book, in my opinion, has three negative qualities:1. Snow Crash has lots of exposition. No, really. Lots. In Stephenson's defense, this exposition is very artfully handled; however, if you find long explanations tedious, be warned.2. The central tenet of the work, while exceptionally creative and well-researched, only holds if you don't think much about it. All science-fiction requires suspension of disbelief, but this tenet is pretty out there.3. The ending is extremely abrupt. The book actually stops more than it ends, leaving the reader without any idea of what happened to key characters. Some ambiguity can serve a novel well if it provokes the reader to introspection, but the end of Snow Crash comes off as unfinished rather than thought provoking.Snow Crash, is however, one of the top two or three cyberpunk books I've ever read, and it's the most ingeniously crafted. While it has flaws, its oustanding even with them."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson plunges the reader into the future, into a world where the Mafia controls pizza delivery, the United States is unstable and weak and the internet is something of the past. Enter Hiro Protagonist--hacker, samurai swordsman, and pizza-delivery driver. Young Hiro Protagonist (yes, that's the hero protagonist's name) uses his computer game wizardry and pizza delivering skills to combat a deadly new designer drug (and computer virus) called Snow Crash. He encounters a sinister computer virus that threatens to bring about a collapse of the information system. With the help of a young messenger on one of the coolest skateboards ever described, he traces the virus to its source and confronts his nemesis in person and in the Metaverse. Along the way, he explores Babylonian metaphysics and Old Testament theology. The flashy, snappy delivery fails to compensate for the uninhabited blandness of the characters. And despite the many clever embellishments, none of the above is as original as Stephenson seems to think. A breakneck-paced 21st-century novel, Snow Crash interweaves everything from Sumerian myth to visions of a postmodern civilization on the brink of collapse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous... you'll recognize it immediately."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson first brings to life the concept of what we now call the Metaverse here. The story of Hiro the hacker and Y.T. the skateboarder saving the world from a babylonian meme is the backbone upon which virtual worlds such as Second Life(where one of my favorite hangouts is Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong sim) have laid their foundations.Stephenson envisioned the Metaverse back in the day when no computer online speed nor graphics card nor processor could support it. Now all are getting faster and smarter and it appears the next step will be the Star Trek Holodeck.The story itself is good. Hiro Protagonist is a hacker falling on hard times having to work as a Pizza Delieveryman for the mafia in a dystopic future america. He comes across a computer Virus that not only shuts down the computer but also shuts down the User's brain. Hiro helps a former love investigate and comes into contact with a wide range of interesting anti heores and villains.Hiro tries to save the day with his hacker skills and his RL skills with japanese sword fighting. He comes into a confrontation with raven the glass harpoon throwing Aluit who has a Hydrogen Bomb rigged to go off if his heart stops beating.At least one of the characters reappears later in \\"The Diamond Age\\" as a senior citizen.Great book for cyberpunk, post cyberpunk, steampunk, and metaverse fans."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Just as Gibson's Neuromancer helped begin the cyberpunk genre, so does Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash reinvent it. As a foil to the outlaw computer hacker so typical of the genre Stephenson introduces a skateboarding teenage girl, and the weapon of the evil masterminds plotting to rule all includes not only nuclear weapons but glossolalia, a speaking in tongues hearkening back to the Tower of Babel.Snow Crash, fifteen years after it was published, is still fresh and funny because of the twists Stephenson gives it. The satiric name of the Protagonist, Hiro, the sardonic look at the struggles of a purposeless U.S. government, the Mob-run pizza chain - all amuse the reader while adding to the story. It isn't a heartwarming romance, despite the teenage sex derailed by rape-deterrents, and it isn't a nihilistic novel of futuristic despair, ending as it does on the message of hope that a couple of kids can save the world. It's a very funny, weirdly heartwarming, and genre-breaking story about how crazy and how fun the near future could be."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Beyond what is an enthusiastically rendered tale of the coming world of 3D interactivity (and I personally believe coming sooner than most realize), this was an insightful look at the vulnerability of the social infrastructure that is growing on the web.Most have celebrated Richardson for foreshadowing the realm of \\"Second Life\\" and paralleling the cyberpunk world of Neuromancer. After reading this book 17 years after it was written, I think the idea of \\"Snow Crash\\" specifically is interesting when, in 2008, some of the broad imagery has already taken form.\\"Snow Crash\\" is a drug that moved from the physical world and through a battalion of programmers to the digital world wherein it became known as a virus that, in essence, effected the same result as the physical drug. Of course it took an offline set of motives and the story certainly has an offline plot, but Richardson fictionally describes a real possibility as the web becomes more tactile and social. The effect of the virus was a real world infection of human users. The Metaverse became simply a delivery mechanism.This particular concept is intriguing and left this reader considering our own brains and the future possibility of nefarious psychological influences that might accompany our participation in the digital world. There is certainly significant evidence pointing to the effects of a related concept: subliminal messages. So much concern was expressed that the FCC outlawed subliminal messaging in advertising in 1974 and the UN stated that \\"the cultural implications of subliminal indoctrination is a major threat to human rights throughout the world.\\"Its doubtful folks will treat this concept with any real interest for years to come. Many still believe that first-person kill games don't proactively influence violence in the real world. In the future (and somewhat presently), I can certainly see where electronic/online games and other digital environments could be created that could effectively brainwash participants through a barrage of misinformation, self-induced fatigue, and other psychological techniques.Social groups managed via the web become particularly vulnerable to the spread of such a construct because of the rapidity to which a group of sometimes thousands of people can respond to a call to action from a member of that group. Literally \\"before you know it\\" a \\"Snow Crash\\" type attack could spread around the globe utlizing the social group infrastucture of the web. This already happens everyday with bits of misinformation such as false news articles and digital attacks such as viruses. I wonder if we should research \\"anti-virus\\" for our brains? Worst case we should at least better understand the psychological and physiological influences of the bits moving across our optic nerves...\\"Snow Crash\\" was a great story and sparked many tangents in thinking given its relevance to the Internet world. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"When I first read Snow Crash, I thought to myself: \\"This thing is paced like a comic.\\" Funny then to later discover that the novel was written after a comic book attempt at the same story fell apart.Snow Crash is the paradigmatic Stephenson novel. Grabs you quickly, thrusts you head long into world that's so preposterous that he can't possibly be making it up, and the drags you along kicking and screaming until you're left startled and somewhat confused at a precipitous ending.But don't let that fool you. This is probably Stephenson's best, most memorable work. It's certainly my favorite and it's certainly the one that's the most fun. (Which is probably why I've read it ten times.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"From the opening paragraph, I knew this was going a be a wild ride of a book. Stephenson's mix of Sumerian mythology, computers, paranoia and a great sense of humor was a refreshing change from the other cyberpunk I've read. In my experience, a cyberpunk novel has all the humor of a train wreck, but Stephenson manages to avoid the Gibsonian doom and gloom and see the humor in the situations he writes about. Stephenson keeps the pace of the novel moving along nicely, even when he's busy explaining obscure Sumerian mythology (trust me, it's all relevant to the plot.) Overall, this an excellent, well written novel and I look forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have two words for this book: Simply Amazing.From the very beginning of the book I was hooked on the fast paced action.The main character, Hiro Protagonist, is an absolute genius.Not only is he a master hacker, he's the world's greatest sword fighter.When he teams up with Y.T., a local Kourier, they become an unstopable team.Anyone who has at least a slight knowledge of computers should not pass this one up.Stephenson has really created a classic with this fine piece."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of the problems I often have when reading a book with central themes like &quot;cyberspace&quot; and Artifical Intelligence is that very often the writer's lack of a core understanding of present technology doesn't allow him to plausibly predict it's probable evolution. In disagreement with a recent posting that stated that he &quot;gets most of the technology wrong,&quot; I'd like to state that as a programmer and network engineer I was more impressed by this book in terms of technological realism than by any book of its type that I can recall. I have no idea what Neal Stephenson did for a living before he wrote, but if it wasn't programming, networking or computer engineering, he's studied it well or has friends who've coached him well. He never once used a plot deviced that seemed impossible or illogical, which is very rare indeed. This is in stark contrast to Gibson's Neuromancer, which although it entertained me, did not show in it's writing style that the writer had any underlying understanding of the functioning of a computer. In fact, Gibson can be forgiven for his lack of technological sophistication only because of the fact that his work was so ground-breaking for the time at which it was written. (Gibson has admitted he never even owned a PC or worked with a computer until after that book was written). This book has great satiric wit, and lies within the definition of &quot;hard sf&quot;. A great combination in my book. It was so enjoyable and memorable I have to give it a 10."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Just don't examine the archeology too closely - I've heard here and from others that the archeology Stephenson uses is completely absurd.However, this is a book I reread every so often.

The concept of a computer drug/virus that can kill is fascinating.This book stretches the mind. Read it!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"You want to check if you are still a living, breathing person and not some TV addled, techno-zombie existing from one murk filled day to the next just for your daily fast food fix?

If you aren't at LEAST chuckling aloud at times (I personally howled at &quot;That Was Stale&quot; and &quot;Smooth Move Ex-Lax&quot;), then give it up- you must already be dead and just ain't fallen over yet... Some of the most biting satire on our &quot;popular&quot; culture I have ever come across can be found lurking, like buried treasure, in the pages of this quite astounding novel. I have found myself returning to this book every year, like some demented pilgrim, discovering anew on each reading some gem of wit and/or malice to my infinite amusement. This combined with Stepehenson's laser-sharp prose and absolutely insane characters give this book an honored place on my shelf. Sell the cat if you must to afford a copy, but by all means... Read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snowcrash is a rip roaring trip through a future where the free market has gone to its logical extreme.The world concept is hardly original but Stephenson uses it as a backdroup and then throws in world domination, religion and meme theory and a lot of very accessible humour.Read Snowcrash as a graphical novel in words. Its almost a masterwork, but its science is imperfect. Hard SF fans might not find it to taste.Snowcrash is easy to read, easy to enjoy and a welcome change from some of the more turgid &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; authors."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Inspired at best by a DC Comics view of an alternate universe... Funny only by virtue of the audaciousness of the caricatures. Not in the same league (or genre) as &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; and not even in the same universe as &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; as suggested by an earlier reviewer. Purely for light diversion, at which it succeeds marginally."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was just a rush, a joy to read. Every bit as hard-core, savvy, and cool as Gibson, but with much more humor and satire. I preferred this book to Neuromancer. Put me in a heady techno-ecstacy: who _couln't_ love a book where the Protagonist is a Mafia pizza deliverator who carries a gun and drives over little old ladies to deliver your pizza in 30 minutes OR ELSE? Admittedly a little long, and the subplot about Mesopotamia and human mind evolution was dizzyingly difficult to follow. However, this novel captures the essence of the modern American attitude better than just about anything I've read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've heard very little other than high praise for this book, but it didn't work completely for me.The book is filled with interesting characters who will have you cheering, biting your nails and /or hissing in hatred, and they reside in the most completely developed cyberpunk world since Gibson's Neuromancer.But the impetus behind the plot, and the author's polemical explanation of the theory that is the germ of the plot were flat and unbelievable to me.SPOILER ALERT:This book also ends at a climactic point and has no real denoument, as far as I'm concerned. The final &quot;crash&quot; of _Snow Crash_ echoed hollowly in my head as I hoped for a little more resolution."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash. Well, crash is the right word. I had heard a LOT of great things about this novel, and Stephenson is certainly creative, but we never get inside the minds and feelings of these characters. The technological aspects of the novel (and the neat twist on the computer virus idea) are superb, and there is some excellent descriptive work. But it just doesnt have the strength of characters who really move the story, and involve you in it. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"There are 30 reviews that summarize the plot of Snow Crash. So I'm going to skip that.The book was okay. Just okay. I found the pacing a little uneven, and it certainly feels like an author's first full novel. The ideas encapsulated in the fiction are interesting, sometimes even compelling. But Snow Crash is a bit of an idea novel. There is only one really interesting character and Y.T. isn't really the main protagonist.The important ideas are the anarcho-capitalism and languages as virus themes. In many ways, these serve as characters as much as anything else.Finally, the novel, in my mind, closes with several poorly closed threads that are not carried on in future novels. These detract from my pleasure in the novel. If you like Stephenson's other books, you probably like Snow Crash. If you come to Snow Crash as an introduction to Stephenson, it will tell you if you will like his other books."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'm a big fanboy of the cyberpunk genre. I should have liked this book. Instead, I can honestly say that hate this book-- and I also feel bad saying that about someone's work, because it's almost like saying you hate someone's baby.Maybe it was all the hype I was exposed to before reading it,but I just could not shake a deep feeling of annoyance throughout 90% of this book. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. And when I wasn't doing that, I was asking myself things like: \\"Do people really think this is the Cyberpunk cream of the crop? How many pages to go?\\"The first obvious problem was the prose. Apparently some people's funny bones get tickled by similes comparing military bases to boils on someone's butt, metaphors about valleys and geological oral sex, and clever wordplay like calling refugees \\"Refus\\" (Refuse, har har har, get it?). To an elitist douchebag like me it just sounds juvenile and unimaginative. Combine all that with clunky, corny writing, and it's just downright lame. I could have also done without the \\"Unix In A Nutshell\\"-like explanations of EVERYTHING that drag down the flow of the book even more.The other big problem was that I did not care about any of the characters. Hiro was annoying as hell because it's obvious that he's just a nerd's fantasy of what he wishes he could do. Y.T. also got on my nerves. She could have disappeared in the middle of the book and I would not have missed her. There was nothing likeable or interesting about either of them. Ironically, among all the cartoony, shallow characters, the only ones that had some sense of deeper humanity were Ng and Raven.Another letdown was that the book's ideas were not that great, which did not help the plot. I just did not buy the whole \\"neurolinguistic hacking\\" angle as it was used. People becoming brainless zombies from watching some binary code on a screen, or listening to some Sumerian \\"namshub\\"? That is so far removed from the fields of NeuroLinguistic Programming and memetics, that this might as well have been a Dungeons & Dragons novel. I get it. Brains are just like computers, so they can get viruses, binary code, 0's and 1's, blah blah blah. Seriously, I can suspend disbelief, but you can only take a metaphor so far before it starts to look stupid.Finally, for a book that's supposed to be a belly busting satire, the humor in this book is rather lame and nerdy. I read people talking about how this book made them howl with laughter, but almost everything fell pretty flat for me. The only section that got a half-assed 'heh' from me was the government policy on the use of toilet paper, but by the second page the joke had already become stale.All in all, I doubt that I will buy another book from this author. Judging from what little I've read in Cryptonomicon and Diamond Age, there is little that has changed for me to warrant another look."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Parts were very good - if it had an ending but it didn't. It just Stopped.And all the \\"Ominous\\" things that would happen \\"If & When\\" DIDN'T!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson writes the pants off most sci-fi authors, even (especially?) his cyberpunk contemporary Bruce Stirling. (Gibson is a push -- very different styles.) While Cryptonomicon was great stuff, friends have been shocked for years that I never was able to stick this one out, all the more so in light of the fact that I started reading him in 1984 with The Big U (his first novel, which he now all but disavows). Well, I finished it this time, and since I think White Rabbit's detailed review below is very astute, I'll just add a couple of things.First off, Neal often seems to exhibit signs of what some folks might call pedantry; he has the overweening pride, if not cockiness, of the autodidact (complete with occasional swipes at academics), and while I can kind of relate despite (or because of) my hard-earned degrees, he should get with his analyst and find a way to realize that this tendency to pontificate sometimes reflects rather poorly on him as an author and yes, as a human being. That is the case with the excessive Sumerian mythic components of Snow Crash (which don't add enough to the plot for the pages and pages of explication they receive, a source of complaint for many); and it is doubly true of the rambling Baroque Cycle, which few seem able to finish. That instance is all the sadder because it seems that this tendency of his is becoming worse, not better, with age. (In a perhaps related vein, he's also intensely private, even pathologically antisocial toward those of us in the faceless herd, as seems clear from the rants on his website.) One might wonder whether he needs more active editorial input, but here's a scary thought: what if these ARE the final products of intensive editing?Secondly, and more specifically to this novel, the over-the-top satirical elements finally get in the way of sensible storytelling, which becomes harder to take seriously the farther along in the book one gets. It just gets so overblown and silly by the end that I found it hard to stay engaged with it, whether as an adventure narrative or as social commentary. But again, Stephenson's a bright, witty, and intelligent author, one who sometimes is more profound in a single paragraph than are other genre authors over several thousand pages. I'm keen to tackle The Diamond Age next, about which opinion is very mixed. However, I do also hope he picks up the many dangling threads left over from Cryptonomicon at some point in the near-future."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"From one of the most bizarre concepts devised by humanity the pulse pounding opening to Snow Crash emerges. Meet Hiro Protagonist, the hero/protagonist. He has been trusted with a package of infinite importance. If it is not delivered within an ever shrinking frame of time Hiro's job, if not his life, will be at an end.Is it a bomb? A peace treaty with a warring nation? What about some sort of magical ring? All good choices, but by an amazing turn of events, our mystery object is...A pizza!But not just a pizza, it's a cooling pizza (A dangerous thing indeed in the future). 30 minutes, that's their promise. You don't reach your destination in 30 minutes it's over for you. Why can they do that? It's because they're the mob of course!From what you've gathered so far I'm sure you're scratching your head in confusion. Let me assure you that after the opener, pizza plays a very small part in this book (the mob however will play a bigger role). The story of Hiro is more of one of a slightly depressing life. He lives in a storage crate, and he's only paying for half of it. Having a job that puts his life at risk at a near constant rate doesn't help much either.To escape his suicidal living conditions, Hiro spends a lot of his time in the Metaverse. This is a sort of virtual reality / internet game (this is the future after all). On said alternate universe Hiro is a rather skilled new age samurai. Sword fights and programming jargon are his tools, and he's never lost at the former (he shouldn't, he wrote the software).Anyways the actual plot of the book depends on a certain aspect of the Metaverse, called a snow crash. Think of it as like a blue screen on a Windows OS, it's usually game over. Anyways a special kind of crash is going around, one that alarmingly hits the users in the real world as well. Coma and useless babbling are the only symptoms, and when it hits a close personal friend of Hiro it's vengeance time for the Samurai.The rest of the book goes deeper into programming style plot, and takes a surprising turn into ancient culture and religion. I won't ruin it for you but lets just say the ending leaves you wanting more (not necessarily in a good way).You will enjoy \\"Snow Crash\\" if:- You enjoy a Science Fiction now and then- You don't mind the occasion long winded explanationYou may want to pass on \\"Snow Crash\\" if:- Computers never interested you- You don't have the maturity to take a bit of swearing and adult situations."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow crash is an avalache of a novel, which picks you up and overwhelm s you with it's mix of cool gadgets, summerian mythology, fast action and names like Hiro Protagonist or Vitaly Chernobyl.In my opinion this is the best book by Stephenson, 'cause here he doesn't let his interest in the detailes of the world get into the way of the actual story (as he sadly did in Diamond Age, for example). The story defies description in a few words, and moreover, you don't want to read what it's about.But it starts with a pizza delivery man who works for mafia (and mafia here is official), but who is also an uber hacker.And for his antagonist - how about a guy, with an a-bomb strapped to his bike, and a chip in his head - if he dies, the bomb goes off.Mixing &quot;Matrix&quot;-style action (allthough it was written years before &quot;Matrix&quot;) and &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;-like revelations about history and religion this book will delight fans of cyber punk and other readers alike."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Given the great Sci-Fi that exists, I could not give this book five stars. Its drawback is that it will appeal to a narrow audience, but that includes me (maybe I should give it 4 stars). After an exciting start, we are led to puzzle that draws from the evolutionary theory of thinking and language. Very interesting, particularly if you are into memes, evolution, language, and programming. Not so fascinating if you are looking for a general and exciting Sci-Fi read.There is also some Japanese sword-play and some motorcycle chases. They are always fun, but they too, could be better.In sum, it is the right book if you are looking for a Sci-Fi book playing on the theme of the evolutionary selection of ideas and language. Otherwise I would pass it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Many of my fellow reviewers are correct; the first 150 pages are gripping, creative, and outrageous. The first time I read this book however, I struggled to follow the story through to the end. A year later, I could recall the opening pizza delivery scene in crystalline detail, and remembered nothing of the ending. But that's not so unusual for me; I tend to blast through books without digesting all of the content. So I sat down and devoured the book again.This time it made sense. Now that I am familiar with the world of burbclaves and loglo, I had excess processing power to absorb the Sumerian history and mythos. The ending was far more satisfying the second time also. I paid more attention to who and what Y.T. is. She's so competent and confident that it's hard to keep in mind that she's just a kid. Reading the ending with that in mind makes it far more satisfying.This is the most amazing cyberpunk novel I have ever read, Gibson included. It is well worth an attentive read. Don't read it just for the action and scenery or you'll miss out on characters with more depth than some reviewers believe."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I did like this book actually but if you read the reviews on the paperback edition you'd think this was the Second Coming, in fact some reviewers compared it to Pynchon, there are echoes of Pynchon in there but not enough that I would have drawn that sort of comparsion. But about the book itself, it's typical cyberpunk stuff, Stephenson loves his idea of the future and spends many pages describing it, in fact so many that you don't notice for about a hundred pages that the plot still hasn't gone anywhere and when it does go somewhere it does get better, but the ending is absolute nonsense and totally anticlimatic and is it just me or does Snow Crash never turn into the threat that everyone is talking about. One guy gets hit by Snow Crash and that's it. Whee. And then characters themselves are a tad bland, even though I like Hiro but the scenes between him and YT aren't all that interesting, and there's too much time devoted to explaining Sumerian myth . . . it gets sort of boring after a bit. But his prose and pacing do save it from becoming a chore and I have to admit that I didn't realize many of these faults until after I finished the book. Go figure. If you've devoured Gibson this is probably the next best place to start."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"Snow Crash\\" has one of the liveliest openings of any recent novel -- a lengthy and complex description of the appearance, behavior, and activities of a guy who comes across as a combination of the Terminator and a Special Forces op but who in fact turns out to be a pizza deliveryman.Unfortunately, it also has one of the worst climaxes of any recent novel, involving a robot dog bringing down an airliner for reasons having little to do with anything that came previously and which leaves most of the plot threads weaving pathetically in the breeze. It's as if Stephenson was setting things up for a sequel without having the vaguest idea as to what he was going to put into it, and so decided to leave all his options open.\\"Diamond Age\\" ended in much the same way, with a mass swim by a group of Chinese orphan girls for purposes impossible to surmise. So, after two novels of extremely spirited, uneven, and generally disconnected material, it becomes apparent that Stephenson has no idea what structure is or even that such a thing exists -- a strange characteristic for somebody so involved in cybernetics. Stephenson's method of writing seems to be a 3rd mil variation of the old pulp crank-it-out technique. He simply throws in whatever occurs to him at a particular moment, hammers it until it fits, then sends the whole assemblage rolling. When it comes time to shut things down, he grabs the most convenient plot element, tosses it under the wheels and throws his hands over his eyes until the noise stops.That no editor has ever so much as noticed this failing, much less sat him down and discussed it with him, somehow comes as no surprise to me.It's all a great pity, since Stephenson has beaucoup other virtues -- imagination, flair, serious knowledge beyond the level of \\"I read it the Paducah Democrat science section\\", along with other elements not commonly seen in SF: real humor, real wit, a sense of style, and a compassion totally alien to the \\"humans are units\\" attitude of the sciffy community in general. But none of this will work if it doesn't tie together, and from what I've seen, Stephenson simply can't bring it off.In that, he's very contemporary. It's all very similar to how the PC evolved, or how most software is written. So he may well be stuck, in spite of himself. Two and a half, tops. And on to \\"Cryptonomicon\\" -- one of these days."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In a world where the United States leads the world in software programming and pizza delivery, Neil Stephenson tells a classic tale of a sword fighting hacker and a couriour on the ultimate skateboard. His novel turns reality up to &quot;11&quot; and shines it through a fun house mirror to give both a distorted yet prophetic view of the future."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a great novel, reminding me of a top-quality Japanese Anime. The main character is a down-on-his-luck in the real world hacker (whose job is as an ultra-deluxe pizza delivery guy in a post-apocalyptic California) who is the premier cyber programmer in an alternate virtual world. A heck of an adventure and a heck of a good read -- just don't expect something too deep."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is without a doubt the best book I have ever read, and I am not a science fiction fan at all. In fact, I was making fun of my brother for reading it (unaware of the fact it wasnt the typical star wars type sci-fi crap I see on TV) because he usually reads the same stuff I do...Grisham, Clancy, etc. He told me, however that it was turning out to be an excellent book and said that I should give it a try. I did, and I got to say I may give up reading the regular type stuff I read to read alot more of this cyber-punk style writing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really enjoyed reading this fairy tale of a book. It is a sometimes funny tale of the future with heroes, love, Pizza Kourirs, skateboards, Aleutians, mobsters, modern days samurais, revenge and high adventure. It is a metaspace romp that will entertain many and agitate some.It is a quick moving story where Hiro in many ways is the young Willy Garvin and the female hero is a even young version of Modesty Blaise. They are happily not limited to live only in reality, but can also exist in virtuality, where one can have a totale different and sometimes more significant role than in normal life.The plot revolves around a drug called Snow Crash which is available both in Virtual and Real reality. After one of his friends becomes infected by this 'drug', Hero and skate-boarding Y.T. must investigate who is behind the snow scheme and stop the onrushing Infopocalypse. Along the way they meet an assortment of characters: a psychotic Aleut who uses razor-sharp knives to fight with, a wonderful funny cybernetic dog that can run at Mach2 (and is worth reading the book for alone. Enjoy the wonderful dog - gooooood dog! Sit!!!!), a Mafia Pizza Mogul with a heart (but for whom and what ?). The settings range from the city-states of ancient Sumer to Virtual Reality libraries to a huge surplus aircraft carrier/floating city in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.Why then does so many readers trash this story; Some do not believe in its bleak future (its science fiction!), some dont like that its the bleak future of USA (its science fiction!!), some dont like name of the main character ( its sc....well you know what I am going to say - ), some thought they were going to read an updated copycat Neuromancer story (ask for the money back if you dare), some just didnt like the story (but still got agitated enough so that they sat down and wrote a review), some didnt like the end (almost nothing is perfect in this world) - anyway I gave it a four and not a five!If you think some of the list just above could agitate you, please stay away from this book. If you dont mind some minor glitches in a story and are not overcritical and love a fairytale with born again Modesty &amp; co read it for fun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is one of the most accurate futuristic novels written! It is a fast-paced enthralling story, which interweaves the magic of language, pizza delivery, neighborhood cities, and internet cities: where the programmers custom build their own cyber-houses... and sword fighting is a cyber-art of 1's and 0's, and toggle back to the real world, where the music scene and politics intermesh in a whirlwind plot.Delve into a interesting and enticing story of the future of media!A must read for anyone who: watches tv. reads anything. uses any computer, anytime. speaks, at all. Learn the history of our language and the future of mass media in this great story!Allison Tripp-Russo"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What can I add to the other 363 reviews? Which, btw, I haven't read... most likely, nothing. Still, this is one of the most important books in the post-cyberpunk genre, so I'll add my bit, for whatever it is worth.Cyberpunk, as seen in Neuromancer, is reputed to be dead. There is certainly a difference in perspective between this book and the cyberpunk genre, but also a lot in common. Cyberpunk universe is decadent, without hope, and it's successor is not.You'd have a hard time telling that from this book, though. Certainly, institutions and values we are taught to cherish have all gone awry or simply away in here. And the insane speed with which life happens, the cacophony resulting of a million cultural groups clashing, is all the more depressing in the way it feels familiar.But there is a subtle undercurrent that paints all this not as decadent, depressing, but as vibrant and alive. And there is hope.The story is typical of the cyberpunk genre. Male uber-geek and female street samurai companion save the world from itself, without the world ever noticing it. It is well crafted, and a definite page-turner. And is definitely an essential read for any cyberpunk fan."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"After reading some of William Gibson's books, I found Snow Crash. I was glad I did. Much was very similar (which is also good), but Snow Crash keeps its own identity. The story revolves around one of the founders of cyberspace as it exists in the book, who also happens to be quite good with a katana. The mixture between cyberspace and martial arts is very interesting as the main character exhibits some of the trademark characteristics of a samurai, but perhaps more of a fallen one.The plot is pretty good. It too mixes cyberpunk with mythology, reaching back to ancient themes, not common to western culture, and mix them seamlessly with the current technological world.The world Stephenson creates is quite intriguing. Nations no longer really exist, just large corporate territories, to which people can obtain citizenship. This is a great world and a great story. If you enjoy anything by Gibson, you'll like this as well."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Usually I read 4-5 books at a time because neither can hold my attention long enough. This is not the case with Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, which pulls the reader into the eerie world that we can relate to as we discover the wonders and fears of virtual reality. Mafia, computer dorks, greatly developed characters, and fast plot surrounded by new fresh philosophies about cyberspace and cold war are what makes this novel a must read. You will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is located in the future that is predominately run by computers. Hiro is the main star of the novel, and he is a computer hacker. In the computer world, he is also an expert swordsman.In this story, there is a computer virus going around the computer world that affects hackers. However, the hackers actually suffer biological damage from this computer virus.Hiro is supposed to find the cause of this virus with the help of a friend called Y.T. Hiro will face a big challenge in stopping this virus, because he finds out that it will affect all of humanity.The futuristic approach is very interesting, but at times the novel is really confusing. The roles of the many franchulates and the Mafia are quite amusing. But overall, it is only an average book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"...by anyone interested in religion, pizza, fast cars, faster skate boards &amp; the evil machinations of corporate merger-land. Oh, and the harmful effects of software viruses on physical, mental, emotional &amp; socioeconomical infrastructure of humanity.Neal Stephenson, I'm not sure if you (via prescience) consciously hit every relevant Millenial topic smack on its head when Snow Crash was first released in '93...or if you were simply writing a swift romp through an alternative future world for amusement only.Snow Crash works several ways. It satisfies the hunger of a science fiction fan. It addresses the historical impact of technology, spam-marketing, Brand recognition &amp; our sick pursuit of organized &amp; punitive religions. It is sweet and hopeful and has a noble sense of Honor as &quot;pilotfish&quot; through the ugly morass of the ALL-CAPITALISM--ALL-THE-TIME future that we are always on the very brink of creating.Thanks, Neal. I haven't reread a book so much since Harlan Ellison wrote, &quot;A Boy &amp; His Dog.&quot;"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has one of the most interesting imaginations I've come across; half the book sounds like what comes out of your head, very very late at night, when someone turns the creativity switch &quot;on&quot; and then forgets to turn it off. His style of writing, if the present tense doesn't put you off, is very original and VERY amusing. The middle section of the book, I will admit, fails utterly as a novel, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. Stephenson relates religion and language to viruses by way of Sumerian mythology-- calling the god Enki the &quot;first neurolinguistic hacker&quot; was an interesting touch. This bizarre theory is presented in a series of very long discussions, however, which sort of stop the plot dead while you try to figure out what is happening. If you enjoy language, mythology, modern religion, and/or blends of all of the above raised on a diet of hallucinogenic chemicals and then filtered through Stephenson's completely whacked style, it is fascinating. If such ideas put you to sleep, you'll probably hate it. I belong to the former group, and have read this book three times, and STILL don't quite understand all of it; that is what makes it so much fun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I belive that if 'Beavis &amp; ButHead' could read we would hear ButHead saying &quot;That is the coolest thing I have ever seen.&quot;For it is. It is a fantastic book. Detailed, intelligent, well structured, powerfully cast and riviting to the very last detail.The intertwining of various stories and charachters is done impecibly. It is fun, it paints pictures you feel you can almost touch in your mind and it realy draws you into the Snow Crash world.I was fascinated about the annalysis of language and the 'meta virus'. The whole religion thing being shown for what it could be.The likable mafia who really do seem like the good guys, despite this you never realy know which of the corporations are good or bad.The description of technology is fantastic too. In depth, detailed, clear and understandable.This modern/futuristic guide to life is a must for any sci-fi/cy-fi fan and will draw in anyone who reads it. I was physicly unable to put it down for hour! ! s on end and I was devistated when there was no more to read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It's been a while since I read this book, but I now feel compelled to add my .02 (so I slack a bit). Stephenson's vision is compelling - so much so that this book has memed itself into the tech-culture that ultimately will be our everything &lt;Smack&gt; (end of seriousness)Bam! Wakes you up by throwing a red hot pizza into your unit and slapping you silly. Deliver that pizza or it's your a**! Today this work reads like a dictionary of all that is cool: #Mafia-pizza #Babylonian memes #Motorcycle tac-nuke #Floating city-state #Katana neckslices #Hypervelocity pitbull #Brainfry cyberdrug #Smartwheel skateboard #Monomolecular bumpersticker - Put those in your book.Snowcrash isn't a novel, its a hyperguide to better living.

Dang, i've been memed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"You are quickly caught up completely in the Snow Crash universe, moving at light speed wherever Stephenson takes you. Particularly impressive is that nothing seems dated. 1993 to now is a long time in the computer world, and his Metaverse is not co-opted or made to look foolish by the Internet, which became widespread, remember, completely after he wrote this book. I haven't seen any other writing with such technical detail that ages so well. Well researched, and much of the research can be done only by talking to people in the particular sub-culture - you can't just go down to the library for much of what has such a real, &quot;I've been there&quot; feel to it.I just wish there was a slightly toned-down version of the &quot;gag and gauge&quot; section - I'm of a generation where there are people I can't recommend the book to, just because of that little part. Lots of punch, lots of impact throughout the book. That one part just goes a little further."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Like The Diamond Age, Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash is a truly wild ride. And like Diamond Age, what you're getting here is really a series of odd and amusing episodes, with plot taking a back seat. Still, it's a fun ride."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is the book I now give to people in order to suck them into science fiction. It contains a good understanding of how programmers view the world, and of humor and irony.From the beginning, this book takes the reader on a (literal) ride through its world and challenges the reader to keep up. If light reading is what you're looking for, this book is not for you. While its premise is ridiculous, it -is- fun, and the journey it leads you on is amazing.Basic background: the concept of a &quot;nation&quot; has collapsed. Nothing is sacred unless it is related to money. Anti-technologists will hate this book. Techno-philes will love it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I picked this book up on a whim after reading about two lines worth of review in WiReD. Let me say this is one of the best books (Neruromancer is right up there too!) that I have read. I blew through it in 2 and half days. I couldn't put it down! The character were actually realistic, and I thought that the character of Y.T. to be one of the best portrals of a female character in any book I have read. She written in such a way that she almost, at times, displaced Hero. The plot was of the standard, One man vs the world to save everyone type, but what made it diffrent was the fact that it was believable and the characters were well written, nay, superbly written helped you really get lost in all of it. The mix of Mafia, Yazuka, Bushido, and Cyberpunk was handled really well. Its a really good look at how the future may turn out! This is one hell of a good book and good read!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"N. Stephenson has showed us the future in Snow Crash.

Suffice it to say, this book is the best written sci-fi conspiracy novel I have read to date."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Very clever social and cultural satire. If you liked this, you'd probably like the 1950's works of Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth, also a 1970's book by Jack Vance called &quot;Wyst.&quot; (these are satirical but predate cyberpunk)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The first third of &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is so much fun and so bizarre, I was instantly hooked. The post-breakdown world he describes is at once surprising and familiar, and--a welcome change from other Bleak Future novels I've read--it is often laugh out loud funny. But after the initial setup, the book sadly fails to deliver. The librarian has lots of fascinating ideas, but I hate being on the receiving end of a lecture, and the librarian was a too-thinly disguised device to deliver a too-long lecture. And the dead-on sendup of contemporary Christians which Stephenson sets up in the first half of the novel starts to sound a little cloying in hindsight: how can you criticize a group for believing their tenuous interpretations of ancient myths are Truth when you are yourself proposing far more tenuous interpretations of ancient myths as Truth? Still, the first 150 pages of this novel are SO good, I recommend it highly. Just check first to see if your library has it before you plunk down your $6. (shhh, don't tell the amazon folks I said that!)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The book was hard to put down and some of the descriptive passages had me astounded. If this is the future then count me in."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In an era where mindless Shadowrun(tm) books are the mainstay of (secondary) cyberpunk literature, this book is truly good news. At least once you get over the first 50 or so somewhat childish &quot;my cyberpunk is cooler than yours&quot; pages. After the long awaited &quot;Snow crash&quot; enters the story, a near-brilliant, astonishing plot weaves through fast paced, refreshingly off-beat prose. A true hacker (not cracker, folks) would love this book.That said, to my knowledge Stephenson was not the first to use &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Metaverse&quot; leans on several other similar terms, and Da5id is just another 3Jane. Odd, since he goes through some trouble to acknowledge all the archaeological/anthropological/etc. research (although no full citations are given)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of the best book I have ever red"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really liked the speculative science fiction in this book. The characters were great, and I even liked the story when it was moving. But I got bored with the chapters on philosophy; it slowed the pace of the book just when things were getting good."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash is a shining beacon in the world of cyperpunk novels. He twists the world of thr future around to make it dark, as per the formula, but also very interesting and at points humourous even. I enjoyed Snow Crash quite a bit, but I enjoyed Zodiac, also by Stephenson, so much more. Definitely read Snow Crash, but check out his other works are well.Snow Crash does do a wonderful job in its portrayals of the main characters, but Stephenson sometimes gets lost in the wonders of the world that he has created it. A tighter focus on characters and plotting would have served the book well."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a masterful work. I have read it over and over again, and I enjoy it every time. It mixes a masterful rendering of a possible future of the world with a quickly moving plot that has a uniquely intriguing backbone idea.

Despite this, I would suggest this book to anyone, and have in fact loaned my copy out to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Nothing but good thing is what I can say about this book"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"That's all I have to say. Insanely great"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I absolutely loved everything about this book, except the ending. I loved the characters, the social satire, the plot, even the edutainment about Sumerian language viruses. But I felt like it was missing an entire chapter. I actually checked the page numbers of the library copy I had thinking somebody had ripped it out. It left so much unresolved. I felt like it needed a couple more short chapters to tie up all the loose ends. Where's the deneuoment (sp)? Besides my disappointment with the chopped ending, I think it's probably the best Science Fiction book I've read in years. Definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Has some good points but the plot goes downhill in the second part and is unsatisfying, monotonous and tedious about language"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is a masterly writer, and here he combines this talent with a wonderfully imagined view of the near future. The characters are fun, the gadgets are cool and theme is thought provoking."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow crash is certainly not short on ideas, the franchised earth is a great thought, especially when the franchises include the mafia and the US govt, and no law.The visions of the near future are indeed pretty horrific, and theres some pretty hardcore weaponry and technology, Hiros unstable nucleur chain gun has too take some beating.The opening is superb, and the book is well established in the first chapter, allowing for the then constant onslaught of ideas.The only real downside was the slightly overdone library references, the links to sumerian myths could have been chopped down a lot, the depth just wasnt needed and slowed down the story, ill admit to skipping huge swathes of these explanations.It certainly reminds me of the William Gibson stuff, although since its over ten years since a read them, its a little hard to say why."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Finally, someone with a different view of the cyber world.

This book is a classic among technology enthusiasts and is recommended reading for everyone involved in the information technology industry. More generally, anyone involved in an industry that is dependant upon timely and accurate information and data stands to benefit from the perspective offered by this book.Mr. Stephenson showcases his unique ability to, through the voice of fiction, bring complex and futuristic topics into focus for the general public. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson crafts a rich futuristic world in Snow Crash, one that reminds me of two movies. With its lawless society governed by large corporations and independent country-like &quot;burbclaves&quot; like &quot;Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong&quot;, the book has a definite &quot;5th Element&quot; feel to it. It is in this world that the book's main character, aptly christened Hiro Protagonist, is living in a U-Store-It locker and delivering pizzas for the mafia. When a pizza delivery goes bad, he meets up with his foil, the attractive teenage girl &quot;Y.T.&quot;, who is a Kourier (a delivery person of the future, who uses her &quot;magnapoon&quot; to latch onto and surf behind cars). The book takes a decidedly &quot;Matrix&quot; bent, however, when the Metaverse is introduced - it's essentially a virtual reality version of the Internet on steroids (although the world wide web did not exist when Stephenson wrote this book, many of his terms have been adopted today in the real world, most notably &quot;avatar&quot;). Hiro Protagonist is one of the masters of this world, a hacker who helped create it in its early days. The sci-fi plot turns into a mystery novel when a new virus inside the metaverse starts infecting people in the real world. In unraveling the mystery, you will be subjected to a delightful array of innovative creations, ranging from the Rat Things to the dentata, that will have you longing for more!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Welcome to the United States in the not too distant future.

It was built and programmed by an elite group of hackers who are now being struck down one by one. A new virus, capable of not only crashing a computer, but also the human brain, has been released on the unsuspecting hacker community. Now it is up to Hiro Protagonist and his partner Y.T. to find out who created this deadly super virus and stop the Infocalypse.Neal Stephonson blends technological know-how, ancient myth, and a passion for adventure to bring the reader an unparalleled sense of realism to his masterpiece.

I loved the idea of relating ancient Sumerian myth to modern society but the story, that is built around it, is weak. There was no desciptive writing anywhere. I couldn't wait to finish so I could move on to another book. And the ending - its bad. The whole &quot;raft&quot; sequence was confusing and dull.

It was loud. I thoroughly enjoyed parts of the book. I found it too raunchy for my taste. I also find that authors who re-define facts, and draw their historical/technical advice seemingly from the detractors and critics more than a bit ANOYING. I would best sum it up by saying I forced my way through parts of the book to experience &quot;the definitive cyper-punk novel&quot;, and in the end threw the book away rather than pass it on."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"this is a book where everything moves fast because a taste for character development seems to have vanished together with the United States as we know it. The year is later, and Hiro, a multicultural hero, is a hacker who delivers pizza for the Mafia (who have taken over pizza delivery and teach it at the Cosa Nostra Pizza University). Then Hiro finds out that there is a nefarious plot that uses a lot of references to Sumerian mythology - a plot to take over the world.This is a story that is full of clever and hip little descriptions; it moves at a frenetic space, it's cool, it has as its heroes a hacker and fifteen year old skater, it takes place in virtual reality and in normal reality, and there's plenty of sword fighting and things blowing up to keep you away from the fact that - well, that the story is kinda thin, kinda childish. We spend a lot of time with Hiro but darn it if you get any sense of who the guy is; darn it if you really understand a lot about YT aside from the fact that she's a cool teenager with a heart (gag!). When it comes down to the meat of the story - to explaining why things are happening and where he wants to take us, Stephenson sounds like an amateur - there's page after page of earnest exposition, like crib notes taken from Wikipedia; we're fed a lot of stuff about mythology in page after page of little summaries. Then it gets kinda incoherent, like when he calls Christianity a 'brutal, irrational theocracy' - but then it sounds like he endorses it because he praises it for suppressing speaking in tongues.By the time you get to that it's too late to throw the book against the wall, so you just go along with the explosions for a while longer, knowing there will be a sword-fight at the end that will tie things together (like Lebowski's rug) while you're left scratching your head and thinking you're not cool enough to 'get it.'"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As an idea Snow Crash is fun, inventive, and exceedingly clever. As a book Snow Crash is frustrating, condescending, and extremely dull.Stephenson is talented at creating interesting plots, but he proves himself to be truly awful at writing. This is a common malady in the Science Fiction genre, but that shouldn't make it okay.All characters are as one dimensional as paper dolls, action scenes are a consistently muddled mess, the story never invokes any sort of emotion towards it's protagonists except apathy, and the author strives so hard to make everything \\"super cool\\" that you'll feel like you're back in junior high.I'm sorry to give this book a bad rating because it really is based on a fun if completely implausible concept, but the execution of that idea is absolutely inexcusable."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Most of the premises of this book were familiar to me already from reading William Gibson, so I cannot say that it struck me as particularly original in any way. The Metaverse, privatization run amok, corporatization of organized crime, even the treatment of Sumerian myth (which was interesting, though it could have been presented in a more artful way than a 40 page discussion between the protagonist and a research librarian) is a conceit that Gibson had previously used (although in Gibson's case, of course, it was voodoo mythology).Stephenson's writing style is certainly enjoyable, and it was pleasant reading straight through. I read it in one sitting (a very long flight), and found that I was never bored. Still, one gets the impression that, especially at certain points later on in the book, Stephenson was virtually racing through prose in an effort to make plot elements come together, a task which he really did not accomplish. Stylistically he often makes up for the plot defects (which with a modicum of suspension of disbelief are really not that bad anyhow), but at points the writing becomes quite uneven and the level of detail and discussion very thin. This perhaps points to the author having bitten off more, plotwise, than he could chew.Still, I'd certainly recommend this as airplane reading. As a sort of cross between Neuromancer and Illuminatus, how bad could it be, after all? But if you put any more effort into it than that, or have higher expectations than just an enjoyable romp, you could come away disappointed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"While Neil Stephenson shows some promise in this book, which will later show up as full-blown talent in Cryptonomicon, this is one of his works that is best avioded. The characters are two-dimensional, the setting is poorly thought out, and the &quot;science&quot; behind the eponymous drug and the mysterious illness related to it is no contrived and patently impossible as to cause a reader physical pain. There are some cute moments and good ideas in this book, but not enough to redeem it. This is one of Stephenson's earlier works, and it shows, do yourself a favor, skip this and move onto his later writings, which are much more polished."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"i love sci fi. i'd tried to read this twice & just couldn't get traction. when i finished edelman's infoquake trilogy i wanted more so tried again after advice from a friend that this is more accessible than cryptonomicon. so i slogged through the pizza delivery bits. i am giving this story 1 star for vision & 1 star for the first two segments about semi autonomous guard units. the virus/sumerian subplot i found tediously executed - an author with more talent and/or patience would have told the story without needing pages and pages of direct exposition that saps the book of its remaining momentum (which had been flagging for some time).i wanted to like this book but it is so uneven with odd flashes of bitterness misplaced even in such deep satire that i will pass on the rest of this authors work. if you like anime you might find this visually rewarding as the descriptions are very vivid. but if you like a coherent plot and consistency in characters give this one a miss."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The opening of Snow Crash has to be one of the best 50 pages in Science Fiction! It is a high energy romp through an anarchistic future run by the Mafia and a varity of entrepreneurial sovereign nations of which the US goverment (what's left of it) is just one.Stephenson predicted cyberspace before we had a word for it and creates an interesting and compelling story.The story does slow down after a while and the book does not maintain the wild pace of the beginning. Also there is a section of lectures in the middle given by the \\"librarian\\" that we could have avoided.Other than that, its all interesting and its all fun!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a book that weaves Sumerian myth with virtual reality and creates a cyberpunk thriller. It reminded me a lot of Gibson's Neuromancer/Count Zero/Mona Lisa Overdrive series but it was vintage Stephenson all the way.

I really identify with Hiro, from his racial identity issues to his halting, but evolving relations with the opposite sex. :-)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"When William Gibson was inventing cyber punk, Neal Stephenson was foreseeing the most extreme use of the Internet. And this incredible net is set in a barely functioning USA: no central government, a bunch of city states.The two protagonists presage Salander, the &#34;girl&#34; in Dragon Tattoo and a male hero/nerd cum samurai. Definitely the oddest pair in contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"great book, the name of the main character is Hiro Protagonist, need I say any more about this gem of a story?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have read several of Neal Stephenson 's novels and each is better than the last.

These are all words that I have heard describing this book by everyone who has read it. Guess I will have to find out."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have read a prodigious amount of sci-fi throughout my life. I enjoy many different authors within the genre, but if I could choose only one, it would be Neal Stephenson, without a doubt in my mind. He has several outstanding books, and I've read his entire canon. With that being said, Snow Crash is what started me off as a Neal Stephenson fan. It is a classic cyberpunk novel that just doesn't get old."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This was the best cyberpunk novel of the 1990s. It is very well written, tremendously innovative, and incredibly entertaining. Neal Stephenson has found his own unique viewpoint on American culture, and the result is awesome. It is darkly humorous in places (the Deliverator is one of the best sub-characters in American fiction) and he leads you into a great deal of thought about the future of this country while remaining so enjoyable that you have to be dragged from the book to eat. I consider this to be one of the great books of the twentieth century, and have bought copies for several friends just to be able to discuss it with them."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Well written fast paced novel that does not read like cyber-punk. The book slows occasionally as we learn about language and viruses but this only adds to the book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Yes, it is a cyber-punk novel, which almost prevented me from being interested in it at first. But for whatever reason (I forget why) I DID read it. If you have a great imagination and don't mind letting go a bit, this book will immerse you into a future world that will challenge your imagination and then beat it senseless, not to mention destroying many of your more delicate brain cells. All governmental, religious, social and internet conventions are ravaged. Rat Thing, a cyber/nuclear/bionic guard dog, has to be read carefully to be appreciated fully. The Federal Toilet Paper interdepartmental memos had me in hysterics. Some of this book you may read standing up. If you can't seem to fit all this together, I understand. Either you've been Snow Crashed, or you have not. This book is one of Time Magazine's top 100 novels of all time. Google it. If you are imaginative and have one of those \\"theatre of the mind\\" personalities, you will never forget this book. It can't be made into a movie. They had better not even try."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson masterfully does what good science fiction is supposed to do: show a futuristic, somewhat plausible, quasi-dystopia, and populate it with solid characters who interact with that world.Snow Crash is a great, entertaining read. If nothing else, it is solid entertainment.However, like Stephenson's other blockbuster, The Diamond Age: A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, Snow Crash goes way beyond pure entertainment. He is similar to Orson Scott Card in his ability to see where technology is taking culture and then to take that technology several steps further, showing a likely end result.I recommend Snow Crash for fans of science fiction, good literature, technology, and even Biblical languages (you'll have to read the book to understand). Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"0101 1100 1101 00011111 0010 0101 1010What if looking at these seemingly innocent binary numbers could not only affect your computer, but your brain as well? After all, your brain is simply a biological computer itself.This is one of the main themes in Stephenson's SNOW CRASH, a becoming-more-recognizable future where people divide their time between Reality and the Metaverse.The other theme is more complex, but tries to draw parallels between Sumerian mythology and computer viruses. It's interesting in that it challenges the reader to alter their view of history, but the analogies are not as well drawn as they could be.Fortunately, these two suit-and-tie topics are woven into a story that features an eccentric cast of characters and an action-packed storyline. I couldn't use the phrase \\"colorful cast of characters\\" as some of them are literally black and white in the Metaverse!For example there's the main hero, Hiro Protagonist. I haven't come across a name that creative since Prince S., a character in Dostoyevsky's THE IDIOT.The sword-wielding, motorcycle-riding Hiro reminded me heavily of Cloud from the famous FINAL FANTASY 7.Then there's the skateboarding Y.T. (not Whitey!), a 15-year old, skateboarding female Kourier that reminded me of the rebellious John Conner of TERMINATOR 2.The locations are just as interesting, where people live in storage units or the neighborhoods of Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong, The Sacrifice Zone, Nova Sicilia, Narcolumbia, et al.It's not exactly Mister Roger's Neighborhood either as each place has their own rules and lots of security to keep out unwanted people.Just off the shore of the West Coast (where most of the story takes place) is a mass of ships called The Raft. Very similar to Mieville's ship-city of Armada in his book THE SCAR (written many years after this book). It is here where Hiro and gang meet up with several of the major antagonists as the novel draws to a close.With so many crazy ideas all into one book, it is understandable that the first hundred pages read like SNOW CRASH FOR DUMMIES, complete with laugh-out-loud humor, to make your transition into this world easier than Orientation Day at school or work.After those first hundredish pages, the story races along like a mechanical guard-dog on a straight highway.The mythology portions come up about halfway, but are presented by a Librarian. The best way to imagine the Librarian: What if GOOGLE could talk? or What if that stupid paperclip in MICROSOFT OFFICE actually did something useful for once?The ending, while action-packed and exciting, is where I felt some disappointment. The last line is good, but there is not much closure on what happens to the characters and the chapters that were previously ~15 pages are rapidly narrowed down to ~5 pages--a sign of an author who can't contain his excitement at almost finishing his book.But on the whole, I found this novel much more enjoyable and understandable than William Gibson's earlier NEUROMANCER.If Hiro were rating this book, he would give it 0100 out of 0101 Stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson's vision of the present/future is remarkable, especially for a book published in 1992 (his only misstep I saw was stating that people carry CD players). My only complaint is that the man on the cover of this version is clearly Caucasian while Hiro is supposed to be black and Asian. Really, that's my only complaint."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I wasn't quite sure of what to expect when I started reading 'Snow Crash,' as I hadn't really heard anything about it (other than a bit here and there that it might be \\"good\\"). So I wouldn't say that I was surprised per se when the story really started to reel me in - but it wasn't an unpleasant feeling, to be sure.The plot of the book is pretty straightforward - in the near future, America has fragmented and now there are isolated pockets of like-minded folk that live together in protected suburbs. The government is pretty much abolished. There also exists a souped-up version of the internet - imagine being able to jack into a sort-of 'Matrix' style reality by using goggles.And someone is trying to mess things up by introducing a vicious virus called Snow Crash.The...main character (who goes by the name of \\"Hiro Protagonist,\\" possibly one of the funniest things I have read in years) is both a master hacker and real-life swordsman who starts to unravel the machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" - and this is where the book really takes a huge turn.Most of the actual plot of the book is very well paced from an action perspective, but when we start to get to the portions where Hiro is deciphering the plans of the Big Bads, things get very metaphysical with descriptions of Sumerian history/mythology which builds to a very compelling (if pseudo-science-y) interpretation on the nature of both communication and transmission of information.This deciphering does slow down the story, but it is interesting enough that I'm willing to give that portion a pass. What is somewhat of a letdown is how everything is somewhat tied up at the end, where the reader is forced to make quite a few assumptions as to what may have actually happened to various characters.In short, a great book with a less than spectacular finish."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Clearly my opinion is not shared by most, so I suppose this should be taken with a grain of salt.Let's start with the good. Snow Crash is a good story and it's hard to put down because you always want to get to the next part. There are a lot of very cool ideas that are well explored. I don't think Mr. Stephenson has the best grasp on nuclear physics or thermo-dynamics, but there is a lot of cool tech stuff anyway.The down side is Stephenson is very self-indulgent and likes to rant. That's OK, but about half the book is spent repeating the same rants about government and corporations. That coupled with the massive amount of time spent on Hiro Protagonist (who ironically does not have much of a character arc) doing research and summarizing it all as he goes only to summarize it all again towards the end, and the book has a lot more pages than the story can really support.For sci-fi fans, this is a must read. For others, it's worth reading, but don't stress it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"High-speed pizza delivery.Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson, has one of the most interesting openings in science fiction, a description of a high-tech armored driver and car. A man with a mission. A man with wonderful high-tech toys and samurai swords, who works for the Mafia doing one of the few things that the United States still does better than any other country in the world. In the first few pages the reader is introduced to Hiro Protagonist- a hacker, pizza-delivery driver, and a samurai; Y.T. - the skateboard courier; and the major political structure of the future.Stephenson does a fantastic job of introducing the first book of its kind. One that incorporates the concept of a Metaverse, a blend of corporate-franchise, city-states, and the Internet. A place where status is not determined by capital wealth but by the amount of information one controls. Once inside, they can relate to each other and the environment in the form of an avatar. A powerful businessman named L. Bob Rife intends to control the minds of the unsuspicious population by releasing the Snow Crash virus both as a drug among the general population and a computer virus through the metaverse. Hiro and Y.T. are in a race to determine what his plans are and how to stop him.The idea that Stephenson uses suffices as the inspiration for stories like the Matrix. The concept of multiple realities was brand new at the time of the release of this book. Over time it has grown and is now a mainstream concept used in games like Second Life and numerous movies.Those of you interested in how the future of communications might affect society and how we may interact with each other should find this an interesting and fun read. I give my highest recommendation for Snow Crash."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash pretty much cracked sci-fi wide open. My only regret is not having read it 15 years ago or so - since so many of the ideas inside have become (or are becoming) cliche due to their influence on so many other creators.If one measure of speculative fiction is how many things the reader sees differently in their day-to-day life after exposure - then this book is among the best I've read.The concepts involved overshadowed the narrative itself, however, as I found the story to be choppy, inconsistent and poorly resolved.In the end, it was a bit like a video game that was a hell of a good time to play, regardless of whether or not the plot was the focus."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Read it four times, more than any other book. Unbelievable. Highly visual. Godlike. Steal a copy today!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I found Snow Crash to be a very enjoyable read. I like the style that the author used to present the story. It almost seemed like a narration. The ending seemed a little rushed though. That said, I look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If I don't like it it is because I don't like cyberpunk. This book had some good points though I suppose. It began well ,was funny in a way, &amp; probably had some good moments. I hate to say this, but one of the reasons I don't like these kinds of books is because the people I've known who like them are creepy. I guess that's silly, but I haven't liked liked the cyberpunk I actually have tried. Well, I did like a Cadigan story I read in Asimov's, but otherwise bleh to this whole subgenre I doubt I'll try another."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was offered Snow Crash by a friend to read. I was a little dismissive, due to it being 'cyber-punk', but I rallied on. After a fairly humourous opening, it went rapidly downhill from there.To give the man his dues, there are at least two cracking good ideas on every page. Unfortunately, the words stringing them together are awful. Horrible, dull, clunky sentences pervade most of the passages. I'd say the man can't write for toffee, but that would be unfair as I've not yet summoned the courage to read his other works. I'm told I would enjoy Cryptonomicon, but then again, I was told the same thing about Snow Crash.And then there is the info-dumping. How I hate info-dumps. The process of just reeling off large sections of what sounds like textbook or encyclopedia and just putting it down on the page as one character talking to another. Ugh. There's a lot of it in this book.So, The book gets 2 stars for the good ideas, but no more for everything else that makes it awful."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Way too overwritten, with Melville style tangents into things about which nobody cares. Cyberpunk gone bad."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is Stephenson's first work, and it shows in all the right ways. There's a sense of exhilaration and freshness that doesn't come through in his other books. Moreover, he obviously had been thinking about some of his most memorable lines and thoughts for years and they all come out here. From a fragmente on comparative advantage on pages 5 and 6 so good that it's quoted approvingly in \\"The Economist\\" to a description of federal workers required to read a three-page memorandum on toilet paper, this book covers the gamut of the zany, the bizarre and the hilarious.And when he gets down to the plot, he has a pretty solid foundation. So much writing in SF's \\"cyberpunk\\" phase was just existential angst and leftover hippie-ism. Writers dispensed with plots and concentrated on attitude, which will only get a reader so far. Snow Crash, on the other hand, had an important point to make about the origins, costs and benefits of human interconnectivity, and was able to present the point intelligently and interestingly, even making the pedantic parts (i.e., the Librarian) fun to read. I don't exactly agree with Stephenson's characterization of the origins of Judaic thought, which seems to be based on an ad hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, but at least he's talking about interesting and thought-provoking things. I never learned more from any other source about Sumerian history.My only reservation about the book is its glaring inaccuracy about \\"speaking in tongues\\" both in the biblical context and as a linguistic phenomenon. First, a careful review of the biblical verses relating to the Day of Pentecost reveals that the languages spoken were known languages understandable to those gathered: \\"And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?\\" Acts 2:8. On the linguistic side, glossalia has been examined and it has been determined to be an artifact of a mind already developed by language. Examination of the choice of syllables and formation sounds and words of \\"speaking in tongues\\" used by the Pentecostals will reveal the native tongue of the speaker and even which part of the country he or she is from. See \\"Word Play\\" by Peter Farb. These facts vitiate Stephenson's principal argument."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Along with William Gibson, who is sort of the &quot;father&quot; of cyberpunk, and Asimov and Clarke, the &quot;fathers&quot; of science fiction/high-tech, comes Neal Stephenson with one of his many works that will easily add it to his other works, such as &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, as well as works by William Gibson such as &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Virtual Light&quot;, and so on right up to newer authors of cyberpunk and high-tech in titles such as &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. Each of these titles are great in their own right and a true science fiction collector should get them all."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really wanted to like this book but I think I went into it expecting to much. Although the story is really good (I read the whole book in one sitting)it comes across as being kind of juvenille. I don't mean that in a bad way it just seems like this book is aimed at a certain target market: teenage hacker wanna-be's into the Matrix and Nine Inch Nails. Snow Crash is a fun book but unless you fall into the target audience you probably will be a little let down, like I was. If it matters I am a Network Technician with experience in Unix and Linux, I have been devouring Bill Gibsons masterful works since I was a teenager. I love &quot;cyber-&quot; stuff; but Snow Crash just seems to target the high-school crowd."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really did not like this book very mcuh, but I can see why it would be popular and why some readers love it (most of them that probably read it) and others hate it. Basicaly the book is very futuristic or at least a vision of the future. The main character of the story is Hiro Protagonist, who delivers pizzas for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra and is a computer hacker in his spare time. He's basically your looser pizza boy who spends time hacking and skateboarding. The story is set in LA and the Unisted States is run by the mafia and pwople are being affected by some new drug called snow crash, where the story gets it's name. Basically snow drug is a computer virus, but not only does it wreck hackers' minds, but they basically can't do hacking because they don't think straight and they talk in gibberish. Anyway Hiro's best friend and mentor comes down with the virus and Hiro's off to save and protect the world from the mafia. I simply don't like this kind of writing and story. The writing to me seems to be very unfocused and therefore isn't very good. Stephenson does write some incredible stuff in this book, but it's not consistent. It's almost like he put a lot of time and effort into writing certain aspects of the story, but not everything. The beginning I thought was strong and I enjoyed it, but after a 100 pages I was gone and I really didn't enjoy very much after that point. The story may have been fresh in '92, but I've seen too many things that are similar for my taste. It really reminded me of japanamation. Usually when I read a book I have an image of the characters, bt the characters weren't real to me. I sat there reading the book and I saw a bunch of cartoons running around. It was just annoying because I knew the characters weren't real. I basically thought the story was a long script for a japanamation movie. On the positive side, there are a lot of people out there that like this kind of stuff, and although I don't and don't know about it I think people that are into science fiction and japanimation would really enjoy this story. I haven't seen a whole, but have seen enough to know what it's about and I think this has the same kind of jist. In closing I'm sure most people that have read this book enjoyed it because fans of this genre of books like stuff like this, it seems to have a lot of common elements of stories that are similar, if fact the date of the book indicates to me that it may have somewhat have been innovative. Someone like me who just doesn't enjoy works like this and it doesn't do anything for us should stay away. I would suggest the story to someone into science fiction, but not someone like me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"the master at over-researched, wouldn't-know-a-good-line-of-prose-if-it-bit-him,cyberjunk,slop.

Stephenson's pacing swings wildly and disconcertingly, from breakneck speed during chase scenes, to inexplicable lulls while characters float in life rafts for days at a time, to painfully tedious passages (entire chapters) devoted to a computerized librarian's history lectures. None of the characters are well-realized, their relationships are arbitrary and trivial, and the technology varies from very-near-future (slow, unrealistic, unreliable, shared VR universes) to far-future (nuclear-powered cybernetic guard dogs that run at 700 kph). The first third of the book is exciting, fun, and gripping; the middle third is overwhelmingly dull and tedious; and the final third is confusing and rushed, with a sudden and unsatisfying conclusion. I would not recommend this book, particularly not to someone new to the cyberpunk genre, lest they get the wrong impression and shun talented authors like William Gibson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A book I had to struggle to finish. I gave it a 3 because parts of it were funny, but the book, as a whole, is overrated. Cyberpunk is getting really boring -- it seems like a bunch of people who use the net got together to churn out a bunch of books with the same scenario."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Entertaining? Yes. Wildly creative and imaginative? No question. Flawed? Sadly yes, and fatally.Read this as a carnival ride and you won't be disappointed, but think about it very much, or slow down long enough to consider what's being flipped at you, and you'll find it terribly dissatisfying in several ways.Firstly, I am intolerant of authors that end the story at the very climax, as if saying, 'well, you can figure out from here the rest of what happens.' Sure I probably can, but if I gotta write my own epilog, why did I bother letting you tell the rest of it?Nextly, I am offended at gratuitous eroticism. Sure, sexuality is a part of human existence, but so are many other human functions that don't contribute to a story. And am I really supposed to enjoy the romanticized telling of the rape of a 15 year old skateboarder by a mutant muscleman? Why is there no outcry against this?Also, can't our character development be a little less contrived, a little deeper? How many times must I be reminded that our Hiro is the best swordsman in both worlds? Must all the cardboard supporting characters continually gush about how 'bad' or 'cool' he is?Sure it's a hard-boiled 'gumshoe' novel, but that doesn't excuse it from being a novel, with satisfying endings, tied off loose ends, free of adolescent titillations, and real characters.And all the Sumerian myth stuff, though interesting in itself, was kind of just chopped up and dumped into a pot and mixed up with all kinds of other unrelated things (neurolingual programming, machine code, speaking in toungues, even herpes virus). That works to make a green salad, but not a credible theory of the development of human communication.So promising in the beginning. I can't believe I read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My favorite book from my favorite writer. The cyberpunk lovers can't let this one pass by. Neal Stephenson at his best."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of the few books I have read multiple times for entertainment and it entertains every time. Gotta love the skateboards."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is the second time I've read Stephenson, and the second time I've been quite enthused about the first half of the book only to set it aside.My problems with it: the futuristic America presented is not explained, nor is it plausible for the world to have changed so much in so short a time. The idea of \\"corporations\\" running everything is also contrary to the way our world is unfolding, so I don't know if that was some kind of anti-capitalist statement or what. There's certainly quite a few Politically Correct salutes here and there against \\"racism\\" and \\"sexism\\" ... I'm really looking forward to reading a novel that doesn't beat me over the head with that preachy crap, guess I'll keep waiting.Anyway the story itself: I overlooked the above, noting when it was written, and enjoyed the cartoonish/comic book flavour of Hiro, The Raven, and the mysterious \\"drug\\" snow crash. Where it lost me was with the long-winded historical explanations ... I mean pages and pages of it, complete reader disconnect here ... am I supposed to memorize all of this? And all this explanation lumped in kind of artlessly too ... oh thank God, a new chapter, some action, the story moves on ... except, now we cut back to Hiro for YET MORE of these clunky explanations ... zzzzz ... Lost me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is an awesome, sci-fi, thriller which is more about today than the future. The hero (his name is Hiro) is a lively character as is everyone else in this book. I don't usually enjoy science fiction but this book was a big exception and came highly recommended to me by many friends. I am sure this will be made into a major movie."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you're a computer geek, computer geek-wannabe, or in any way interested in the 'cyber-culture' which has grown up around the Internet, this book is a must read. It takes a good idea (Gibson's _Neuromancer_ novels) and improves on it by spending as much time investigating the society in meatspace as it does cyberspace. The result is an entertaining novel which shows how both worlds interact with and change each other. The plot revolves around a drug called Snow Crash which is available both in Virtual and Real reality. After one of his friends becomes infected by this 'drug', Hero Protagonist and his skate-boarding female sidekick (if only I could find a girl like this...) must investigate who is behind this whole scheme and stop the onrushing Infopocalypse. Along the way they meet an assortment of memorable characters: a psychotic Aleut who uses razor-sharp glass knives to gut his opponents and carries a live nuclear weapon in the sidecar of his motorcycle, a cybernetic dog that can run at Mach2, a Mafia Godfather/Pizza Mogul with a penchant for straight razors, and a quadraplegic war vet who's wheelchair doubles as a tank. The settings range from the city-states of ancient Sumer to Virtual Reality libraries to a huge surplus aircraft carrier/refugee ship in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I swear I'm not making this up! Simply put, this is the most entertaining and thought provoking book I've read in years. If you liked Gibson's books, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I always thought that there could not be an author how could peak me wierd intrest, but Neal did it. This book is awsome. I loved the stroy line and the underlined message in the book. I could not put it down for three days! No book ever had that effect on me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Anyone willing to name the main character of his novel Hiro Protagonist [Hiro is not a misspelling as was suggested below] certainly catches my attention.In Snow Crash, Stephenson manages to mix action with rather dry discussions of the bible and Sumerian history with relative ease--no mean feat, I would contend. The characters could have been developed in more detail, though they reveal themselves through their actions rather completely. In this way, it's somewhat reminiscient of The Three Muskateers--the natures of Athos, Porthos and Aramis aren't discussed in very much detail at all, yet through the narrative Dumas *shows* us what kind of people they are.The story here is fairly complex, but the author keeps the action interesting and the characters engaging. The balance between the technological and what I can only describe as the spiritual is very reminiscient of Gibson's Neuromancer.If I could give half stars, this one would be a 4.5--not the best book I've ever read, but absolutely one of the best in its genre. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Fantastic book. I enjoyed the &quot;comic-book&quot; like action with the added plus of being one of the definitive first works of cyber-punk fiction. Great pace all the way through the book. When I finished, all I could think was &quot;damn, it's over&quot;. Loved the name &quot;Hiro Protaganist&quot;, and all the other literary &quot;easter-eggs&quot;. Buy it, Read it. Seriously, No Regrets."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In this novel (about the fifth or sixth cyberpunk novel I've read), I was really taken with the way Stephenson made the corporate states so pervasive. Of course, powerful corporations are at the heart of most cyberpunk novels, but here they completely take the place of nations (well, almost). I also enjoyed the humor apparent in the novel - I mean, really, the main good guy is named Hiro Protagonist! And the image of the Mafia Pizza guy in my mind is just too funny. You want pepperoni with that? Forget about it!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson has written the jewel of all science fiction books with this one. I had to study for finals last week and still managed to kill the book in ten days. I've read quite a bit of sci-fi, and Stephenson's book is the best around. I think the story is much better than Neuromancer, while the book as a whole might not be as revolutionary. What makes it better is that Stephenson is one of the funniest sci-fi authors I've ever encoutered. I'm reading Cryptonomicon right now and can't get through three pages without erupting with laughter. READ BOTH!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I haven't read a ton of books but this one was definitely one of the best I've read so far. I recommend it if you are into sci-fi and have a good imagination. I guess I liked this book a lot because I'm a software developer, so I like to think I'm like the main character (Hiro) hee hee."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The opening pages say it all. Follow the adventures of the best-named character ever: Hiro Protagonist, the Deliverator.In a world where governments have given way to suburban enclaves (burb clave) where you buy your citizenship, and pay your dues to belong to a organization anywhere in the world. Hiro Protagonist battles his way through an adventure that would be amazing no matter where it was set.Reading a Neal Stephenson book is an amazing experience. First and most important, the stories and characters are great. But sometimes, you'll be reading along, and he'll hit you with a turn of phrase, or description that will stop you in your tracks.Neal Stephenson writes books for people that love to read the way some directors make movies for people that love movies.From \\"Snow Crash\\":\\"There are only four things we do better than anyone elsemusicmoviesmicrocode (software)high-speed pizza delivery\\"\\"The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in thirty minutes or you can have it free, shoot the driver, take his car, file a class-action suit.\\"He has a battery powered needle gun that can vaporize a Louisville Slugger, leaving his assailant holding a smoldering toothpick. Instead, the Deliverator prefers a matched set of samurai swords. Punks weren't afraid of the gun, so he was forced to use it. Swords need no demonstrations.And all of this was just up to page three. Most books don't have this much cool in the entire book. Page three. Wow."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson exaggerates American culture to the point where everything (even cities), is owned by huge franchises. A multi-form virus threatens to wipe out the information age. Fun reading if you're into computer programming and the internet. Complaints: twists ancient history quite a bit (hard to tell what's real and what's fictional/apocryphal), and has a little too much reference to sex."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"was such a great book for its time. That's not to say it's not still a great book. It is. But when I first read it, it blew me away, and it shows how great Stephenson is. If you like this, I recommend Cryptonomicon, which is very different but super cool, too."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Prepare yourself for a future of computer geek pizza delivey martial arts swords masters, jet powered skateboards, monstrous men, robot dogs and TV drones! And watch out for staggering examples of modern cultural criticism!In Snow Crash, Neil Stephenson proves his inexplicable ability to tell great stories. Not only will you want to keep reading rather than eat, sleep or go to work, but I'm guessing you will find yourself surprised by the quality of this book's writing. Its not a masterpiece, but for sci-fi it is very well composed. And you thought you were too intellectual for sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My first book by Neal Stephenson was Cryptonomicron (outstanding) so I had high expecatations for this, even though it was written earlier. I have to say I was about 90% satisfied. It is a great techno type novel and I really enjoyed it. Once I got about 1/2 into it, I really didn't want to put it down. My reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5 was that I don't think it was as good overall as Cryto, just didn't seem as refined and tight as that novel was. However, again if you liked Crypto you won't be disappointed, but if you thought that novel was only so-so, you might have a hard time with this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've never read a cyber punk novel in my life. If they are all like this one though, I should pick up some more.This was entertaining, well thought out, funny and had a lesson for our life in it.I loved it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of my favorite books of the last five years. Fun cyber-punk. Welcome to the urban dystopia that is Los Angeles of the near-future, where the divisions of today have resulted in a mad patchwork society. Appealing characters, a good sense of humor and satire, and fast-paced non-stop action. You'll never feel the same way about pizza delivery again after reading &quot;Snow Crash&quot;"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The first third of the book sweeps the reader off his feet, with the pacy careless style of narration the author conjures up a flashy \\"gizmotic\\" but hilariously identifiable picture of a not so distant futuristic (American) society, which is fragmented in all senses. The biggest achievement here is, obviously, the concept of 'metaverse', and one should recall the the general scenario of the internet in 1992 (when the book was finished) to really appreciate the author's run of imagination. The middle portion of the book explores the advent of occidental concept of religion in a refreshing manner, which succeeds in widening the scope of the book, giving it some pseudo scholarly touch. Although it suffers from being pretty minuscule throughout, the plot thickens during this part of the narration. Here the author's achievement lies in developing the parallelism between software and biological virus, both converging into a single entity inside the human body, the most complicated creation of the universe (as far the knowledge stands now!!!). But the last third portion of the book is disappointing, in the sense of being predicatable in the lines of numerous thrillers being written and filmed which follow a general formula churned out by the publishing houses and the movie companies. The freshness of the first two-thirds is lost, as if the book turns into a product to be marketed according to very stringent customer sartisfaction regulation based on past records, the story line more or less guided by the editors of the publishing house not ready to take unnecessary risk. Overall, definitely a very good read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Twisted and manic, with a touch of spookiness, Snow Crash is a white-knuckle ride through cyberpunk, post-punk, cryptography, and ancient history. This may well be one of the 50 best SF books ever written. Indeed, how can a book whose main character is named &quot;Hiro Protagonist&quot; _not_ fail to utterly amuse?In many ways, Snow Crash is a biting, satirical take on society. The typical cyberpunk libertarian streak has grabbed Stephenson: the Federal government is reduced to a hyper-paranoid enclave called &quot;Fedworld&quot;; giant corporations battle each other over efficiency and speed in pizza-delivery services; competing superhighways are built to cater to the discriminating driver; and gated neighborhoods with private police abound. Frightening for some, inspiring for others -- Stephenson sees the future, and it ain't pretty.The denoument of the book is too incredible for description; and, besides, doing so would be a definite spoiler.If you cut your teeth on William Gibson and grew up with Bruce Sterling, you should by all means turn to Neil Stephenson. Your brain will thank you, once it's finished spinning."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"i first picked up this book when i found it in a package with a game i bought called Spectre VR. i couldn't figure out why my Mac video game came with a book...until i read it.i couldn't put this book down. very cool. great characters with a nice twisty plot that slowly unravels itself. weaving cyberpunk tech knowledge in with philisophical theories and tie them together in an awesome climax...true genius.since i read this book (and re-read about half a dozen times at least) i've read many more stephenson books and i still come back to this one. a great way to pique your interest in stephenson's writing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I don't even know how to begin this review. This was the first work of Neil Stephenson I read and it absolutely compelled me to buy his entire collection of works - Even those labelled 'sociology and business' on the back cover ;).This is an absolute must read for anyone with a computer background or a lust for speculative fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"How should I say this? I'm a big fan of cyberpunk...a BIG fan. I love Gibson's work. I find Sterling a bit preachy, yet a very thought-provoking read. I like Cadigan, Shirley, Rucker, Maddox...But I'm not a big fan of Stephenson.Now, on the surface, Snow Crash has all the glossy coolness of cyberpunk, but that's just not what cyberpunk is about. Cyberpunk is beyond the glossy coolness...that's just a method to get people to read it. Cyberpunk is about the role of the individual in a world where not only is the individual being replaced by corporations (which have taken a life of their own) but the individual is also plastic...a world where one can change themselves both phyically and mentally (think the cybernetics of characters such as Molly or the cut-out chips in the puppet whorehouses of Gibson's Sprawl).Snow Crash is none of that.Only two aspects of this novel ar \\"cyberpunk.\\" One is the Balkanizaton and franchisation of nations, and the second is Raven.The end of the world plot is trite and derived. The exposition of the plot almost entirely through the Librarian daemon is, well, lame, and Hiro's ability to do anything and everything in the Metaverse is an insult to the minds of both the reader and the author.Now, Snow Crash is funy...I was laughing straight through it. It's entertaining; I read it within 24 hours of picking it up. The writing style (third person present tense) is a little hard to follow, but it grows on you.In other words, this is quite an entertaining book. It's hip, it's stylish, it's fast-paced. Snow Crash is to true cyberpunk like modern \\"punk\\" bands are to the Clash, Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Dead Kennedys. It's glitzed over attitude made for mass consumption but it just doesn't have the same depth."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Yes, the plot falls apart. And the characters aren't multi-dimensional. But I laughed out loud at many points, something I don't often do when reading anything, particularly SF. The memo from the Feds about the proper paper to use in the bathroom (not hyperinflated currency), plus the memo about the proper way to read the memo, was a howler.It'll be interesting to see if this makes a fun movie, or ends up being as bad as Johnny Mnemonic--just don't let the director take it too seriously!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The first few pages of the book almost prompted me to put it down -- personally, I don't care about a Mob-owned pizza delivery service. Once I got past that, however, the book really picked up speed. I feel that it was well-written and everyday I looked forward to reading more about what was going on in the world of the metaverse. While the book is a lot of science fiction, much of it seems very close to reality."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I think Snow Crash was awful as a novel, but individual vignettes from the book are far better than anything else I have read in a long, long time.Normally I detest books labelled as &quot;cyberpunk&quot; (I guess I'm from the old school... Heinlein, Williamson, Bester etc.) but the book starts so wonderfully that I had incredibly high hopes for the story. I even enjoyed the exposition in the middle unlike many of the other reviewers. My problem with the book is that there is so little plot that the climax and ending are largely meaningless. In the small, Stephenson coins wonderful phrases and shows us incredibly well painted satire. Unfortunately, plot development and characterization seems to take a back seat to gee-whiz imagery. Also, the &quot;ideas per page&quot; coefficient (which sustains the book for me) seems to fall of markedly towards the end.In summary, Stephenson blenders together a lot of elements and ideas that are individually a lot of fun and very interesting, but maybe he should have written a bunch of short stories instead of a not-very-well-integrated novel. I'm giving it five stars because I had a hell of a lot of fun reading this book even though I thought it didn't hang together as a story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was presented to me as the &quot;Bible of Silicon Valley&quot;. After reading the book I tend to agree with that assessment - some of the technology concepts are about as old as the bible. Granted, this book was originally published a few years ago and technology has made great strides since then, but if you're looking for new information technology insight - look again. What added a few stars to this book's review are the author's unique vision of a future society and the many humorous &quot;one-liners&quot;.The plot (along with the characters) is simple but has a tendency to become weighted-down with a lot of useless techno-babble and a history(?) lesson concerning Sumerians. If you buy this book, don't buy it for the plot."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I tend to be a rather picky reader, and I can't stand poorly-written science fiction. There are a few gems out there. I love the subtlety (I didn't notice the play on words in the main character's name 'til nearly the end), the sense of humor, and the fact that the constructed world view didn't seem constructed; the book had a very down-to-earth, 'that's the way it is, period' outlook. The only problem I had with this book, and it wasn't enough to drop from 5 stars, was...what happened to Da5id?? Even a hokey 'happily-ever-after' would've sufficed in that respect. Ah well, over all an excellent book. I've just started Diamond Age..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephensen portrays the future of Info Tech as few can. While his picture of America's future is somewhat fantastic, his view of cyberspace to come is, I feel, very close to the mark. A must read for anyone interested in computers/the future."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hilarious, tense, thought-provoking. I don't read a lot of fiction, and when I pick up an SF novel, I'll put it back down if it's not engaging. I didn't put this one down except to eat, go to the bathroom and sleep (three hours after I usually turn in). This will be a hard act to follow."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The opening of this book is among the best cyber-fiction I've ever read.As the story progressed it continued to amaze me with it's blend of interesting characters, interpolation of modern technology into the future and historical references.I can only hope that Neal has another work of this caliber in his future."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This one goes into my sci-fi top ten! It's funny, and filled with action and thought to make it a must-read! Get it quick!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I had great expectation before reading this book, and it didn't disappoint me at all. The characters are very well taken care of, and the way Stephenson imagines the future of Northern America is just as funny as it can be - the Mafia delivering pizzas and protecting neighbourhoods? I really had moments of laughter while reading it. Furthermore, there are characters in the book I found particulary amusing - the Rat Things - it's amazing how Stephenson vaulted into the minds of those &quot;cyberdogs&quot; and described their thoughts and acts - very cute! Also, through the book it is obvious that the writer has got quite some knowledge about computers (coding in particular) - and I myself, being a programmer, found the Metaverse (cyberspace) and all its features quite believable (more than Gibson's cyberspace, although I love his work as well), as well as amusing. What's more, I understand that some people find the Sumerian-mythology in the book somewhat inappropriate or boring, but I think it makes the book much better, giving it the opportunity to show an original and very amusing theory of how we have become like we are now. I recommend this book not only to science fiction fans but to everyone."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson's \\"Snow Crash\\" is one of the classic books about near future. How silly does that sound? I'll start over!Most science fiction ever written had had two major problems: it was either written for teenagers (and I never understood the whole concept of teen literature anyway) or it's stunningly cheesy. After all why does a wizard living in a huge steel tower on a space platform need a sword if all the monsters around him use plasma rifles? Anyway, this is the reason I never liked Sci-Fi.Snow crash in one of the books that completely violates all the ridiculous assumptions about what a sci-fi reader needs. This book is about the future of America, where everything (including the government) is a franchise, the music is dark and loud, there are no good guys and bad guys, technology drives the society as the information age had evolved into a new bizzare form of informational warfare medium, the world had been economically globalized and economy broke into pieces, federal laws had been abandoned for local, and hackers program computers in binary code and humans in binary religion.The epic feel of technocracy overlapping with theocracy, beautiful language mastery of the author, complete absence of good guys whatsoever, crazy dynamics of the book, the hip and cool feel of every character, exaggerated aspects of ridiculous lives we are living today, and the smile on your face when Stephenson leaves out all the phony action scenes by simply saying \\"and then there's a chase scene\\".A great read for someone who could never imagine themselves reading sci-fi."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My computer science professor recommended this book. I'm halfway through It and It's wonderful so far. I recommend reading it if you are a computer geek or just a regular person =]."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Recently I was reading something or other and came across an essay on George Elliot's novel \\"Daniel Deronda.\\" In this essay it was noted that most scholars believe that that particular novel never lives up to its opening scene. I have never read \\"Daniel Deronda\\" because I had never heard of it because 17th century English lit isn't exactly where my interest lies.Upon reading that assessment however, I felt that you could lift that passage up, substitute \\"Snow Crash\\" in where \\"Daniel Deronda\\" is and you'd have a fairly good review of this novel.The opening chapter of \\"Snow Crash\\" is incredible. It is exciting, prophetic, funny... mostly FUNNY. After reading chapter 1 you will (mistakenly) think that the rest of the book will be the most awesome book you ever read. Do not be fooled. I am not saying the rest of the book is bad, far from it, it just doesn't um.. POP! I would have been very happy to see Chapter 1 as a short story, it would have been just as effective as the whole novel.That being said however, the effect of having a balls to the wall action scene (as every James Bond fan can attest) makes sure that you stick around long enough to tell you what the author is really thinking about. In this case I don't think Stephenson sat down to write a novel about A pizza delivery, he wanted to work out his ideas about Sumerian culture and what he thought the internet might evolve into.As to what the internet might evolve into, Anyone who has played Second Life or any similar themed games knows that the Metaverse is not far away, if it's not already here. Whether \\"Snow Crash\\" was a prophetic novel or a novel that caused the internet to become what it is is a question I leave for the historians, but it is worth chewing over in your mind for a while at least.One thing I really missed in this book (as well as all cyberpunk novels and stories I've ever read) is the idea that there probably be more than one Metaverse. This may seem silly, but where there's Windows, there's Linux and Mac OS, so why, in every story I read is there only one Metaverse? It seems to be a conceit in Cyberpunk, but in a book as rich as \\"Snow Crash\\" with so many factions with so many agendas it just seems that that there would be parallel Metaverses where each faction could make the rules.Lastly, I'd like to just mention in passing how influential this book actually is. I find it amazing just how many things this book has ended up being mixed up in. For example, I recently became a fan of the show Heroes and for the LIFE of me I can never remember what the little Japanese dude with the samurai sword's last name is because I just call him Hiro Protagonist. There are other examples, recently I've even seen Burbclaves starting to develop.So if you are a fan of Cyberpunk, SF, Sumerian culture and or literature, give this one a try. Whatever I personally think of it, it is a landmark novel and, despite not living up to that first chapter, is still a fun and exciting read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Others have recapped the book so I won't duplicate their work here. I will say that this book was a hell of a lot of fun. I had trouble putting it down and was sorry when it ended.The dystopian future setting was inventive and typically bleak yet funny and unusual enough to allow the irony to seep through. The characters are quite likable - \\"Hiro Protagonist\\" might be the best character name I've ever heard.I can't say enough good things about this book. Give it a shot, if you're into sci fi or action movies or technology at all it'll be worth your while."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a fantastic book, with Stephenson's usual thought provoking teaching mixed in.Highly recommended to everyone."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a cyberpunk science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson, originally published in 1992. It involves virtual reality and computer science, religion (particularly ancient Mesopotamian religions, Sumerian in particular), linguistics, and philosophy.Stephenson writes in the present tense, a technique that is typically annoying and inferior, but which Stephenson pulls off reasonably well. This is not to say, however, that Snow Crash would not have been better served by being written in the standard past tense. It's close.The world Stephenson has created is vivid and interesting. Society has degenerated into anarcho-capitalism; virtually every aspect of government has been relegated to the private sector. Elements of Stephenson's Metaverse are present in today's internet. Stephenson holds the reader's interest with his colorful characters, including his main character, the sword-wielding hacker Hiro Protagonist.A cast of interesting people doing interesting things is, ultimately, enough to carry the book, which is good, because Stephenson's take on philosophy, religion and linguistics falls flat. Stephenson obviously did a lot of research, which he presents as page after page of lecture from the Librarian character. He's gotten some things fundamentally wrong, however, most notably the development of early Christianity. And his concept of a real-life virus as code is downright silly.Ultimately, Snow Crash is seriously flawed, but well worth reading."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"First, let me say that this book has the best first chapter of any book that I have ever read. After you read that chapter, it goes down slightly in quality.Perhaps Mr. Stephenson rewrote that chapter again and again, or perhaps he wrote it for something else. Regardless, it HUMS. And it feels different from the rest of the story. Darker, more dangerous, just as satirical, but not quite as funny.Past that, though, the story hardly breaks down. It is entertaining throughout, very amusing in most places, and harbors characters that I will probably never forget. I had previously read a single Neal Stephenson book (The Big U), which I also loved. Every time I see one of his new books come out, I have the feeling that I should buy it. (I had this same feeling with Murakami's Kafka on the Shore, and Kazuo Iguro's Never Let Me Go...now adays, I simply listen to that little voice, obviously).The story never gets bad, it is entertaining throughout, the characters are original and interesting, so why not five stars? Well, two reasons. First, I don't think that any of the characters develop, at all, in the course of the book. Things happen, people die, and no one changes. Not something that I ordinarily like to give five stars to. Second, while it is terribly fun, it is not terribly relevant. There is nothing here that made me think, \\"Hrmmm...\\" in the realms of personal thought or thoughts of import. Again, not something that I like to give five stars to. If I could, I would, also, give it four and a half stars. If only Amazon would give us ten stars to use!!!I read this book, enjoyed it, and discovered why it is on Time's list of the 100 Best Books in English since 1923 - Because it is good! So, I will be lending it, recommending it, and reading it again. It's definitely worth picking up.B+Harkius"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've read this book at least a dozen times. Quick whit, parallel storylines. It reads like a movie, or a graphic novel (as it was originally intended)If you're into SciFi with a cyber twist, this is a must read"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is the only science fiction novel that I'd recommend to anyone. It stands on its creativity, literacy, and wicked humor. It's complex, engaging, and just plain cool. Perhaps it's not high art, but it's certainly highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What an excellent book! I read this several years ago when I was still a high school student; I've read it at least four times since then. Every time I read it, I discover something new. There are a lot of issues approached in this book. It really is a gift that keeps on giving."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Really, what is there to say? This is one of the single coolest books I have ever read. It's also the only book that reads like something that was once a japanimation movie! Anyone who reads it and does not agree after getting through the Deliverator sequence at the beginning should check your pulse, as you're probably not amongst the living any more.The characters are fresh. Each is a very distinct person. The sense of humour exhibited by the writer throughout the book, and especially in the creation of the world, is outstanding! This is best realized in the character of the skateboarding courier Y.T. who often acts as narrator for most of the physical layout. The other main character, Hiro Protagonist, serves as the social balance, giving the reader a window into the Matrix, this world's version of Gibson's cyberspace. The villain Raven is also nicely drawn, given an interesting past and a kind heart for young girls; it goes great with his killer instinct and mercenary nature.Where this books shines is that almost none of the technology featured in it is really outlandish. From the full suit, portable computers, to Y.T.'s skateboard with the self adjusting wheels, nothing seems extraordinary. The terminology used when describing the functions of The Matrix are consistent with real computer terms in regards to what they do and how they're used. This is one of the few books to use hacker in its original, correct form!Literally the only complaint that I have with it is that Stephenson's ending neglects to tie up completely a lot of loose ends. The good part with that is that there just may be a sequel at some point in the future! Now that I look greatly forward to! :)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has written an entertaining novel whose thought-provoking ideas are matched only by its eclectic cast of characters. Focusing on the idea of knowledge and the dissemination of knowledge through computer technology, the basic premise of Snow Crash is that of the protagonist (named Hiro Protagonist, no less) and his young partner, Y.T. (Yours Truly, which she wouldn't bother to tell you unless it was in the form of a sarcastic remark), thwarting an intended infocalypse with a little help from the Mafia and some other unusual allies. Along the way, the reader is given a good look at a future that may not be so far away: one dominated by computer technology and paralleled by a virtual reality that might question exactly what constitutes reality, and private franchises which rule in the place of governments. Stephenson has a flair for vivid description of a world just strange enough to be innovative and intriguing, yet familiar enough that we can see its basis very firmly rooted in our own. Despite the outlandish nature of both Snow Crash's characters and setting, basic principles are the same: there is the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, those who survive and those who do not; the difference between the two is that of information.However, despite all these assets, Snow Crash is little more than light entertainment. The lofty ideas which Stephenson explores in his book seem to be beyond his firm comprehension, and discussions of Babel, Sumerian myth and other archaeological finds are dry and arcane, detracting from an otherwise vibrant and fast-paced plot. Almost all relevant information about the technical aspects of Snow Crash is revealed in the form of cryptic dialogue between Hiro and a computer-generated librarian, discussions that sound more like encyclopedia recitations than believable (or understandable) dialogue. I found myself glossing over these portions of the book without any real effect on my understanding of the plot; in the end it still comes out to the same thing: the bad guys have a dangerous weapon, and the good guys have to stop them. The details about Sumer and the fall of man are interesting, but not portrayed in a form that lends itself to any quick grasp of ideas that can be retained after the book is done. However, for those willing to take the time to read and reread a fourth time, Stephenson poses some interesting ideas to ponder.The characters in Snow Crash never leave the reader a moment to rest from the excitement they provide. Outrageous events happen one after another, and the calm manner in which they face everything from kidnapping and murder to the possibility of destruction of society and the world as they know it provides a great deal of amusement and curiosity about what they might do next. However, despite a plot that hurtles itself ever forward and drags the reader along, forced to either keep up or drop along the way, I found the ending both disappointing and deflating. Hiro and Y.T. save the world, of course, but then Hiro just drops out of the story altogether and Y.T. appears to transform from a rebellious and wild Kourier into mommy's little girl for little other reason than to provide some kind of ending. I would have liked at least for some kind of epilogue, if not a totally different ending altogether. In reading the last few pages, it seemed that Stephenson rushes to tie up all the loose ends of the story in any way possible - any way possible often equating to dull, bland, and unsuitable when compared to other parts of the book. After such a well-written novel containing such interesting characters and a world whose details must be read to be believed, I was hugely disappointed by the conclusion to say the least. However, Stephenson does tell an interesting tale and has great potential; his best work is yet to come."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Our &quot;Hiro&quot; (sic) is an underachieving superman able to do anything and everything but with no desire to do anything. The author tries to tie in Sumerian superstition with the bible, and relates everything as a computer virus. The characters develop relationships amongst each other not because they should but because he needs it to further the plot. The primary characters are two-dimensional and the rest are one-dimensional. The technology side is a reasonable projection into the future from where we are. The rest is junk."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a Kindle review. Plenty of reviews for the book itself exist, so this is to help those interested in the Kindle version.Summary: Fair warning that this version cannot be lent out to friends! But if you don't care and want to read Snow Crash on the Kindle, this is a faithful translation, meaning nothing was lost from paper to digital. Whether you love the book or you're visiting it for the first time, if you're considering the digital version, rest assured it's good.Longer Review: At $9.99, the Kindle version is cheaper than new paperback (though cheaper used paper versions exist). I borrowed the book from a friend years back and wanted a personal copy. Since this was cheapest and accessible on-demand on my digital devices (Kindle for iPad, PC, Fire, etc.), I went digital. However, I did want to lend it out to spread the Snow Crash love, only to discover you cannot lend.Having bought poor Kindle paper-to-digital translations, I was afraid Snow Crash was in the same boat (or flotilla). It's not. All text is there, with some additional (standard) features:BookmarksFont ChangesText SearchBook ExtrasPopular HighlightsSkip to Page/LocationAnnotationsetc.\\"Book Extras\\" contain an unfinished glossary of characters, organizations, locations, quotes, etc. but is so sparse on data that it's not worthwhile.Note: To me, \\"Popular Highlights\\" is an extremely annoying Amazon default that's not unique to Snow Crash, but you can turn it off. Go to your Kindle home page, click on the circular \\"i\\" icon for your Menu, click on Settings, then find \\"Popular Highlights\\" and click it off. This will apply to all of your Kindle books.In short, whether you love the book or you're visiting it for the first time, if you're considering the digital version but aren't sure about its quality, rest assured this is good.I'm happy to answer any questions. Let me know how I can make this more helpful."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I like the style and story...this is way better than anything William Gibson ever did. My only beef if the sex scene with a 15 year old...I like sex scenes just fine, but why did the girl have to be 15 years old? Seemed kind of inappropriate so I had a hard time enjoying it like I would have if she was 18. As far as I could tell, there was no plot line necessitating that she be that particular age."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A visionary work which popularized the term \\"Avatar\\" and foresaw Google Earth. Also quite humorous (Mafia pizza franchises, the main character's name, etc). However, the Sumerian background mythos is so contrived that it requires endless expository dialogue. Huge swaths of the book therefore read like an essay. Worth finishing, but not starting: the characters and action were interesting enough to push me on to the end, but overall I recommend spending the time on another book entirely (try Daniel Suarez's The Daemon for a more modern and coherent work in the same genre)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a pretty entertaining read, especially for the gadget-oriented. There is a lot of fun computer hacking, sword fights, and explosions, and the characters are pretty well developed.The backstory behind the main antagonist is unique; the author weaves ancient Sumerian mythology with Human physiology to create a sort of computer language of the human mind. It's interesting, but I think the time Hiro (the main character) spends in the library studying Sumerian lore should have been condensed. The book otherwise has a very good pace.Snow Crash is mostly an external adventure. What I mean is, the main characters don't do a lot of growing throughout the book. They pretty much are who they are, and they're out to get the bad guy. It's like watching a good action flick. That's why I gave it 3 rather than 5 stars. For me, the development and conclusion of the anagnorisis, that 'ah-ha' moment, is most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a subversive, postmodern romp through a world defined by computers, religious fanaticism, commercialism, and near-anarchy. Hacker Hiro Protagonist delivers pizzas for a living for the now-respectable Mafia until a mishap unites him with a fifteen-year old, futuristic skateboarder named Y.T. Hiro falls back on what he knows best -- hacking and gathering intelligence that he can sell to the former C.I.A., now a private corporation -- with Y.T. as his eyes. When his friend and former business partner Da5id opens a mysterious hypercard/drug called Snow Crash and becomes instantly catatonic, Hiro realizes the danger: all hackers, this new world's most valuable resource, are vulnerable. He sets out to stop the malicious forces that threaten to reduce the population to a babbling, unthinking mass. As Hiro and Y.T. make their way toward the deadly Raven, an Aleut armed with glass knives and a nuclear bomb, and L. Bob Rife, a New Age cult leader (a send-up of L. Ron Hubbard) at the center of a flotilla of rafts and refugees afloat in the Pacific, they uncover the \\"truth\\" about viruses, language, computers, mythology, and the core of the human brain.The most amazing aspect of this novel is Stephenson's ability to imagine in 1992 (really, before that, since that's the year it was published) what today's world has become; the cultural satire and commentary in Snow Crash has become more relevant today with the internet/World Wide Web, privatization, dependence on computers, policy-shaping religious leaders, Second Life, and a global economy. Although Stephenson's parallels between computers and the human brain are not new, what he suggests, that our DNA contains an informational/language virus based in our Sumerian roots, is both weirdly original and thought-provoking. His revision of mythology and religion (here, both language and religion are viruses) is rooted in research and then takes off in improbable but intriguing directions. Like Ishmael Reed'sMumbo Jumbo, this novel connects religion from multiple cultures, from ancient times to the present, to form the heart of a conspiracy.Except for the sections detailing Sumerian mythology and history, this novel moves forward at a brisk pace, with both humor and suspense. For another cyberpunk novel, the first, see William Gibson'sNeuromancer."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book starts off great, but about 70% of the way through it just went flat for me. There was way, way too much tedious description of all kinds of tangential stuff, a lot of it really boring, as if the author were describing the movie he was envisioning the book would become someday. The characters never really develop that much, and the story just starts to drag. That's just my opinion. I know millions would disagree. As Y.T. would say, Whatever."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CostaNostra Pizza, Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince.\\" This book jacket intro does not begin to do justice to the tour de force of sheer originality, silliness, and fun that Stephenson shares with us in \\"Snow Crash\\". The first chapter, alone, is worth the price of admission as we follow Hiro on a death-defying pizza delivery, in which he risks everything and leaves Dirty Harry sounding like a first rate wimp. It also may leave you laughing so hard you can't quite get a breath in - which is what happened to me.\\"Snow Crash\\" was my first introduction to Neal Stephenson's bizarre blend of science fiction and adventure, and while I did not close the book on its last page feeling entirely fulfilled, I did close it feeling as though I'd borne witness to something powerful and unique. The novel never quite achieves, or maintains coherence, and the ending feels somewhat tacked on - as though the author simply hit the stop button on the roller coaster. All of this is basically okay, however, as the book is less a story than it is an experience.I can say with confidence that I've never read anything quite like it, and even Stephenson's other works pale next to it for sheer imaginative power. Sometimes growing almost overwhelming in its new-concept-a-minute (sometimes a-second), a roller coaster ride seems to be the best metaphor I can think of to describe the book. If you are willing to overlook some weaknesses in plot logic, and the need for a truly satisfying ending in return for something absolutely new and fresh, then take a chance on \\"Snow Crash\\" - you'll find it's about as risky as rolling a loaded dice."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is so good, that you have to buy extra copies to give to your friends, and no one that I know who has read it, didn't think it wasn't spectacularly wonderful. Mr Stephenson is one of the most gifted writers, writing in ANY genre today. Once you read this book, you'll want to read all of his books. NEVER a dull moment. Never a cliche. I don't know what to say. Sigh. I'm in awe of very few things in this life, but this man's writing is one of them. Smoochy Neal. Don't you dare ever stop."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The idea that drives the story is really interesting but he wastes to much energy trying to convince the reader that the sumerian &#34;wizards&#34; and hackers are pretty much the same thing, and I concur with the reviewer that said that a sort of essay on the sumerians and they language would be more useful and reader friendly that the stories and explanations that populate the book"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was a good read. I choose the book on the recommendation of my son and it was on the Time Magazine 100 best novels. The Story was interesting and I kept turning the pages. I found the background on the story of the Tower of Babel to be interesting but to be honest I don't know anything about it or its Sumerian roots. So I take it as part of the story. If you like Futuristic Sci-fi you will probably enjoy the book. While it makes the Time list, I don't see if as great literature."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Great work of science fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through. I recommend reading this before Diamond Age because there is a noticeable difference in the quality of Neal Stephenson's writing. Do not let this dissuade you from reading this novel. The writing is only less when compared to Stephenson's greatest work.Overall 9/10 book. Probably would have rated it higher if I wasn't constantly comparing it to the quality of Diamond Age."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was opinionated going in to this novel having read both Anathem and Zodiac. It's hard to comprehend how one author can write such completely different material. A depth of change of this magnitude is something I've not experienced since I started reading Iain M Banks. Don't get me wrong, I've loved each of the three titles, but for very different reasons.Snow Crash will appeal to lovers of Sci-Fi in the William Gibson (Neuromancer) or Tad Williams (Otherland) vein. Futuristic settings with integrated Metaverse/Internet/3D Second Life type access. If you love this stuff then Snow Crash will satisfy nicely.Snow Crash is not as profound as Anathem, which begged a serious indulgence in order to fully appreciate the nuances of the story. That said, the plot is not straightforward, with multiple plot threads winding through the narrative. This keeps the reader engaged throughout. The plot is simply impossible to anticipate - sit back and absorb it like fine art. Let it flow over you.As I have explained, Snow Crash is the third novel of Stephenson's that I have read. I eagerly await the next novel which I am sure will take me into new, uncharted waters."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Really loved the book. The characters and the world are so much fun. I was hooked after a first few chapters."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Given all the rave reviews Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash has received over the years, it's a wonder that the book has been sitting there on my shelf for well over a decade now. I was getting more and more concerned with each passing year, for this work kept receiving such accolades that it raised my expectations to what I felt was an impossible level. I mean, a science fiction novel being selected as one of the 100 books to read in English by Time Magazine? It reached the point where Snow Crash had to be one of the very best books I had ever read, if not the very best, if it had any chance of meeting those lofty expectations.Understandably, although it is an ambitious, intelligent, and entertaining novel, Snow Crash couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. It is a fun and thrilling read, no question. And yet, as much as I enjoyed it, I don't feel that it's the sort of literary work that lingers within your mind long after you have finished it.Here's the blurb:One of Time magazine's 100 all-time best English-language novels.Only once in a great while does a writer come along who defies comparison--a writer so original he redefines the way we look at the world. Neal Stephenson is such a writer and Snow Crash is such a novel, weaving virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything in between with a cool, hip cybersensibility to bring us the gigathriller of the information age.In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince. Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so outrageous...you'll recognize it immediately.The worldbuilding is simply awesome. In a not-so-distant future, the USA has become a fragmented ensembles of smaller Burbclaves and city-states. As is usually the author's wont, the witty narrative is full of satiric social and political commentary. What's even more brilliant is the fact that Snow Crash was written between 1988 and 1991. To realize just how on the money Stephenson turned out to be regarding the information age and virtual reality, it's simply astonishing. The same thing goes for the technology now in use, both in terms of software and hardware. Truly, Neal Stephenson was a visionary.The characterization is well-done, especially considering that having teenagers as your principal protagonists can sometimes be quite tricky. Yet both Hiro Protagonist, the Deliverator and katana-wielding hacker, and Y.T., a pesky Kourier, are well-defined characters you just have to root for. When Hiro is involved in an accident and is about to be late delivering a pizza, Y.T. delivers the pie on time, thus earning a favor from the Mafia and joining her fate to Hiro's, though none of them are quite aware of that fact just yet. Although the narrative follows the POVs of these two protagonists for the better part of the book, they are joined by a colorful cast of secondary characters that give Snow Crash its unforgettable flavor. Chief among those include Uncle Enzo, the Librarian, and Raven.The pace is fluid and the chapters relatively short, making this novel a real page-turner. Indeed, there is never a dull moment. The early portions about the Sumerian myths and their importance are a bit more nebulous and hard to understand, but everything is explained later on in the book. Hence, for a while at least, you are sort of left in the dark as to what this new computer virus is all about. Be that as it may, you just need to buckle up and enjoy the ride. From beginning to end, Snow Crash remains a dense and surreal work of fiction full of humor that will make you think as much as it makes you laugh.As I mentioned, what is even more impressive is the fact that this novel was initially published two decades ago. Discovering just how right Stephenson was concerning everything that has to do with the information age and virtual reality will have you shaking your head in bewilderment.Snow Crash is a smart, cool, funny, witty, and action-packed adventure featuring a pair of unlikely heroes who must save the world from infocalypse. If you enjoy roller-coaster rides, Snow Crash is definitely for you! You will never again look at toilet paper quite the same way afterwards. . .If, like me, you haven't read it yet, Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash could be perfect vacation reading material for you.Check out Pat's Fantasy Hotlist!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Future-based thriller where there exists a huge computer network \\"city\\" where people can \\"go\\" to connect.

I would recommend this to anyone who is into cyber punk books, the internet, or pizza. Great read and well worth the time as long as you are into technology and interested in what the future may hold."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book had my heart after the first paragraph. I love the way Stephenson is so descriptive, using so many metaphors that your head spins. It was seriously like watching \\"The Matrix\\" for the first time. You remember how with just about every action scene you were able to mutter at least one \\"That was freakin' awesome!\\"? Well that's how \\"Snow Crash\\" is going to be for you. There's not one chapter that goes by where you aren't interested.Even the less action-packed chapters are just as captivating, not only because Neal Stephenson can write a sentence so full of satire and humor that only weeks later while standing in line at the DMV will you break out in laughter at finally understanding it completely, but because the content is just so intriguing. I also must confess to loving the parts of the book that dealt with Sumerian mythology, as well as the Raft.Anyway, without giving any more details, I definitely stand by this book as one of the best novels ever written. Even Time Magazine seems to agree, having put it on a list of \\"All-Time 100 Novels\\"(http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html). So especially if you've been out of touch with a good book for a while, consider reading \\"Snow Crash\\" by Neal Stephenson. It'll make you fall in love with literature all over again, even if you don't know for sure what Cyberpunk means."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The combination of technology and cutting edge concepts make this a watershed novel.

An engaging journey in a world of the future, it sucks in the technogeek in me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson continues to amaze me with the amount of research he puts into books. You can learn a lot of fascinating material from each of them.Snow Crash was written over ten years ago, but amazingly Stephenson's foresight in regards to online interaction and computer technology advancement are impressive.One of the major ideas Stephenson uses in this novel really intrigues me. He takes relationships in computer structure and applies it to linguistics - in the early days of computer programming, it was very low level interaction, programming instructions weren't very human friendly. Over time, we have created higher and higher level languages that allow us to program computers with language more english like and easily understandable. His idea is that human language has progressed the same way, that there is some basic primal understanding that we all share, and that our current languages worldwide, are high level abstractions that allow us to manipulate conversations and information processing with greater ease. Furthermore, he puts forth that the lower level human language is still accessible, much like you could still program in assembly if you wish.He gets into much more detail and extends this idea far more, but I won't share that as it's extensive and a spoiler."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Not much more to add. Other novelists my be more visionary, artistic, etc, but Stephenson is eminently readable and enjoyable. Haven't met anyone yet who dislikes this book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"That's why they call it fiction. The characters are crazy and a bit scary too. He has taken some of our most serious social problems; drugs, organized crime, the internet, hackers, corporate greed; and extrapolated them into an extremley entertaining, although unbelievable tale. No, this is not going to happen to America. Read the book though, I think you will enjoy it. If you like Stephenson, you must also check out &quot;Transfer: the end of the begining,&quot; by author Jerry Furland. Then you will know where America is really headed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'm giving this 5 stars b/c it's everything I like in a well-written book but I doubt that Stephenson's style of writing is everyone's cup of tea. I found Snow Crash to be clever and thoroughly engaging. It doesn't hurt that I'm a tech geek either. Well done."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson's SNOW CRASH has won itself near-classic status in the cyberpunk genre by combining the worship of technology and hacker skills made popular by earlier writers like Gibson with a humorous tone and farcical view of the future. Published in 1991, the book suggests a near-future America where the privization and libertarian fantasies of the Reagan years have led to America breaking up into innumerable little city states, each part of a franchise chain. The independent hacker and swordsman Hiro Protagonist pays his bills by working as a \\"deliverator\\", conveying pizzas from a Mafia-owned pizzeria franchise to LA suburbs designed to the same general plans. When not making deliveries, Hiro is a luminary of the Metaverse, a 3D virtual environment accessed by people all over the globe. In this technological fantasy world, someone is spreaking a virus that kills hackers, and Hiro has to take down the culprit with an understanding of Sumerian myth.Parts of SNOW CRASH are dated indeed. The Metaverse concept seems silly now that the 1990s interest in virtual reality has faded. Stephenson's hope that hackers would be the heroes of the future has gone unrealized when the people who keep the web's most popular sites running are still considered socially inept geeks. Nonetheless, quite a bit of it is still remarkably fresh. Consider this early observation of globalization:\\"Once things have evened out, they're making cars in Bolivia and microwave overs in Tadzhikistan and selling them here--once our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickel--once the Invisible Hand has taken all these historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity--y'know what? There's only four things we do better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software), high-speed pizza delivery.\\"I really enjoyed this book the first time I read it in my early teens. Nowadays, however, I see the book as incredibly flawed. Anyone with a liberal arts education is sure to be annoyed by Stephenson's treatment of linguistics and Sumerian myth, and the DA VINCI CODE-esque sensationalism on ancient religions. When Stephenson has to introduce the Sumerian element, he has no better way to do this than a long droning monologue from a librarian character. The whole hacker and super-privatized America portions of the book are great fun, but the Sumerian virus element just seems lame. Still, as this book does have the potential to keep you entertained, I'd recommend it as light reading."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The book arrived in better condition than what was listed, and arrived quick- what more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I liked the linking of how a human brain works and how a computer works. There has to be some hardware/software wired a birth to create the different personalities and to allow consciousness to develop. A funny exciting read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Five stars? From a guy who doesn't read much science fiction? Yes. Although I had to warm to the book at first, I eventually gave myself over to Neal Stephenson's genre-busting mix of thrilling narrative arc and thoughtful book of ideas. The eponymous hero, Hiro Protagonist, is a winner; the evil antagonist, Raven, is one for the ages as well. When Raven turns on someone with his glass knives in hand, the reader will take notice (or maybe even cover, if said reader be weak of heart).The book begins with a Mad Max-style pizza delivery scene, introducting Hiro and the strong female support, a kourier (delivery girl) named Y.T. who \\"poons\\" cars (attaches a magnet attached to a ski-style string leading back to her skateboard-type device) for speedy delivery. She's a 15-year-old, wise-cracking, firecracker of a foil for Hiro. Then Raven is inserted into the mix, and before you know it, Hiro is trying to solve a mystery that involves heavy research into the ancient Sumerian culture.The characters move freely between real time and the Metaverse -- an Internet society populated by avatars. Hiro is a master hacker, and he's going to need all of his talents to counter the likes of Raven. It's funny. It's intriguing. And it's hold-on-to-your-seat thrilling.Readers will appreciate the fast-paced plot and the spectacular ending, but thinkers will be fascinated by the concept of language and mythology being intertwined with viruses that can infect not only computers, but human brains. Inventive and witty, Stephenson's prose is a muscular antidote to the MFA style writing you might be getting bored with (or even sick of) these days. If you missed its initial publication (as I did), there's no time like now to make amends. Go ahead. Treat yourself. Call it slumming, if you want, but SNOW CRASH is cool and worth the cold cash you might lay down."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was the first NS book I read - but certainly not the last. He's simply the most intriguing, creative writer I've come across and one of my first recommendations for anyone who wants to read intelligent commentary on the human condition through fiction. My only critique of Neal's work is that he doesn't always seem to know how to end a book. But maybe that's because he's such a fine writer, I just don't want it to end. Start with Snow Crash, read The Diamond Age, then if you're hooked, take a shot at reading Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Cycle."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Okay, you don't really *have* to, but it captures the fast-paced nature of the Second Life metaverse, and its addictive character. It seems that 20-somethings enjoy this book more than older readers, but that is probably because growing up with blackberries and WOW sets one up with the background necessary to get into this book immediately."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this many years ago, right after neuromancer and recently sat down to reread it. I noticed this time thru that the descriptions of The Street are becoming quaint. Advances in MMORPGs have already blasted through anything Stephenson imagined. And onlines like Second Life and the Sims, have actually created a virtual hangout that mirrors reality pretty well. The stuff about your avatars looking grainy if you have a slow connection was pretty funny too. It's ironic that he imagined everything in The Street being free just based on programming ability.Most successful online worlds require an economy with scarcity, otherwise there is no challenge. Second Life may be an exception to this. I still give him alot of credit for coming up with this so long ago.The first time thru, I did not realize what a libertarian Stephenson is, but this is more clear in some of his later books and interviews. The discussions of franculates and burbclaves makes MUCH more sence when seen in this light. I didn't *get* it the first time thru and missed a whole layer of subtext, just thought it was cool and futuristic. Now I see that he was extrapolating what would be the natural outgrowth of privatizing all functions of government; citizenship is something you could buy and sell and choose your own affiliations, independent of where you live. I think that alot was left unsaid however but some of the implications were well-developed. Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong providing autonomous robotic defense facilities, or the deregulated prison system (ie. The Clink).He effectively blurs the lines between gang affiliations, corporate franchises and governments, which is a thought provoking juxtaposition, since each of these provides much the same role but in different sociological arenas. I understood that residential burbclaves could have their own constitutions and defense forces, but all of the other territories were private property...even the roads were private property. So do you pay rent everywhere you go? Not exactly clear.Still love all of the stuff about Enki and the en and me... Babylonian thought virus, Cuneiform = C++, Tower of Babel = psychic Systems Crash, brilliant. Makes me want to go read Daniken and Sitchin again. This is a great book, now go read Cryptonomicon!!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"At the outset we meet our protagonist, Hiro Protagonist (yes, it is a stupid name). It is difficult to tell exactly what is taking place. The narrator speaks in third person who is quite annoying at first but you get used to it; does not last through the whole book. Soon it becomes clear that Hiro is a pizza delivery boy who also thinks he is a samurai.Please don't stop reading after the first fifty or sixty pages as I almost did. I promise that it starts to make sense. The whole book is not about the process of future pizza delivery. If you stop you will miss out on some of the best speculative fiction ever. Hiro must figure out who is unleashing a virus that can destroy minds through the Metaverse (the future internet). Rarely had a book raised my adrenalin levels as much as this did.I must admire an author who can take such a silly seeming idea and infuse it with so mush life and thankfully Stephenson is writing faster than most people can read. From the reviews it seems that this is something to be thankful for.Highly recommended to any Sci-fi fan not only hackers and programmers (I can barely check my email)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I truly love the way Stephenson describes details in the world he has created. A main theme running through the book is an idea of colors, and his use of incredible descriptions blew my mind at times, and I just had to go, &quot;Wow, that is a powerful metaphor.&quot;I also really dig the little break-ups he has between every few chapters, when it switches days, with a good device of delivering info in the form of a magazine that comes out in the universe we are reading about. This is wonderful, because you don't have characters explaining things to people where they would OBVIOUSLY understand what they are talking about, because it is such a pertinant part of their culture.Alas, the only part I didn't enjoy was there should have been more description and understanding of what makes up certain parts of the world. Understandably this is a made-up place (hopefully) and rules aren't really in practice as we know them, but at times I felt like I was struggling to understand what EXACTLY was going on. So I had to make up several rules to make situations fit in my brain. This is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.Incest, a wonderful ending, and kickin' adjectives make this a very amazing read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The beginning is very funny and engrossing and draws you in. Stephenson really has an eye for detail, and he has an obsessive-techy-guy style. He also works in some really interesting ideas, such as his theories on computing and linguistics. However, this is the kind of book where Stephenson draws you in, but then can't finish the story. The book is 600+ pages, and they don't all add to the story. Stephenson is a very good writer, but he gets to involved in detail, and needs to be a more succicient writer. Unfortunately, if you've read Cryptonomicon, you'll know that this Stephenson still isn't over this habit."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I had a hard time pulling away from this one! Y.T. and Hiro make a great team! It would be great to see a continuation of it..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really enjoyed the characters, but I was bored with the explanations and there wasn't a very climactic ending. The descriptions lost me after awhile because they were boring and not descriptive. I should have read this book before I read Neuromancer--which was much better. Still a good quick read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What most people consider the talent of Stephenson's Snow Crash is the whip lashed pace of the cyber-punk fiction from beginning to end. However, the greatest feat achieved by the author is the wide range of literary tolls that lead us from joy to pain to disgust to desire. Combining this pace with tongue-in-cheek humor as well as staggering symbolism, Stephenson delivers a ticket to a most mesmerizing ride inot the last, great,unknown frontier known as &quot;the future.&quot; For a virtual &quot;rookie&quot; to the sci-fi fantasy world, and a less than avid reader, Snow Crash provided a breath of fresh air from the monotony of required school reading. However, my cynicism leads me to be skeptical of a lowly pizza delivery boy, albeit a Samaurai master swordsman, saving the virtual future with the aid of his hacker girlfriend. The aggressive undertones of violence denoted by an occasional sword fight or two convey Stephenson's distaste for the world's shortcomings causing him to create a virtual realm which has been set up to compensate for these inequities. Despite this motive, the actual storyline and resolution of the plot in and of themselves make Snow Crash an entertaining thrill ride through dementia and ultimately into utopia."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am usually a reader that avoids the hype and sticks to authors and books that I know will provide an entertaining read.After reading the Amazon synopsis and a few of the other reader reviews I decided to buy this book and another of the author's books, &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;.Snow Crash was one of the best books I have read in a long time. It was very funny and written with a very entertaining flow with lots of wit and energy. Now in the year 2000 some of the ideas he wrote about don't seem so far away but even now the book loses nothing of its edge and is still a great story. I loved both of the characters but Y.T was a rip! She was a great character and I would love to see a continuation of her character's story in another book.Thank you very much Neal for this story and I am very much looking forward to reading The Diamond Age. Write something else with Y.T. I am sure everyone else who reads this book will agree she truly makes the story. Hiro is a great character too.It is nice to read a book where the characters actually do what the reader thinks they should do and doesn't have people doing totally stupid and unreasonable things just to keep the story going longer and longer to a drawn out ending. This book had totally believable characters and situations from start to finish. I can't wait to lend the book to a friend so I can talk to them about it. A truly great find."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is an excellent book. The first chapter is terribly funny tongue in cheek humor that sets the scene for a slightly more humorous look at the cyberpunk world than is offered by most authors. But the book does not continue like this. It progresses onwards, garnering a plot in the process. It does not possess the darkness that makes true cyberpunk (William Gibson) so great. Not to say that the book is not worth reading, but keep your expectations low."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was definitely for the science fiction lover. It takes place in the future where everything is computerized. The main character, Hiro Protagonist, is a hacker, a pizza deliverer, and swordsman. He creates an alterntive world called the Metaverse. Anyone can go to the Metaverse through any computer. A &quot;drug&quot; is being distributed through Metaverse called snow crash. this drug crashes your computer and your brain. Hiro joins up with a couple of his friends and trys to stop the spread of this &quot;virus&quot;. This book wasn't really my style, because I really don't like science fiction. But, it did keep me interested. I expected more action and explanation in the ending. Overall, I thought it was a decent book and I would recommend it to anyone, science fiction lover or not."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"&quot;Snow Crash&quot; by Neal Stepheson, was very well written and thought out book. I love how he took the world and place it into the future, but a lot of the time you think it is happening in the present time. The book was very easy to follow and he's always keeping you on your toes at all times with alot of suspension. Extremely action packed and thrilling. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson has an interesting vision of the future - one in which nations have been replaced by corporate-nation-states. His depiction of the United States (Fedland) is hilarious. His use of Sumerian mythology and the idea of a metavirus is intriguing.However, much like Diamond Age, the book lacks an ending. The world is saved in about 30 pages. It's unsatisfying.Still, the beginning of the book is excellent and the middle is quite good. Stephenson is a witty satirist and he develops compelling visions of the future.Recommended, with the reservations about the ending."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I thought Diamond Age was good...predicting a future shocking but believable. Snow Crash is much better though. The characters are odd...but that's what people are like really. More importantly, there is a mixture of software and art in this book.Even the clinching plot twist involves using the liberal arts side of your brain. It's engrossing and well worth the read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was defiantly something new for me as science fiction is not an area I read at all. The book was given to me as a gift and came highly recommended. That being the case I gave it a shot and found that I really enjoyed it. The biggest issue I had was getting into the completely fictionalized and make believe world, once I stopped saying \\"but that can't happen\\" I found I really got into the book and enjoyed it. The author has done a great job in making the lead character into a cross between the Harrison Ford character in Blade Runner and Joey from Friends - both dark and at the same time fun to be around.The book is about this run of the mill not overly successful guy in the real world that finds he is much better in a cyber world that has been created and is as real to people as the real world. The \\"real world\\" in the book is rather dark and not very nice so you understand why the character would spend time in the cyber world. So once in there we have an action / mystery story that is fun and fast paced. The story is enjoyable and is easy to read. If you are looking for some escapism then this book will fit the bill. One caution, as I do not read SF, I have no idea how this book compares to others in the field."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Great story. It jumps right in to the action, successfully intermingling the intro-type details into an action scene. Hiro Protagonist's Sumerian studies got a bit long in the tooth, but the cross-fades to Y.T.'s side of the story every now and then kept things rolling. I couldn't help but feel that the book was written with the intention of being easily converted into a movie -- unlike &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; or &quot;Diamond Age&quot;.This book is typical Stephenson: techno slant, good humor, lively characters, very granular descriptions of most everything. Unfortunately it also contains Stephenson's biggest flaw: the ending is way to short and very abrupt compaired to the flow of the rest of the book. He leaves issues unresolved and characters dangling. This must be deliberate, since he did the same thing with &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, but it still gets to me a little bit."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This SF novel is packed with high-speed bizarre action, the sort one would normally expect from superhero comics. As such the entertainment value is very good. Particularly striking are the oddly fascinating pizza delivery service, as well as the main theme of the story - human computer virus in cyberspace. Unfortunatley, the ingenious ideas are not fully developed, and the later parts of the book do not seem to have resolved all the puzzles in a satisfactory manner. Anyhow, the book is one of those defining the modern SF field and is worthy reading material for any SF fans."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The cyberpunk book I am reading (Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson, the first novel by the guy who wrote Cryptonomicon, about which I raved so much) has a character making the conjecture that the deutoronomists came up with the codification of the law into scripture in order to make the Hebrew people immune from the virus of Asherah worship. The point being that Asherah worship is a virus that is not good for people, like a disease, but that the Hebrew religion (as codified by the Deuteronomists), being the first rational religion, brings immunity from the pre-rational religions (and the pre-rational religions work by actually re-wiring people's brains). Cool concept, isn't it? This all comes about because in the book is a bad guy who created a weird Christian religion mixing Jesus and Elvis, but which, apparently, actually is a virus that spreads easily from one person to another, and which includes the speaking of tongues, but quite possibly the tongue they are speaking is Sumerian, leading back to the Asherah worship thing, and our protagonist must work to stop the virus from spreading. Fascinating modes of thinking this Neal Stephenson has, and brilliant writing. Not just some great philosophy, but he has a wonderful way of describing scenes, and can be hilariously funny at times. This is a must read book, for fans of any genre, but it is simply too good not to read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I picked up this book beacause I saw an interview of Neal on ZDTV. They were talking about his &quot;crypto..&quot; book and they mentioned Snow Crash. I read reviews and bough the book.I don't read a lot, but I couldn't put this one down. I read it in one week on vacation. Being in the computer industry made this even better because the technology Neal writes about does seem like it could happen any day, and makes sense.I read Diamond Age after this. It was ok, but not another Snow Crash.I'm waiting for the next Stephenson masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was a bit out of my reading phases when I picked up Snow Crash. It was the same time that Cryptonomicon came out, and I wanted to see what Stephenson's style was like before diving into it's 900+ pages. Snow Crash is a very interesting story set in a futuristic world and meta-world. The main character, Hiro, is well developed, and you get a really good feeling of how things go through his mind by the end of the novel. Of the several books of Stephenson's that I have read (I've enjoyed them all as well), I can easily say that this is my favorite. I definately couldn't put the book down!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of the most purely entertaining books I've ever read. It has a thousand and one concepts that seemingly would only work in a comic book, or movie, or oher visual medium, but every detail is pulled off with perfection. The world in this book is oddly plausible. Every major change simply reflects the direction America and society in general are always moving in. Above all, however, this book is fun to read. I recommend it without reservation to anyone at all. Read it!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"All Stephenson's books seem to break down in the details. He excels at rapid-fire exposition, colorful scenery, and an cultivating a pornographically rich compost of ideas. Of course, if you dig too deep or look to close in compost, guess what you find. As a science fiction writer, Stephenson is laughably bad at the extrapolation of both technological and social realities. And while he excels at the art of creating colorful characters in a few quick strokes of characterization, much like characters modern comics, they don't bear close examination.Nevertheless, this is a hell of a fun read -- a bona-fide rollercoaster ride through a strange world that's just enough like our own to really freak you out. Taken at that level, it's hard to go wrong."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I guess Gibson is the towering measuring stick to which all cyberpunk is compared. As opposed to Gibson's dour and gloomy version of the future, Stephenson's &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is more upbeat, satirizing modern society and taking it to its humorous but still somewhat logical extreme.The use of Sumerian mythology (or IS it?) was just awesome. With such a great foundation, Stephenson could have written a very focused and intellectual &quot;concept&quot; novel -- but instead he treats us to a romp that explores a well-realized near-future world and doesn't take itself too seriouslyMy only complaint is that there should have been MORE of it! After I was done I caught myself thinking in every free moment, &quot;Hey, I can read some more of Snow Crash!&quot; I very nearly started right over again from the beginning!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I could not put this book down, from the first two chapters on i was hooked. The Sumerian legend was emaculately intertwined throughout this novel and in my opinion was what made it different. This is not just another cyberpunk book.....this is THE cyberpunk book. I do agree with one of the other reviewers that i was wondering where the last few chapeters were. I read the about the author hoping it would give me the closure i so sorely needed. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Great book, lots of fun to read. Full of humor, cool technology, and interesting characters. I highly suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Do we have a Metaverse, with people already online 24/7. Stevenson does a good job at predicting some of things happening now, think Halo3.I loved this book, if your a computer guy, its a great read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As pretty much anyone who reads books for more than just school (a sadly declining occurrence in today's techno-centric world) will tell you, Neal Stephenson is, at the very least, a good author. That notwithstanding, when I first looked at this book and noticed that the protagonist's name was Hiro (Hiro Protagonist, no less), I couldn't help but groan and think of Heroes (an excellent TV show that I can't seem to escape, even when I want to) and one of its protagonists, a sword-wielding man also named Hiro. Of course, I don't think that Hiro would've been delivering pizza for the Mafia. Yes. Delivering pizza for the Mafia. And that's just the tip of the iceberg for a book that features such concepts as \\"Li'l Crips pajamas.\\" Yet couched in all these humorous trappings is an interesting cyberpunk story about trying to prevent disaster in hyper-corporatized, extremely techno-centric world. One that should set off some warning bells in your head. And, if your response is \\"Why should I care\\" or \\"That could never happen,\\" read the book. In fact, read it anyways. Then tell me you don't care or that something like that couldn't happen. Because, despite being set in a world extrapolated from late 80's and early 90's trends and concepts, that fictional world is not a very far stretch from our own current world.Oh. And beware the dentata..........Just read the book. Trust me.- Sean Rynerson(using this account with permission of the account owner)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snowcrash isn't a novel for just anyone. It is certainly not a traditional sci-fi novel. Instead, into the subgenre known as cyberpunk. The story centers around a dystopic world where Hiro, the protagonist, surfs the metaverse... Something between the matrix and the internet. Hiro stumbles upon the Snowcrash virus which threatens not only the users of the metaverse, but also people in the real world. The story continues from there. This book is in the same vein as Gibson's Neuromancer, and is a very well written and satisfying read. Perfect for the readers willing to embrace their inner adolescent boy and have fun with it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"And it gets better every time! Bimbo Box has crept into my library of slang, and I was even part of Cybertown back in 2000-2001 that had been heavily influenced by this book.LOVE it. A must read for the digital generation."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A friend loaned me this book - hard to put down once I started. Crazy fun story that I find really well written and visionary in many respects."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have recently been on a tear reading through Stephenson's books, entire forests of trees were sacrificed to put these in print, but they are truly the works of a great, highly imaginative intellect. I liken Stephenson to Thomas Pynchon although he is a lot easier to digest. There are fewer digressions and he doesn't get wrapped up in inside jokes that are hard for anyone apart from PHD physicists to appreciate. At the same time, there is certainly a lot going on from a technical standpoint and some sort of background in computers is necessary to get a deeper understanding of what's happening in his breakthrough novel, Snowcrash. A basic understanding of Neuro-Linguistic programming and Artificial Intelligence will help the reader get a lot more out of the storyline than just the comic book style action. The pace can be sort of uneven and there is no real resolution or surprise ending, but still, this is a great read.Is it possible for a virtual world to exist in such a fashion that it gets mixed up with reality? To me this is what Snowcrash is all about and if you like the Matrix and its various sequels, than this one is right up your alley. The author's mind is absolutely brilliant and he works his way through time, much like in Pynchon's V, integrating history & Sumerian Myth with his futuristic Cyberpunk-world. There is a lot of cutting satire mixed in. In my opinion, Snowcrash continues along the lines of the Frankenstein's monster theme-the idea that man made technology can get out of control and take on a mind of its own. In a way Stephenson takes it to the next level in Snowcrash where technology creates its own parallel, quantum reality.The thing I like best about Stephenson is his prose, there is a lot of humor in his writings and the way he describes things. It's easy to follow and though he is does lay out some heavy concepts, he doesn't overwhelm the reader. There's a kind of hip edge to the \\"geeky,\\" techno-concepts brought forth in Snowcrash and Stephenson's vision of the future isn't too far off from some people's realities. The complete \\"techno-dweebs\\" will have to be somewhat hip to enjoy this one with concepts like a virtual drug overdose, sexual encounters, Ukranian fuzztone grunge, and Japanese sword fighting being central to the novel. The action is comic strip style and sometimes a bit stupid or silly in my opinion, but its pace and the humor make this a highly entertaining read although some sections tend to get bogged down in technical innuendos. I can't say I relate to the characters or would consider myself a Cyber-punk, but I have definitely taken quite an interest in Stephenson and I am working on reading Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Series. This is great stuff and if you need to dust the cobwebs off of your gray matter, go buy one of these thick, heavy tomes!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash's success is startlingly because it was intended to be a satire of American media. For this reason, its success as a legitimate entry into the scifi/cyberpunk world is amusing to Stephenson and those of us who noticed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This has got to be one of the coolest sci-fi novels ever.The world is populated with franchises - countries, religions, jails, the mafia - all are now small, independently owned and operated franchises with establishments all over the world and all over the greater LA area where a lot of the action takes place.Of course there's too many people (and no real police) so people live wherever they want - a public storage locker, a Winnebago on the side of the road, in a boat attached to an aircraft carrier, etc.But many spend their free time in a worldwide metaverse, where you can roam around as a tricked out 3D avatar in total defiance of the laws of physics but still subject of the laws of society and reputation - unknown nobodies still have to wait in a fake line to get into a fake club where all the cool avatars hang out.This is SO how the future could really be!Of course, sometimes Stephenson's penchant for extremely detailed descriptions of vague processes and theories get in the way of his great plots and action - like pages and pages about ancient trickster gods and their computer-hacking-tower-of-Babel-rule-the-world plans - but his crazy-hilarious descriptions of this cyber-punk future make up for any long-windedness one might encounter. (And that's his style, so let's cut him some slack - I'm sure some will find the Tower of Babel parts are their favorite) Now if only I could get my hands on a Dentata ... !"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"An in depth look into the Franchise run US of the future. Going into great detail of a possible future of a world run by corporations instead of governments. Following the Hacker Hiro Protagonist through his dealings with the mob, and a viral church. Very well done, a great read with plenty of action. Where everythign leads to something more. I highly recomend this book to anyone with an open mind on the future. Or just looking for a realistic near future sci-fi."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is my first foray into the cyberpunk genre, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. It takes place in the no-so-distant future, where everything in California has become privatized. Hiro, a self-proclaimed freelance hacker, is delivering pizzas for the mafia when he finds out about a computer virus, Snow Crash, that not only crashes the computer, but hackers' brains as well. The rest of the story is Hiro, his ex-girlfriend, and sidekick Y.T. trying to figure out what is going on and how they can stop it.The book hits the ground running and never lets up. Stephenson has an interesting take on religion and has done some solid research on Sumer and its gods and goddesses. I enjoyed the Metaverse and see definite parallels with today's 'Net, although the virtual reality part of the Metaverse has never caught on in real life. The ending was a bit of a disappointment for me-it seemed like he just realized he had 5 pages to finish the book and kind of threw it all together. Overall, though, I thought it was a great read and recommend it to all."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was introduced to Neal Stephenson's writing with Cryptonomicon as the first book I read. I figured his other books would be worth taking a look at as well. This book wasn't the same style as I liked in the other book, and was too much of a fantasy style for me. At some points the computer gadgetry was interesting, but too unrealistic for me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you are a sci-fi fan, Neal Stephenson should already be one of your favorite authors. If you are, and he isn't, &quot;Snow Crash&quot; should be the next book on your reading list.The story takes place in a strange but not too distant future. Governments function in a completely different way. Virtual reality has reached the point where people can go clubbing and engage in sword fights on-line. Information is the most valuable currency. The Mafia runs the pizza-delivery business.The characters are some of the best I've come across in a while. Hiro Protagonist (terrible name, great character) is an Arfican American Samurai and computer geek. He crosses swords with a gangster/warlord named Dmitri Ravenoff--called Raven--who has weapons that leave people baffled for most of the book. Stephenson's development of all of his characters is incredible--besides these two, there are at least 3 others that you'll be in love with before the story's done.The story has everything you'd want--freaky plot, interesting historical anecdotes (where did the story of the Tower of Babel come from?), awesome characters, high-octane fight and chase scenes, and cool technology. If you don't read this....just don't read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Reading the reviews below, it appears that there are two reactions to SNOW CRASH: you love it, or you hate it. From an design standpoint, this is excellent. The book motivates people to react, and it's not mired in mediocrity. Notably, if you like NEUROMANCER and other William Gibson/Bruce Stirling novels, you apparently hate SNOW CRASH. Fortunately, I have never liked Gibson or Stirling, and I loved this book.This book is NOT an attempt to examine society; it is NOT philosophy, nor does it pretend to be (unlike *ahem* other authors). It's a rollicking good read, with lots of action, some good virtual-reality imagery, and a tongue-in-cheek manner that whips the reader through a fun, interesting plotline. It's supposed to be funny; it IS funny. It's not a textbook for the future, it's a science fiction novel with few pretensions save an enjoyable story.Want an escape, with interesting characters and a moving plot, read SNOW CRASH. It's fun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a great book. Buy it, it is good."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Well, like most of the 350-something reviews say, the book starts off great but loses more and more momentum as time goes on, until it's just kind of dragging you along. Several interesting ideas are presented in it, with the corporate suburb-states the United States has splintered into, the Metaverse in general, and the hyperinflation of the dollar bill, so that Y.T. actually pays 745 billion once as a bribe to cops. However, instead of expanding on any of these ideas, Stephenson goes off on wierd trips through mythology.Thus, we never get a real feel for the relationship between Y.T. and Hiro, we never learn how the U.S. came to be as it is in the story, and we never learn why the nuke doesn't go off when Raven dies. That, and I admittedly thought it a bit much to try and show the degeneration of morals by having ever male character in the book except Hiro salivate over a 15 year old girl. Even the (supposedly) good guy Mafia men tend towards this, and the little scene with Raven and Y.T. was just disturbing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book (Snowcrash) is one of the best Cyberpunk books Ive ever read. The story is action packed and funny! The pages turn themself and I couldn't stand to put the book down. If you like futuristic, virtual-realty based stories, then this book is for you!! Neal Stephenson's greatest book to date!! (ive only read one of his other books; Cryptonomicron)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"More than a dozen people recommended this science-fiction novel to me as a work of fiction dealing with memes, so I finally read it. I .have to say it's one of the best SF novels I have ever read. Stephenson really seems to grok viruses of the mind, and paints a future in which cultural viruses such as franchising, religious cults, pizza delivery, and the Mafia have spread wildly at the expense of today's laws and governments. Meanwhile, is someone trying to come up with the perfect designer virus that will allow them to take over the world? This fast-paced, literate story is a must-read.--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"THis book is fabulous. As was stated before, if you are a computer geek of any kind, or want to be, you'll love the book. Its references to the future of technology will keep you wondering. I couldn't put the book down until i hit about page 400, then it got slow. there wasn't much action, and it just got confusing. I could easily go through the pages upon pages of history lessons, but not the ending. What was supposed to be the climax was actually the low point of the book. Don't get me wrong, you MUST read this book. You'll be satisfied just by reading until page 400, but afterwards, it'll get slow. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have read Snow Crash twice. It is an amazing book. Neal Stephenson did an amazing job presenting the facts dealing with 'me', 'nam-shub', and 'en'. Outside of reading Snow Crash, I have done extensive research concerning Sumerian Mythology and theology and have found these facts to be more than true.Snow Crash is an excellent book, and I highly suggest that any cyber-hippie read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Just before going on a trip overseas, a friend bought this book. I thought \\"why would I want to read a Sci-fi novel?\\" Most Sci-fi novels are thick with cheesy plots revolving around the author's idea about some aspect of technology.Snow Crash was quite a different story. From the start I found it very entertaining. The idea of a Mafia pizza delivery service, and a church franchise (Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates) makes a very interesting setting for a book.At the same time, I really enjoyed the author's hip writing style. For example, the beginning of one chapters goes like this: \\"Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest .. in the world\\". I enjoy this sort of saavy writing, which is found throughout the book.I have finished reading this book for the fourth time, and each time I re-read the book, I find I learn something new. The concepts of a metavirus, the Asherah cult, and how they relate to world religion are quite fascinating, and definitely food for thought. I can't help but wonder if people really are infected with some sort of Asherah virus.Lastly, I really enjoyed the hero of the book (ironically named Hiro Protagonist). I can definitely relate to his problems and attitudes.Definitely buy this book if you can. There is something for every one in this book, even if you don't consider yourself a \\"nerd\\". It really is a entertaining novel and a rare gem."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Ever wonder what capitalism is doing to us? Ever wonder why so many languages are so similar? Ever think about what people say, how they say it, and what they really mean? If you answered yes, then you are in luck because so does Neil Stephenson. And he did a little research on the subject and came up with a wonderful tale.Not since Ayn Rand has there been an author that has woven a philosophical message so well with a piece of fiction. From page one you will want to keep up with Hiro Protagonist and his neo-skater friend. The Mafia will keep you guessing, and the government... well, I can't ruin everything for you. It is one of those books that you read through because you want to know what happens to the characters and when you are done, you have a whole new outlook on life that you didn't realize was being given to you. The outstanding writing and the wonderful characters all add to the readability.If you like to think or you just like a good read, this book will not let you down."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"After reading &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and &quot;The Big U&quot; I'm convinced that Neal Stephenson is one of the greatest satirists in print today. Picture a Michael Crichton with interesting characters and a smart-a** sense of humor.&quot;Snow Crash&quot; opens with the same kind of hilarious thrill that those other novels contained. We're given a world turned around, mixed up, inside out... Suburbs are armed nation-states. Pizza delivery is the most ambitious career in the United States. It is a joy.So, what happened? In his notes, Shephenson states that he intended &quot;Snow Crash&quot; to be a one-of-a-kind computer-generated graphic novel, but the techonology fell through and he went back to writing a regular novel. This makes sense because &quot;Snow Crash&quot; feels pristine on the outside, hollow within. Stephenson creates such a weird and incredible world that he has to spend too much time explaining it to us while the plot stalls.And there isn't much plot to begin with. Hiro Protagonist is out to stop a psycho who about to infect the world with an &quot;information&quot; virus. The plot moves in spurts, but Stephenson resorts too often to a tired technique that he is far above- using character dialogue to roll out expository info. In one fragmented sequence, Hiro learns about the origins of the virus from a virtual reality guide. Problem? As good as Stephenson's research into Ancient Sumaria is, 100 pages of exposition is a sloppy mistake.&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is never boring, but it is a fascinating failure."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'm an ex PC 3D Graphics Product Manager weasel and I used to muse about a 3D internet as THE application that would someday consume the 3D rendering power on the product roadmaps of graphics companies. I'd argue that the most intuitive human interface is three dimensional, so it will just be a matter of time before it is so on the net. I had 3D web dreams, but those paled in comparison to the Metaverse in \\"Snow Crash.\\" It is astonishing that this book was written back in '88-'91. What a vision! There are equally compelling futures for the Library of Congress (&quot;...people are not entirely clear what the word &quot;congress&quot; means...&quot;), skateboard wheels, pizza delivery and the interstate highway system. Wow.Where is the \\"Snow Crash\\" movie? It would be a mosh of \\"Black Rain\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"The Matrix\\", \\"Star Gate\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Brazil\\", and \\"The Sopranos\\". Yes, the book gets a little deep in Sumerian languages and pre-monotheistic religions, but if you find those topics interesting too (I do), this book has the potential to sweep you off your feet. Overlook the little errors or annoyances and see the big picture. One of the three best books I've read this year."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book, which one has to keep in mind was written circa 1988 -- long before the Internet craze, and as such I feel it was in many ways much ahead of its time. Stephenson's writing style I found to be very tongue-in-cheek from page 1 to page 480. I also found the manner in which he took (accepted as) factual ancient Sumerian legends and re-&quot;engineered&quot; them into a credible basis for the story line fairly ingenious. I don't recall hearing of anyone else making the same connection between the human brain and computers before, I mean other than the obvious, that they both are capable of making calculations and decisions, but to tie in the fact that they can both have communicable viruses, was an interesting thread. His social commentary on America only producing four decent items anymore: &quot;Music, Movies, Microcode, and Fast Pizza Delivery&quot;, I found priceless, let alone the suggestion that the Mafia is more trustworthy and honorable than the Federal Government (Hmmmmmmm, there may be something there). Anyway, this book has it all and then some as long as you don't take it, or yourself, too seriously."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash, is without a doubt, one of the most adventurous techno-thrillers I've ever read. Stephenson has managed to interweave fact, mythology, and his own fiction to create a plot so intertwined and multi-faceted that you'll probably never fully understand it. :) But that's okay, because Stephenson has also packed the book full of exciting fight scenes, huge explosions (well, one at least), sex, and special effects. The world Stephenson creates in Snow Crash is both incredibly fantastical and fully believable. One must wonder how often Stephenson himself got lost in the plot while writing this book. So, if you enjoy a good techno-thriller, an exciting action novel, or just an all-around incredible book, give Snow Crash a try."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash contains at least 7,000 clever ideas, any one of which could form the basis of a personal philosophy, a system of government, a business plan, a religion, a video game, an action movie, a floor wax, or a dessert topping. How can an author include so many ideas within the plot of a novel? Well, he can't: they stick out of the actual story like Post-It notes on book pages.Neal Stephenson has never heard of the writer's motto \\"Show, don't tell\\", so instead you get \\"conversations\\" that consist of character X asking, \\"What do you know about Sumerian mythology?\\", to which character Y responds with a 6-page encyclopedia entry. In other parts of the book, the author can't even be bothered with that meager illusion of story-telling, and simply presents large slabs of information directly to the reader, without bothering the actual characters, who presumably have other things to do.Oddly, there are characters in this book. The hero, or protagonist, is named Hiro Protagonist, no doubt to let us know who to root for. He fortuitously has every skill necessary to allow him to foil someone in their nefarious plot to do something - I never could figure it all out. Hiro can wield katana swords in both real life and online, program rings around anyone else on earth, ride a motorcycle expertly, sort out abstruse problems in hieroglyphics and neurolinguistics, and master any weapon that lands in his hands. How does this paragon make his living? Delivering pizzas, of course.The major bad guy, before we meet the actual major bad guy, is a dude named Raven, who routinely filets anyone he has a grudge against - and he has a grudge against the entire USA - and who tools around on his own motorcycle with a nuclear weapon in the sidecar. When he gets in over his head in a fight, he threatens to detonate the nuke and, for some reason, people capitulate. I guess he's never met anyone nuttier than he is to say, \\"Go ahead.\\" Or maybe he's just the prime example of an observation of mine that, in any confrontation, the craziest person wins.My favorite character is YT, but then I'm a sucker for a 15-year-old girl who can rescue herself from any danger, thank you very much, and, after a long night of adventure, change back into her schoolgirl persona so her mom won't worry about her. She's a package courier: note this for later discussions.In this world, government - all government - has abdicated its responsibilities, and the power vacuum has been filled by various corporations that have staked out various territories and enticed the population into a bewildering array of multiple citizenships. Everyone seems to have a business-slash-government, including the Mafia, the Yakuza, white supremacists, Hong Kong, and televangelists. A lot of the fun in the novel - and it is very funny in places - arises from Stephenson satirizing actual businesses and governments with the logical outcome of their development.Stephenson is celebrated in geek circles for inventing the idea of the metaverse, an online world where the avatars of actual people can interact regardless of the real physical location of the people involved. He describes the metaverse exhaustively and exhaustingly. Some people claim that modern MMORPGs owe a lot to his description, but I don't quite see it. What he's describing does seem a lot like the clunky old video game BattleZone.You will learn a lot from this book, about ancient Sumer, neurolinguistics, the Aleuts, World War II, computer viruses, Japanese swordfighting, program design, religion, robotic dogs (or, possibly, dogotic robots), archeology, economics, fractal blades, bureaucracy, Mafia respect rituals, skateboard technology, virtual reality, the Gospel as mental vaccination, and a new interpretation of the Biblical story of Babel. It has a central intriguing idea about the possibility of crashing the software that runs on the human brain, the Snow Crash of the title. This problem is never actually solved in the book, but enough bad guys die to make it all seem worthwhile, and enough survive to make a sequel possible.I read this book because I realized that there were some gaps in my geek cred, but it's hard to recommend Snow Crash. It has some nice writing, but the relentless firehose of information is overwhelming. If you do read it, at least you know what to expect.It's interesting to contrast Snow Crash with Virtual Light, by William Gibson. They were published around the same time (1992 and 1993, respectively). Both deal with the consequences of economic near-collapse. Both have strong female leads who are couriers. Both involve extended chases around MacGuffins.However, Virtual Light is by far the superior novel. Gibson doesn't hit us over the head with economic theory and lectures, as Stephenson does. Instead, he shows ordinary people selling items they've scavenged from the trash, to make ends meet (as Gibson himself did before earning success as a writer), or being denied entrance to restaurants or hotels reserved for the uber-class. He doesn't explain the origin, development, and implications of technology, as Stephenson does. Instead, he shows people wearing goggles and talking to what looks like a dinosaur, or worshipping TV. It doesn't take much to get the reader the message. A picture is worth a thousand words, even if the picture is described in words.Also, Virtual Light has actual characters that we care about. Rydell is a genuinely good person recruited to do a dirty job he doesn't suspect. Chevette is a very real young woman who doesn't know how to live her life, having had no good role models. Even Skinner, a down-and-outer who has gained an almost oracular reputation just because he's survived so much, is a fascinating character we can care about. Maybe this is why I re-read Virtual Light about once a year, but I wouldn't re-read Snow Crash for a largish sum of money.Therefore, my recommendation is that, if Snow Crash sounds at all interesting, you read as much as you can stand, then read Virtual Light. See if you agree with me."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I don't like to label books, movies and music. All I care is if I have fun with them or not. And, reading \\"Snow crash\\" I surely did.Neal Stephenson's plots are so crazy and involve elements so appearently unrelated that trying to explain the plot here will only spoil some of the fun. It's enough to say that \\"Snow crash\\" is about a near future that is very dark, yet brightly colored by Stephenson's good writing. Add to that a main character that is the greatest sword fighter in the world, a teenage girl who fears almost nothing, a gigantic aleut who carries an atomic bomb wherever he goes, a virtual reality universe called The Metaverse, an enormous conglomeration of boats drifting in the Pacific close to the californian coast, and an ancient sumerian cult that is capable to interact with the human brain in a most unusual way, and we have a sample of what is \\"Snow crash\\".But there's more. Stephenson is able to write, in the same breath, sex, action, pursuits, sword fights, and technological stuff. What's best, when it's needed, Stephenson's didatics is great. He deals with some very misty subjects, and yet he is able to make the reader completely at ease. His characters are very unusual, greatly developed, colorful and interesting. Some of his ideas are so crazy that they may be hard to grasp at once. But when you understand the greater picture behind Stephenson's main ideas, \\"Snow crash\\" is a very entertaining book. My only complaint is about the ending. I expected a bit more in the final moments of the story.If you have read \\"Cryptonomicon\\", there's no way to compare the Snow crash's plot with Cryptonomicon. Cryptonomicon is much more complex and lenghty. But Snow crash has the same allucinating pace, and Stephenson's characteristic style of writing. Which is, difficult but engrossing.Grade 9.0/10"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash may be known in many cirlces as \\"that pizza mafia book,\\" but for those who have actually taken the time to read more than the first few pages featured as excerpts at the ends of other books, it is an extraordinary ride into the near future that blends cyberpunk and linguistics and archaeology all into an amazing, fast-paced tale.There is indeed the pizza mafia; the appropriately named main character Hiro Protagonist begins the book as a driver for THE pizza delivery chain, whose owner/don personally guarantees on-time delivery (and woe be the deliveryman who fails to make good and make the godfather look bad). This near-future world features a religion spawned upon Elvis, a destabalized government where the military has sold off aircraft carriers to stay solvent, and inflation that results in people carrying around \\"megabucks\\" ($1,000,000 bills!!) as small change.The story focuses on the attempted world domination of a media mogul and founder of Elvis worship whose virus passed from computer screen to hackers' brains is an attempt both to recreate the pre-Babel days and also to control the minds of his employees and the people of the world as a whole. Aspects of Sumerian and Babylonian mythology intertwine with gritty cyberpunk to make the novel a real page-turner filled with characters like an Aleutian whose motorcycle contains a Soviet nuclear torpedo wired to explode upon his death, a punk young skateboard-bound delivery girl, and the aforementioned Hiro Protagonist and pizza mafiaoso.This book is a definite read for fans of cyberpunk of any sort. Though less intellectual than his following \\"Diamond Age,\\" Stephenson's Snow Crash is still an excellent read that threatens to overwhelm the senses."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Not being into cyberpunk (as a genre), I took a friend's advice and read Snow Crash. I wasn't disappointed.Neal Stephenson's &quot;in your face&quot; writing, grabs you by the shoulders and rockets you through the not-so-far-away future, ruled by franchises such as Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong and The Mafia -- You've Got a Friend in the Family!, and policed by franchises like The MetaCops. A future with public street computer terminals on every corner, so you can log onto the MetaVerse, because virtual reality beats staring at the walls of your U-Stor-It 20x30 space.Published at a time when CompuServe, Prodigy, and AOL were just taking off, Snow Crash gives you a glimpse of how things might (and probably will) be, and as an added plus, gives you a lesson in ancient history. The main characters have just enough attitude to make you care about their mis/adventures through the prefab, neon landscape, and even though the history lesson slows you down, it's not as if you aren't learning anything in the process.I recommend this book to everyone whose social life consists of booting up and logging on, and to whomever appreciates the type of fast-paced, creative, and humorous writing that Neal Stephenson seems to excel at."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is a complete waste of time. It is the worst book I have EVER read. I just kept reading it because someone recommended it to me and I was desperately hoping something interesting would happen, giving my friend the benefit of the doubt. In the end, nothing did happen. So the Raven guy tries to nuke America in cyberspace. So he fails. 500 pages of irrelevant mini tangents preceding the obvious denouement. The Sumerian legend junk and Hiro's paralleling of it to a computer/brain virus is completely far-fetched and boring (I had to skip entire paragraphs about the Ashkeran junk, it was so stupid). Then the book is peppered with spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, poor choice of words, and obvious mathematical fallacies (2^2 = 8? ). Trying to get something out of this book is like trying to get nutrients from a chewed up piece of bubble gum."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was required to read Snow Crash as a school assignment. I figured that since I am a computer nerd I might get a few kicks out of this \\"cyberpunk\\" novel. I was sadly mistaken. Honestly, I think this book is terrible. I was immediately turned off when I first read that the main character's name is \\"Hiro Protagonist\\". I mean come on, can it get any cheesier? He is a sword carrying samurai who makes a living delivering pizzas for the mafia. He and his teenage Kourier sidekick Y.T. get involved with a new drug in the Metaverse (a virtual world that is beginning to take the place of reality) called Snow Crash. The entire novel is so far fetched from reality that I often had to reread pages, and sometimes chapters, to make sure that I understood what was going on. The level and style of writing is quite easy to understand, but one would get lost in the content if one wasn't familiar with the subject. There are pages full of information about the origins of ancient civilizations and their languages and endless allusions to computer programming. I would only recommend this novel as a cure for insomnia, because I found myself nodding off more than a few times trying to get through it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Comic book cyberpunk. I didn't care about the characters and thought some of the good 'uns were soul-less. Also, there is a strong anti-American, anti-capitalist vibe to this book. There is a character in the story who is &quot;Bill Gates-level wealthy&quot; yet who has given the world nothing useful. Well, 'the rich' DO provide useful goods and services, thus they have wealth. One positive note: very well done Sumerian mythology blend with plotline."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Publishers who turn off text to speech should be boycotted.

My guess is that this book probably appeals to immature teenage boys with raging hormones (nothing wrong with that, per se, it's just that the book feels as if it was written by someone stuck in puberty) and those with limited imaginations - it certainly is not what one might call \\"literature.\\" At best, it may be possible to that state the author has an \\"imagination,\\" however, that doesn't make this book a creative experience. The story weaves and spins through endless threads that come from nowhere and then disappear, completely, into the ether. Got too much time on your hands and want something to scramble you brain on? Then this book is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere for substance - this book doesn't have any."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The technology in exceptional science fiction has a sort of timeless quality to it. Dune, Armor, and Enders Game are all common examples of books that I think do a wonderful job with technology. The things described are either thoroughly alien and a delight to imagine, or have already come to be in some form but the foresight exhibited by the author is still impressive. This book, written in 1992, dares to explore the amazing technological breakthroughs of 1996. Attempting to read it in 2007 was a painful experience. Any immersion I had in the story was destroyed when the protagonist started speaking about computers and I was reminded of my copy of \\"DOS for dummies\\" I had in middle school (years ago)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I don't know why people everywhere - and I don't mean to be sexist but particularly men - are going crazy for this book.

It has great bones, Sumerian bones to be precise and Neal Stephenson comes up with a lovely social structure, fabulous underpinnings and rationalisations that make cyberheads pant with desire to live with.But when it opens its mouth puleeeeasse. Particularly painful is its treatment of women: sexy but too young. Unattractive but brainy. A woman who is a genius, but whose Metaverse wielding friends consign her to designing faces - this is one lady who hit the glass ceiling with a huge smack. Not to forget frumpy old mum, who doesn't mind sadistic humiliation at the hands of a Government agency, just for the chance to type until her eyes fall out.

I finally put the book down after 6 weeks and 273 pages. I just couldn't take it anymore. I would have stopped a long time before now, but I don't like leaving books unfinished. In this case, not finishing is better than the alternative...Nothing every really happened in the book, at least not the part I read. There were a few scenes where something actually transpired besides dialog or author rambling, but the scenes were shallow and short.I kept waiting for some big event to take place after all the description, but over half way through the book, it never did. I just feel like I wasted the last 5 weeks trying to get through this book, when normally it takes me only a week to get through one that can keep my attention.I was not impressed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Bad, silly, superficial and really, really boring.

Unfortunately the first two free chapters were explanation, description and backstory ending with a futuristic pizza delivery guy crashing into an empty swimming pool.With numerous f-bombs, lack of action, and wondering when the author was going to get to the real conflict and story line, I have no interest in paying to read the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The old school SF writers were put through the grill of writing for SF pulp magazines. To get their story bought byu an editor they had to write &quot;Hooks&quot;. First lines that would convinve the editor, reading hundreds of trash stories a week, to choose their missive. The best survived and became the shapers of all we know of SF. Snow Crash has a hook of a first line. The whole first sequence is a hook. Not just a hook for the book, or a hook for a lifetime of reading Stephenson's work, but a hook on SF as something that will survive to the future without just Gibson (wonderful though he is) holding it up.Snow Crash - rip roaring adventuure, self aware, a hero, a heroine, gangsters and a sympathetic villain with a nuclear bomb, and an attitude."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"You have to admire a writer who has the guts to name his hero/protagonist &quot;Hiro Protagonist.&quot; What seperates this book from the rest of the cyberschlock that litters bookstore shelves is an incredibly skewed sense of future Americana (pizza delivery is free if it doesn't make it in 30 minutes or less, complete with an apology from the Mafia Godfather, and the, um, termination of the hapless delivery boy), combined with some very heavy philosophy and ancient history. This book has scope, with nothing less at stake than the battle for control of the thoughts and actions of the future's cyberspace residents!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Brilliant!

I liked it so much that I've read it 3 times and still laughed. I hope Neal writes another one as entertaining as this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The vast majority of this book is an incredibly well-conceived, fascinating sci fi adventure taking place in a bizarre cross between modern LA, Mad Max, the Libertarian dream-world, and the Matrix. Its characters are well-written, witty, and as realistic as they need to be; the social commentary is hilarious and extremely relevant; the mix of future-slang, technological explanations, and real English is perfect. Everything up to and including the last page will keep you riveted.My one qualm with Snow Crash is that there are a few very long passages attempting to connect the events of the novel to events in ancient, ancient history and religion that not only make very little sense, but also have a Dan Brown-eque feeling of half-researched mumbo-jumbo. Worst of all, these passages add next to nothing to the book: they attempt to explain events and motivations already made perfectly clear by what we know of the characters and the world they live in (which are, again, both incredible things).If you enjoy science fiction, samurai, skateboards, pizza, or dystopian novels, you'll enjoy Snow Crash."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a funny, hilarious and fabulous book.Ever since I have read it, I have never looked at the late pizza delivery guys the same way (you'll get this early in the book).I loved the plot, loved the characters even those of canine persuasion and enjoyed this book so much I was sorry it ended."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of my favorite books...both fun and fascinating.

My brother had this, so I borrowed it, and was surprised by how much I liked it.I always like it when a writer can craft a believable world with new cultures and technology that are interesting, and Stephenson does this very well in Snow Crash. The only proble I had with the setting is that it seems to close to the present for everything to have changed as much as it had in the story, even considering it was written in the early 90s.The characters were really well developed with a lot of interesting relationships tying them all together. And the story itself was interesting with several different aspects that were woven together pretty well. The one thing about the story that bothered me was that I didn't think that simply being able to understand binary would enable anyone to gain any meaning from a picture representing something in binary as the story suggests. Actually, I'm not sure how many programmers today ever work with anything in binary, anyway, much less in the future. But that was not a difficult thing to dismiss and just accept in the context of the story.I'll probably give Cryptonomicon a shot now, and I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a little comedic, sci-fi, cyberpunk."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you are looking for a fun and stylish cyberpunk book, this is for you.

I quite honestly couldn't put it down - extremely action packed, better than most movies I've seen lately.I'd almost say I'd like to see Snow Crash made into a movie, but I don't think anyone could do it justice.This book has hi-tech gadgets, pizza deliveries, super computers, elaborate and well researched conspiracies, skater-delivery girls, religious commentary, motorcycle sword fights, archeology, fantastic weapons, a few heavy chunks of pure fantasy, machine enhanced gaurd dogs, and much much much more.Absolutely Enjoyable.Once you start the first page you'll have trouble putting it down."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What can one say about a cyberpunk classic like this one? Surely most fans of the cyberpunk genre will have already read (and loved) this seminal work, but plenty of surprises await those who are just discovering this peculiar sub-genre. In a not-too-distant future, Snow Crash is a mysterious newly-emerging virus (does it affect people or their computers? What's the difference?) It's the story of how a racially diverse everyman named Hiro Protagonist and his feisty young (15!) girlfriend Y.T. have to save the world from a nefarious plot to enslave all humanity. And who do they turn to for help, but the Mafia?This book is wild, hip, intelligent, sprawling, darkly comic, and a deliberate jibe at many of our culture's basic values (religion, work ethic, etc...). It's a highly detailed futuristic sci-fi adventure into epistemology, virtual reality, Oriental sword fighting, and of course, skateboarding. Bizarre characters inhabiting bizarre cultures in two very bizarre worlds (real and virtual) lead readers through an unforgettable adventure, filled with action, fun, and sardonic silliness. The modest levels of sex and violence are handled with such breezy unreality that there's no shock value to upset more fastidious readers, although younger teens may find this book too long for their liking. Some sections seem to move pretty slowly (Hiro's researches, for example), but there's so much to love about Shepherdson's 21st Century America that most readers will surely want to wade through this tome's 500-plus pages more than once."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really don't understand why so many people rate this book so highly. The book starts out with what I thought was a firmly tongue-in-cheek rendition of a cyberpunk world. World government has collapsed, resulting in each housing subdivision becoming a separate country. Everything is franchised, right down to police and jails. Freeways are privately owned and operated. And the main characters' names are Hiro Protagonist and Y.T. (Yours Truly). I snickered all the way through the first chapter.Then comes the well-researched but heavy-handed explanation of speaking in tongues and how these sounds may be the microcode of the human brain. Pages and pages of such explanation, very seriously discussed, clashing garishly with the whimsical setting of the book.At the end of the book, I still liked the setting and the characters. I just wished Stephenson could have found a whimsical story to go with them."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this book a few months ago and loved it. It is very entertaining and has a very interesting story. It is mainly about a different type of virus that can infect you through your blood or your computer. This book has everything from hackers, virtual reality, and cyborg dogs, to the mofia, odd cults, samuria sword fights and mind control dating back to ancient religions. If you haven't read this yet, you should definitly get it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is a great storyteller. Vivid descriptions of his imaginings of the California of tomorrow, and at least two great characters. The computer science and RPG stuff (role playing games) is a little dated but it really doesn't matter because the story line is so good, the pace is steady, and the denoument is satisfying. I actually liked Stephenson's &#34;Reamde&#34; a little more, but this was still a fun read. Be aware that Stephenson is a very smart guy, I would have to assume he's MENSA-level, so there's no sophmoric or dumbed-down rhetoric in his writing even though at first glance you might think his target audience is under-20's. Not really. I'm a 60+ Ivy-educated guy and I loved it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"For years my friends have been telling me I should read Snow Crash as it was such an important book, helping to launch the whole cyberpunk thing. Well, I finally got around to it and I have to say that I was disappointingly underwhelmed. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I love the frenzied pace that the book started out with and I loved the humor found throughout but overall I just couldn't get into it that much nor could I really empathize with the characters.While I enjoyed Stephenson's charaters what bothered me was that there didn't seem to be much in the way of relationship development. It just seemed that characters met in order to move the plot along, nothing felt very organic. Take Y.T. and Hero for example; they meet in crazy circumstances and on a very superficial level and next thing you know Y.T. is asking Hero if he wants to partner up, which just seems so against everything that we have learned about Y.T., but hey it helps to move the plot in the right direction.Yet, Stephenson spends page after page after page explaining and rationalizing this whole concept that computer viruses, biological viruses, and information all are interconnected and that these connections can be traced to their roots in the Sumerian culture. I think that Stephenson got enamoured with his own brillant idea that had to spend way too much time telling the reader what a brillant ideait was and then trying to rationalize it to us again and again. I think many of those pages would have been better spent developing some of those relationships that were never properly flushed out.Despite its flaws I still liked the book. Didn't love it but liked it enough. And it was fun to see how so many of the concepts, first introduced in this book, became tropes found throughout the entire cyberpunk universe."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I had high expectations for this book, which may have underscored how let down I was when I finally got to reading it.First, the good. Some of the grandiose ideas bandied about (i.e, connecting together computer viruses, linguistics, Sumerian civilization, & religion) were pretty clever, and really enjoyable to read. Also, the description and fleshing out of the 'metaverse' concept was well-done and synched up with what is happening today when you think of online communities such as Second Life.However, a few things really irritated me about this book.First, the writing style in general wasn't for me. The plot and characters seemed like they were pulled out of a comic book. Some folks may see this as a plus, but it's not my thing. The violence is implausible and over the top--I'm not squeemish, but violence loses its effect when it's done in a cartoonish manner. The main antagonist is an impossibly powerful, bad mofo, to the extent that reading about his butt-kicking quickly got boring and predictable. The main protagonist walks around with samurai swords. Ultimately, the absurdity of it all just becomes distracting.Also, many of the author's attempts at being cool, witty or funny just end up coming off as awkward. Naming your hero/protagonist \\"Hiro Protagonist\\"? Lame. Sushi K's rap lyrics? Cringe-worthy.The ending is unsatisfying. This esoteric po-mo convention may have resonated as exceptionally clever with the literati back in 1992, but at this point, it's just boring and annoying, and looks like he just gave up. Dear authors: please finish your books...if we wanted to use our imaginations to finish them ourselves, we wouldn't have piggy-backed off of your imagination for the first 99% of the story.Finally, a lot of the predictions made about the near future were off, and frankly, a bit half-baked. Since the novel was written, the Japanese economic empire has crumbled, nobody uses the word \\"Soviet\\" anymore, South African Apartheid is dead. These all were featured predominantly in the book, but are completely irrelevant today. And other than the metaverse, most of the technological predictions made by the author were pretty off--we're more advanced in some respects he could've never predicted, and way, way behind on others. This isn't the author's fault--he tried and did better than most people ever could. However, the fact is that near-future sci-fi's usually don't age well, and that includes this book.Overall, I find it difficult to recommend this book; younger readers who would enjoy the over-the-top action would be put off by the now-irrelevant technological predictions. Mature readers would be more understanding of this, and would enjoy the book's more intellectual aspirations, but would likely be turned off by its juvenile style.In other words, just wait for the movie...it should have some cool explosions and fight scenes."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is probably my favorite book ever. Every year Stephenson's biting satire of American culture becomes funnier and more relevant. Reading his vision of sprawling, congested future driven by fast communication and business franchising gone awry one quickly sees that Stephenson is not trying to predict the future, but to scewer the present.Written in 1992, before Starbucks ruled the world and e-commerce was a buzz word, Stephenson's vision has become closer and closer to a reality."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"An explorational book. The future of the Internet as avatar-interaction is explored. The history of language is explored. The relationship between commerce and morality grows more and more in sync over time. But there's too much blood 'n' guts in it for me. It reads like it was written to become a movie and makes large leaps in character, warfare, geography and hacking. Maybe a more mature Stephenson will write more mature books. I do look forward to reading more of his books."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is an exceptional modern science fiction novel. In this book, the main character, Hiro, faces a corrupt world of cyber-punks. As a reader you will become quickly engrossed in the futuristic stream-lined world of the Metaverse, a virtual computer-generated world. This book is recomended to any science fiction lover. From Neal Stepehenson's use of hip attitude and profanity, this work is very realistic as well as realistic. The only drawback of the book is that is is long, but, it is still good."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash starts out very gripping and slowly loses its grasp as the book progresses. Stephenson, who always seems in dire need of an editor, has this tendency to over-explain everything. What could be summarised in a paragraph is often drawn out into an entire chapter.Still, the characters are engaging and even when the writing drags a bit, the plotline is entertaining. One of these days, someone will sit down with Stephenson and say &quot;Trim,&quot; and a phenomenal book will result. Until then, merely good books like this will result."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I love this book, but it could have used a more hard-nosed editor to cut out some of the vast reams of exposition in the latter 2/3 of the book. Otherwise, this is a highly-charged jaunt through all sorts of locales, virtual and otherwise. The first few chapters alone are worth the price of admission. This is a great book to give to someone who says &quot;I don't like to read science fiction&quot; (and yet that person will watch science fiction blockbusters all summer at the movies, hmmm, never did figure that one out). What will draw these new readers in is Stephenson's wild ideas of the future--it doesn't matter whether the futuristic ideas presented (like burbclaves) will come true or not (although many think we already live in a Snow Crash-esque world already). The point is that they're FUN, and not dumbed down--Stephenson provides a feast of visual sensations that are enthralling, and not just for techies or Trekkies."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I found Snow Crash to be a captivating and very enjoyable cyberpunk fiction book. Despite its enjoyability, I did at times find it hard to follow the story to the end without repeating certain areas. Neal Stephenssen leaps into the near future by weaving virtual reality, Sumerian myth, and just about everything imaginable together to bring us this thriller of the information age. I find that this story is rather complex, but Stephensen does a good job of keeping the action hot and the characters engaging. The main character, Hiro Protagonist, is a freelance programmer who comes upon a conspiracy that threatens hackers with a virus leaving them in a vegatative state. Hiro takes on the challenge of deciphering who is behind it and how to stop them. Joining him is a young skater who has gotten the attention of the Mafia King. I had fun reading this book. This is my first cyberpunk novel, leaving the others to try to compare to this. The scary thing about this story is its wild and eerie view of the future that may before long prove accurate if things continue at the speed they are now."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book was unique in its story line and method of joiningbiblical philosophy and near future technology. Unfortunately, itseems to be written for a 13 year old audience. The plot was always predictable. But, it was entertaining in the same way a comic book is pure fantasy. Overall, a good book to read if you find one laying around and have some time on their hands. END"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As I was thumbing through the books to read for my senior colloquium class, I almost fell asleep just reading the short two or three sentence descriptions about the books. Internet and society, a very interesting topic, if you're in a group and discussing amongst each other, though by yourself, it is a real sleeper. When I came across the book Snow Crash, by Neil Stephenson, I thought I would give it a whirl. It is a science fiction book, so it would have to be more interesting and entertaining than reading about Dell Computers marketing strategy. I start out reading the book and I see the main character, Hiro Protagonist, delivering pizzas. My first impression was, what the hell does this have to do with computers. I thought that I had definitely made a mistake choosing the longer book because it sounded interesting. As I read a few more pages Stephenson adds a little more to the book. For example: skateboard couriers who harpoon cars, mafias who intern own the rivaling pizza joints, and a virtual world known as the metaverse. This metaverse was quite intriguing in that you could walk, talk, and act like you would in the normal world. Though, it is paralleled to computers now days. Each person plugs into a port and uses an avatar, their virtual self, to communicate. Depending on your computer and your ability, you can have a real elaborate avatar or a simple avatar, denoting your poor skills and computer. A skilled swordsman Hiro is, in both the metaverse and the real world, we learn that he is also a freelance &quot;hacker.&quot; A new virus has stepped on the seen in the metaverse, the only problem is that it also is a drug in the real world and effects people in the real world. It is a race against time for Hiro and his friends to find the distributor and end this virus known as snow crash. To complicate things worse, Stephenson gives the distributor of snow crash, whose name is Raven, a nuclear warhead that will detonate if he is killed. As I read the story, Stephenson really made a good parallel to the way we actually use the Internet. Many people in Stephensons' book plugged into the metaverse for hours on end becoming dehumanized just as people in our world get on the Internet and chat lines and become dehumanized. Stephenson does a good job in telling a real story of our world and it's Internet addiction through a very stimulating science fiction story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I stumbled across this book a few years ago, and since then I have read it over and over again. It's quirky, funny, and completely engaging; I just wish it was longer. I read a lot, but this book is--and will stay!--one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This novel lived up to all the hype surrounding it and then some. I read it in very quickly. It was very hard to put it down, yet it was interesting as well. I really liked all the main characters and a lot of the technologies used in the novel. Stephenson obviously put a lot of time into researching for this novel, and gives it a nice twist to make it seem very plausible. (for a sci-fi novel) I really can't wait to read his other novels."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a very funny book, written in a non-scientific style. You won't find yourself going back to the sentence or paragraph before to reread it. This is an excellent book. It's highly entertaining and won't be able to stop reading it for longer than 15 minutes."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book stimulated ideas and creativity on my part. While taking a break from designing a company intranet I read this book. I started reading it on the way to Tahiti and was quite confused by the begining. After 10 days in Moorea and Bora Bora I picked it up again on the flight home. After that I could not put it down. Yes some parts did not fit into the scheme of things but over-all Snow Crash was a stimulating concept."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"plenty of people have told you the sorry so ill just say this this book is science FICTION it is not real it is for fun not all the facts have to be realsometimes for a good story everything cant be real dont be a nitpicker enjoy the book as a fine work of FICTION not science fac"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"More brilliant concepts in the first hundred pages than in a year's collected ramblings by anyone who uses the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; in conversation.It's too bad the rest of book is only there to justify the fantastic beginning. This seems to be true of all of Mr. Stephenson's work so far.Read it for the ideas. Be forwarned, as I was, that it goes flat for awhile then throws in everything in the author's notes to finish the book (maybe he was running out of disk space), and you'll enjoy yourself immensely."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"There are only two books I have ever read that even compare to this book: A Canticle For Leibowitz&quot; and &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;. This is by far the greatest science fiction, in terms of goodness, that I have ever read, or probably will read in the near future. Claiming that ancient Sumerian wasn't the language of all mankind misses the entire point. It is possible (although certainly not likely), and who's to say that the ancients haven't tricked us all? Granted, the end is rather odd, like he was crammed for space, but who cares? It's not supposed to be too philosophically deep, so the ending isn't all that important. Snow Crash is THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THERE IS NONE HIGHER"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It's good, for all the reasons you can see in other reviews. Having read The Diamond Age first, I was forwarned that he can't do endings. It didn't matter so much here, the ending was &quot;good enough&quot;. Loved it. -----HOWEVER---- I thought the lack of acknowledgement to Gibson was cynical. He said that he prefered &quot;Metaverse&quot; over &quot;virtual reality&quot;, without mentioning &quot;cyberspace&quot;, which must be a deliberate snub to the seminal work. Something must have sneaked through into his sub-conscious mind though. See page 414 (on my book) where he refers to &quot;doing a wilson&quot;. In Neuromancer that was the phrase for a noteworth victim of black-ice. In this book it was used for falling off a skateboard.--------------Anyone not into cyberpunk must wonder what I'm gibbering on about ! Read this book and discover the genre."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Ok, so it's not historically accurate and the plottends to jump around a bit. But if you've read &amp; enjoyedbooks like the Neuromancer series, Islandsin the Net, True Names, and other cyberpunkclassics, this book is for you. It's fast-paced,absurd, and engaging - just the model we need forthinking about what cyberspace is and whatwe hope it will someday look like."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"snow crash bears the stamp of extensive rewrite, andand the action can sometimes seem out of step.

The book made me laugh out loud(really). Stephenson creates characters that are both outrageous and credible. His ideas about the internet are innovative and are beginning to materialize. I wish he would write a sequel to Snow Crash. Outstanding job"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I found this book earthshattering. Not that I like what's called &quot;Cyberpunk,&quot; because I feel it's somewhat superficial. But this book took us to where I believe we will be in the future....to a degree. I think we will be a &quot;Net&quot; based society, and I think it will happen faster than most think.If you cut out the &quot;far out&quot; stuff, I think you can get to the core of where society is going. And remember, this was written BEFORE the &quot;internet of today&quot; was conceived.....but I do think a large part of our internet formed because of the influence of this book. I would really like to talk to the author some day.....and shake his hand"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you are a serious &#34;techie&#34; then this may be an interesting read for you. There is so much inter-acting between the cyber world and the real world that most of the time you don't know if you are in the real world or the cyber world. I have plodded through over 25% of the book and it feel as though every page is introducing new characters with character descriptions that go on forever with no advancement of the plot. There has been a hint as to what Snow Crash is but so far as not been introduced into the plot of the story. I will attempt to continue reading this book and if the plot becomes easier to read. I will give up reading this novel."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I actually lost my original copy in a roof-leaking misfortune; this was one of the lucky few to be repurchased. I hadn't read it since it first came out, and as I began rereading it, I was afraid it was a little dated. What actually &#34;dated&#34; it though, was more the fact that Mr Stephenson needed to explain a lot of the tech that we now take for granted because the book was written before a lot of the ideas and concepts became commonplace. Once I got past the small bouts of over-explanation I thoroughly enjoyed my reread."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As far as the fiction goes, the story is a slow build up, but there is a wonderful general sense of humor about things that kept me turning the page long after I gave up on the fact this would not be my favorite Stephenson book. As the book went on between the sumerian history lessons, and development of Y.T. and Hiro it was hard not to fall in love with the story.Reading this now in 2012, the Metaverse seems like a quaint notion that's a blip compared to what actually happened with the internet, but Stephenson's take on how everything in the future becomes privatized because the government just collapses in on itself seems potentially accurate after seeing several states I've lived in sell off their prison systems, roads, and various other services that were largely believed to be exclusively a government function when this book was written (NOTE: no public commentary on what's right or wrong here. absolutely not interested in that discussion). Hilariously to our modern notions, at one point the President of the United States has to point out who he is because no one recognizes him or is even that impressed when they find out who he is."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The first thing I notice about this book is the cheesy name for the main character &#34;Hiro Protagonist&#34; after that though, the book really picks up and is a fun read, though the graphic sex scene involving a 15 year old girl was a bit disconcerting.Snow Crash is an exciting drug-fueled cyberpunk adventure that is worth the read. However, the ending was lacking. The book just sort of stops, which was kind of disappointing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'm a huge fan of Charles Stross and Neal Stephenson's earlier books. Upon rereading this book, I quickly remembered what I loved so much about it 15 years ago. Brilliant, visionary, fast paced, hilarious. Recommended to anyone who likes SF. It's a classic and created a whole subgenre of SF."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"...Stephenson's world-building is fantastic, and I had to keep reminding myself that this was published back in the early '90s, because it feels like it could have been written more recently. I'm not sure if Snow Crash is the result of pure genius, or a lot of research, or both (probably both), but the world Stephenson creates for this book includes enough realistic elements that it feels like a very plausible future, and I found it very interesting to get into...Even when there are breaks from the action, I still wouldn't exactly call it a \\"lull.\\" It took me a long time to actually finish this book, because school kind of took over my life for a while this past semester, but even after a month or two, I was able to pick this up and remembered everything that had been going on without having to flip back and refresh my memory. Some books, you know you would have to do that, but I was too into this one to forget any of the details, and I think that is very telling of the ability Stephenson has to create a world and a story and characters that a reader can become truly invested in.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"An amazing novel from beginning to end. Over the top cyberpunk, archaic mythology, and the feeling that you are on a non stop roller coaster that's been so well planned out, you can just sit back and enjoy the ride. I didn't think anyone would surpass the genre founding work of William Gibson's Neuromancer. I was wrong."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of the first \\"cyberpunk\\" books written, and it's awesome. Stephenson creates characters that are well thought out, fully fleshed out, and a great story line that shifts from character to character, without being totally confusing. I read the book in one sitting - couldn't put it down, finished at like 2am. I've reread it about 10 times, but not for at least 5 years - I'll have to go back and give it another one now that I see it's a Kindle book. This is one book I highly recommend for anyone who reads SciFi/Fantasy genre books. Definitely a must for your Kindle Library. (Also, his book Cryptonomicon is another keeper, though it isn't really a fantasy or sci fi book per se; mixes history and the present (or future) and lots of technology.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I loved Cryptonomicon (5 stars) and The Diamond Age (4.8 stars), but only liked Snow Crash. Overall, I wasn't disappointed, it just wasn't quite as a good as the other two.It's well written in his usual style, and I actually felt less of the minor let down I felt at the conclusion of Cryptonomicon and Diamong Age. However, the mythology stuff was a little heavy handed, the scenes in the library and later at the meeting in Ng's office stretched out too long, and broke the flow of the story a little with all the history lessons. In general, the metaphor/not-really-a-metaphor with the virus felt a little ham-fisted and left me with a bit of that sour Dan Brown after taste for a few pages.On the plus side, the skater motif was much better than it easily could have been. This kind of things runs the risk of turning into a cheesy Surf Ninjas kind of thing, but Stephenson handled it gracefully, maintaining it steadily through out the story with out over doing it.There's nothing too surprising in the Metaverse (virtual reality) for a modern reader, but it doesn't come off overly cheesy. Like the skater thing, Stephenson managed to hold this up without overdoing it for the most part.Overall, I would recommend it for anyone who likes Stephenson's work or cyber-fiction in general."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The first Neal Stephenson I read was \\"Anathem,\\" and I LOVED it. Loved it. So I was a bit taken aback when I started this one. I originally bought it for my Kindle because I like \\"Anathem\\" so much, but \\"Snow Crash\\" is pretty much completely, totally different. I find that a little unusual because most authors seem to stay somewhat within the same range of ideas.So at first I was really hesitant about this novel. As the characters and story developed more, I began to really enjoy it. Like \\"Anathem,\\" it takes a bit to get going. It's written in a back-and-forth between the characters' experiences, which may take some getting used to, but which heightens the suspense as the reader is left hanging with one character and thrust back into the story of another.It was really strange reading an author explaining what an \\"avatar\\" is (as well as some other techo stuff). Doesn't everyone know that? C'mon! Then I looked at the date of publication. Oh. That explains it.I enjoyed the conjunction of disparate ideas: Sumerian culture, virtual reality, biological and computer viruses. It was just *different* from the same old pulp fiction. Plus I learned some really interesting things, though a lot of the biblical theology was... shall we say, unorthodox.I'd highly recommend it. It's a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A screaming animee feel, a bit of dry humor, and a unique look at the future where the excesses of today are taken to the extreme, all come to mind upon reflection of _Snow_Crash_. Somewhere around the middle it does tend to prattle on a bit too long about the whole \`language as a virus' thing, but overall an excellent techno-thriller with strong characterizations (if a tad sexist at times). Definitely a book worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of the most exciting books I have ever read. It's smart and funny with furious action. Read it!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"thrashin', dude"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is 'classic' Stephenson, with all the warts and dimples that implies. The 'dimples' are the excellent sense of language-play, the shish-boom-bah opening sequence, and the truly intriguing alternate society.Heading up the 'warts' column is Stephenson's apparently congenital inability to write an actual *ending* to any of his books (see _The Big U_, _The Diamond Age_, and, while I'm only on page 637, doubtless _Cryptonomicon_ as well). The integration of high-tech and deep-past could have been done better (and has been done better, by other writers), but it's adequate.It's an interesting novel-of-ideas, and the much-maligned YT is actually one of the few teenaged characters that actually acts like a teenager -- spookily mature judgement paired with spontaneous lapses of horrible judgement, all slaved to a hormonal throttle -- very much like what I recall from my own adolescence. Hiro is a garbage character, sure, like someone's RPG character thrown into a novel, but he's a fine Beatrice to lead us through Stephenson's wittily described Infernal circles.If only he'd get out of the habit of writing himself into corners..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Nowhere near as significant as a groundbreaking book like Neuromancer, this book is a light and enjoyable read. That is, if you can overlook the gaping plot holes, overly smug tone, and (worst of all) about 50 pages of garbled ancient Sumerian crap, which was about 49 pages too many."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"After reading this book I just have to write a review about it.This is one of the best books I have ever read.There are no boring moments and the shift between the characters of YT and Hiro are excellent.If you want a book that you will read more than once or even if you are lookin for a great book to read look no further than Snow Crash"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a good summer time read. The lead characters are interesting, although the sinister &quot;Raven&quot; is not well defined. The middle of the book expands ad nauseum on an idea that should have taken far fewer pages. The ending of the book looks like it is begging for a sequel. All in all, this is an interesting book, and would be a very interesting book if 100 pages were trimmed out of it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Unless you're a holier-than-thou cyberpunk literature freak who feels us lesser mortals don't understand the 'genre', it's a good bet you'll enjoy this novel. However, Snow Crash is not perfect. One of the larger shortcomings is that some secondary characters are a bit underdeveloped considering the length of the book. Overall, it is not highbrow literature--nor is it intended as such--but it is a very enjoyable read.It is important to point out that Snow Crash was originally intended to be in graphic novel format, which may explain some of the book's shortcomings (the ending, cardboard secondary characters, etc). The reader should approach Snow Crash with this in mind."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is simply excellent. Although many people have said that the characters are shallow I would say that they have depth and, well, character. I have read this book five or six times and still I cannot tire of it. My only advice is - read this book. Borrow it, buy it or steal it - whatever you do, read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I suppose I'm a geeky Ph.D. (although not a computer/science/math geek), and I agree with many of the positive remarks in the reviews. However, I disagree with the frequent remarks about the linguisitic elements that, indeed, are at the heart of the book, and without which, frankly there is nothing more than some clever cocktail-hour chat with a rather warped, imaginative geek. I'm sorry that some readers were disappointed in the explanations in the book that in my mind were abbreviated (not lengthy) and necessary to make the plot work. As an undergraduate English major (which I realize hardly makes me a qualified reviewer) I certainly wouldn't call the exposition on these topics in the book &quot;poor writing.&quot; But, I guess I'm operating with different &quot;me&quot; under the influence of a different nam-shub."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Reading the opening chapter of this novel is like reading an adrenaline rush. I didn't know such a thing was possible; now I am convinced that it is. The entire book is a fantastic trip - humorous and excellently constructed. Stephenson's language is captivating. Overall, a wonderful read - I highly recommend it (and I'm not normally a sci-fi or future type reader, either)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hiro Protagonist, the book's main character, is what every young man wants to be. He's a high speed pizza deliveryman, hacker, and expert samurai swordsman. Unexpectedly steeped in a deadly mess of drugs, gangs, mythology, and religious fanaticism, he has to make sense of it all before his foes bring about the second &quot;Infocalypse.&quot;Snow Crash is thought provoking in its use of mythology and vision of the commercialistic future, but still careful not to get bogged down by its own complexity. It never loses its pace for an instant."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I first read this when it first came out, but after getting through Gibson's newest one, and since I found I didn't remember many of the details of _Snow Crash,_ it seemed time for a re-read. There are some interesting parallels between the world-setting and even the characters: Gibson and Stephenson both posit semi-anarchic worlds (Stephenson more so), both have teenage main characters who are couriers/messengers (Chevette on a bike, Y.T. on a skateboard), both have adult main characters who are out of the ordinary even in their native societies (Rydell is a rent-a-cop, Hiro is a freelance everything). But where Gibson has a quiet sort of delivery, almost like background music, Stephenson is often no-brakes, over the top. Neal brings in a lot of other very interesting narrative threads, too -- especially Sumerian mythology and neurolinguistic theory. And not to forget the notion of franchised mini-nations and the Mafia as a force for (relatively speaking) good. Hafta to make a note to re-read this one again in ten years. . . ."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My favorite book of all time. This is reminiscent of all that I dreamed of when I watched TRON over and over again in 4th grade... And Stephenson put it on to paper. This metaverse will exist--he is a visionary!That aside, the book is an exceptionally easy read. I enjoy it enough that I have purchased 6 copies of the book...I recommend it so highly that I give my copy away and buy a new one, just so that other people will get into it...."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is sometimes a tough read, but the strange style and interwoven shotgun plots draw you in.

If you haven't discovered Stephenson yet, start here then go directly to Cryptonimicon."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In the novel &quot;Snow Crash,&quot; the future seems like a gothic hellish place to dwell. A striking new invention called the &quot;metaverse&quot; lets people walk around and interact, share files and data, all in a virtual-reality setting accessable right from your own computer. This may sound all well and good, but there is trouble brewing in this digital paradise. A vigilante named Raven is engeneering and distributing a new space-age gerne of drug that literally brainwashes you. Hiro Protagonist, the protagonist of the story, and his unlikely skate boarding partner Y.T. must do all that they can within their power to stop this drug from infecting the whole world!

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"All I can say is that if you are not &quot;The Matrix&quot; sort of person, then you won't like this book. Bits and pieces from theology, archeology, anthropology, computer science, and linguistics rolled into one. Interesting theory about the connection of the demise of the Sumerian culture and the Bible's Tower of Babel. Cultural nuances depicted in the novel is so accurate. Definitely a different twist into the realm of science fiction... most probably because he started to do research for a computer game and not a novel."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Perhaps the best Cyber Punk novel of all time. The setting is a near future world where Pizza Delivory is a life or death thing, the government is made up of independent corporations and teritorys,ther are no laws, and you can get killed on the internet. The plot is as vivid as the setting, with a good deal of violence but not without thought. The charicters include Hiro Protagonist- a sword wielding hacker/pizza deliverer/all around badass, Y.T- a sexy kourier who skates boards at 100mph, and Raven- An 8foot mutant with a Hydrogen bomb. The book also has alot to offer if you like learning something when you read, inclueding research on religion, mythology and computers. It also has several funny/discusting/awsome parts involving swords and guns but I wont spoil anything. If you like Sci-fi/cyberpunk read this book. If you don't-read it anyway! Have fun!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a very imaginative book, full of details about a highly digital future Earth, complete with an Internet-based simulated world called the Metaverse. A mysterious menace by the name of \\"Snow Crash\\" is unleashed upon the Earth and the Metaverse. It seemingly turns people into stupid herd creatures that speak in tongues. It can also make smart hackers totally lose their minds and turn into vegetables. Our hero and heroine set out to fight this evil not really knowing what it is: is it a computer virus, a disease, or a drug? How are an unbelievably macho thug, the President of the United States, and the world's greatest monopolist connected to \\"Snow Crash\\"? And why are some 4000-year-old clay tablets from Sumer the key to the whole mystery?The book is set up really well. The initial premises make a lot of sense, unlike a certain other famous cyberpunk book. This initial phase lasts for about 100 of the 470 pages. The rest of the book is full of either uninspired Hollywood-esque action (chases and violence) or else outrageous conjectures about Sumerian mythology and their connection to the Three Great Religions (excuse me, Mr Stephenson, ever heard of a part of the world that lay to the east of Sumer?). Stephenson clearly took pains to research his material. I know this, having read one of his sources about Sumerian civilisation. But all research is useless if you are going to use it for PSEUDOINTELLECTUALISM and alas, that is exactly what you get from this book.Eventually, this religion/mythology thing gets so irritating that one is glad to return to the straightforward fights and flights. Our hero and heroine eventually save the day and kill the badguys, so all ends well. (Or does it? There's that unfinished business with the nuclear bomb.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read Snow Crash because someone recommended it as an alternative to Neuromancer, one of my favourite books. Snow Crash doesn't come close to Neuromancer, it's not complex enough, it doesn't have the same feel of seamlessnes.Snow Crash depicts a future of city-states spread across the former USA, where you join a country like you join a club. The technology is far advanced, but it seems to be for the benefit of the reader instead of using it as a tool to make the setting believable(imagined author quote: Hmm, people think railguns are cool, i'd better throw in one, an i'll make it fission powered and automatic- that'll make people like my book!).The same thing goes for most of everyhing when I come to think of it. It's a bit like eating large amounts of snacks; it's not that good, you won't feel good afterwards, but you don't stop eating anyway.Nonetheless, I did finish it, so if you like SF, and you have to much time on your hands, i recommend it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really enjoyed this book alot. I actually wound up reading it twice. I cannot understand for the life of me why Neal's books are usually put in the Science Fiction catagory. It is just pure enjoyment if you ask me.All of Neal's books are well written and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I should have put it down after the first page. Instead, I struggled for weeks, forcing it down like the chicken nugget my kid didn't finish but I don't want to throw away.I dig comics and the cyberpunk aesthetic, but this one came across trite and thrown together -- like a cyberpunk wannabe wrote it. The sumerian tangent was disgracefully convoluted and as unintelligible as the 'babel' it draws from -- unless I'm a dumb ass and just didn't get it.Anyway, I give 2 stars because I feel like any author taking the time and energy and displaying the courage to carve out a place in the publishing world warrants such a rating, but this book is the least enjoyable that I've read in a very long time. I did finish it, but instead of taking it to our local paperback shop, I tossed it in my recycling bin."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As we stated above, the book will exert tremendous influence on books concerned with cyberspace. Its accessibility and hilarity will enthrall many, many adoring fans and make Stephenson a pile of money that he richly deserves. Yet it is a book that will not exert much influence beyond this portion of the genre into other media and will not live long outside of the genre itself. The very greatest books transcend genre and move nations-this book will not do that. But we don't feel it really attempts to and completely satisfies its own ambitions.WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:Cyber-geek? Computer enthusiast? On-line gamer? Hacker? Eskimo? Mafioso? Japanese-American? Cube jockey? If you're any of these people, this book could well become your manifesto. Read and enjoy many times over. It's better than any book of its kind published in the modern English language.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:If you have no sense of humor whatsoever, then do not read this book. We're talking about people who have never smiled at a newspaper comic, have never enjoyed a moment in any sitcom, comedic film, stupid commercial, or street mime. Basically, you'd have to be a Vulcan. It is finally an immensely optimistic book and a distinct pleasure to read. If you're suicidal and looking to check out of this world or are suffused in such a profound fit of post-modern angst that you can't possibly find a moment's cheer in this doomed world, then pass on this and go read Al Gore's book or attend a Ralph Nader speech. You certainly don't need to read this.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but frankly I am glad to have finally finished it. There were some terrific ideas in here: the virtual-reality Metaverse where wealth and status impacts on your appearance; religion as a virus infecting people through a base, ancient and long forgotten language; brains as machines that can be affected by binary code. And the book was at it's best when the hero, called Hiro Protagonist, was having these ideas explained to him by a computer program librarian within the Metaverse. But the story just doesn't hang together and as a dystopian vision of the future is not a patch on the greats such as 1984, Brave New World or A Clockwork Orange."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This item was given as a gift to a friend, who specifically requested it, and expressed great satisfaction on receiving it. Pricing, delivery and product integrity were all satisfactory. My rating it a 4 out of a possible 5 reflects only the fact that I lack first hand experience with the purchased item, and can only reflect the limited information conveyed to me by its recipient."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I was recommended to read this book by a fan of Neal Stephenson. I didn't know what to expect. This book is probably the most exciting thing I have ever read. It is a thrill-fest from the beginning to the end. This book has MOVIE printed all over it (To bad Stephenson has said openly that he will never make it into a movie). Anyway, It was exciting, fresh, intelligent, can't say enough about it. It you like science fiction, you have to get this book. It ranks of there with the best (Dune, Ender's Game, and now SNOW CRASH). Read this book, you will not be disappointed (I recommend this book to everyone, and they always jump on the bandwagon)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"An interesting and possible future. The characters were interesting and I would like to meet many of them. It has been a long time since I read this book so my memories are not that clear. I remembered the author and try, when there are available, used paperbacks available, to read everything by Stephenson. Loved Cryptomonicon and look forward to reading the Baroque Trilogy."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is everything that Neuromancer (by Bill Gibson) should have been. This book is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Ahem, I'm not usually into this sort of thing (i.e. the \\"science fiction\\" genre, \\"cyberpunk\\" anything or anything associated with the SFBC (Science Fiction Book Club, for the few uninitiates reading this review), but I did read and enjoy immensely Stephenson's 3,000 page Baroque Cycle or Trilogy. So, when I was browsing a friend's bookshelf and came across Stephenson's name on one of the paperbacks, I couldn't help but pull it out. My friend said he'd never read it, or only read part of it and couldn't get into it (or something of the sort) and said \\"Just keep it.\\"---Thus, my fortuitous reading of Snow Crash.The first thing to say about any Stephenson work is that it's fun.--It's Fun!-and also, Snow Crash, as other reviewers have not been slow to point out, is uncannily prescient. I kept going back to check on the original date of publication to make sure that Stephenson was so spot on in his vision of the future, very much like our present. Almost every chapter of this book is a crispy, sparkling narration full of a combination of wit, erudition and, again, FUN. Methinks some of you reviewers (as was the case with The Baroque Cycle) are taking all of this a bit too seriously. Yes, the notion that a screen full of binary code will crash a hacker's/programmer's brain is nonsense. But what a fun concept to play around and to run with! Likewise, the whole Sumerian language bit simply wouldn't do for a doctoral thesis. But how much one learns about history, language, and biblical scholarship---all in a supposedly \\"cyberpunk\\" novel! Confession: My favourite chapters are those in which Hiro is in the \\"Metaverse\\" library brushing up on this stuff.So, dismount your high horse, \\"poon\\" on, and enjoy the ride.P.S-The only other work of fiction that comes to mind with a major character named Hero (just a vowel misplaced, apparently) is by this fellow named Shakespeare in a very enjoyable read called Much Ado About Nothing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is a great story with an amazing vision of the near future of technology. Clearly the kids at Google have been using this book to pull their business plan together (almost every major piece of technology predicted in this mid-90's published book has now been built and launched by Google). Stephenson's vision of virtual worlds is on the cusp of realization. The cyber-punk story is one layer, the pure prophecy of the technical innovations is the important layer for everyone in the tech business to understand."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"SNOW CRASH is set in the (not too distant) future, in a world where accessing the Internet has evolved from web pages like you are presently looking at to a 3D virtual world known as the Metaverse. Hiro Protagonist, the main character, is on of the most highly skilled Metaverse hackers. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book, as it dealt with a lot of the use of the Metaverse, but it seemed as though Stephenson got away from that in the last couple of chapters, and the ending was a little flat for me.Want to get involved in something that is possibly a precursor to a real Metaverse? Visit www.secondlife.com."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A silly book, but very enjoyable. My take on it is that Stephenson wantedto take the feeling experienced by those in places like Asia and Africa asthe modern world washes over them and totally disorients them, and translateit to America. As such the book is not a prediction --- \\"In fifteen yearsthe federal government will be powerless and the mafia will be running pizzafranchises\\" --- it's an attempt to illustrate the chaos and arbitrarinessof life in Lagos or Kinshasa in terms that can be appreciated by the westernreader; and as such it does that fairly well.The second half of the book goes off the rails a little as the Sumerianmind-control plot is developed, but again, being kind to Stephenson, Idon't think he in any sense buys this idea, he simply found itinteresting.Ultimately I think the book is less than it could have beenbecause it tried to marry together two very different sub-books, and indoing so demeaned both of them. Even so, it was worth the time and even themore lame ideas in it, like that old cliche of virtual reality, weretreated in a way that wasn't completely stupid (which is far far more thanI can say for _Neuromancer_.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"From the very first page, Snow Crash grabs one and doesn't let go. The writing is fast, neat and smart. Reminiscent of Gibson, Stephenson re-modernizes some cyberpunk elements and gives them his own twists.Lighter than Cryptonomicon and much more fun than Diamond Age, Snow Crash is just plain fun, one of the things that's been missing from the SF scene, as far as I'm concerned. YT, Hiro and the rest of the characters go from problem to problem, suspenseful situation to suspenseful situation.There's lots in here that other writers have addressed, but Stephenson definitely puts his own stamp on this genre. This book is worth the read for the first chapter alone. It may get a bit slower afterward, but not by much. This is not a heavy or dense book, and may be Stephenson's most accessible work. I'd recommend it to SF fans of all ages."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This was my first Neal Stephenson novel and I cannot say I was impressed. I am of the belief that one sould give an author a second chance though. This novel kept the pages turning for me but left me feeling kind of empty when I finished. I wish I could say more positive things about this respected author, but this book just wasn't all I thought it could have been"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Call me old fashioned. While the pace of this book is fast and it does contain some great imagery, shouldn't it go somewhere? Hiro Protagonist has devoted so much of his resources to the 'metaverse' that is an internet with expanded VR capabilites. So much so that his daily life is drabola. i.e.- He lives in a mini storage warehouse. In praise of the book, these guys are rubber balls- the worse things can happen to them and they bounce right back. Go ahead, buy the book; but beware; it is a massive download of gargantuam proportions. Drink five cups of coffee, skim it, be amused by zaniness and get info overload!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Do you like Sci-Fi books? Do you like computers?

I found Stephenson's &quot;Snow crash&quot; quite interesting and compelling, but somewhat haphazard. The parts about linguistics and some of the other asides are fascinating and insightful, but don't always seem to be woven into the story in the best fashion. Still, it's a great read overall."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This was the greatest! Thrilling, action-packed, and at times pyschotic. That's cool though, I am not saying anything bad. I really liked his use of the skateboarder (I know, Kourier..) Y.T. She was so rock-on! I'm not the skater myself, but I am totally CyberPunk. It's cool for the nontechno peeps, and it is currently my most recomended book to my friends. Thanks dude! (I am not liable for any weirdness I may have expressed. I am a teenager. I do weird stuff.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Reading this book is like watching an Imax film of Calvin and Hobbes riding their sled. Stephenson manages to combine something old, sonething new, lots of things borrowed, and a few blue, in an intelligent and well-thought-out book that does not discard all the old literary virtues, even as it is uproariously original. And, it's so nice to see ancient cultures, computer programming, and swordsmanship all treated with intelligence and respect and some regard for the facts."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Y.T. is too close to Chevette Wilson of Gibson's &quot;Virtual Light&quot; for comfort - young women who use high-tech bicycles/skateboards as inner city messengers. I hope the type doesn't become generic.&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is a good cyberpunk read otherwise."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Fun setting, but not much of a plot. The Sumerian undercurrents drag the action to a stop. But when there is action, it's full steam ahead, in the most implausible ways. For better cyberpunk, read William Gibson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Something good:This book, written before the Internet was little more than a government and university project with a few commercial interests throw in, presents an almost precognitive look at a world interconnected via the computer. Some of the technology described, even if slightly off-base, rightly predicts what we are using and developing today.Something bad:I won't delve too much on the absurdities described with a supposedly ancient \\"hacker\\" algorithm being made to free mens' minds from the entrapment of a hypothetical space \\"virus\\". Nor will I go into the rancid historical references used to back up this laughable proposition (there are more intelligent people than me who have detailed this in reviews here already.) But to suppose that by 2012 (this is a guess based on evidence in the story since the date isn't listed anywhere I could see) that the entire US government would be minimalized to the point of vestigial worthlessness because of over privatization, and that society would be fractured into competing commercial \\"franchises\\", run by agencies such as the Mafia none-the-less, is just silly. Sure there's room for satire (I'm pretty sure Stephenson was not a fan of the Reagan era), but an author has to at least give a more realistic time line to work with. This is supposed to be a natural deterioration here, not even post-war, yet, somehow, all democratic society withered away in 20 years.Something awful:Contrived plots and silly ideas are one thing. Writing them down in such a poor and inconsistent manner is inexcusable. There are times when the characters will completely shift their narrative and their personality. Just going from the first chapter to the next couple presented such a fundamental change that I have to believe that the first was written years apart from the rest of the book.Later in the book Stephenson can't seem to find a better way to express his largely contrived ideas than to expound upon them in a fashion that I can only relate to a Socratic dialogue (in tone if not in substance.) First there's the main character, Hiro, talking back and forth with an AI librarian for chapters at a time trying to formulate this Sumerian plot point, then later we get the same type of performance except now we have the heads of a few of these world controlling franchises playing the parts of the librarian. Stephenson couldn't think a better way to get his ideas across than to create lengthy (and quite boring) dialogues?To conclude, I'm not sure why this book is so beloved. The writing is immature, and the ideas supporting the plot are untenable. If it wasn't for his view of an interconnected virtual world this book would be worthless."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I started reading Snow Crash with high hopes. It was picked by Time Magazine as one of the top 100 English-language novels and two friends had recommended it to me. It seemed like a safe bet.Woops.Snow Crash is a nonsensical stew of crackpot ideas and sophomoric escapist fantasies. If you want well-drawn characters and an engrossing plot, look elsewhere. This book is nothing but a jumbled assortment of \\"cool ideas\\" strung together in a ridiculous plot filled with two-dimensional caricatures. It's the literary equivalent of a lowbrow Hollywood blockbuster: a bilious torrent of pseudo-intellectual sensory overload spewed at the audience to no particular effect.If you're a twelve year old boy or a fan of crackpot philosophy then you'll probably love this story about samurai hackers riding around on motorcycles chopping up zombies infected with a religious virus. If that doesn't sound totally freakin' awesome to you, save yourself the 468 page effort and skip this turd.Stephenson earns two stars for prescience, but this book is a loser."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is about the world in the not to distant future were the government has folded and everything is run by corporations. The Mafia has incorporated and runs a Pizza franchise, and I'm sure the ethnic slam is totally intentional. The man in charge of the mafia is called Uncle Enzo. The author seems to find this kind of thing amusing or clever because the main character's name is Hero Protagonist. His full name Hiroshimo Protagonist but he is referred to as Hero throughout most of the book. This was almost enough to make me stop reading right there.The author seems to like programming and by like I mean he has naughty dreams late at night about strings of ones and zeros. Since programming is the little window through which the world is viewed in Snow Crash, everything is rammed through that window. Things like religion, philosophy, the evolution of man, and pretty much everything else neatly passes through this window with surprising ease.This is a techno-punk-thriller kind of book so there is a virus/drug out there called Snow Crash that spreads through computers and people, because people are just complex computers. This virus may just cause the collapse of capitalization, but fortunately there is Hero out there. A novel idea but not necessarily what makes for a good novel. Sorry I was feeling punny.There is some mildly interesting sword fighting, car chases, sex, and nifty futurist stuff going on if you can slog through the fist third of the book.So, I would recommend passing on the book unless you are into the whole techno-punk-thriller genre or have nothing better to do. If you fall into the first category, \\"geek on my pimply faced friend\\"."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Three stars doesn't quite sum up how I feel about this book. I do consider it essential reading for anyone interested in Sci-fi or Cyberpunk, but that doesn't undo the fact that there are some utterly absurd elements that undercut the aesthetic value of the book.First, the good. I have never read some a convincing picture of the future as world-gone-bad. Though Stephenson doesn't spend any time really explaining how society got the way it has, the way it has become is quite powerfully presented. His understanding of the way in which the Internet might develop reflects a sense of vision and insight that would have done Jules Verne proud. On so many things--future weapons, potential subcultural groups, lingo and slang, technology--Stephenson hits precisely the right note. On top of all this, he has a wonderful assemblage of characters. For all of this, Stephenson unquestionably deserves 5 stars.But SNOW CRASH also is one more example of how things go wrong in sci-fi when there is any attempt to deal with religion. There have been, of course, many fine sci-fi novels in which religion has served as an element. The great classic A CANTICLE FOR LEIBOWITZ springs to mind. But when sci-fi attempts explain religious phenomena or to bring it within the contenxt of imaginative analysis, it invariably fails. The extended and tedious discussions of Sumerian culture and the highly speculative discussions of the history of religions were not merely unconvincing and poorly founded on any of the historical record. They were boring. For this, SNOW CRASH deserves 1 star.So, I recommend this book very highly. But I do warn any potential reader that there are several passages and chapters that mar an otherwise masterful work."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"After having friends reccomend this book/author to me I went out and bought it. I wish I hadn't. This book is nothing more than a holywoodized piece of cyber trash. It could easily make it to the silver screen as the violent content is extreme and unecessary and the plot is pseudo-intellectual.It is well written and hard to put down, I'll give it that, but it feels upon reflection as though the author had re-written an archeology paper from university adding extreme violence and technology to sell it to the mindless consumer drones of generation X America. Of all the 'cyber-punk' novels I have read this has the most graphic depecition of violence and also has the highest 'body-count'.[The archeological sub-text is far more interesting to me and I wish he had spent a little more time on the explanation of the use of 'me' and it's relevance in mesopotanian society.]Books I recommend, far superior in concepts and content, are;&quot;Neuromancer&quot; by William Gibson,[most cool book of the 80's].&quot;A scanner darkly&quot; by Philip K. Dick [know Blade runner?], and&quot;Vurt&quot; by Jeff Noon[the 90's best new cyber-punk author. READ IT. It is inspirational.]"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is not a funny book despite what some reviewers claim. It is amusing in places but I didn't find it actually funny. It is a good story, but not a great one. It _is_ let down by all the Sumerian myth stuff - pages and pages of boring infodumps on the subject. I don't care if they're accurate retellings or not, they slow down an otherwise well-paced story. They don't fit in very well with the rest of the plot and the rather tortured attempts the author makes to base the Snow Crash mind-and-computer virus on the ancient Sumerians and subsequent \\"mind hackers\\" is like President Bush's \\"ill fitting suit\\" in the debates - ugly and weak.The two main characters, Hiro Protagonist and Y.T. are well done and engaging and Stephenson's description of the metaverse is very good also. Raven is initially a suitably evil villan but then later when Hiro starts communicating with him and suddenly pulls out the connection between their fathers (apparently from thin air) it all gets a bit ridiculous. And what did happen to Raven's H-bomb? We never find out, which I found rather slapdash. Maybe he just left it ashore for his mother to look after while messing about on the Raft?However, despite the criticisms above there is still a lot of good writing in this novel and the story is engaging overall if a little longer than it should be (God knows Stephenson seems to have gotten worse in that department since!) It was the first Stephenson novel I'd read and I liked it enough that I'll probably read The Diamond Age, and depending on how that goes perhaps Cryptonomicon as well. I don't think I could face the absurdly overweight Baroque Cycle books though - I like SF not historical novels and I really don't expect to live long enough to finish them..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow crash is a book.

Nueromancer also rulz!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I started reading Snow Crash towards the tail end of a long flight, although I was sitting towards the front of the plane I was the last one off, as I simply couldn't put it down. This book has everything, great characters, ancient legends, sword fights, fantastic and realistic weapons, incredibly cutting edge technologies, romance, a super-internet where one can walk and talk, inter-family blood feuds, bullet bikes, skate-boarding couriers, the Mafia, hackers, first rate super villains, a floating city and nano-technology. One could fill this review with cursory mention of all of the incredible things that the author has managed to work into this book. The treatment of these topics is not light either, but there is real thought behind it. The author did his homework, talking with many authoritites before introducing cutting edge topics, and it pays off. It really is one of the best pieces of science fiction I have ever read.This book is not just a great piece of Sci-Fi, but it is good literature too. The story is written around solid characters and a very interesting plot, it just so happens that it takes place in the future. There are many interesting characters, although the book does focus around the actions of Hiro Protagnoist and Y.T. Those other characters are all incredibly interesting , with their own motivation and purpose in the story. They interact with each other in many ways, but always consistently, keeping the pace lively. Mr. Stephenson's characters are deep- even when he writes in the first person as a super-bioengineered dog his characters are consistent and interesting.The plot is top-notch, with the focus being Hiro, a hacker and swordfighter (yes, this is believably explained), and his sidekick, YT, a futuristic skate-boarding courier, are forced to unravel a mind-controlling virus that threatens the planet. This requires him to move through the Metaverse (the super internet of previous mention), and California of the near future, including adventures on a floating raft, gun boats, romance, sword fights and more. The action is non-stop, and it is done in a rich and colorful universe that is believable and engrossing.I can't recommend this book enough. It is fantastically entertaining and thoroughly thought provoking."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time.

I can definitely envision a future overrun by large corporations and having a second life in the metaverse. However, I didn't connect with the philosophy of Snow Crash or felt it believable. It felt like the writer was viewing various religions through a telescope and then trying to piece them together while insinuating that they are all cult-like. I would have enjoyed the book more had it focused on more technological reasons than spiritual for the existence of Snow Crash.Snow Crash came highly recommended and being a software engineer myself it seemed like it should have been the perfect book for me. It was worth reading for the world and characters but I won't be rereading it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Wonderfully written. You will quickly become a Neal Stephenson fan.

I found the whole pizza delivery/scateboard scene too far out. I learned after I finished the book that it was originally intended to be a graphic novel...it would've helped to know this at the start so I didn't try to apply logic to the scenario.However, after getting into it, I found the author has woven in pretty deep philosphy/religious themes that (appear) well researched and are thought provoking. Combined with a well timed sense of humor, I really enjoyed Snow Crash...and it was nice to pick a book I didn't finish in one or two sittings."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It takes a short moment to get into this book, But after a few chapters it grows harder to put down. An amazing book by a talented writer. Because of this novel I went on to purchase many other titles by Neal Stephenson and haven't been sorry yet.The book takes place in a futuristic re-imagining of the world, specifically the US. Life is lived in a totally different manner. You'll grow to enjoy the characters, lessons and knowledge placed upon those pages. Stephenson is an extremely intelligent man who does not leave want in is writing. Start on a journey of epic proportions that eventually has the world in mind. You'll not be sorry if you purchase this book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I have to say I love this book. It isn't perfect. The writing can be a little disjointed/ADD sometimes. Still, this book's originality is astounding even after all these years. It brought concepts such as \\"meme\\", \\"virtual reality\\", \\"online avatars\\", \\"corporate city-states\\", \\"religion as a virus\\", \\"hacking\\" etc etc into the public imagination. It did so in a way that was entertaining, non-technical, and surprisingly human. A lot of sci-fi can be conceptually interesting but a chore to read. I often wonder if many mainstream sci-fi books were either written by someone with severe Asperger's syndrome or an AI...because the characters are so one-dimensional/uninteresting and the plot gets bogged down with elaborate technical details. Not so with this book...it moves at a quick pace, the characters make you laugh/cry, and the ideas are effectively communicated.Most importantly, I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Perhaps if I read this in 2000 when it came out I would have a higher opinion. It is a Gibson-esque romp through cyberspace. It has some interesting concepts that the author does a good job attempting to convey but doesn't quite get the message across. The first part of the book was wrote in s pseudo-stream of consciousness and it took a while to adjust your mind to Stephenson's writing style. The middle of the book was highly entertaining. The end was meh. It felt like Stephenson publisher was demanding the book and he wasn't actually finished with it so he wrapped it up the best way he could and submitted it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson is visionary in this prophetic novel. Extremely alluring and entertaining read. Perfect gift for the inner geek in all of us."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Many other people will have already written full-on book reports about Snow Crash, so don't expect that here.I picked up this book at a friends house decades ago. He told me I couldn't borrow it if I liked it as he hadn't finished it yet. I read the first 100 or so pages and on the way home bought my own copy. In some ways even more-so then William Gibson, Neal Stephenson nailed the Near Possible Future squarely on the head. I found the pace and detail of the book perfectly to my liking with characters I wouldn't mind seeing again. The one thing I will say, Neal has trouble ending books. I don't mind they way they end in general but Snow Crash and also Cryptonomicon both ended shall I say Jaggedly? The story was wrapped up, but the ending wasn't clean. This however did not hurt my love of these books the first time I read, nor when I have had to re-read.

This book (number 33 of 40) was an outstanding ride with lots of insights. Its 1992 initial publication date will have you nodding in reflection about how on-target Stephenson was. The mix of young and older characters, virtual and real world, financial titans, religious demagogues, Mafia types, and people living in storage rental spaces make this a great ride. It was my first exposure to his work. I'm looking forward to reading more and I'm not worried about getting a pizza delivered in 30 minutes anymore."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"No, great book.

I'll never read another book by this author again!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A pseudo-ambitious, weak plotted, scathingly unoriginal waste of publishing resources. The 2-dimensional characters are so shallow they remind me of the leftover aliases to long deleted 8 bit programs. Looks like this wannabe is trying too hard to imitate writers like Jeff Noon and William Gibson. Noon succeeds partially because he doesn't try to explain his fantastic realm in terms of hard-scifi technological facts. Stephenson, amid his slavish but somehow half-hearted kowtow to what he perceives as techno-realism, comes across as desperately trying to unscramble the omelet his college-grade imagination has half-baked. The semi-promethean Gibson can be excused because he was writing in 1983, well before the internet had a chance to saturate the cultural zeitgeist. A decade and a half later, Neuromancer still has more conceptual drive than Snowcrash. I'm sick to death of the endless tide of young interlopers like Stephenson coming along and using the concept of cyberspace as a mcguffin to wank imaginative. As a long time fan of conceptual/philosophical sci-fi, I found nothing even mildly intriguing in NS's concepts; the '80s videogame Tron had more food for thought than the whole of Snowcrash. The plot was nothing more than formula presented in sickeningly unrelenting irony &amp; one-liner adolescent social commentary, pedantically interwoven with a quasi-researched mythico-linguistic subplot."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"So, over a decade ago I read Neuromancer, and I'm enthralled. At the time, I was a 13year old BBS geek moving into the internet (this is before gopher, and long before the WWW!). Neuromancer stuck out as being amazing. I loved the style and the concept of dark SF. Ahead 5 years, and I finally buy Count Zero and Mona Lisa OD. I realize I still love the entire concept, more now than ever, since I see how absolutely real its becoming. However, I never ventured past Gibson, as the &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; anthology pretty much told me that most other 'cyberpunk' authours bored me to tears. 5 more years, and someone recommends that I read Snowcrash. I also happened to find it the next day on a used rack. I bought it, read it, and hated it. Absolutely WORTHLESS. The plot was boring. The characters lifeless and stupid (I'm still reeling from how ridiculous it was to make the main character a katana-wielding wonderboy named 'Hiro Protagonist' -this isn't ground breaking, kids, its stupid). Skateboard kids who act as flippant, ultra cool couriers? Please. These are the sorts of things I'd have written as that snot-nosed 13yr old in an attempt to parrot Gibson. Then there's the constant Sumerian &quot;plot&quot; that keeps getting beaten over our heads (Gibson had voodoo, so I guess he needs something even more esoteric.. and unlike Gibson leaving us to figure it out, we get it all in MINDNUMBING MINUTAE). Yes, I'm glad you know more about that than I do, now shut up already, Neal. The whole religion thing with the boats, however, always struck me as somewhat interesting. I find it even more funny now that I've learned all about L Ron Hubbard's dead alien cult (scientology, see http://www.xenu.net), and I need to go back to further apprechiate this aspect of the sarcasm. Really, the only thing about this book at all that appealed to me was the opening about pizza delivery, and pizza in the future, and I figure that's because I managed a delivery store at the time and could almost relate.Skip this one, unless you're some sort of self-describe &quot;hacker&quot; or other, similar, techno-buzzword."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Like many other one-star reviewers, I heard about this being a classic in the Neuromancer sense. I tried to like it, I really did (I was hoping to have this be the first leap into discovering Stephenson's other works), but I ended up doing something quite rare for me: I put the book down halfway through it.I really tried, but I found it simply unreadable. I have to agree with other reviewers that the torturous sentences, simple plot, shallow characters, and just plain boring storyline killed it for me. I also found it funny that for futuristic cyberpunk sci fi, it wasn't very futuristic or cyberpunky... the technology feels like it was written by someone from the 1950's envisioning their future.I'm an avid sci fi/fantasy reader and can count the number of unfinished books on two hands. Snow Crash has joined that list. I wish I could get my money back, it was THAT bad. Are all his books written like this? Should I just stay away from Neil Stephenson?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Sure, you can say how &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;exuberant&quot; this novel is, but I disagree. It started off good, then tumbled. It starts out full of suspense, as Hiro Protaganist is on a timed pizza delivery, then his vehicle wrecks and a rebellious teenager named YT has to help him. Hiro spends most of his time in the Metaverse, a virtual cyber world. Here he comes across a virus called &quot;snow crash&quot; which threatens to activate a &quot;bablyonian infocalpyse&quot;...this is where it gets weird. Who wants to read aoout linguisitc theories based off of the Sumerian culture and how it relates to the Net and the alleged &quot;Infocaplypse&quot;? I mean really...Stephenson just tries to be too damned unique. Also, the book has a poor and shabby excuse for character development. There is only the most minute description for each character, and even less for co-characters. The antagonists are weakly constructed, and the world is not fully releazied. Now, I'm not into the hacker/cyberculture subculture, but that doesn't mean there was still a possibility to enjoy it. Of course as shown, it was a rather terrible read. But foremost of this book, is the annoying fact that it was written in PRESENT TENSE. It just gets all your nerves. An example: Hiro say, &quot;How do you know that?&quot; YT replies, &quot;I've just heard it before.&quot; Hiro then walks to the nearest door. It drives you completely out of your mind. END"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is full of fun and often inventive SF gadgets and ideas. How much you will enjoy this novel will depend upon how heavily you are 'into' science fiction and how plausible you like your stories. I found the characters somewhat lacking in complexity, and some of the plot devices contrived. Snow Crash felt to me a little like a comic book, without the illustrations. If you like your science fiction with an extra fantastical flare, Snow Crash is for you. If you're into hard-science SF and plausible story lines, there are many better options available."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What's going on here? I've read three reviews that seem to think this book is some sort of classic. In my opinion Stephenson tries to do way to much with this book, grossly overcompensating for being a not very good writer. It reads like he's got several concepts and settings that he wants to write about to show how clever / sophisticated he is, but the plot? What's up with that? His characters are about as deep as the hiro (snigger) in a marvel comic. He writes clearly but with no passion and manages to evoke exactly zero empathy with any of the characters who seem just to be wandering around delivering what Stephenson obviously thinks (completely misguidedly) is 'cool' slang dialogue in what frankly is a woeful, haphazard and disconnected series of settings. Stpehenson thinks he is clever, well maybe he is. He also apparently thinks he is a writer. No maybe's there - he's not. Unimaginative computer programmers looking for a non-challenging comic book will lap this up. I was bored out of my skull and had to force myself to complete this torrid piece of writing. An insult to its genre."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is funny and suspenseful, a great story, easy to read, and compelling characters. A must read for anyone."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Like a glimpse into the future we live in today, Stephenson cuts likes a samurai sword straight into a grainy and digitized reality enjoyable from page one. There is something for everyone to like in Snow Crash, from hacker geeks to rebellious religious fanatics alike."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is not a book for everyone. First, it heavily scattered with computer terms, which might hinder some non-geek. Second, the hilarious and sarcastic style which will offend some readers. But if you are OK with that, this is an excellent book for you.The story revolves around the protagonist, Hiro Protagonist (yes, that is his name), a pizza delivery man, a computer hacker, a part-time spy and a swordplay expert. You figure it out! The setting is a wholly privatized world, when the government is just another private company. And Snowcrash is some kind of digital drug within the digital world of the future.One of my major complains about this book is the protracted beginning. It does not go anywhere except bringing you from one hilarious scene to another. Yes, it gives you some idea about the world they are in, but still too dragging. It does not get interesting before page 200. But if you survive that, you get the gem of this book (which I will not tell you because it will spoil the fun).But I can tell you this, Stephenson is indeed a visionary writer. This book was first published in 1992, while most of us at that time probably knew Internet only by using email. In this book you can find the world of Second Life, when human-user can interact in a 3D virtual world called Metaverse using their avatar (yes, he used this term in this book), which is much bigger than the Earth itself.The second interesting thing is his bleak vision of our future, which I might comment, is not too far fetch. This makes this book a bit depressing, if not frightening. Even though this is not an apocalyptic novel (in one sense, but apocalyptic in another sense), this book really makes me doubt that our future will be a golden age.The best part of this book is the fresh interpretation of some mythologies: biblical and Sumerian. It really gives you food for thought.I give it a four instead of five because it is too action packed, and it is too comical (It is originally written for comic book)."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read a lot of sci fi and this book has some interesting themes and intellectual ideas but the writing, plot and characters are all either lacking or dull."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Reading this book so many years after it was first written, it still send my head spinning with intricacies, details and wacky characters. There are a lot of expositions here which are interesting but skimmed over just a little too quickly and in need of a little more explanation and substantiation for better impact. Thorough enjoyed Stephenson's imaginative construction of a future world of hackers, pizza delivery and revamped mafia.PresageThere is some similarity between Snowcrash and Presage,which story starts in 20181. - a controversial new class system is enforced to gear people up to do community work to replace welfare that the government can no longer afford. Hugh van Santen is the editor in chief of a major newspaper which relies on scoops to keep his newspaper afloat. he recruits Sophie Chantal, a cub journalist knowing her brother-in-law is a computer scientist, who can create amazingly accurate simulations of people he calls mindroids - Sophie's first assignment is to write a feature on the bicentennial birthday of Karl Marx and she asks Sam to simulate notorious who one after another causes mayhem and near riots. Meanwhile the CIA is after Sam's simulation technology who designs a game of clairvoyance called \`Presage' where people can retrieve parcels of his simulation program. Warfare is instigated between Sam's gamers and the intelligence agents who initiate Operation Hercules in a race for Sam's secret in the reality of the virtual.Comparing the two books, the exposition in Presage is about the media and ideological battles whereas Snow crash is about technology."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I gave up after about 1/3 into it. The author writes of this strange world he created as if we already get it; what it is and how it came to be. I also didn't find as much humor as just plain strangeness.

I couldn't have cared less about the entire story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book may not be the best cyberpunk story in every aspect, but it is the best overall, and with the most likable protagonists (pun intended). I have this in paperback and in Audible formats, and I keep going back to listen to the Audible version again and again. This is an instant classic."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Too much exposition halts the plot and give unbalance...I finally was able to read Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash after seeing a fellow student read it on a bus ride to school, and hearing positive things about it from various other sources (online, sci-fi community, etc).Was it everything I expected?It could have been better.I thought the idea of a 'Blasian' (half-black/half-Asian) hero, Hiro Protagonist was pretty cool.The idea that the Sumerian legends had something to do with the virus of the title that is soon to be unleashed to those outside the Metaverse (which is the virtual world where characters spend time).The major aspect that turns me off of the book are the very long Sumerian explanations that halt the book at various points.Hiro seems to already know these legends and consults a library at one point to go over the legends and their relation to Snow Crash...then at another, while he is speeding on a motorcycle.I do like the 15-year-old blonde Caucasian character of Y.T., as she seems to be an individual who can pretty much handle herself; her mother, a single-parent, works for a the government in a pretty strong 'by the book' environment.The world seems to be a bit dystopian (which is somewhat of a cliche of virtual reality stories) as Hiro lives in a storage area; and, Y.T. at some point of the story even has a quick fling with a man much older than she...who turns out to be the villain of the story.All in all, I found myself wanting to find out what happens, and when I did...I didn't find it as mind-blowing as many, but I do understand there is an audience for this book. Furthermore, I now have an interest of reading some of William Gibson's cyberpunk books.As aforementioned, I think the areas with the Sumerian exposition could have been worked into the story, rather than devoting several pages to it; because, it seems to grind the story to a halt..especially when the reader (i.e. me) is into a certain action sequence. (It makes the story a bit unbalanced).I may revisit this book in the future, and I do recommend it for others...who may have their own likes and dislikes, as well as their own interpretations on the material.*** out of *****"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has produced a futuristic society engulfed in anarchy where corporations take the place of nations and virtual realty has moved to the forefront of leisure. Hiro Protagonist, a gritty and likable computer hacker/swordsman extraordinaire, stumbles upon a secret whereby society is slowly being manipulated both via software virus and something much more sinister.Aside from its intriguing ideas that meld libertarianism with near complete lawlessness, the story struggles between being a high-tech science fiction epic and a comic book style fantasy. On the one hand, the story revolves around virtual realty and technologically advanced weaponry, on the other hand the book contains family pets turned to fighting robots and pizza delivery services risen to near sacred importance.There is no doubt Stephenson is incredibly inventive and he surely let his imagination run wild; however, the contrasting elements of style make this book hard to label. The story takes different directions and produces many captivating environments, but only slowly develops to an eventual anticlimactic ending without any real excitement or intrigue."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is the only Stephenson book I have read. He was recommended to me by a friend even though I said I wasn't into SciFi. He pushed me to give it a chance because Stephenson is such a great writer so I picked up Snow Crash. I was not disappointed. This book is an amazing read start to finish. His vision of a future America run by commercial entities (one of which is the Mafia) is so detailed that you will lose yourself in the setting and have moments where you think, \\"wow that's what it's gonna be like.\\" It's obviuos to me that Stephenson was keeping himself out of the \\"cyberpunk\\" trend as the SciFi market was being flooded with books of this genre, but then decided he would show everyone up and come out and show that not only was he capable of writing in that genre but he could raise the bar for everyone else. Stephenson never takes anything too seriously, I mean his protagonist is named \\"Hiro Protagonist,\\" which keeps the tone fun. His characters, especially Hiro and YT are bursting with personality. On eof my favorite passages is how he describes, through Hiro, how everyman at one point or another thinks he could be a totally bada$$ mofo.I have heard criticisms of Stephenson's other novels that his endings are weak, well that is not the casehere. I'm keeping this spoiler free but suffice it to say the showdown atthe end is very rewarding for the reader and will not leave you hanging.The book combines Asian influences with traditional SciFi and wraps it in this \\"cyberpunk\\" package that gives it an edgy feel.

This book cuts you. (Yeah, I'm being overly dramatic - but I swear, this is what I thought about 50 pages in.) But the style grows on you. It's fast paced, it's fun, it's futuristic. Plus, it's got lots of fun and interesting theoretical stuff involved. Though sometimes the drop from constant action traveling at the speed of sound, to long discussions centering around hypotheticals was a bit - jarring? rough? of a comedown? I don't know - while I enjoyed both types, I might have preferred a bit more of a transition between. (And the end, while workable and very much enjoyable and of a piece with the rest of the book, felt a bit as if he didn't quite know what to do with some of the characters. Fun ending line, though.)

It intriged me, so I picked up a copy and read it. I was glad I did.Being brought up in such a tech-savy world that we live in, I could easily understand most of the story, though some of the cut scenes where rather confusing at some points. I also got confused about how the Sumerian myth played into the story, but the ending chapters explained the connection clearly.The characters where all colorful and different. This is also one of the few books (not counting comics, manga, ect.) that features a non-white person as the main character (Hiro Protagonist), which should be done more often.As many reviewers have pointed out (and I can agree with them on this), it is a though you where reading the script for a Japanese Anime movie or series, if you like that sort of media (and I do with glee!). I would love to see this as either a live-action or an animated movie, since it desperatly cries out to be one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Vision, out-of-the-boss thinking and extreme creativity."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson provides a realistic outlook in our present and future lives.

Our hero, Hiro Protagonist, navigates a franchised America, where everything (and I do mean everything) is part of a chain. In this America, he has to fight to stop a new virus, Snow Crash, from infecting both the hackers and the rest of the world.This is where the writing is uneven. In his descriptions of future franchised-to-the-teeth America, his writing is impeccable and fresh. But in his long-winded descriptions of the new virus, he delves into myth and theories of language that are better suited to an academic text than to a cyberpunk novel. The plot alternates between a breakneck pace and a long leisurely stroll. The strolls make you wonder what's happening elsewhere, because the real action can't possibly just stop while Hiro goes off and chats with his Librarian.For all its flaws, it's a reasonably good book, and one that I always recommend to my geek friends, as one geek to another."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"While the world is set only slighltly after it's writing in the early 1990s it is not the world as we know it though it might actually go that way.

Hiro Protagonist, a hacker, finds himself pitted against a virus called Snow Crash that destroys the brain of hackers, there is a drug by the same name, too, and people infected by it start talking in tongues. Y.T. is a fifteen year old skater who works as a Kourier and forms a intel gathering partnership with Hiro. She is a spunky girl who has a way of making strange acquaintances: Uncle Enzo the DON of the Mafia being among them.I thouroughly enjoyed this book.

In fact I almost think it is an alternate timeline type of deal.If there is any book that deserves a sequel it is this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It's difficult to say anything about this brilliant book that hasn't already been mentioned in the other reviews. Suffice to say, this is a brilliant cyberpunk novel. Descended from William Gibson's genre-making &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is an entertaining, wild-eyed look at the near future, but is not as bleak, either in writing style or imagination. The three strongest points to make about the book are its plot, characters, and pure imagination. The first half of the book is an introduction of the characters and the discovery of a technological and biological virus named Snow Crash, which a person can get through blood, exposure, or by looking at diseased data in the Metaverse, a kind of populated, mall-like cyberspace. The last half is a mad, action-filled rush to the conclusion. It has enough action to keep a thriller fan happy but requires plenty of brains to follow the origination of Snow Crash, which moves from Sumerian myth to populist religion in modern times. The idea is completely hair-brained, but somehow Stephenson makes you want to believe in the possibility of what he writes, which belies his talent. Secondly, his bizarre assortment of characters like the attitudinal skater Y.T., the cool but psychotic Raven, and the familial mobster Uncle Enzo populate a world strange enough to belong to the Twilight Zone, but frighteningly familiar. There's not much substance behind the characters, including the aptly-named Hiro Protagonist, but they make up for it with style. Stephenson's imagination links his plot into the environment of an imploded USA, most of which is pure fiction that couldn't happen in the next twenty years, if not longer. Still, what they lack in reality is made up for in hilarity. His look at the possibility of Mafia-run pizza delivery and what's left of the government are hilarious! Add that to an image of cyberspace VR intertwined with the mall-going culture, and you have a wild ride through a nearly-insane world. All in all, this is a fabulous book, and even if the characters and plot aren't so deep, the sheer power of Stephenson's imagination and humor shoots it into the atmosphere."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Published shortly before the Internet boom, this book is a hopeful but realistic look at the future of humanity, ecology, religion, computers and business.None of these really interest me as simple subject matter to base a book on, but this book covers all of these topics in such a wonderful way.Characters maintain their personalities throughout the book, but Stephenson has a brilliant way of making you change your mind about them without changing the characters personality, making them more realistic and relatable.The humor is subtle in most parts, which doesn't make the author seem like he's trying too hard and the writing is fantastic.The only drawbacks were located in the middle of the book, where an entire background on almost every religion imaginable was introduced, making it seem like a thesis in religious studies rather than a novel, but it does raise some interesting alternative views, and all in all is related to the story and it's characters even though I found my mind straying through many of these parts and had to re-read them.Overall, a great book I'd highly recommend for anyone who reads."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"NOTE: I wrote a review of this novel a couple of months ago, but it was never posted. I won't speculate on the reason or reasons why (although I have my suspicions), but I promise to be a good little Phrodoe this time out. Onward:Snow Crash is an astonishing, clever, funny, suspenseful work of the imagination. I've read a couple of Neal Stephenson's books (Cryptonomicon and The Diamoind Age, both of which I highly reccommend), and I still think this is his best novel. In Snow Crash, a part-time hacker, information-scrounge, and delivery boy for Uncle Enzo's Cosa Nostra Pizzerias, and full-time Metaverse (virtual reality) samurai named Hiro Protagonist (one of the best names since Billy Pilgrim!), is slowly drawn into a mystery involving a virus program called Snow Crash, which is claiming not only the computers but the minds on hackers the world over, including Hiro's best friend. Who is behind all this, and what it has to do with Sumerian mythology and the hard-wiring of the human language centers is what Hiro must find out, while at the same time he attempts to prevent the further spread of the Snow Crash virus. Along the way he falls in with a skateboard punk named Y.T., who is more instrumental to the story than might first be suggested, and who is the novel's most intriguing character, if only because her investigations are almost more revealing than Hiro's are -- in fact, Hiro comes off as a bit of a cypher compared to her. But I digress. All of these events take place in Stephenson's richly- imagined near-future, where the American government has become a tight-sphinctered, half-failed corporation, while corporations have become governments, and a multimedia mogul has cobbled together a vast fleet of refugee boats from various countries, in the most questionable act of philanthropy since Ted Turner tried to buy the UN. There are also gated communities that are not just gated but practically self-contained universes. And then there is the Metaverse...Stephenson's delightful extrapolation of the Internet, where you can be anyone you want to be, whether that person is yourself or someone else, within reasonable limits of course. The Metaverse is also as overloaded with advertising as the 'net is, and it was Stephenson's clever description of M.V. ads that really hooked me on this book for good (not that I needed much more persuasion at that point). The Metaverse, and the weird, wired world which surrounds it, are both so enthrallingly, memorably...I was going to say realistically, but perhaps a better term would be surrealistically, rendered, that reading about it is one of the novel's high points. Every moment of Snow Crash, practically, is full of mystery, intrigue, brightly-drawn (for the most part) characters, and humor. Oh, didn't I mention that Stephenson is a bloody riot to read? The man is a futurist-humorist-satirist of the first caliber...I would say worthy of Vonnegut, but that's pretty lofty company, and probably not entirely accurate. yet Stephenson comes darned close, and he, along with Kurt Vonnegut, Mark Twain, and Douglas Adams, is one of the few authors who can make me laugh right out loud, so mordantly witty is his stuff. But Stephenson is also more than a wit, as the clever premise behind Snow Crash suggests. His concept, that human consciousness and language concepts are as programmable as any computer, is as intelligently-reasoned as any science-fiction concept I've ever come across, and one which would later be revisited, reexplored, and expanded upon by Greg Bear in Darwin's Radio (see my review, he said in a shameless plug), although Bear added some wrinkles even Stephenson didn't think of. And in linking his concept back to both the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel, and to the Babylonian creation myth Enuma Elish, Stephenson creates a tapestry of invention that few writers in my experience have been able to equal, all told elegantly in Stephenson's supple, muscular prose. And if none of what I've written here convinces you to pick up Snow Crash, maybe this will: There is a tendency in science-fiction for writers to create improbable post-apocalypse dystopias (i.e., The Matrix, Mad Max, or any one of a hundred bad stories written by good writers -- even the great Harlan Ellison has written his share), and in my opinion such stories are not only ill-conceived but also a cheat. It's easy to imagine a post-apocalyptic world (where there seems to be all the gasoline, computer time, and electric energy available, no matter how wretched the rest of the world has become) -- in fact, it's too easy, which is part of the problem. Show me instead a far more difficult feat...instead of a blue-sky approximation of the post-apocalypse, show me how the world is GOING to end. That is what Vonnegut has done time and again (cf. &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; and the novel Slaughterhouse Five), and that is pretty much what Stephenson is doing with Snow Crash. He isn't worried about the post-apocalypse...but rather, about the aptly-named Infocalypse which may be happening all around us even now, right under our noses. And that, above all else, is why I love Snow Crash so much. It is rare, unique, and a thrill to read, and I would reccommend it without reservation to anybody."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The last great hope of cyberpunk to visit us, and one of the best and funniest, Snow Crash walks on the wild side of fiction, and struts while doing so. From page one you know this isn't a \\"normal\\" book: the first description is a pizza delivery man for the mob. If you don't get your pizza in time, the godfather feels that he has lost face, and you are personally visited by the Dom, while the \\"Deliverator\\" gets a pair of cement shoes. And that's just the beginning. The hero's name is Hiro Protagonist. It's obvious, it's absurd, but because the author knows not to snicker at his broad pun himself, it works. For this isn't just cyberpunk, although it has all the trappings; this is post-modern satire. And yet, even carrying all that dangerous literary baggage, it's also a roller-coaster ride of an adventure novel. True believers, this one's got everything.I'm actually a late-comer on touting the pleasures of this novel, and usually I find myself not enjoying things when I'm slow to become culturally on-line with, for the sad fact that I like to be a leader, rather than a follower. But Snow Crash overcomes all that. I wanted to be skeptical, but found it impossible to be skeptical and to be enjoying myself so much at the same time.There's a macguffin here that the hard SF freaks balk at: the new-age, Babel and Joseph Campbell influenced plot thread. To hell with them. This ain't serio-SF. This is a cross between the most biting Douglas Adams and the most pyrotechnic William Gibson, and if Stephenson feels like he wants to be Robert Anton Wilson as well, I'm willing to follow him."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Looking back to when this was published, it does make a few decent predictions - the rise of massive internet-only companies like Google - but the story reads more as escapist fantasy for nerds. The hero is a one-dimensional superman (there are no real situations where the story makes you feel like he's at any risk at all, throughout his escapades) who hacks code, swings a katana, and speaks Japanese. Moreover, while he's a nobody in the real world, he's a God among men in cyberspace.The prose isn't painful, although the dialog is a bit hack in places. It just reads like a better grade of trashy airport fiction. Stephenson spends a good 60% of the book gushing about fantasy technology and the other 40% is not solid enough exposition to make this a great read. The character development isn't done terribly well and the plot elements typically involve an endless series of deus ex machina.It's a good order of magnitude better than most cyberpunk or fantasy books...but in all honesty, that's not saying all that much.In short, if you're looking for simple filler with a likeable enough but shallowly defined superman who runs around in some kind of IT guy's fantasy land, then this is right up your alley. Otherwise I'd give it a miss."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Absolutely loved it! This book is for people who like intelligent fiction. Stephenson manages to capture pop-reality without being cheesey. It's a very well-researched and well-written book: silly and sardonic, futuristic and tangible. Potential readers shouldn't be turned off by the cover. The book is much better and more intricate than that silly illustration. Totally five stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The opening chapters of this book really raised my expectations! They have a giddy, zany, breakneck quality about them that is wonderfully refreshing. The characters, Y.T. and Hiro, are introduced well, and the early action is completely hilarious. However, the book goes into a slow decline after that. The long passages with Hiro and the Librarian are not only unnecessary, but incredibly tedious. Totally snooze-inspiring. A book that is basically techno-adventure should not delve so deeply into linguistic and biophysical theory. And the ending is extremely unsatisfying. It's as if the author got tired of the story, so he just stopped writing, not giving the reader the courtesy of even a cursory conclusion, leaving the reader slightly confused and very annoyed. However, Stephenson's vision of the future is a darkly funny and captivating one, with the Mafia and the Metaverse being especially well-drawn and well thought out. The chartacterization is strong thro! ughout, and the action sequences are written very well. The one unqualified thumbs-up? The Kouriers. What a fantastic idea! But they can't overcome the uneven pacing and the erratic story line. The book was enjoyable, but it could have been so much better! I give it three stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In keeping with my personal philosophy of exposing myself to different literary genres, I picked up a copy of Snow Crash -- a cyber punk novel. It's a different experience when you start out. You're not sure whether you're missing some background information or a special dictionary to go through the book. It starts off at a fast pace and uses words like Burbclaves, Franchulates, Kouriers, pooning, loglo, etc. Our protagonist is called Hiro Protagonist, a pizza deliverer for the Mafia-controlled pizza chain Cosa Nostra, who also happens to be a hacker supreme in the Metaverse and greatest sword fighter in the world.Did you do a double take on what I just said? If you did, welcome to the world of cyber punk. If you didn't, welcome to the world of cyber punk. The author has to lay down the groundrules of his &quot;future world&quot; while at the same time using that as a foundation to tell a story. (Everyone's vision of the future is different.)This novel will be very different from the others you've read. It is erratically paced. The action scenes from riding a skateboard to sword fighting are exciting and fast. The scenes in Hiro's office figuring out the mystery of Snow Crash with the Librarian is slow and sometime downright boring, preachy and dull. The plot is really simple. Once the dynamic duo of Y.T. and Hiro determine what Snow Crash is, the rest of the plot is predictable.The seemingly self-contradicting characters in this novel alone make it worth reading. Y.T. has real spunk. Her attitude is that of a typical carefree 15 year old rebel. She delivers packages on her hi-tech skateboard while keeping it a secret from her mom (a government programmer). Her dialogue is true to her character. Hiro is at times a curt, savage and indifferent person, yet at other times a loquacious, compassionate and loyal friend. His dialogue and actions display both extremes. Raven is described as Asian, but in reality he's a giant thug. There are many other characters that complete the book.Two weeks ago, if you asked me whether I'd pick up another cyber punk novel again I would have answered no. But lo and behold, I'm finishing up The Diamond Age by the same author, and I thoroughly enjoy it so far. Look for my review to come.All in all, I did enjoy this novel. It was a great intro to the world of cyber punk.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 3.5 (Hiro wavers, Y.T.'s a blast)E (Erotica) - 2 (one scene sticks out)A (Action) - 4 (pooning, katana-wielding, Reason)P (Plot) - 3 (simple, just complicated by cyber punk lingo and the &quot;future&quot;)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My suggestion is: read the first 20 pages. If you can put the book down at that point, do it - but I'll bet you can't.Snow Crash is an ultra-fast paced journey into the day after tomorrow that includes everything from acient Sumerians to the Metaverse (an extension of the internet) to a pizza delivery guy who carries Samurai swords and a canoe-paddling assasin whose blades are a molecule thick. His characters jump out of the pages, and his view of the not-so-distant future is startling and impressive.Stephenson's storytelling style fits the motif perfectly - hip, modern, and told entirely in present tense in something almost reminiscent of modernist stream-of-consciousness writers.This is the book you'll be telling your friends about."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"During the Montreal Jazz Festival, I had the opportunity to talk at some length with an interesting dude with a BS in computer science from Harvard and a Black Belt in Martial Arts. He told me I had to read a book called Snow Crash. Indeed, he stressed the point throughout the weekend. I was convinced. When I got home I picked it up and read it.I teach SF, but hadn't read any cyberpunk before. Wow. It was hard putting it down to go to sleep at night. A seriously cool book.What made Snow Crash if not revolutionary, then certainly evolutionary SF in 1992, was Stephenson's use of cyberspace as fictional space. It's the virtual Librarian, coupled with Hiro's inquisitiveness - i.e., his theorizing about the meaning of certain Sumerian/Biblical myths and the origin of language, and how language itself may contain mental/behavioral \\"viruses\\" and how that relates to the idea of a virus in relation to the vast internetwork that will be cyberspace - that really make Snow Crash such a brilliant tour-de-force of an SF novel.Snow Crash is about a seemingly revolutionary Idea (and SF is, at its best, about an Idea) - the possibility that our cerebral faculty, or minds and hence our behavior, can be compromised (i.e., reprogrammed) by a destructive virus contained in language itself. A serious thought in a world where people blow each other up because of words.I dare anyone to read the first 31 pages of this book and not be completely hooked."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a phenomenal book with crazy action, a greatstoryline, and superb characters. From the first page, NealStephenson pulls the reader into the story of our hero, HiroProtagonist (get it?) By page five, you're hooked, and good luck getting some sleep before the story is over.The characters in Snow Crash, while a bit over the top, are fantastic. Hiro is a computer hacker who has a side job working for the mob. Y. T. is Hiro's buddy, a skater kid with an attitude. We also get appearances by Uncle Enzo (the current mob don), a biker that has a nuke for a sidecar, and even the President of the United States.The plot trucks right along from the beginning, making you ask questions and guess what's really going on all the way through. It reads something like an episode of The X-Files mixed with Neuromancer, with just a bit of a Jackie Chan movie thrown in for good measure. To say more would be to give it away, so just trust me: it's cool.I've loaned this book out to several friends, and even my punky kid brother, who never reads, loved it.If you enjoy sci-fi, read it. If you like action, read it. If you like conspiracy books, read it. If you like cyberpunk, definitely read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Ok, this one was fun. Stephenson's writing style and descriptives dragged me along with great aplomb. I found myself re-reading sections of the book for descriptions and turns of phrases. The only criticism I have is that his characters occasionally appeared to be doing the literary equivalent of mugging for the camera, and like Heinlein's heroes, things were often a bit too easy for them. But the level of research, both of the Sumerian myth and history and language/meta-virus theory was quite impressive. Enough to go and seek out some of his sources, myself. Off to read more of his work."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Let's engage in a binary riddle, shall we?The kind of binary riddle that Snow Crash author and cybergeek Neal Stephenson loves so dearly, the kind of binary sorcery that undergirds the glittering silicon-spawned mile-high superstructure of the Metaverse's sprawling Neverland City.Boil all those 0's and 1's down and this is the riddle: DO---and DON'T---Believe the Hype.Do believe the Hype: \\"Snow Crash\\" is immediately consumptively engaging and deliciously readable, roaring along at light speed with style, flair, intrigue, and brutal aplomb.Don't believe the Hype: for all its techno flourishes and Mata Hari duplicity, \\"Snow Crash\\" is a simple tale.For all its sound and fury and caterwauls of vicious intrigue, Neal Stephenson's electric cyber-punk 1992 debut \\"Snow Crash\\" is a simple tale, the simplest, really: it is the story of a poor young knight (with Katana and Wakizashi at his belt, no less) out on an adventure, aided and abetted by at least two damsels, to prevent a Mad Evil Genius from destroying the world.It doesn't get much simpler than that.But wait a minute, now: the glory of the Hunt is the Chase, not the Kill. The dark delights of the gifted Stephenson's ripping good yarn is not the trip from Point A to Point B---which happens, for all of the detours---but the getting there.The poor young Knight: Hiro Protagonist, Knight Errant and warrior Prince of our near future cybernetic Underworld, freelance hacker and information runner, stringer for the Central Intelligence Corporation (formerly Agency, but in this day and age, baby, you gotta incorporate).Oh yeah, and Pizza Delivery Boy.Or rather, Deliverator, as Hiro styles himself---for Cosa Nostra Pizza, which serves up---along with its piping hot, delicious pizza pies---an offer the customer can't refuse: pizza in 30 minutes or it's on us. And you get a free trip to Sicily, and Uncle Enzo landing on your front lawn in his JetRanger 300 series, paying homage to you for the inconvenience.See, Cosa Nostra Pizza turns the Offer You Can't Refuse around on the Deliverator: 30 minutes or less, or the Deliverator is out of a job. And out of a life.By Page 5, our boy Hiro finds himself in the former situation, if not the latter. Out of a career, and back into the guts of hacking. He wields twin katanas, which speak louder than the micro-gun issued by Cosa Nostra to back up pizza delivery fees. He shares a storage locker out by LAX he calls home with underground rocker sensation Vitaly Chernobyl.Oh, and being one of the founding programmer fathers of the Black Sun, along with buddy Da5id, Hiro is a mover and shaker when he patches into the Metaverse, Stephenson's stand-in and prophetic forerunner of the World Wide Web---which he conjured up when the WWW was a faint glimmer cresting the binary monochrome of the old Dos/UNIX command line.In Real Life, Hiro is a nobody. In the Techno underworld of the Metaverse, he's Nobility.And someone is trying to kill the Metaverse and its hacker and programmer princelings, spreading a designer software virus called Snow Crash that crashes your system and fries your brain, reducing you to gibbering, drooling insanity.Talk about a computer bug.Who---or what---is behind Snow Crash? What is the connection between it and telecommunications mogul L. Bob Rife, who bought up the USS Enterprise to use as his own personal yacht, and has since made a few---erm---modifications? Who is this bad dude Raven, him of the Aleut looks, razor sharp javelins, \\"Low Impulse Control\\" tattoo on the forehead, and a black hog with a thermonuclear warhead joyriding in the sidecar? Why is Uncle Enzo and the Mafia so interested in Snow Crash? Who is this Kourier chick Y.T., and why is Uncle Enzo so interested in her? And will Hiro ever get enough real world dough for a decent pad?\\"Snow Crash\\" is absorbing, hyper-kinetic, eminently readable, and constantly intriguing: I polished it off in about 3 years one rainy Sunday afternoon. It's like that. For all the Tower of Babel imagery and Sumerian mythology Stephenson weaves in, this is not a meticulous and measured work of literary craftsmanship like Dumas's \\"Count of Montecristo\\", in which, if you removed a single word or altered a phrase, the entire structure would tilt, topple, and crash.Indeed, Stephenson seems to almost unwittingly channel William S. Burroughs's \\"Cut-up\\" style: any passage, any chapter, could be cut and pasted before or after any other and it wouldn't make a great deal of difference to \\"Snow Crash\\".But this is a giddy good read, constantly engaging and neat to poke around with like a new techno toy. Stephenson reads like William Gibson with a sense of humor.Plug in.JSG"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The book was long to a point where i found myself reading it and wondering when all the pointless plot segments would come together.

Great for geeks and nongeeks."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'll be 100% honest. I had never heard of Snow Crash prior to a few weeks ago. I knew of a few of the, generically lumped, \\"Cyberpunk\\" authors but I never really gave the genre a chance. Recently I read \\"Ready Player One\\" off a recommendation, and Snow Crash was mentioned by the author as being a big influence to him. So I looked into it, and I'm very glad I did.The book was written before so many of the terms, and environments, were realistic to a degree. Before terms like \\"Avatars\\" were common knowledge to different generations, and used in common day to day conversations of technology (Be it gaming, etc). So reading a book that, in a way, started that phase is interesting because you expect it have a few bits of things that caught on, and a lot that is just insanely far fetched.The thing is... the book holds up well.Yes, a lot of the technology talked about in Snow Crash may not exist in the form described in the book but it's getting to the point where we see these as some logical steps. The apocalyptic picture painted of the world mirror's a lot of our own fears, and thoughts. So when you read this book you almost forget the time that has passed since it was written.The story follow's two core people. Hiro Protagonist, and Y.T. You're constantly jumping between them, and sometimes it's not the cleanest or most opportune time to transition, but you honestly won't care. You'll still be glued to the pages, and wanting to see how it ends, and where it unfolds.I'm not going to waste your time discussing little plot points, or story points, etc, as you probably have read them a bunch of times if you're reading my review. The synopsis will give you the basics.What I will say is this. You should read the book if you're a tech head, gamer, or just someone into the cyberpunk genre (again, used generically). The story holds up, the characters are interesting, the switching of technology and history is enlightening in ways. The whole thing was a solid read. The author was ahead of his time with the vision he wrote into this book, and his story holds up nicely. A sometimes tough read, but a good read.My only gripe is the ending. I'm left with a lot of questions on those characters I have grown to love. I know the groundwork for a \\"you can easily construct your own vision, and probably be right with where the author was going\\" was set, and you don't feel that you are missing that. You just sort of end suddenly, and I would have liked a little more closure. Other than that, when I turned that last page I was glad with taking the time to read it.I know I have a tendency, when reviewing books, to really not focus much on the story itself in my reviews. This is because you're going to know a bit or you wouldn't be reading these reviews. You simply want to know if it's worth your hard earned dollars, and my thoughts on them. So yes. I think this book is worth that few bucks, and I hope when you're done you'll agree."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Imagine a science-fiction writer who doesn't impale himselfongeek-technology but rather uses it to free us from the morassofreality- to explore human nature and history.Definitely a fun read for everything from conspiracy nutsto priests ;)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Lots of action, realistic extrapolation, and even a message built in, I did really enjoy reading this book.(incidentally, I was in Mumbay and got to wander why when you visit a temple they offer you a milky holy water: read the book and you'll wander too)Technically, I would recommend the author to consider compact light reactors (based on U233 and from Brasil in my extrapolations) rather then radioisotope sources as power supplies.

Besides,how can you not love a book in which the central character'sname is &quot;Hiro Protagonist?&quot;"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson attempts to create a new cyberpunk vision, and comes up with mixed results. His Metaverse provides an excellent parallel to William Gibson's 'cyberspace', described in stunning but slightly pedantic detail (most readers will probably already know that powers of two like 256 and 512 are important in computers). His vision of a world ruled by commercial franchises, where the President of the United States is less well known than a Mafia godfather, is a startling notion, and uncomfortably believeable. However, once you get past the appealing scenery, there is little substance left. Stephenson seems content to interweave a mediocre and confusing plot with long, arcane references to Sumerian mythology that don't keep the reader interested for long. His characters are weak and hollow, with no real opportunity to develop personality traits that make the reader feel any attachment to them (not to mention the extraordinarily odd step of naming the main character Hiro Protagonist). The climax of the story, taking place in the Metaverse, appears to bring the plot together, but leaves the reader with an empty, &quot;What just happened?&quot; feeling. All in all, Stephenson's effort has a definite cyberpunk look and feel, but leaves much to be desired once you're inside."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really did enjoy this book for the most part. I work in the high tech industry, this gives me a sort of geek license to enjoy the nerdy aspects of the book. The metaverse was a very interesting concept - and not as far off as it seems. The references and comparisons to Sumerian mythos/languages were some of the more interesting aspects of the store (along with the general geekiness of the metaverse)Why three stars instead of more? The characters were not nearly as fleshed out as they needed to be, the ending was quite anti-climactic, and the writing was in places quite sloppy. Funny character names such as \\"Hiro Protagonist\\" does not make Neal Stephenson Thomas Pynchon. i.e.:\\"If we get out of this, will you be my girl?\\"This is one of the many gag moments - along with the extremely clunky male/female relationships and a hamhanded delivery of a 'sex scene'. Luckily were as many 'wow' moments as there were \\"barf\\" moments. This is what kept me reading, and not dashing the book into the fireplace."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"There are a lot of references to Gibson in these reader reviews. I have enjoyed Gibson's work, but in truth he has only begun to realize the potential he displayed in \\"Neuromancer\\" with \\"Pattern Recognition.\\" The rest of Gibson's books have been pulpy and enjoyable but do not approach the level of creativity or insight that either Stephenson or Bruce Sterling exhibit.Whether or not the Sumerian myth in \\"Snow Crash\\" is 100% correct is largely irrelevant, as far as I'm concerned. Simply by combining Julian Jayne's theory on the \\"dawn of consciousness and the bicameral mind\\", Chomskyan linguistic theory, Sumerian myth, and his own take on the pros and cons of a completely libertarian near future, and all along producing a great adventure story, Stephenson has put himself in a class by himself in regard to his fellow \\"cyberpunk\\" authors.Stephenson is not as much into anti-climax as Pynchon, but his novels do lack the trite \\"happy ending\\" (or anti-happy, for that matter) scenarios that many authors rely on to clean up their messes (Gibson finally fully realized his own Pynchon-esque anti-climax with \\"Pattern Recognition\\").After reading another review, I am saddened to learn that anyone who makes the comparison of Stephenson (or presumably, the other cyberpunk cadre- and by the way, it's BRUCE Sterling) to Pynchon is of an inferior nature intellectually. Ah, well, life is full of these disappointments. But, in the interest of argument, I will point out that the comparison is there because science fiction, and in particular \\"cyberpunk,\\" is about the interface between technology and humanity (and how technology changes humamity)- ala \\"Gravity's Rainbow.\\" Secret organizations and conspiracies are much less the issue.As far as referring to the world of \\"Snow Crash\\" as a dystopia (and \\"post-apocalyptic\\" is ridiculously off-the-mark- the only \\"apocalypse\\" involved is the \\"infocalypse\\" of Babel), that would be in the eye of the beholder. I expect a hard-core libertarian would see it as paradise. We would be significantly closer to this world right now if 9/11 hadn't happened and we weren't in the midst of an (hopefully temporary) expansion of federal powers. While some of the scenarios or situations may be somewhat extreme extrapolations of our current world and US trends (globalization and the shrinking of government), for the most part, Hiro's world is OUR world of corporate criminals, global franchises, shrinking government, de-regulation, religious fanaticism, gated communities, privatization, globalization, and information overload in some segments of the population and growing illiteracy in others, etc. AND one idea clearly stated in the book that holds pretty true now 13 years after its publication is that the United States only does four things better than anybody else: \\"music, movies, microcode, and deliver pizza in under 30 minutes.\\" I guess you could add we invade other countries and SHOP better than anybody else. While Stephenson's statement may be a little harsh, it's not far off the mark; we export culture ONLY, these days, with varying degrees of success.If the timeline of \\"Snow Crash\\" seems improbable, see above paragraph, and bear in mind \\"1984\\" done came and went, too.In the study of history, it is better to understand the content and meaning of an event or period rather than all associated dates. Similarly, speculative fiction is about concepts and trends, and dates are more for shock value than anything else. Considering the book was written in 1992, it is entirely possible that two characters could have fathers in WWII (what year did Stephenson have in mind? 2002? 2005? 2010?- that might put Hiro and Raven in their late 30s, born late to older fathers) and have another character who had been in Viet Nam. The whole point is that this could all come to pass in our lifetimes, and as stated previously, for all intents and purposes a great deal of it has.Read \\"Snow Crash,\\" followed by \\"The Diamond Age,\\" which is (sort of) a sequel, at least in terms of extrapolating his future world-view. Then jump into \\"Cryptonomicon\\" and \\"The Baroque Cycle\\" to see the development of an author who is a lot of fun and provocative as well. If you really get into it, check out \\"Zodiac\\" to see and early example of a good work and \\"The Big U\\" to see a very early example of a not-so-good work.Now I think I'm going to order an extra copy of \\"Snow Crash\\" just to make sure I have one around in case of emergency. Oh, and I'll go caress my Pynchon books and bask in the glow of my love of the IDEA of Pynchon, even though I apparently ain't smort enuff to unnerstan' him."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Take William Gibson's flair for neo-futuristic cyberpunk. Introduce a bizarrely colorful cast of characters: a dreadlocked hacker who prefers samurai swords to guns, a young but volatile messenger-cum-heroine, an unstable homicidal deviant who lugs around a hydrogen bomb just for kicks, and various and sundry extras both real and artificially programmed. Toss in a smidge of Douglas Adams's subtle wackiness, a garnish of JRR Tolkien's fascination with languages and a generous helping of Jonathan Lethem's taste for the flat-out absurd. Neal Stephenson has woven a kaleidoscopic hodgepodge of elements - humor, rapid-fire prose, witty cynicism, farce, biblical mythology and much more - into a book that stands out from all the other fiction I've read by dint of sheer audaciousness alone.Naming his main character Hiro Protagonist (harharhar) is just the tip of Stephenson's iceberg. We're treated to a detailed glimpse of a future America where pizza delivery is run by the Mafia, speaking in tongues is one's ticket to religious pseudo-enlightenment on a boat city on the Pacific, and the virtual-reality Metaverse (the future's hyperdeveloped version of the internet) accomodates motorcycle chases at Mach 2. Like the best science fiction it's wonderful escapism because it's so farfetched; like the best satire, there are numerous elements just weird enough to be completely believable. The plot's many details can get as confusing as the basic story itself is simple, but the disparity between all the parts still makes for an addictingly fun whole.The main lapse/s into lengthy dialogue-bordering-on-lecture occasionally interrupts the whole flow, but that's probably inevitable when one tries mixing this book's degree of the intellectual in among all the action/adventure stuff. That's really the only stumbling block I found here. Even the present-tense narration I normally hate was just a small speed bump. If you're fascinated with languages and mythology, the degree of inventiveness behind the Snow Crash virus itself will be the book's most brilliant touch (and maybe a laugh riot at the same time). If action's what you're looking for, be assured there are fights aplenty and no shortage of things blowing up. There's a strong vein of black humor running throughout the story that'll have your inner cynic cackling like a hyena, albeit a relatively calm one.With all that said.. this probably isn't a book for everyone. But if these descriptions sound like anyone's cup of tea, then I doubt they'll regret giving Snow Crash a whirl. A book that manages to be simultaneously this gripping, vivid, creative, cerebral and laugh-out-loud funny is a rare thing indeed."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This exciting, imaginative tale is marred by its homogenous characters and puerile sensibility.For example: two-thirds in we're finally given a good look at Raven, the story's mysterious bad guy, who turns out to be just another foul-mouthed boor with a bad 'tude.And, as they say, it's all downhill from there: the remainder is almost unreadable, as the author turns to insipid, highly contrived monologue/action sequences to come up with an ending - ANY ending, I imagine. This is an extreme disappointment after the blazing, highly readable opening chapters.Oh, well - there are some interesting bits: some of the satire is funny, the technology is funky, and the premise, although poorly executed, is fascinating. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Don't let the Kirkus review above scare you off. This novel is tremendous, with great insight, a blistering pace, wit, and excellent character development. You'll love Hiro, Y.T., Uncle Enzo, and even the Rat Thing."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"When 'Snow Crash' was published in 1993, Gibson's 'Neuromancer' had already been on the market for almost 10 years. In view of this fact it seems to me that a large majority of the SC readers and loversa) probably never read the books of Gibson, Sterling etc. at all or b) merely read them quite superficially, just focusing on 'speed &amp; action' and cool technical gadgets without any further insight into characterization and atmospheric aspects.When I was reading SC I constantly had the impression, that Stephenson looked at 'Neuromancer' etc. like some guy who is standing in a museum in front of a masterpiece painting, saying to himself 'I can do that !'.But of course he can't, and so couldn't Stephenson since fortunately there is more behind art than simply putting cliches together.So what came out as 'Snow Crash' is merely a cyberpunk fan's work - not a cyberpunk writer's work - and it tell's you a lot about what has become of the original cyberpunk ideas, concepts and intentions that only quite few readers seem to notice this."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Overall, I found Snow Crash to be an extremely original, if not always precisely engaging, romp through a thoroughly disturbing world. Although the world was fascinating and Stephenson obviously has a gift for imagining truly off-the-wall environments, the problem I had with this novel is that it was just that: a collection of really cool, cyberpunk-like vignettes with minimal narrative linkage between them. As such, I found that this book read more like a glorified, beefed up character study than an actual novel. Many of the more interesting plotlines were abandoned before they had even really been given a chance to breath (examples include the Fallaballa camp, the cyberdog, and the Northern Kodiak Republic).Conversely, where Stephenson did focus on the story, the plotline seemed somewhat derivative and less than solid. After all, the main character seems to decide to go off on his quest for no real reason, risking life and limb in an amazing adventure, basically because a friend asks him to (granted there's more to it than that, but that's the gist). The most interesting parts, especially involving the impact of language on the human brain and pysche development seemed largely unfinished and while it would appear that Stephenson had a very strong idea of where he wanted to go with it, he seemed unable to fully articulate the details of his plot and as such just sort of threw his ancient Babylonian myth backstory at the main plot and just hoped the reader would make the connection and not spend too much time trying to figure it out.Likewise, there are several annoying plot holes which are never really plugged, and the reader is forced to assume that everything just happened behind the scenes (ex. how Hiro came to realize that he and Raven were linked, how and why Hiro decided to become a gargoyle, among others). This coupled with Stephenson's tendency to drop storylines as soon as they become interesting is frustrating.This is not to say that \\"Snow Crash\\" is not worth the read. Considering that it was written in 1992, it has aged relatively well for an entry into the cyberpunk genre. Stephenson seems to have more or less accurately predicted the rise of MMORPG-type environments, the continued integration of personal electronics, and the pervasiveness of the net and networking sites. While we take these things for granted today, in 1992 these concepts were revolutionary (or at the very least ahead of the curve). As such while Snow Crash is certainly a worthy entry into the field of cyberpunk, apart from its immaginative setting and forward-looking view of technology, there is really nothing here to distinguish it beyond the genre."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I got hooked on the first page.Not only is the style stellar and the plot electric, but it's funny, too. There's not much more to say: the dystopia Stephenson describes is an anarcho-capitalist wet dream, though I don't think there's a political message here. The characters are beautifully sketched, beautifully introduced, beautifully grown. The world is nightmarish and fun at once. The plot never stops, and always surprises.More than the author's mastery of the language, or his imaginative science fiction, the book is just really fun. I could read it again and again."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I loved everything from the wonderful and entertaining way the book was narrated to the technology used by the characters. The anarchic world that Neal Stephenson described in this book is very interesting and I almost wish that he had described it more.The characters are excellent, and the two protagonist(Hiro and Y.T.)are extremely funny. Finally, the reason I give this book four instead of five is because I believe the ending seemed to sputter out without a real conclusion. Also interesting to people who read this book is one of Neal Stephenson's other works Diamond Age."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was reccommended to me by a friend who is very much into cyberpunk, and he loved this book. I like most science fiction, including the cyberpunk genre, and I was not disappointed by this novel. The characters are all well-defined and unique, and all are likable, even the \\"bad guys\\". I was surprised at how much of the book deals with ancient history subject matter, but it does directly pertain to the plot line and the mystery that Hiro Protagonist - the hero/protagonist of the novel, a hilarious name choice - is trying to get to the bottom of. The character Y. T. (Yours Truly) is a rebellious teen-aged girl who steals the show, in my opinion, and ties all the characters together by her fateful encounters with them.Stephenson's writing is easy to follow and provides a great amount of visual discription, which makes imagining his world very easy. There are a lot of neat not-too-distant-future toys that make an appearance in the novel, creating a technology texture for the reader. The story line is interesting but not so fast that it's unfulfilling.In a nutshell: Interesting subject matter, fun to read, not as cryptic as some sci-fi can be."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is the best of the Stephenson novels. But be prepared, it introduces concepts characters and events at an incredible rate. This book is not for the faint of heart but what a ride it is. Pick it up and Hang on because if you can keep up you are in for the ride of your life."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Cyberpunk is a term that defies strong definition. Most people agree it is a subgenre of science fiction, that it has something to do with the relationship to man and his machines, and that it tends towards an idea-rich, &quot;crammed&quot; prose style. Bruce Sterling and William Gibson are the two other others most often associated with this field. Neal Stephenson, in Snow Crash, does the best of all. He proposes many futurist ideas without sacrificing the storytelling, and his characters are amongst the most memorable. If you were turned off to this genre due to the weak plotting and dense prose of Gibson, it's time to give it a second chance with this novel."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I do love this book, it is one of the best cyberpunk novels I've ever read, tied with William Gibson's Neuromancer. The only thing maring it is the confusing pacing at the beginning when we have two separate characters going about their business before their paths reconverge and the ending, which is more of a non-ending. I really think this book could have been ended better a few chapters earlier, like a movie that runs too long after it's climax is over. I liked the Sumerian mythology but the exposition of it detracted from the pace of the story somewhat and made me wonder when he was going to get back to the characters. Despite these downsides, the book is good enough to warrant 4.5 stars, but since that isn't possible here I'll round it up to 5."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"One of my favorite books and one of my favorite authors. Stephenson writes in the same vein as Thomas Pynchon, but it's a faster ride and the storyline is easier to follow. And, unlike Gravity's Rainbow, things get more or less resolved at the end.Stephenson weaves together notions of cyberspace, virtual reality, and avatars, much as presented in The Matrix, but ties it in with plot twists of ancient Sumeria, religion, drugs, viruses of all sorts, and ties it all together with different ways of hacking the firmware of the wetware.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The beginning seemed interesting - an alternate American reality where roads have become towns, people live in storage lockers, toxic wastes sitting around with no one to care anymore and violence gone out of control it's everyone for themselves in this society. Also the concept of the Mega-verse was fascinating. However...The characters were cardboard and seemed to me unbelievable as real human beings, I could only imagine them as animation figures. In a world where the most advanced weapon technology can been had by anyone that can afford to pay for them, Hiro Protagonist, our main man, is able to fight all his battles with swords. He is the best sword fighter in the world, apparently descended from samurai, as well as a computer genius. Then there's the main villain, Raven, he has a nuclear bomb inside his body who fights with glass swords able to cut through armor. And YT, 15 years old, young, blond and attractive with the strength & fighting skill of several grown men put together, and the wisdom & vision of a seer. The plot too was weak, almost non-existent, the same old simple good versus evil battle, the Sumerian legend theory seemed far-fetched and ridiculous, even embarrassing.Maybe just not my kind of book?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Simply fascinating. Stephenson re-thinks the biblical fable of Babel as fact, and in the process explains a great deal. The mystery of liguistic viruses- the idea that religion, or indeed any complex thought, is capable of being spread from person to person as if a viral infection and mutating much like we now understand viruses to do - truly fascinating.Action sequences that will please any fan, ideas presented within the context of the metaverse, or next generation avatar-based web, and a true sociological examination of contemporary religion make this a book i re-read over and over."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Snow Crash. It was incredibly well written, entertaining on every page, creative and extremely funny. When I checked when the book was written I was really surprised that it hadn't been written in the last few years, given the vision of the world that the author has created. Highly recommend this book for sci fi lovers or tech geeks."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Though not exactly distopian. There are hints of the society explored in this title in our own culture. He is a huge fan of the \\"in late, out early\\" writing method, which works. A tiny bit dated."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"With this one you have to get past the description. I had this book recommended by a friend and his description was not inspiring. To his credit he was trying desperately to entice me without giving away spoilers, but regardless I was unimpressed. Long story short he hounded me until I read it and my only regret is not having read it earlier.Be wary, no intentional spoilers but I am describing the book:Generally, the setting is an alternate reality to the one we are currently living that is close enough that it seems thing could have gone that way. The main character Hiro Protagonist is the world's best swordsman and a pizza delivery boy. He is unwittingly thrown in the middle of world changing events where he attempts to single handedly save the world (well mostly single handedly). PS everyone else carries a gun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really liked the world of this series. From the burbclaves to a fractured world, it seems so possible, but also shows how it wouldn't necessarily be the end of the world and might, in many ways, be better than our current order of nation-states.Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Pros: Pretty darn creative. Stephenson is extremely humourous. The whole section on the governmental memo on toilet paper pools was great. A steady diet of Stephenson would be too much, but once in awhile is just the change in pace I need (I usually do action/adventure books).Cons: Of the three books of his I've done, only Anathem has a reasonably written ending. Both Diamond Age and Snow Crash ended like \\"And they lived happily....\\" He didn't even get the \\"ever after\\" in. After all that effort to create a reasonably written and creative story, and he doesn't stick the landing.I find this to be a continuation of some of Stephenson's genetic theory, communication, propagation stuff that he was proposing in Diamond Age. I don't buy a word of it, but its certainly entertaining, it allows me to push my brain around in a different way.Bottom Line: A good Stephenson to start with. If you liked his other stuff, then you'll enjoy this too."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Definitely a great read for anyone looking for a writing style that is a bit out there and can understand that this novel was written 20 years ago. This is one of the few occasions where I feel compelled to state that if you didn't like it you probably didn't get it.Also one should not assume that all of Stephenson's books are written in this style, I read everything but The Big U and each book has its own distinct style with a certain flair unique to the author."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'll keep it short, others have put is more eliquently. If you liked William Gibson's Neuromancer, you will likely enjoy this. It is one of my favorite science fiction novels as it has cyberpunk, psuedo history, a unique idea of a virus being both electronic and bioligical, and action. In my opinion, this one has it all."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"With main characters named Hiro Protagonist and YT (Yours Truly), this book already had a unique style by chapter three. A dystopian near-tomorrow 1980's based setting conceptualizes a world past the collapse of society into franchises (like Uncle Enzo's Mafia, the Crips, Greater Hong Kong, and the Government of the United States) and enclaves/burblands, where commerce is conducted by might-makes-right and daredevil Kouriers who ride the skateboards of tomorrow. Weird concepts include electromagnetically (har)pooning traffic for greater board speed, cyborg pit-bulls called 'Rat-Things', and the portable suitcase railgun 'Reason'.Hiro is black/asian, and he is a sword wielding hacker who has a pizza delivery side job and lives inside a small converted storage locker in Reality. In the Metaverse, the 3-d version of the internet, he's serious business, having helped write the avatar disposal routines. YT is fifteen, has a short attention span, and is sexually active (complete with her own love scene late book). This may offend. YT and Hiro become business partners around page 90ish after they save each other from various circumstances.The plot is neurolinguistic hacking... based on a bunch exposition involving the Tower of Babel and Sumerian history, someone has figured out how to basically hack into the subconscious of the everyman and reprogram his psyche. These ancient programs called 'me' would concentrate an obscene amount of power into someone's hands, and Hiro and YT are trying to stop it.The prose is funny, gritty, in-your-face, cyberpunk-styled action, but the exposition is inserted in story flow disruptive chunks, and the ending leaves much to be desired in terms of characterization closure. Overall I liked the work, but it had rough edges. Three and a half stars rounded up."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hiro Protagonist is a free-lance hacker for the CIC (the Central Intelligence Corporation) and pizza delivery guy for the Mafia, a concert promoter, and other things to make ends meet. He is also the greatest swordsman in the world of the not too distant future. Most nation states have fallen apart and corporations have taken over running things. Hiro and his sidekick Y.T. are in up to their necks in a plot to take over the world by a \\"computer virus\\" as old as civilization itself.In this very original thriller that smacks of Lethal Weapon and the Matrix (although written in 1992) Neal Stephenson weaves together Sumerian myth, hackers, Pentecostalism, the world of organized crime, and an America that is scarily recognizable into a fast-paced intelligent story that will keep you turning the pages far into the night. The only problems are that Stephenson is sometimes needlessly crass, and the ending of the book is so abrupt it leaves a lot of loose ends that left me gasping for breath and a little put out with the author.I enjoyed it immensley, but it left me unsatisfied with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is a modestly-compelling novel with elements of mystery, action, and historical fiction. The characters are well developed; I had no trouble placing Hiro as a multi-cultured and skilled hacker lost in mediocrity and Y.T. as just a stupid, annoying [expletive deleted]. The details into Sumerian myth and the Tower of Babel were well thought out, and while the connection with the technologically advanced Snow Crash metavirus may seem ostensibly tenuous, the author's slow-paced narrative between Hiro and the computerised Librarian is interesting enough.Unfortunately, the novel suffers from a Hollywood-esque violent action ending that ruins the story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The best words I can think of to describe this is a science fiction novel with attitude. Like if a Sex Pistols fan majored in computer engineering and then wrote about LA in the future.As I was reading, I had to continually check the copyright date to make sure that I wasn't mistaken and that it was actually published more than 15 years ago. Stephenson is completely spot on with his portrayal of technology and the digital age, it's frightening, mostly because all of that technology in the book is the method for bringing about the corruption and destruction of society.There is so much historical, philosophical, and theological content in this story that at times I felt my head swimming with information overload. However, right when I would be about to set down the book to take a breather, the author sets aside all the heavy stuff and let me have my breather by giving me some futuristic hilarity or violence.It was an entertaining read to say the very least."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Scholars willing to study the Second-Life phenomenon would do well by first turning to \\"Snow Crash.\\" Many terms which we use in the on-line community today on an every day basis, such as \\"avatar,\\" originated in this book.This book was written between '89 and '91 and \\"misses\\" several technologies we take for granted today. For instance, the book describes a scene where a video connected to a TV in a bar gets rewinded when the movie is over (huh? no DVD?), and similarly many other common functions and technologies are replaced with pre-'90s equivalents. But Stephenson's vision of how virtual reality systems function and the level of immersion that they afford to their users is surprisingly prophetic and accurate. Culturally, the book portrays an environment which is consistent with other cyberpunk works (a la Philip K. Dick's \\"Plastic, Franchised America\\").All in all, this is one of the classic cyberpunk novels, and together with Gibson's famous trio can be considered as one of the works that launched an industry. More importantly, this book is packed with action, incessant suspense, and just a lot of fun to read. It doesn't fall short of the author's more recent masterpieces."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"this is the problem with books and music. i'm absolutely certain that there is a ton of really great stuff out there and i'm missing out simply because i'm not aware of it! and yet, there is a resistance to being open to the suggestions of others (even pro critics) because they can't possibly know what i think is nifty and i only have so much time.... alas.anyhoo, this book is FANTASTIC! it took until the second sitting to realize that it is written in PRESENT TENSE! i did a mental double-take! what in the world! i'm aware that there have been novels written in present tense but this is the first time i've ever read one!but it doesn't read dryly like a screenplay. it is every bit as descriptive and rich as a novel should be (and more) and stereotypically, i too must opine that it does indeed add a sense of urgent immediacy to the proceedings.i love, i adore william gibson's neuromancer as well as his compilation burning chrome. and comparisons are inevitable. but i would say stephenson is more familiar and at the same time, more out there. and when the book starts bringing up religion and anthropology and history, i kept thinking about the author - who the heck is this guy?!and as deliriously evocative as gibson's prose can be, it is rarely EXCITING or action packed in the summer movie sense. but man, imagine my surprise when there are several set pieces in snow crash that make you smile at the images playing in your head and like a little kid, i was reduced to muttering \\"how cool!\\"i regretted not knowing about this book. i hope i can be a voice that informs you of its existence and exhorts you to pick it up and give a try. it's a benevolent virus and a really fun time flipping pages.jin"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It's hard to believe that \\"Snow Crash,\\" one of the flagship works in the cyberpunk genre, was published fifteen years ago. The wildly-creative vision of a near-future society in which many of the traditional powers and functions of government are displaced by massive corporate franchises, the intellectual elite spend much of their time wired into a Metaverse with an unmistakable resemblance to today's Internet, and racial, cultural and national boundaries have become increasingly irrelevant, still comes across as a convincing extrapolation of current trends. Neal Stephenson brings this world to life through the eyes of computer programmer/sword fighter Hiro Protagonist, a brash, fifteen-year-old, female skateboard courier named Y.T., and a number of other colorful denizens of this mad computer-centric society.The plot, which has a farcical and haphazard feel, serves mainly as a platform to bring together the author's diverse interests in technology, Sumerian mythology, and social satire. This may be off-putting to those who expect a tight, coherent story line. Yet for those who are willing to plough through some dense passages chronicling an alternate history of language and religion and overlook a number of dead-ending plot threads, this book is likely to be a rewarding read.And who knows, reading it could turn out to be good preparation for the day when America can do only four things better than anyone else: music, movies, microcode (software) and high-speed pizza delivery. Heck, we're almost there now."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is considered one of the best cyberpunk novels out there, and this is more than well deserved. This book chronicles the exploits of a Hiro Protaganist. Yes, if the name didn't give it away too much he's the good guy in this novel. He's a programmer, hacker, master swordsman, and, oh yeah, mafia pizza delivery man. All in all he's when every pasty kid who spends 12 hours at a computer daily wishes he was.The world Stephenson creates, where one of the only tihngs the US is good at anymore is on time pizza delivery, is so far off in left field you can't help but laugh and get sucked into it. Much of the future is too close for comfort, like the horrid sprawl that creates an eyesore over the entire planet, as well of the meshing of cultures to such a degree that there really is nothing unique anymore.The plot, involving a resurrection of the language before the Tower of Babel fell, is fascinating in its mythology, and the means that the hacker's ability of reading computer language is used against him is fantastic, as well as the way they get new converts(which seemed to me like a thinly veiled rip on protestant mega-churches).Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I thought this novel was great - I had previously read Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon,\\" which was amazing, so I had high expectations. They were, for the most part, met.However, I found the \\"Librarian\\" to be somewhat of a trope - it seemed as if Stephenson had difficulty linking the diverse strands of his plot (Metaverse, \\"reality,\\" and Sumerian myth) together and had to employ a long-winded virtual program as somewhat of a stand-in to tie some of the more esoteric Sumerian threads into the entire plot. Forgiveable in a first novel, but set in relation to the whole (and the standard set by his later work) I was a little disappointed.Regardless, still highly recommended."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was a brilliant book when it came out in the 90's and it has held up very nicely. Unlike William Gibson, who had great ideas but was unable to create compelling characters or narrative, Neal Stephenson combines mind-blowing ideas (each chapter of Snow Crash contains at least one plot point which a lesser author would have turned into an entire book) with compulsive page-turning writing and characters who are both complex and interesting. The first chapter is a little choppy, but the story finds a rapid-fire groove in the second chapter and stays there until the end. He is a rare genre-defining writer who has yet to write a bad novel, even if he has disowned his first book, \\"The Big U.\\" This is the first book of his I read, and it remains my favorite although his other novels are great. Get it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson wrote this book in the late 80's / very early 90's. If you read the book (which is a really great read even if it were written recently) with that in mind, it will give you an extra appreciation for the feats of imagination contained within. The \\"internets\\" as our fearless leader would call it was certainly in existence at that time, but people, it was accessed via character based, pre-Windows, menu driven applications!The story starts with a sci-fi futuristic bang but builds into a really compelling drama/mystery that just gets more and more interesting while introducing one great futuristic notion after another. Eventually he ends up dealing with the origin of human language, the Bible, the Mafia, corporate America, skater culture...but it's not all over the place. It's brilliant.I've given this book to at least 10 people, and every last one of them loved it. A slam dunk any time but especially for holiday/summer/travel reading."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"First understand that I am not normally a science fiction fan, certainly not a reader of \\"cyberpunk\\" fiction, yet I loved this book. This is probably the first science fiction book I have read since grade school. I only read it because it was recommended by a friend.This book is so different from anything I've ever read. One of the other reviewers said that Snow Crash had the best first chapter in any novel ever; I think Anna Karenina and the Brothers Karamazov come close, but this may be the first introductory chapter I've read. Stephenson literally invents a new world and uses the first couple of chapters to introduce the new lingo and basic concepts going along with it.The vast majority of my reading deals with history or current events, and so I think what mesmorized me was the social trends that Stephenson seemed to be predicting, bearing in mind that I was reading this book in the 2004-2005 period, well over a decade after publication. Not everything is right and I don't think he literally intended it that way, but the picture of the future he paints was, I thought, really amazing for a book written 1988-1991.His concept of a Burbclave, a \\"city-state with its own constitution, a border, laws, cops, everything\\" and other substate entities taking over sovereignty was right on. Although I have long been generally aware of the localized zoning phenonemon, I didn't realize how far this had gone until I read Robert D. Kaplan's 1997 book, An Empire Wilderness, about the present and future of the United States. Had I not read Kaplan's book I would not have fully understood Stephenson here, and the way he pictures the world.The Metaverse of course is quite insightful; the internet was around then, but it is much more obvious now that something like this is possible, that people might live their lives in virtual reality. I bet Stephenson thought he had been ripped off when he saw the Matrix movie, too.A similar but distinct point is regarding his Central Intelligence Corporation, and you would have to be hooked into the world of intelligence to really make the connection, in fact he may not have intended this. Stephenson doesn't use the phrase, but \\"open source\\" intelligence is one of the big trends of the future. And there are private intelligence corporations now, Stratfor being the most prominent.The way Stephenson pictures the thinness of culture has mirrors a worrying trend - like the reference to the woman who speed reads tabloids and can't control her kids, and the fact that people are so socially detatched and rootless. And the fact that Hiro is wanderer, a guy with an intense interest but fixed to no specific place, is emblematic of that.When I first read Stephenson's reference to America not manufacturing things, having not read the year of publication, I did look at the copyright page, since that dates it somewhat. The early 1990s was when that was really big, and lately the hysteria has been over outsourcing. On that issue I've never bought the dire predictions. There is some truth to what he says though, especially in terms of economic global interconnectedness and globalization more broadly. Also, his emphasis on Japanese corporations is a bit dated - if he were writing the book today I'm sure that they would be Chinese.So if you are looking for something new to read, and you haven't ever read Neal Stephenson, try him out."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow crash is good science fiction. If you are looking for a deep-thought sci-fi, then you're knocking at the wrong doorstep. Neal Stephenson is an awesome writer; this is a highly entertaining book and the best in the cyber punk genre. This book is best for mature readers."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of those books that has a word-of-mouth reputation as a good read. A novel beloved of all hackers. Having finally read the novel I can see why it's considered a must read if you love your Sci-Fi with distinct cyber themes. It's both entertaining and presents some original ideas I haven't seen elsewhere. It starts out pretty normal but about a third of the way through the story a good twist comes up that in many ways turns the story you thought you were reading on its head.Hiro is pizza courier by day and the last of the freelance hackers in cyberspace by night. When he fails to deliver a pizza on time and looses his job and then finds an old friend affected by an impossible virus he finds himself drawn into a plot that could destroy everything he loves.If you like Sci-Fi this book should still be on your reading list as it's still a good read. It's not perfect and I certainly hope this future never comes true but it's also easy to see why it's considered a classic book by now."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Early on reading this I got the impression I was supposed to take this book with a grain of salt: the characters are so over the top it's hard not to, and Stephenson's prose has an underlying dark humor and sarcasm that I liked. Plus there are a few genuinely interesting ideas scattered throughout.Unfortunately, this book is hit or miss, largely because the structure and pacing is so awkward. The first half was a real hoot to read, but in the middle there are suddenly several chapters of awkward exposition, and then the back half is all action sequences heavily seasoned with intervention from the gods of plot convenience. Each of these was a speed bump that really threw me and my mood (and enjoyment) off.I probably would have loved this book if I had read it 20 years ago, when I was in my teens and the underlying cyberpunk flavor was still fresh. Unfortunately, I've grown up. Still, turn your brain off (ie: don't expect \\"literature\\") and keep your expectations reasonable, it's a decent read -- if you like this sort of thing.3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Conceived as a graphic novel, but published without pictures, this furiously fast-paced, wildly inventive cyberpunk novel is really too cool to miss. So you will not be led astray, the hero is named Hiro Protagonist, an Afro/Asian free lance hacker and stringer for the privatised CIA. His partner, a 15 year old courier on a super high tech skateboard is a perfect example of ultra hip teen girls, with thinking, libido, and slanguage to match. Together in alliance with the franchised Mafia they take on a religious super cult inexplicably bent on the mental destruction of the homo superior hacker class amidst a landscape of franchised enterprises of all sorts constituting teeny city states that make Italy post-Roman Empire seem positively grand. Unreal concepts? Hell yes, but way more fun than I've had from a book in a long time. Buy it for summertime poolside fun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Not much can be added to what's already been said... fine action, engaging characters & storyline, intricate technical detail, not to mention witty and entertaining. Some of the passages on Hiro's academic research can become tedious, but that's really the only fault I could find with this novel, and it's a minor one. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I missed Snow Crash when it was published in the early '90s. As the years passed, knowing that Snow Crash was a high-tech, cyberpunk tale set in the near future, I figured why bother? The novel's time came and went and sci-fi novels of the near future are a lot less interesting when history and technology make their premises irrelevant. But there are some novels, like those of H.G. Wells and especially Orwell's 1984, that are still great literature even if their posited futures clearly have not come to pass. Stephenson is such a well-liked author that I decided to give him a try, and I might as well try with his breakthrough novel. I'm glad I did. Snow Crash is a rollicking good adventure that also has an intellectual undercarriage that makes you keep thinking about the book after you've read it. It is one of those books you want your friends to read so you can talk about it.Also, even though the action in the novel should take place right about now, the fact that the nightmarish future created by Stephenson has (yet) to occur does not diminish the chill of recognition that a future like Stephenson paints could still happen. As with Orwell's 1984, just because that year has come and gone does not make that novel any less compelling and cautionary.Snow Crash follows two very intriguing and fun characters -- a hacker samurai and his teenage skateboarding partner -- into a mystery involving viruses, the virtual reality Metaverse, a monopolist businessman who would be king, and Sumerian myth. Stephenson pulls all these strands together brilliantly. Strip away the cyberpunk stuff and you still have a very tight, fast-paced plot and great book to read.This novel contains a lot of violence, some sexual content, and a very depressing depiction of the near future -- think of it as an R rated movie, a good one but not for youngsters. Despite the horrifying dystopia that this novel suggests that we will be living in soon, Stephenson seems to have a fundamentally upbeat view of human nature. This novel is not picaresque and nihilistic; the heroes are decent people out to do good deeds. Despite the cyberpunk sensibility, this is an epic adventure, worthy of the ancient myths that apparently inspired Stephenson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is just a wild ride in a high tech world. Like all good science fiction, it allows a historical archetype (the Samurai) to explore a brilliantly created world- in this case with his futuristic sword and in pursuit of a harpoon-wielding bad guy. Stephenson is a very creative author, and his characters all shine. He put a lot of work into this stand-alone novel (rare for sequel-obsessed authors such as him) and I was sorry it had to end. I picked up Snow Crash after my favorite author, Max Barry, recommended it. Now I have CO-favorite authors."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is one of those books that will either grab you in the first 30 pages, and hold you to the end, or you will hate. You'll worry about the comic book aspect at first, but quickly get past that.As with much of Neal Stephenson's writing, Snow Crash is completely unique. It is hilarious through the first half of the book, and has a couple of Stephenson's amazing allegories sprinkled throughout. One in particular describing a Dilbert-view of a future Federal bureaucracy is worth the price of the book on it's own. Snow Crash is not, however, at the level of Cryptonomicon. The world of Snow Crash seriously bogs down and becomes Hollywood-movie-clich&eacute;d at the end. But it's a great ride getting there."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"So I went from reading _The Da Vinci Code_ on the (regrettable) advice of a friend to reading _Snow Crash_ based on a throwaway line in a newspaper editorial. Despite all the obvious differences in the books, I was struck by one huge underlying similarity: the use of ancient legend to try to make sense of the modern world generally, and religion specifically. The difference is that where TDVC comes off as a screed against religion duct-taped on top of a bunch of chase scenes, _Snow Crash_ actually works as a novel all by itself, with a semi-coherent philosophy giving it enough impact to be memorable.Of course, it's not a perfect book. I almost gave it 4 stars rather than 5, since there are a few plot holes here and there and a bit too much exposition, but when looking at the book as a whole, those are actually minor issues. Despite its futuristic feel, Stephenson understands the great rule of old-school performers--throw enough good stuff at the audience quickly enough, and it won't matter if some of it doesn't work perfectly.And, finally, a hint for reading the book, since there's so much detail in it: Don't get hung up on all the Sumerian stuff--you can always page back to it if you need details."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you love Science Fiction this is a &quot;must read&quot;. If you don't despise Science Fiction this is a &quot;must read&quot;.This is Neal Stephenson's most important and prolific work (keep in mind it was written in the early nineties) that (in my opinion) galvanized the Cyberpunk Genre and lent it's style to so many popular books and movies since (not to mention clothes and music).I won't go into the content of the book, or offer specific reasons I loved it so much... I will however let you know that I've read something in the range of 500 or so books and would qualify this as one of my favorites; and depending on the day, I might say it's my favorite book ever.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It changed my life!No it didn't. But it was still an incredible book. With a wonderfully funny, refreshing, and yet awfully frightening depiction of the near future, this book is hard to put down. It also has a healthy dose of Sumerian mythology (any book that doesn't should be burned), enough theology to make the Pope's head spin (which might be kinda cool, I mean with that big hat and all, if you dipped it in ink, you could make some cool spirographs) and plenty of techno-jargon for the techies out there who are lookin' to buy some jargon (and can't get any through the traditional jargon barns).And let's talk characters. I love 'em all, except that Raven guy, who's a real jerk. You care what happens to these people (except for Raven), and man, I wish I had a nuclear powered pooch like Ng does.Okay people, bottom line is this: Informative cyberpunk with a sense of humor and a little theological pondering is what you get, and you should buy it (only from Amazon, I should add, cuz Amazon's the best!)................The person who wrote the rather distasteful review below urges you to read William Gibson instead. Don't!! I have and it's the one thing I regret more than what I did yesterday.Thank you for reading this review."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The book has not aged well in 20 years. Unfortunately I read it for the first time in 2012. Had I read it when it first came out I would probably feel very differently."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The Title says it all. Lots of others have summarized the plot so I wont bother, but I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with this book.Stephenson starts the whole thing off with an awkward bang, and the first couple chapters hum along at a great pace. But the cliches are just a bit too abundant to really get into this story. Hiro is written as a character a 14 year old computer nerd would think is cool, Y.T. is an overly witty skateboarder kid, and the villain is so forgettable I cant honestly remember his name while writing this review. The only character that I found interesting is Uncle Enzo, and he shows up for about 10 pages all together.It's kind of a shame how this story doesn't live up, because the concept is pretty interesting. While I didn't hate the Sumerian research stuff like a lot of other reviewers it was fairly unnecessary padding. The MetaVerse is a pretty cool idea, but again it's painted amateurly at best. The ending was way too rushed to be enjoyable, and readers will likely have more questions than answers when it's all said and done.Snow Crash isn't terrible, it just isn't very good. If you're desperate for a new story to read, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise I would recommend skipping this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this book a number of years ago, and I've been a Stephenson fan ever since. It's got the best opening chapter in the history of the English language novel, and the rest of the book isn't bad either."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book introduces the concept that if you are exposedto the correct visual stimuli, your brain can crash -- i.e.become a vegatable, or mentally impared.This concept is plausable since we know that epelectic seizuresin children can be caused by video games.I enjoyed the characters, and the virtual worlds the book placed me in. I didn't give it a perfect 5, as I reserve thisfor works like the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but Cryptomocrongets a 5 which is another of his books."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Probably all-right if you have blue or orange hair or a lot of metal embedded in your skin.Everyone has the right to enjoy what they like. This was just not for me because of screaming language, overdone profanity, overlong descriptions and character development.But I give the guy credit for writing a book...not an easy task. He obviously has talent asa writer. I will try him out again on a different book.Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am on ebook page 293 of 1029 and I am completely bored by this book. In comparision Dune Book 2 is only about 387 pages and it was a lot of fun by the time I was on page 300.Sentenses are complicated. There are too many made up words that in the end don't mean much. Mix those together and you get a difficult to follow book. Other reviewers described this issue better than I did here.Main plot drags nowhere and I even cannot see main plot. I have now given up on the book and think it was a waste of money.I tried this book because I like \\"The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\\" by Neal Stephenson. The Diamond Age is a brilliant work and beats Snow Crash without any doubt."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is an exciting novel, with a great premise and an interesting story line. Technological descriptions are vivid and original; I especially like the futuristic wheels used by both Y.T. and Hiro P.However, this book suffers from a chronologically fragmented beginning, two plotlines which are horrendously slapped together, and a general sense of being on shaky ground throughout. Stephenson's bleak outlook on the future is not the problem here; the problem is that the plotline is so fractured and out of joint that the tale suffers greatly. I wound up being annoyed because whenever things got good with one character, the other main character would bludgeoun his/her way in and ruin the plot. It seems as if Stephenson or his editor wrote the manuscript, cut it up between random paragraphs, threw all the pieces in the air, and then reassembled with no thought for continuity or flow.I love the plot itself. References to Ancient Near Eastern religion and modern computer technology usually don't mix well, but Stephenson can and does make it work. The fragmented and fractured plotline, however, is more a distraction than a successful device. Perhaps a second or third read will improve the experience; here's hoping this is so."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am feeling somewhat confused. So many positive reviews and comments and yet, what I have managed to read so far comes nowhere close to what I was expecting.As a lover of almost all things sci-fi with a particular penchant for Cyberpunk in general, the reviews for this book gave me the impression that this would be just the kind of thing I would love. And here is where I ran into a problem, I downloaded the sample for my Kindle and settled back for what I was confident would become my next purchase.At first I was pretty sure I had managed to get the wrong book somehow. I read the reviews again, character names and themes appeared to match what was being said but what I was reading seemed horribly stilted. The writing itself lends to a kind of closed sentence structure I've not come across since I was learning to read in junior school. While the story at times shows you tantalizing glimpses of what it could have been,(With some undeniably great concepts concerning the technology used for example) for me at least, the style used was practically unreadable and entirely too jarring.Many other reviews have waxed lyrical upon it's many virtues and creative ideas but I'm afraid until disabused of my notions, I will be unwilling to experience this for myself. I'm still half convinced that what I got was a plagiarized clone of this book written by a precocious 12 year old."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this book by recommendation of a friend. This most disappointing issue with this novel is its failed potential. The first chapter really took me by surprise. Hiro Protagonist is a pizza deliveryman in the future and failing to deliver a pizza on time means more then losing your job. It was fresh, hilarious and written with a very snappy satirical edge that sadly never resurfaced as the novel went on. The interesting play use of Sumerian myth and religion created another bit of potential that was never fully realized and ultimately convoluted. The novel slides into a contrived mess by about page 150 and spirals down hill from that point on. The plot line is ridden with holes, and many key issues are not resolved. I'm not the kind of reader who demands that everything be tied up at the end of the story, but I do feel that some very blatant issues that were tossed in at the end of the novel were left hanging with no real reason for their existence and with no real resolve. The characters are just ludicrous and the pop culture perception of hackers is uninformed. Hackers are largely solitary, and an online event where half a million hackers joined at one location is ridiculous. Not to mention the event is tossed in the fray to provide a vehicle for some grand loss were going to nuke the world drama that can only be found in your typical shameless Hollywood epic. The pacing is fast and furious but at times explanations of the plot line drag on (if the scheme of your villain is so complicated you have to spend upwards of 50 pages just explaining it something is wrong), and random unnecessary scenes are tossed in for no real purpose. The whole book comes off feel like a typical cheesy campy summer blockbuster. There are better novels out there, and this one falls prey to the largest sin, starting out on a great foot, dragging you in, and then failing.Holes, cheese, over packaged. Can we say SWISS?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It was like the book version of a video game. I couldn't put it down, was late for work. More do you want... no, I don't give \\"5\\"s."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Thankfully I got the free sample for this book.This has the distinction of being the first sample I couldn't finish.Two pages of drivel was enough for me to delete it.It reads like a bad essay from a school boy.Maybe it gets better, since it could hardly get worse, but that was enough adolescent tripe for me to give up on this author."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"i haven't finished, just skipped to the part about sumer and whatnot to see how that played out, and i realize that may be the dumbest idea on the planet. if he's saying humankind spoke the same language until the sumers, is he ignoring the aztecs, native americans, etc.? is he advocating some sort of christian creation story? because if he's not, then there were already different languages before the sumerians?! am i missing something?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The beetle ate the cockroach while reading \\"100 Days of Solitude\\". He preferred \\"Catch-23\\", which, as everyone knows, is a favorite of beetles, while cockroaches prefer \\"100 Days\\" - understandable if pizza is not really your thing. Of course, Jamie didn't see it that way because, well, when flying over a house, one's mind drifts - but perhaps we all drift (even when eating pizza) to somewhere over the rainbow beyond the metaphysical boundaries of common literature...WHAM! The motorcycle skidded on the poor beetle and flipped over, causing a thermonuclear explosion and a time dilation which made Star Trek into reality (yes, Kirt was interviewed by Oprah, seriously). The cockroach survived - as cockroaches do, especially in times of nuclear war (just ask archie) - but how about that pizza? Hot, dude, real hot, even without jalapenos... Need I continue?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Whatever fun and interesting sci-fi creations are present are rendered utterly worthless by the underlying religious mumbo-jumbo PLOT devices. I loved the first hour, but the PLOT--that is the middle four-fifths of the story and the driving power of the story-- was BORING self-indulgent drivel created out of whole cloth in a free-association style that killed my enjoyment of some of the clever sci-fi devices."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"but it looks pretty darn good"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this book initially during my younger, agnostic years, and I liked it a lot. Inventive, crazy, disturbing, and definitely entertaining. Tried to re-read it recently and found it deeply offensive, now that I am a Christian. In this book the Holy Spirit is likened to a virus. I threw it in the trash, could not finish it. So, if you are an atheist and like books that trash Christianity and reinforce your world view, then this one is for you. I don't require the promotion of my world view in the books I read, but I'd rather not have it attacked. I don't understand why so many sci-fi authors do that these days, given that the super majority of Americans self identify as Christians."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"...but this has got to be the most disappointing novel I've ever wasted my time on! Okay, so I listened to the audiobook version while I was driving to and from work, and so I was kind of a captive audience anyway. But I would have been much better off spending that time listening to something like, &quot;The Blue Nowhere: A Novel,&quot; by Jeffery Deaver (which I'm currently listening to), or maybe &quot;Digital Fortress,&quot; by Dan Brown (which I've already read in book format). Although these novels may not have as much appeal to the true techno-geek/hacker types, they are much better suited to those of us who want to be engrossed in a truly riveting story while stuck in traffic.Most of the time I was confused about whether the characters were in reality or virtual reality at any given moment, and the rest of the time I was confused as to what the story was supposed to be about. Don't get me wrong - there was some great material in there, and the story might have bloomed in the hands of a truly gifted writer, but judging by this novel, Neal Stephenson is apparently not that writer. All in all, this novel was entirely forgettable."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I normaly don't write any reviews, but this time I just had to tell other readers that this book is awful.DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY IT, I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND NOT JUST 9.99 NO I WANT 1000$ AT LEAST FOR WAISTING MY **** TIME!I love science fiction and read it almost every day. How much do you have to smoke in order to come up with COZA NOSTRA PIZZA UNIVERSITY? LOL. And use it in one sentence? Why did it get published in the first place????!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you enjoy science fiction books, then knock yourself out, enjoy the book and move on with your life. I did not enjoy the book. I live a normal life and I do not find these types of books interesting. I only read it upon the recommendation of one of my friends-apparently we have different taste in literature. Other than being extremely confused with the book, I did find it helpful on those sleepless nights. If you like this kind of book, then I recommend it. If you do not like this type of book, move on in the reviews."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I agree with the majority of reviewers who say that Snow Crash is a blast. The overlooked gem here is Y. T., the teenage skate-punk herione. For once a young woman is portrayed as sharp, brazen, unaplogetic, and totally independent. She survives on her own wits and power, without much help from the white knights (and in this case, the Mafia) who set out to &quot;save&quot; her. Hiro, and the world, would have been toast without her. I loved the fact that the baddest dude in the book fell hard for her and she blew him off without any sentimental regrets. On a technical note, the Sumerian mythology and linguistic theory subplot was quite convoluted. I have a background in neuroscience and thought the brain concepts were intriguing, but unsatisfyingly underdeveloped--a lot of talk but little substance or real resolution. This is unfortunate since it meant that the whole meaning and mechanism of the Snow Crash plot remained mystifying. My favorite hacker critqued the computer technology and found many bones to pick in that arena as well. Overall, Snow Crash was a wild ride and I salute Stephenson's creativity. And yes, it would make an awesome movie for any filmmaker who really wants to show off his or her CG prowess!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book represents everything that is right about cyberpunk. In the first 50 pages, Stephenson demonstrates his talent at creating settings that absorb you, creating a cyberpunk near future that is anarchic, chaotic, and downright fun. It deliberately carries the hip, ubercool attitude of the genre to elaborate excess without being self-conscious about it, and at the same time avoids the nihilistic depression that dogs many similar works.It succeeds because Stephenson isn't even trying to prophesy. This book isn't about the 2010's, but instead is a nostalgia book about the 1980's. It takes everything mildly disconcerting about American culture in the Me decade, magnifies it to the nth degree, turns it into a virtue, and shoots it in an artillery shell three decades into the future.It's about strip malls and minivans, Ted Turner and the Godfather, Domino's Pizza, suburbia, and televangelists. Of the protagonists, Hiro Protagonist is a former computer hacker turned high-speed pizza delivery man for the Mafia, while YT is a teenage skateboard courier armed with a crossbow-mounted plunger and the last word in anti-rape defense. The book doesn't try to be realistic; it doesn't try to make deep moral statements or provide insight. It's designed from page one to be a vast sound and light show for your infinite enjoyment. And it succeeds brilliantly.For the first several chapters, there doesn't even appear to be a coherent plot, but the setting is so much fun that you won't care. When it arrives, the plot is a frightening blend of action, world conspiracy, and beyond-the-fringe neurolinguistic theory. It could have been the result of an unholy colaboration between Umberto Eco and Edgar Rice Burroughs.The novel's only shortcoming is that the style and snap, the language and wordplay fireworks that carry the opening don't carry well into the rest of the book. This novel would not have needed a plot to work -- for the last half of the book, many times it seems as if the plot advances at the expense of the book. Nonetheless, Snow Crash is all about style, and in that style, it delivers."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In a future America where everything is for rent -- the Army, the Police, the Highway system -- and the only thing that works efficiently is pizza delivery (because it's monopolized by the Mafia) Hiro Protagonist is a freelance hacker who also happens to be the only one standing between the computer-based Metaverse and a horrible new drug called Snow Crash. As if this isn't enough, he owes the Mafia the cost of replacing the pizza delivery car he wrecked, and he has to pull Y.T.'s fat out of the fire after the Skateboard Kourier delivers his last pizza for him, saving him from the punishment of the Mob.If you go down to Silicon Valley and ask anyone wearing this year's model of pocket protector, I'll bet you even money they're there because they read Snow Crash. This book saved the dying cyberpunk genre by giving it a sense of humour. Besides, though the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; comes from the writings of William Gibson, the current concept of cyberspace comes from Stephenson's vision of the Metaverse. Every geek in the Valley read this, and many of them are computer-hacking now because they want to grow up to be Hiro Protagonist."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I enjoyed Snow Crash immensely. The main character, Hiro Protagonist, has a wonderfully wry outlook. The characters and situations are just off enough to be funny, but not so much so that this doesn't work as a science fiction novel. However, be aware that the first chapter is much more humourous than the rest of the book. My only real quibble with this book is that the primary female character, Y.T., who is allegedly a 15-year old, acts *nothing* like any real girl of that age would. I don't have a problem with her athleticism as a skateboard courier, after all, most Olympic gymnasts are teenagers. But, her sexual self-possession cannot be explained away by the ownership of a device that makes rape impossible. There is something about the way she acts generally that interfered with my ability to suspend my disbelief when reading the book. And I'm not the kind of person to complain about characterization.My guess is that Stephenson was trying to write the female equivalent of the typical resourceful teenage male character that you find in these types of books, but just plain didn't know enough teenage girls to know what they are like. (Note, his later book, &quot;Diamond Age&quot; does a much better job with the female characters, while in his earlier book, &quot;Zodiac&quot; his female characters might just as well be cardboard cutouts.)Anyway, read the book!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"For several years, I'd been having friends tell me that I absolutely *MUST* read \\"Snow Crash\\", and once I finally listened to them, I understood why: I found myself reading it late into the night (each and every night), until exhausted, and upon waking I immediately rolled over, picked it up, and read for another 2-3 hours (I'm not kidding) before getting out of bed forthe day! (Luckily, the bulk of this was on a weekend... ;-) )That was maybe 8-9 years ago, and I've since found myself vehemently recommending it to friends, buying copies for them(when they aren't sure if they want to spend the $6-7 on it andI'm sure that I'm not going to let them out of the store without it), and keeping 2-3 extra copies of it around the house so I can loan them out on short notice without having my autographed copy get beaten up. (Thrift stores are good for this. I found a $0.25 copy once which has been passed on a few times.)\\"Aha!\\", I imagine you thinking to yourself, \\"A nutcase! A freak!\\" But no...it's not just me. I've checked. This book really *does* have a strange effect on many of the people who read it. (Not all, to be sure, but many.)Personally, I like to think it's because \\"Snow Crash\\" is sort of a self-referential, recursive story. Sure, it's got a Sci-Fi, futuristic plot, lots of action, and is also eerily prescient about lots of things we take for granted nowadays, such as the global Internet, 3D Avatars in virtual reality-like online chat rooms/meeting-spaces/games/etc. (I think Neal Stephenson actually coined this usage of \\"Avatar\\" [in regard to 3D online personae] as it was previously only used in Hindu mythos & the like.)He also pretty well spells out the current virus-ridden state of the online world that most Windows users are suffering through, and helps paint a picture of the security nightmare that we're currently living in, while at the same time subtly teaching some good principles of computing, security, etc. And the sprawl-like, fractured, strip-mall-society of \\"burb-claves\\" and \\"franchise ghettos\\" that he envisions isn't *quite* full-blown (yet), but you can definitely see it coming.In the story, Snow Crash is a drug...and it's a computer virus...and it's a biological virus. It's all of these, and none of them. In the real world, it's a meme. An idea that behaves like a virus, jumping from one host to the next. That's for sure.I think that's the thing that I like best about it: The disturbingly subversive fact that the story is about language, and the mind, and how language can program and RE-program the mind. As you're reading (or listening) and learning these concepts, while the story unfolds, you also realize that IT'S BEING DONE TO YOU...RIGHT THEN......and you're having so much fun that you don't care. :-)Those sections about ancient Sumerian religion, culture, and the history of language (the sections that some people bog down in and don't enjoy) seem (to me) to be the real meat of the matter. That's the main course of the meal. You're learning this long chain of history and philosophy, woven into a story about language and memetics being used to program people and changehow they think. (And after many times through it, I still don't know how much is made up and how much is really true history. It could all be fake, or it could be mostly true. I'm not sure, and that's what makes it fun...it's somewhat plausible.)We recently listened (on CD) to \\"Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded: August 27, 1883\\", by Simon Winchester, and he does a similar thing: It seemed like we went through about 3-4 CDs, learning about the history of the Spice Islands in Java/Indonesia, including its culture, biology, geography, geology, (and many other things!), then he taught us the historyof planetary geology, and gave us a detailed understanding of Plate Tectonic Theory (not just what it is, but how it came about.) Eventually, we finally had enough understanding so that he could talk about the volcanic eruption that was the focus of the story.That long prep-time was thorough, detailed, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I already knew the volcano exploded. There was no need to rush into it. And since he took his time, I ended up learning a whole lot of other cool things. (I now am beginning to appreciate the benefits of a classical education such as he had at Oxford & Cambridge. It shows in his speech and his work. I'm envious. :-) )Coming back to \\"Snow Crash\\", it's a similar thing. Neal takes you on these seemingly long loops of discourse, meandering through history, religion, philosophy, language, computers, networking, etc., and spices it up with occasional bouts of gunfire and violence to keep it interesting. :-) At the end of it, though, you can gain a larger understanding of the picture he's trying to paint; the chessboard that all of his characters are running around on.While reading the words, or hearing the sounds, there's this little voice in the back of your head saying \\"What if it's true? What if reading/hearing this weave of words can somehow infect me?...What if it can sink down into deep, subconscious levels of my mind, nestle in, and make itself comfortable?\\" [You can't easily turn off your hearing, or your sight. And if those are vectors of infection (as they are in the story), then how doyou protect yourself? Thus, the story itself, and your reading/hearing of the story, share a blurred line that makes it deliciously creepy and fun.\\"What if I get hooked?\\" The voice may ask... \\"What if I start trying to get all my friends hooked?\\" Perhaps even \\"What if I start posting reviews to Amazon.com in an effort to expose ever more people to Snow Crash?\\" (A far stretch of the imagination, I'm sure, but it *might* be possible... ;-) )Last year, I found a used copy of the unabridged audio version in a local bookstore. I snapped it up, and was the immediate envy of my other Snow Crash-reading friends. I have recently finished my 4th straight-through listening in the past 12-14 months, as well as the various chunks that I've replayed for friends while introducing them to it. (The chapter about YT's Mom working in FedLand is priceless!)The audio book is excellent for driving, and the 18-hour duration makes it *great* for road trips. (My girlfriend and I both found ourselves alert and interested, even late into the night. We were so impressed with the way it entertained us while also keeping us alert that we bought several more audio books for a longer trip this summer which we just finished. Our findings: Audio books are a hell of a lot better than commercial radio. ;-) )The audio version is also fun to just read along with. Since it's unabridged, you can follow the book text while getting the added dimension of all the character voices.And on the topic of voices, I'd like to praise Jonathan Davis for his absolutely superb job with the narration! He does so many voices that he manages to bring 30-50+ different characters to life and have them talking back and forth to one-another. As one of my friends noted, with awe: \\"He even does *sarcasm* in 10 different voices!\\" I enjoyed his narration so much, I've been looking at some of his other audio works, just to hear more of his talent.I found the audio presentation to be very digestible...much more so than the book. (That's why I've listened to it 4 times...so far...) I've found that it also helps me to recall specifics of scenes, dialog, etc. I've found that friends who've listened to it are able to recall and discuss particulars of the story, while friends who've read (but not heard) it have the same sort of enthusiasm that I started this long-winded post with, but they don't remember many of the details or scenes when I mention them. (This adds to the semi-creepy \\"Have I just been programmed?\\" aspect that I also mention above. ;-) )This was my first exposure to audio-books, and I've become hooked. I now realize why the Oral Tradition was used so successfully for thousands of years in passing down folklore and stories and tribal wisdom. It works. It works really well. Audio input seems to stick in your head better than purely written words, and it seems to cross-link and anchor itself to the memories of whatever you where doing while hearing it. (I pass various locations while driving that now seem to key certain memories of bits from the story, as does hearing certain phrases, etc.)Yep...It works its way in there, nestles in, and makes itself comfortable...Fnord.Enjoy!Patrick Salsbury----Update: June 20, 2012: I'm up to about 9.5 listens, now (the .5 is from playing bits for friends) and it's STILL AWESOME! Can't recommend the audio version enough! Try it!:-D"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am a Mesopotamian archaeologist, and one of mystudents lent me *Snow Crash*, to see what Ithought of it. I've been reading sciencefiction for almost fifty years, but myexperience of Cyberpunk is mostly restricted toWilliam Gibson, whose books I like very much.That being so, my first reaction was thatStephenson's book, and particularly his heroine,was a rip-off of *Virtual Light*, though now Igather that the publication chronology does notpermit that hypothesis. There are a lot ofinteresting and amusing bits in the book, but Ifound it confusingly plotted (well, I thoughtthe same of *Neuromancer* the first two or threetimes I read it). I was particularlyunconvinced by Stephenson's version of virtualreality; I really can't believe that a pair ofcathode-ray goggles would give the effectsdescribed. At least Gibson's simstim operateswith impulses input into your nervous systemthrough a jack in your skull -uncomfortable-sounding, and hard to keep clean,but surely more effective.The major point that I can address, though, isrelated to the reason my student lent me thebook: the Sumerian connection. Aside from thefact that the long passages of rumination andspeculation by Protagonist and his mentor areexcruciatingly boring, the whole basis of thehistorical problem addressed is purest BS.Stephenson appears to think it an extraordinarything that once some people spoke Sumerian, andthen after a while they didn't any more. Well,around where I live a lot of people used tospeak Lenape, but now they don't. Dramatichistorical phenomenon? Hardly. He seems tothink that because Sumerian is (apparently) theearliest language we have recorded in writing,therefore everyone in the world must have spokenSumerian. Sumerian was spoken by maybe a coupleof hundred thousand people in southernMesopotamia in the 4th millennium BCE, and theremust have been thousands of other languagesspoken in the world at the time. There aretraces in the earliest texts of at least oneother language whose speakers must have been incontact with the Sumerians. Sumerian remained alearned language, like Latin until very recentlyin European culture, but had probably beenreplaced as a vernacular by Akkadian as early as2000 BCE; Akkadian in its turn had been replacedin Mesopotamia by Aramaic by 400 BCE or so - oneof the most normal processes in the world. Sothe entire intellectual premise of Stephenson'sbook is based on ignorance and an extaordinarilynaive concept of history.DickEllis"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I can never stop reading a book half way. With the books I have had trouble getting through I usually buy the audio book. This is one of those books. It is a great concept, awesome in fact, but the story just drags on and on. I couldn't get into it. It took me about a month to get through it. Unlike the hunger games trilogy which I read all three in about a month."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read and enjoyed Cryptonomicon, so I figured I'd give another of Stephenson's books a shot.This just didn't really stand up. The events in the book really felt like they were the dream of some adolescent teenager, with a random pizza-guy-hacker-swordmaster running around doing stuff. Stephenson did a bit too much telling, not showing, with how the events unfold in the book (the main character - Hiro Protagonist - spends pages describing exactly what just happened to someone, rather than making the events clear through the actual story).The books saving grace is it's very-early realization of a virtual reality world. Stephenson got a lot right, even before such a thing was really more than a pipe dream. However, now that we're starting to see similar stuff, it loses a lot of it's luster. It also was pretty quickly paced."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My rating is based on a comparison with William Gibson's books. This is the first non-Gibson cyberpunk that I've read, and I was reasonably entertained by it. Actually, I liked it a lot, until the end, which seemed a little disappointing. It could have used an extra chapter or two to conclude the story. I've read reviews that mention this as a shortcoming of other Stephenson books. But then again, there's a sequel on the way for Cryptonomicon, so its okay to end that book prematurely.The technical details that Stephenson goes into are pretty much accurate, except for a few things here and there. I still have major problems with certain tactical aspects of the fighting in the book, but that's just me. Looking beyond that to the historical/philisophical content- there is certainly some interesting data that Stephenson has pieced together for his story. I do like the subtle comparison of religion and virii (and drugs?), but Stephenson actually merges them together in a way that could maybe be seen as not sacrilegious...blah blah blah, I give it 4 stars. I was gonna give it 3 stars because I just finished it and I thought the ending stunk, but it does probably deserve 4."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"Snow Crash\\" is the sort of book that lingers in one's memory. It creates a world that is believable not because of plausible physics, but because of its candor and nonchalance. Although many of the ideas are firmly rooted in a 1980's mentality, the seemingly effortless descriptions of RadiKS, Uncle Enzo and L. Bob Rife's Sumerian obsessions captivate attention in a way few older sci-fi books have.Unfortuantely, these wonderful realities seem to overwhelm the need for character development or a really convincing plot at times. However, this does not significantly alter the pleasure of reading the book. \\"Snow Crash\\" is definitely a book for the typical Generation X male. Its various relationships to modern icons such as fast food franchises, kung-fu movies, video games, the mafia, and conspiracy theories all play to the contemporary schizophrenic 30-something white guy. Overall, it's like a roller coaster: it's really exciting at first, a little disappointing in the end, but you can't wait to get back in line for another go."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is on every \\"best of\\" list of science fiction, and now I know why. I was hooked from the first paragraph, which describes the main character, the Deliverator, as a ninja-type warrior wearing a black \\"arachno-fiber\\" uniform that repels bullets \\"but excess persperation wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.\\" People rely on the Deliverator, he is a role model who uses samurai swords instead of guns because punks aren't afraid of guns but \\"swords need no demonstration.\\" What is it that all of this technology and Schwartzeneggerian bravado is dedicated to delivering? Pizzas in 30 minutes or less for CosaNostra Pizza. This vignette at the very start of the book is so smart, so funny, so crazy, so close-to-real-life-as-we-know-it-but-just-tweaked-a-tiny-bit, and so fantastically well-written that I had to read it several times just for the pure joy of it. And the rest of the book only gets better. If you are any kind of a science fiction fan and haven't read this, or if you are a person who loves amazing writing and can appreciate something a little off the well-worn path of the Oprah Book Club (okay, a LOT off that path) then you need to read Snow Crash. This novel defines tour-de-force, so many ideas, so many great characters, such a well-detailed world, it is hard to believe it all came from the mind of one man. Definitely on my personal list of the best science fiction novels."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What can you say? Stephenson is the best author I have come across ever, well, almost ever. Ok, there are some other great ones, ok. But anything this man writes, I need to read,and SnowCrash is one of the best. I bought the autographed numbered copy for my son, who is also a great fan, and he was overwhelmed. Well, whelmed, anyway. Love Neal Stephenson!!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is a replacement for my _extremely_ well worn softcover copy of this book that I've had for years and years. The signed/boxed edition is very nicely done and I'm very happy with it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is one of the best pieces of modern fiction I've ever read, and I can't recommend it highly enough.Great science fiction always succeeds when it says something about our own society and makes us view our world in a new way, and despite the fact that this book is about 15 years old, it remains as relevant as it's ever been (which can't be said for all pieces of modern sci-fi). Several of the events definitely provoke a \\"What if that really happened?\\" response, and perhaps the most provocative aspect of such plot points is that some are more possible now than they were when the book was written.The characters are all incredibly well developed, each with his/her own agenda and voice, and the plot is tightly constructed, with nary a wasted passage. Even the sections that read like amusing tangents end up having a purpose in advancing the story.And as for plot -- it's great. In some ways it had me thinking that it was a bit of a stretch, but the explanations are made as thoroughly as possible to allow a suitable level of suspension of disbelief.Seriously -- just read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book reads like an action-film on steriods. Its a wild ride, and clearly ahead of its time, being written in 1991. There are great characters, and it handles technology reasonably responsibly with some interesting sub-rasa political commentary thrown in for good measure. Its pretty violent, and typical for Stephenson, the book includes 1 short sex scene. (The age of one of the participants made be a bit uncomfortable, but I am repressed, so it could be just me.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am not a usual sci-fi genre fan, but I picked this up after hearing it mentioned a number of times on sites like Slashdot. It was a good read, very fast paced and very entertaining. The future he describes is also interesting to think about, it's one where governments have been disbanded in favor of corporations. I wish the author had talked more about the socioeconomic landscape in his book, but it was still interesting nevertheless.Since this book was written in the late 80s, some of the ideas about technology seem a bit dated.My one qualm with this book was the ending. There was a lot of build-up and tension, all to be resolved in a somewhat cheesy manner in perhaps 5% of the entire book's content (like the last 20 pages). Plus, the ending was too much of a happy-go-lucky ending: all the bad guys die, all the good guys live and walk off into the sunset. It was just kind of a let down to have these big, bad characters killed off so quickly after having spent the previous 430 pages extolling just how tough, crazy, and maniacal they were..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is truly one of the best books I've ever read. Neal Stephenson's talent is right up there with JRR Tolkien's (and that's saying a lot. Rarely do I make such a comparison). Stephenson has a hard hitting, pull-no-punches style that is immediately gripping while being simultaneously humorous. He makes some of the most fascinating analogies throughout the story. The story is an ancient theme of societal sabotage and secrecy, set in a futuristic (non-post apocalyptic) America, in which the president himself is negligable in his power. The small troupe of heros and heroines are faced with subverting the mainstream political paradigm. It's fascinating how they go about uncovering a terrible plot, and brilliant how they overcome it. This book is just an excellent, excellent read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson is Cyberspace masterpiece.

This book is a must-read for anyone who appreciate well reseached writing. It connects modern computer engineering with ancient mythology and history, and brings together characters of such diverse standing that it all seems nearly impossible. This book could be considered a modern epic. It seems like a high acolade, but it contains some very interesting insights into our own current cultures as well as a highly relevant &quot;what-if&quot; look into the near future. The use on language, names, plot and characterization is bleded into a truly amazing story. I would love to see the author attempt the original visual format of this work, all the advances in technology may now make it easier than the period of 88-91 in which it was written."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Well, to begin with, I think people with little knowledge of computers, the internet, and movies like &quot;The Matrix&quot; should probably try reading another book. This book is full of action and images of an unholy world filled with mafia owned pizza companies, rent-a-storage hotel rooms, and Samurai super Hackers who seem to control the world. This might not seem like the perfect world, so many escape into what is called &quot;The Metaverse&quot;; which is basically a 3D representation of the internet, where users use &quot;Avatars&quot; (characters) to roam the metaverse boardwalk. While in the real world however, everything seems to be controlled by either the mafia, the government, sub-governments, and hackers. This may not seem like a good balance of control to the real world, but in many ways, things seem to run very smoothly. The suburbs are a very calm place in this world, however, the big city is a very hard to place to make it, so many are forced to succumb to poverty. Once you enter the city, your liable for anything, including riots, Taxi driver shootings, robotic cheetah attacks, and rampaged super-humans with chips in their heads connected to Atom bombs. Overall, this has been one of the greatest books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of Science-fiction novels, including my favorite- Ender's Game. Finally, if you seem interested in the above, and you're intrigued by what the future could be like, then Neal Stephenson's \\"Snow Crash\\" is the book for you. Geeze I sound like I'm on Reading Rainbow... \\"Denne Den\\""},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Loved the book. It had twists I never saw coming, and I'd never have predicted how it would end. Ending was a little abrupt though."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"When I was younger I used to read a lot of SF. Then I started developing a literary taste and found that a well written SF book is about as rare as finding a beautiful highly intelligent woman. So far I've read 2 of his books and both of them, although not classic literature, are both well written and have interesting concepts."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I first read this novel shortly after it was first published. This was prior to Amazon and ebooks. Back when you went to book stores and scanned spines of books looking for something worth more than the cost of the paper needed to convey the story to you. (I wonder how many more years before someone reading this reviews reacts: book stores????)In some ways this book is another take on \\"be careful what you create you flawed human race you\\". But what really made this book come alive for me was the rich universe that had been all too plausibly constructed.Sure there is plenty of obviously over the top material crusted over the proposed reality but I feel the author wanted to make the book commercially appealing e.g. he wanted something marketable, not a manifesto.In a future world where governments have become just another form of corporation and compete with other corporations for hearts, minds and dollars I find the message from the author that there is still hope for individuals to make a difference a wonderful inspiration of Stan Lee proportions.As I look back on seven years of Bush pushing us towards the future envisioned in this book I get fresh goose flesh upon a re-read. We are still very much at risk of allowing the creation of the future envisioned so many years ago in this novel.Personally I rank this book right up there with 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. And yes, when a pizza arrives at my door in less than 30 minutes I know there is still hope for our culture's survival..."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The main premise of a science fiction book should be plausible, I think. That seems to be pretty much a requirement, right? And if your premise isn't very likely or stands on shaky ground, you'd expect the book wouldn't do well. You certainly wouldn't expect that it would end up considered a classic in its genre. But that's what we have here, folks. Unless I missed the whole point (possible) and this was just a big tongue-in-cheek graphic novelish sort of romp. If so then, okay, cool. Would've made a fun animated flick, as it was apparently originally supposed to be, according to the author's afterword in my copy (from the SFBC). But as a serious sci-fi book, it's got some serious problems. Apparently Stephenson styles himself as a Hacker, and proudly wears his programming pedigree on his sleeve. I've worked as a systems analyst for twenty years, and found the whole Snow Crash virus idea silly in the extreme. The idea is this: working on programs in a third-generation language such as COBOL or C (i.e., an English-like code that must be translated by a compiler into 0's and 1's for the computer's consumption), a programmer's mind becomes altered somehow--becomes amenable to computer viruses. This is just silly. I mean, even if I worked all day coding in actual machine language, down there in the guts with the bits and bytes, it wouldn't alter my brain in some physical way. But that's just the sort of hooey we're expected to swallow here.Hmm. And then we're also expected to believe that a skateboard with \\"smart wheels\\" will allow a fifteen-year-old to skate safely in traffic, on the Ventura Highway, no less, without ending up as a hood ornament.I'm beginning to think this book was not meant to be taken seriously after all. Seems to be just another geek fantasy, which is sort of ironic, given that one of the characters, Hiro, is a loser in real life and a \\"hero\\" in the virtual one. Art imitates life?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow crash is a great neal stephenson book. The book lays out an amazing cyber punk world. Neal covers a great range, frequent laughter, occasional Tear drops. Definetly a story you wish would never end. A must read by any measure."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is a highly stylized super powered brain child of 1984. Snow Crash excels in other areas where 1984 lacked merely do to its date of brith. If you like saumrias and legends and hate governments big biz this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of those books that will make you want to read other Neil Stephenson pieces. That is what has happened to me. It contains very competent writing and very memorable images."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hiro Protagonist is a swordsman, hacker, and pizza delivery person. But when one of his friends and fellow hackers is attacked by a computer virus that latches onto his mind and sends him into a catatonic trance, Hiro knows he's discovered something important--something that just might be the most important thing ever. With occasional help from Y. T., teenage scateboard courier, and with an occasional alliance with the Mafia and a new version of Hong Kong, Hiro must face an ancient threat that goes back to the time of Sumeria.Author Neal Stephenson writes a prophetic warning of a near-future earth where states have largely faded away, being replaced by corporate franchises. Freelance computer hackers have been largely replaced by corporate software teams, and many people spend their lives in three-dimensional virtual reality.The power of SNOW CRASH comes from Stephenson's strong combination of action, connvincing analysis of technology and social directions, and a fascinating look at the history of religion and the past. What if, Stephenson asks, the Biblical story of the tower of Babel were literally true? What if a true language underlies the ordinary languages of humanity--a language that is hardwired to our thought processes and that, if accessed, could control thought?Although some of the forecasts in SNOW CRASH now appear outdated, I am impressed both by how well Stephenson forecast technological progress and how he created a convincing social and political world. SNOW CRASH is a must-read for the serious SF fan."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Although I would have to agree that sometimes things could've been better, I loved this book. A LOT! I actually enjoyed the sense of chronological disconnection between the characters. I absolutely fell in love with the universe that Stephenson created. Yes, I know that he's not shaking things up the way gibson or stirling have, but there were people before them doing similar things. Any great works can be seen as not all that original as we think they are, but bla bla bla THIS is a GREAT book. It's his personal twists that get you. No it's not a radical departure from other cyberpunk, but it is still an intriguing, delightful and entertaining vision of the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Along with William Gibson, who is sort of the &quot;father&quot; of cyberpunk, and Asimov and Clarke, the &quot;fathers&quot; of science fiction/high-tech, comes Neal Stephenson with one of his many works that will easily add it to his other works, such as &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, as well as works by William Gibson such as &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Virtual Light&quot;, and so on right up to newer authors of cyberpunk and high-tech in titles such as &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; and &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;. Each of these titles are great in their own right and a true science fiction collector should get them all."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson literally jumped onto the literary landscape with this hilarious, fast-paced dystopian view of suburban Los Angeles. You know that it's a comedy when the hero's name is Hiro Protagonist. Stephenson's dense prose yields a vast smorgasbord of witty comments about pizza, the Mafia, Japanese businesses, Sumerian cuneiform writing, to name but a few. Although Gibson's award winning prose resonates with an eloquent streetwise tone, most notably in \\"Neuromancer\\" and \\"Count Zero\\", Stephenson's is almost as lyrical in \\"Snow Crash\\". Along with \\"The Diamond Age\\", \\"Snow Crash\\" has to be regarded as Stephenson's best work to date. Indeed, it is also regarded as among the finest examples of cyberpunk fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was first recomended to me by a friend. After the first few pages I was hooked. This book is so original, interesting. thought provoking and fun to read that if you have not read it you are deprived. The characters are individual. The plot is engaging. The gadgets are cool. Cyber Punk is taken to a new level and you will want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I won't repeat the glowing descriptions of other reviewers. I do think this is an amazing book, and it has worked its way onto my personal classics shelf alongside Fool on the Hill by Matt Ruff, and Good Omens by Neil Gaimon and Terry Pratchett, to name only two. The one thing I would like to say is that Snow Crash has reached outside the cyberpunk circle to include a much larger group of readers. I am a student of mythology, and I have reccomended this book to a number of fellow students and even a professor as an excellent discussion of the modern meanings of myth and language theory. It's a mind-bender, and I think everyone should give it a try!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is an incredible journey into the future of the Internet and corporate America. Join Hiro Protaganist on his quest to make the 'Net safe for hackers everywhere! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is at once realistic, sarcastic, and strangely humorous. Snow Crash is my favorite of his books and allows much of his wit to shine through. Set in a nearer future than Diamond Age, Snow Crash is primarily about the use of virtual reality. It is a fascinating, intricate book, and is slightly more focused than Diamond Age. This book might be the easiest introduction to Stephenson's work as it is less complicated than either Cryptonomicon or Diamond Age and a quicker read than Zodiac. The ending, as is often true of Stephenson, is a little abrupt and not altogether coherent, but as is also usually true with his work, this does not detract too much from the overall experience. A must read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson loves details, and this book is full of 'em. Every single thing in this book, from the pizza deliveries to the metaverse to the orign of a deadly virus, everything in this book is detailed to perfection. Stephenson's description of his post-modern world is truly quite amazing.The characters are also quite great, but perhaps not as detailed as the environments themselves. The relationship between Hiro Protagonist (the coolest character name ever, btw) and Y.T. is never really explained, and you sometimes wonder why they even help each other out. Their whole relationship seems to be not based on of loyalty or much less friendship, but one of being there at the same time. They're never aware what the other one is up to until they run into each other. But it actually makes for a few laughs and unpredictability.You can't go wrong with Snow Crash. It's an easy read, entertaining and even informative. You'll be wanting to read it again right after you finish it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"_Snow_Crash_ is definitely deserving of a purchase.While the book is hardly the best work of its author, and while there have certainly been better cyberpunk novels, this one stands out for its sheer humor.While most cyberpunk novels are darker than dark and are devoid of spirited characters, Stephenson proves that one can be comical and still stay true to the genre. Things as diverse as linguistics, Sumerian mythology, and pizza delivery are linked together (much to some readers' distress) to form a tapestry that stands alone in cyberpunk.Albeit, this novel is not a light read, it is certainly easier fare than Stephenson's best novel to date _Cryptonomicon_. If you want to give Stephenson's work a try or are just looking for something entertaining, this is your book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"On one level this book deserved 5 stars. The whole concept and vivid description of the Metaverse was great. The interlinked plot about the Sumerian language, the tower of Babel, and the Post Modern virus &quot;Snow Crash&quot; was powerful, mind-stimulating stuff. Its just a pity the author didn't focus on the virus more, and got caught up instead in the continual diversions of &quot;special effects&quot; such as the endless skateboarding antics of a 15 year old."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In the time since I read this, I have since read Gibson's Neuromancer and find it better in that he thought of it first. That said, Snow Crash was infinitely easier to read and understand, and it has had the advantage of having Neuronmancer to spawn ideas from. It is an exciting book and goes by very quickly, enjoyable - but as just about all other reviewers have said, the ending leaves most wanting."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This goes beyond creative imagination, but takes the mind into a type of universe you would expect out of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazines. There is a lot of humor and seriousness. The history behind the Sumerian part of this book rates top notch and the computer information is superb!When you can successfully mix a martial artist in the virtual world that totes pizzas for a living and make the whole thing work, it is a sign of pure madness or genius! If there is any book you must read this year, IT IS THIS BOOK! I highly recommend it for those who love history, computer technology, cyber punk, or any science fiction! This book has almost anything you can imagine and then some. Jam packed full of all the action you could possible expect, and all the warped humor and excitement that you need.This book I could not put down until I was finished with it.

While Neal takes you off into biblical history around the middle of the book, it's not so much as to turn off the atheist.

He ties historical legend into the present /near-future with a very unusual twist. I couldn't put it down"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Would consider it NOT BAD cyberpunk. Goes down a few roads traveled 2 often in the genre. Just like in the real world. Interfaces change, applications grow, but its still just the internet gone hyper-global.However, the first chapter describing the pizza delivery is by far one of the best openers in a novel I have ever read.

But most importantly this books is incredibly entertaining and a fixture in anyone'slibrary interested in gaining an understanding of technology and human development!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you haven't read Snow Crash, go and read it. It has the most credible and vivid representation of a 3D virtual world system seen in fiction (much more so than William Gibson's works, either the far-out surrealism of his early cyberpunk books or the more down-to-Earth style of Virtual Light and Idoru, which seems to attempt to follow the lead of Snow Crash in more ways than one. The difference is that the hacker Stephenson has more first-hand knowledge of the technology and its surrounding culture than the almost ludditic Gibson).Stephenson presents us witha panoramic view of a very-near-future world and its bizarre cults and cultures, presented with Pynchonesque piquancy, and some interesting twists, building on Jaynes' &quot;bicameral mind&quot; theory of the origin of consciousness but going some way beyond it; as Burroughs said, the word is a virus."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book is beloved of Internet programmers, VRML visionaries, and just about everyone who is wired.

The cyberspace events entwine with Sumerian archeology (this latter in a manner reminscent of Julian Jaynes &quot;The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicamerial Minds&quot; [1976]) and are enacted by comic book characterizations which I found difficult to relate to. However the ideas have a creative bent, which, inspite of their violence, could be entertaining to some"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson takes his anger at society and extrapolates every sinsiter trend today into a hilarious, gripping future where The United States of America competes for space with Pizza Hut.A ROTFL but fast-paced, glitzy world where corporate law is the only is the only law is the setting allowing for a slick post-anti-cyberpunksomething-type story. The idea is a drug called Snow Crash is being past around cyberspace that &quot;snows&quot;(reduces display to fuzzy static) user's computers and &quot;snows&quot; hackers' minds.The logic for that is actual fact: as someone becomes skilled in an area, their neurons rearrange into patterns to make easier the task. Whether it is finger dexterity for piano players or the ability to read binary for programmers, the brain gradually gets wired to it. And Snow Crash, supposedly, shows hackers a field of specially orchastrated snow designed to shatter through their delciately-wired-to-hacking minds, leaving them insane.The story takes that cool idea even further, creating a villain seeking to destroy the ability to read computers and destroying computers ability to communicate: Infocalypse. Stephenson supposes even further that another catastophic event like this occurred in the past, the origin of the fact that human languages tend to diverge, no come together. Weaving Sumerian myth and glossalia and cyberspace altogehter in one mind-bending meta-theory, it staggers the reader. Anybodyt who reads this book will &quot;Wander slack-jawed for days, and emerge with a profoundly redifned sense of reality&quot;-Bruce Sterling.All of this is set to cool characters who you really grow to care about, and some quotes sure to become classic: &quot;Need a loan? Money tight? Call the Mafia! Now you have a friend in The Family!&quot; Hiro Protagonist, Y.T., Raven, and Uncle Enzo, all products of Snow Crash's completely corporatized world, will linger in memory for ever. This book will stick in your brain like glue"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I'm not a &quot;reader&quot;. I read all of Tolkien and Douglas Adams andthat's about it, but Snow Crash had me in its grasp from the momentI read the first paragraph. After about a year of prodding byseveral of my friends I finally picked it up a year ago Halloweenand barely managed to stretch it out past voting day (~one week).I think that other reviewer here must have read it backwards! This bookstarts out in high gear and only runs down enough by the end to letyou not feel TOO bad that it's over. Still, I wish this were aserial publication. ...are you listening Neal!?!? Only now I'm afraidto read anything else for fear of being let down. ;-)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The moment I started reading this book I couldn't stop. It offers not only insight into today's society and psychology, but shows what could really be the future of America. This is also one of the first books I have read that accurrately depicts hackers. It's fast paced fun with some interesting intellectual discussions"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"\\"Snow Crash\\" is a very good book especially considering it was written in 1992/3 -- a nice bit of forward looking of how society and computing evolves. The mixture of the genres is done very well with some very good and interesting character development.If you enjoy cyberpunk or cross-genre stories, then you must read 'Snow Crash'. You will not be sorry.Main ideas in the novel:1) virology -- biological and computer viruses share several interesting things2) languaage evolution -- intersting how written languages evolved from cuniform and how spoken languages change3) corporations will control the world and governments steady change into one world order4) A prediction of what virtual will be like -- a very good prediction of what has become Second Life.5) Direct information absoption into the brain via the optic nerveWorld Setting:The world setting is very well done and introduced in a \\"in your face\\" way that quickly draws you in the same way \\"Clockwork Orange\\" does. The lack of government control and the rise of corporations is well done. I particularly enjoyed having the Mafia being a sympathetic corporation due their strict moral code and strict adherence superior customer service at all costs.Characters:Hiro Protagonist -- great name for a cyberpunk/hacker. The name fits the character very well. I loved the part where Hiro is the greatest swordsman in the (in the cyberspace as he wrote the sword fighting subroutines) and actually good in real life as well. It makes a nice linkage between real life and cyber life.\\"Raven\\" -- a crazed Aleute / Russian assassin specializing in traditional Aleute weapons and hunting skills. The linkage between \\"Raven\\" and Hiro is very interesting, well done and provide a good plot arc."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson pulls you into a world that seems at the same time ridiculous, and familiar. Snow Crash starts in a new America which has fallen into privately owned city states, each with their own laws, security forces, and regulations. Parallel to this America lies the \\"Metaverse\\"; an internet where one lives a second life and anything is possible. The story seems rather shallow and campy through the first few chapters, but with every page you turn Snow Crash unwraps a deep, complex idea that will completely engross you.Stephenson's novel will take you on a wild ride of technology, linguistics, love... and drugs, violence and corruption. The style is very fluid, and though he often jumps from character to character and changing perspectives, Stepehenson captures you until you flip the last page. This book is a blast, I highly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for science-fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This novel may not fit exactly into any specific sub-genre of science fiction. It is a very good book though, but don't pick it up expecting it to be a copy of Gibson's or Sterling's novels. It isn't. It does borrow some of the themes of cyberpunk, but it is also filled with original ideas. If you like Gibson and Sterling then you will probably very much enjoy this novel as well.Also, this novel contains the best pizza delivery sequence ever written.Buy it, read it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has a knack for making this 50+ year old reader feel like he just had a heck of a run down the longest ski slope in Colorado. It is not often that I feel so \\"with it\\" as I do after being able to keep up with the rapid flow of verse, eye popping word candy and just out and out futuristic fun from another novel by Stephenson. The first time I read anything by Stephenson, it was Cryptonomicon, a 1200 page book that went by in a very short time without any boredom at all. So I dug up the scoop on his books and found another well liked book was Snow Crash. When you read a Neal Stephenson novel, the take-off begins on the opening page and then it's full steam ahead for the rest of the book. Oh, sure, in Stephenson fashion, he meanders a bit into tangential imagery and off topics looks at the weird and wild, but it's all done in nanoseconds.Snow Crash has been explained ad infinitum for 500+ reviews, so I will not bore you with the details, but roughly, this book takes place in the future. All that is left of the official United States of America is a group of Federal Buildings on a campus somewhere near L.A. The land mass known as the lower 48 in today's lingo is now a variety of little burbclaves, each with a ruling president of sorts but not like a political country, but a company/city-state mixed with business and politics. For example, there are franchise companies/countries such as Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong, Reverend Wayne and the Pearly Gates, the Nipponese Quadrant and Uncle Enzo's Mafia among others. Crime can be driven out by a menacing robotic/biomass dog-like creature that can move at almost the speed of somewhere-between-sound-and-light. The Police forces have become large for profit as the MetaCops and Enforcers take different tacks to keep the peace.Pizza delivery is the opening segment and it is \\"a riot, Alice, a real riot\\" to quote Jackie Gleason. The names of the main characters should give away some of the thought process of Stephenson as Hiro Protagonist tries to keep his partner Y.T. (no, not Whitey) from getting killed. Although as a one of the best Kouriers in the New World, she can take care of herself pretty well.Reality and the online world of the Metaverse have become meshed and where one starts the other leaves off has become a gray area. Much of the analysis of what is happening was out of my reach for a long while in the book. Then with a deft piece of writing, Stephenson brings all of the pieces together with quite an interesting proposition on about page 400. His genius is illustrated with this fascinating look at language skills, human comprehension and viral infection. I know, it sounds whacky; and it is, but no less fascinating.The best explanation I can come up with is this is like reading a book by H.G. Wells while he was on speed with side orders of Stephen King and Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The Da Vinci Codechase scenes blended with Hiaasen dialogue and Philip Dick science fiction concepts make this a great novel by a young writer.Based upon the premise that human linguistics, affected by religion, work on a binary concept akin to computer programming, the book leads the reader through insightful discussion of religion, psychology and engineering - all at a very simple level so as to allow all readers the ability to understand otherwise very difficult topics.Snow crash is basically a virus which computer users - hackers - experience whether in the Metaverse (computer-generated play field like today's \\"World of Warcraft\\" etc.) where the virus does more than melt down the computer: it also melts down the hacker's mind. \\"He knows one thing. The Metaverse has now become a dangerous place where you can get killed. Or at least have your brain reamed out to the point where you might as well be dead.\\"But, it is more than a metavirus. And, the lead hacker, Hiro, must ask: \\". . . is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?\\" Probably two of the three is the best answer.When the human mind responds to the virus by burning out or becoming comatose, Hiro concludes, \\"It's a software, not a hardware, problem.\\"Ultimately, we get the whole story told to us in Chapter 56 as Hiro tells it to his superiors. It is all orchestrated by a powerful and crazed religious leader. And, like a crazed psychotic evil character out of aJames Bondmovie, the evil L. Bob Rife seeks to take over the world by using the linguistic binary-coded computer-generated virus and manipulate America which is \\". . . illiterate or aliterate and relies on TV - which is sort of an oral tradition . . \\" This televised manipulation will be an easy methodology to conscript followers by the television evangelist - sending subconscious messages to control the masses and rule the world. And, all in the name of God.Entertainment abounds as the bad guy's killer is a mixture of Odd Job,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest's \\"Big Indian\\" and Janet Evanovich's \\"Ranger.\\" This is a page turner - which was something unique for me as I am not usually open to reading science fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"So, Neal?Are you getting it yet? After all this time, people are selling an $80.00 collector's edition of your book. There are like, a dozen editions, re-issues, and reprints of this book.

I promise you, everything like this you write, I'll read, OK?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I can easily agree with the many reviewers here, \\"excellent ideas,\\" \\"brilliant opening,\\" \\"later parts overblown,\\" etc., but really it's almost irrelevant now. The book has sprinted past reasonable criticism and become a standard that other books are measured against. This is cyberpunk to many readers. In the same way that calling Tolkien \\"boring in places\\" is meaningless now, so too is calling Stephenson's characters \\"one dimensional parodies.\\"If you haven't read Snow Crash yet, go grab a copy and follow it up with the source material in The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Folks on the train will be much impressed with you."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"If you liked The Diamond Age you will like Snow Crash. The description of the pizza delivery tools and process is intoxicating.Neal Stephenson does a great job of creating gritty and fantastic environments and then placing a great story in the middle of it. If you like cyberpunk, sci-fi or fantasy, you will enjoy this book. If you like Philip K. Dick, William Gibson or Bruce Stirling, you will like this book. Stephenson's writing is less choppy than Gibson's, but still makes you feel like the pace is fast and furious."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson is one of the 3 best cyberpunk authors, one of the 10 best SF authors, and certainly one of the 100 best authors alive (how's that for random?) This may not be his best book, but is the most fun, and not to be missed. If you are new to Stephenson, promise yourself to give it 50 pages. If you do, you'll read everything he has written. Do it in this order: Snow Crash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon. After that, you're on your own, because you are truly hooked."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"As an employee of Linden Lab (the company behind the popular virtual world, Second Life), I found this book prophetic. It's amazing to think many years ago Stephenson was writing the blueprint for what would exist in metaverses, like Second Life, but he did, and he nailed it. His vision overall of online 3-D communities, even down to the details, is poignant, well-thought-out, and inspiring.As an author myself and reader, I found the book still very engaging, but - at times - meandering and arrhythmic. However, much of this unique style, blended with Stephenson's dystopian descriptions of the future, gives Snow Crash an engaging pallor that is hard to turn away from.This book obviously has a core cyberpunk readership, but I would encourage anyone to read this who is interested in the emergence of 3-D virtual worlds and the effect they may have on the future of reality."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A cyberpunk novel for sure, I felt that it was much more toned down than say William Gibson's &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, still, I'm sure that it will probably always be compared to that novel.I haven't read any Neal Stephenson before, this is my first try.That surprised some of my friends, who said, &quot;I'm amazed you haven't read it, eveyone who likes sci-fi and computers should read this book.&quot; - I've read it and I agree.There is plenty of interesting virtual world description and new tech to entertain any technical readers. None of it comes across as dumb or out of date or foolish etc... It all seems like a reasonable extrapulation of current trends.On top of that, there is so much cool, samurai sword, gun battles, car chases etc... scenes to entertain everyone else. Hiro and Raven are two of the most kick ass characters you'll ever meet in what seems like a pretty realistic world - that's hard to pull off.I sepecially liked the historic background, which has the scent of a well done bibilical/babalonian research paper. I'm sure that Mr. Stephenson has read lots about the history of the bible and it's links to babalonian culture and myths. Much of this book's story depends on theories about those historic areas.Still, I think everyone will remember this book for its tech background, the computer simulations and the metaverse. Oh yeah... that and the samurai swords 'cause really, who doesn't like samurai swords?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am reminded of a line from &quot;The Matrix&quot; which has spiraled and ricocheted through our culture for quite some time now, but it seems to be the quintessential description of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;You cannot be told how good Snow Crash is. You have to see it for yourself :-P"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is the first book that I have ever read by Neal Stephenson, needless to say I will be reading more. In fact I have already bought Cryptonomicon. I haven't got the time to commit to it yet being 1000 pages.On to the book. My friend started out telling me about the book. From there, I just really had to read it for myself. Some of the things he told me about were so outrageous. For one, Hiro, the main character, was a pizza delivery boy for a Mafia owned pizza chain by day and by night he was a hacker and also a master sword fighter! This combination was so weird so I had to find out for myself.The one thing that I thought was really cool in this book was the meeting place where everyone hung out (virtually) called The Street. This was sort of like a futuristic Internet. You could own property, put up buildings and &quot;see&quot; other people (more like images / likenesses) of friends / enemies on there. Pretty much everything you could do in real life, you could do on the street.Stephenson has such a vivid imagination and lets everyone get a glimpse of it in this novel. When I would put the book down to get a drink, etc, I couldn't help but think to myself, &quot;How does someone even come up with stuff like this?&quot;Overall the story flowed gracefully and kept me interested. Ok, I couldn't put the book down. I would get to the end of a chapter and say to myself, &quot;Well, I will read just one more.&quot; Before I knew it I was done with it. :("},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I am not a cyberpunk fan. I read Neuromancer, Idoru, etc., and felt lukewarm about all of them. Snow Crash changed my view of cyberpunk fiction. When it's done right (as here) it's fantastic!There are very few books that keep me turning pages through the night. This is one of them. This is one of those books that will make you go, \\"Holy [Cow]!\\" at the end. If a book makes me do that, it's worth recommending. Absolutely, buy this book!"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"OK, the genre is passe. (yeah right) Fact is that some of the most exciting writers in the past 10 or 20 years have cut their teeth on it.Speed and pacing to rival Gibson and a wicked sense of humor, this book is a tour de force of the absurd logical conclusion!Like Gibson and Sterling? Gotta read this one."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson's work is hard to describe, because it embraces so many subjects! This one has a Japanese/American Samurai Warrior/ Computer Hacker for a hero... Hiro: Hiro Protagonist. There's a (computer) virus being spread by this 7 foot deviant Eskimo genius wielding an incredibly sharp blade made of all natural ingredients. This virus is able to cross the information/biological barrier, to &quot;wipe clean&quot; a person's mental slate, leaving their mind's eye as empty and chaotic as the &quot;snow&quot; you can see on TV, after the station signs off. Very dangerous. I loved it. His &quot;Diamond Age&quot; follow up is great too.Different."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"&quot;Snow Crash&quot; is often cited as science fiction's answer to &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; Like that movie, its creator is far more interested in providing speedy impressions than having a consistent through-line. In this case, however, Stephenson has actually created interesting characters, from Samurai-cum-hacker/mafia pizza delivery boy Hiro Protagonist and his sometimes-faithful sidekick Y.T. to super-badass Raven, battling it out in a bizarre pseudo-post-apocalyptic Earth.If Stephenson's ramblings take a turn for the bizarre (What WAS the point of all the Sumerian mythological stuff, other than to show his obscure interests?), or his science gets occasionally inconsistent or laughable (A black-and-white computer image bitmap which scrambles hacker's minds because their neurological backgrounds establish binary pathways in their brains? Puh-LEEZE! And exactly how do people interact with their computers to utilize the Metaverse? do they enter commands at a keyboard, or what?), at least the ride is exhilarating, and the plot pacing highly enjoyable. Hang on, and have fun."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson's &quot;Snow Crash&quot; is an in your face, stay up late and read cyberpunk manifesto. While reading one might notice themself scratching their head and thinking,&quot;What the! Where the hell does this guy come up with this, huh&quot;. The best part about it is that it all manages to work together; magnificently. This book is so filled with far out ideas that it's almost hard to keep up with, but somehow manages to gel at the macro level. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it kind of just ends with out much of an ending. Don't let this deter you, if you like Sci Fi and/or cyberpunk, you will love &quot;Snow Crash&quot;."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"In the pages of Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson offers his readers action packed adventures in a futuristic society that holds pizza, bimbo boxes (mini-vans), and virtual living in the Metaverse as top priorities. Hiro Protagonist and his teenage Kourier partner, Y.T., join the ever-powerful Mafia in attempting to save the world from a devastating virus that destroys the hard drive of computers as well as humans. Once this virus strikes, the victims are left to function with nothing more than snowy transmissions with no possibility of recovery. Although images like teenagers riding bionic skateboards attaching themselves to the back of unsuspecting motorists have been seen before, Stephenson takes his description of this society to a higher level. When describing something as simple as Y.T.'s plank (skateboard), he provides micro detail all the way down to its &quot;RadiKS Mark II Smartwheels with sonar, laser rangefinding, and millimeter-wave radar to identify mufflers and other debris before you even get honed about them.&quot; Stephenson successfully uses satire throughout the novel to make implications about the poor values of our society. The use of satire is obvious in his continued return to the issue of the obliviousness of Y.T's mom. She doesn't have a clue about her daughter's Mafia connected, professional Kourier livelihood filled with drug dealers, murders, and cults. Stephenson stresses the over-dedication of Y.T.'s mom to her profession rather than to her child. The final pages of the story provide an effective summary of the neglect present in one-parent homes, portrayed in numerous portions of the book. The most intriguing aspect of the story comes when Stephenson connects drugs, viruses, and religion to be one in the same. Hiro says to Juanita, &quot;This Snow Crash thing-is it a virus, a drug, or a religion? Juanita shrugs. &quot;What's the difference?&quot; Using such seemingly opposing topics throughout the plot makes it nothing less than captivating. Stephenson did a remarkable job depicting a futuristic world filled with dehumanized individuals. Any society that would sooner &quot;goggle in&quot; to a virtual world than interact with other human beings has lost touch with natural tendencies. This attitude is further exemplified by his direct correlation between the hard drive of a computer and the human brain. If nothing sets mankind apart from these machines, then what qualities do we, as humans, have to offer society? Aside from occasional deviations in sequential order and a lack of clarity at the conclusion of the novel, Stephenson supplies his readers with plenty of sex, technology, drugs, and religion that no American could ever resist. What better way to describe the future of our society than to build on topics that have already been shaping our society over past centuries?"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The time it took and the research involved, along with his expertise in the computer/Internet technology. His ability to design a story around such extremes and characters, with the option of the future use of these technologies, has confounded me. I was so involved with the story, I felt as if I were a protagonist/character. Unexcelled prose, in my estimation."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is my first experience with Stephenson, and the first 50 pages had me grinning like a mental patient. The images come to life, the scenes are deftly described, and the Metaverse unfolds spectacularly before your eyes.But for all the flash and promise at the start, the plot is oddly and disappointingly weak. Utterly predictable and hopelessly cliched, the characters never develop, never show any motivation as to why they are doing what they do. Relationships are not explored past the superficial. The relationship between Hiro and Juanita and the reason he risks his life to go get her is explained off with a Sumerian myth. Ridiculous.This novel is a fun diversion, and entertaining for the first 100 pages. After that, you are on your own."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"While this novel suffers from all of the faults of a young writer whose ambition reaches beyond his craft, this is one example where this works in his favor. The imaginative scope, the sumerian mythology, and the wry tone pull the way through terrain that would leave any other author mired in cliche. Somehow the sheer energy of the book kept me engrossed - even though the inertia of it made it difficult to fully resolve itself. But knowing when to take itself seriously and when to just enjoy the fictional odyssey is the author's primary strength.not a perfect book, but a great one that pushes the boundaries."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is, hands down, one of the most mind-blowing sciencefiction and cyberpunk books of all time. As much as I appreciateNeuromancer, Snow Crash is 100 times more engrossing. I discovered it from reading an excerpt of the beginning in my Creative Writing class in college. I began reading about the deliverator, under the impression he was some kind of high-tech assassin, and was surprised by finding out he was a pizza delivery man. When I found the book in a local bookstore, I couldn't resist buying it.And it was worth every penny.It is one of the few books I can read over and over and, even though I know the ending, it is still suspensful. Even after the third and forth time of reading it, I still couldn't put it down. What I appreciated most about the book is, unlike the other cyberpunk guru's, Stephenson writes as if he himself is a product of the society he's portraying. The metaphors used in the book are hilariously sarcastic, a tone you would probably find in his near-future America. And the plotline is one of the most original I've ever seen. Who would have though to interpret ancient Sumerians as biological robots! Not only the plot but the background itself of future America makes you think about today's society, which is the entire purpose of Sci-Fi. The Metaverse, a cross between the internet and virtual reality, which may be the future of computer tech and the world wide web (by the way, the book was written before the average american knew of the internet), the possibilities of the biological effect from computers, and an interesting look of our future from common trends.I would suggest any and all people interested in Sci-Fi to read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I liked this one, but enjoyed another of Stephenson's books, The Diamond Age, quite a bit more. Most people with children would probably agree. I suspect that the Amazon reviewer who put Snow Crash in the Sci-fi top 25 list is on the young side."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Overall, I liked this novel very much; but it has some weaknesses. First, I'll say some of the good things. Stephenson has managed to write a piece that is just about eclectic as can be, without being totally absurd. It's no secret that this book blends pop-culture, a 3D realization of the Internet, aspects of sociology, Sumerian myth and pizza delivery into one fun piece of fiction to read. What I haven't seen so much is the mention of how Stephenson's writing style is also very eclectic. At some points, the narrative is all tongue-in-cheek satyr laden with creative metaphors; at other points the tone of the book becomes rather serious; at others, it is scarcely more than a high school history lecture; and sometimes it's even just plane old trash-romance pornography. In the end, some of these very different aspects of writing are brought together beautifully; and some, just don't belong in this book. One thing that is done well, is that the amount of sci-fi gadgetry and hyper-active, pop-culture setting doesn't overshadow the characters because they are equally as bizarre and unique as the writing. Even though this book is by no means timeless; it has some of the most creative metaphors and phrases that I've ever read. Again, it's just a lot of fun to read.Ok, nice things being said, here is some stuff that I just didn't think worked well in this novel. I guess the most hotly debated thing in reviews here are the dissertations on Sumerian history. First, I will say that the way it ties into the story is pretty creative and original; second, as it is a work of fiction I can appreciate historical 'fudging' to make it work in the story. That being said, the historical dissertation provided a lot of information that wasn't necessary for the overall plot. This wouldn't be such a big deal; but the fact is, the dissertations dragged on for no short length of pages. While the underlying purpose for the historical tie-in remains clear, the details get quite convoluted toward the end. Also, some points in the historical digression are repeated up to three times throughout the book. I believe, these parts of the book could have been streamlined quite a bit without detracting from the rest of the content. Beyond the history thing, some of the characters exhibit some drastic internal inconsistencies. For instance, one of the main characters is a 15 year old courier, who essentially is a skater punk. This character is extreme (being a teenager immersed in such a hyper-active atmosphere) but totally believable for the most part. Once or twice though, this teenager drops a bomb of wisdom that manages to elude most adults until their 50s. Also, she panics at some points where she would probably be calm and stays calm in some absolutely ridiculous situations. I know teenagers have mood swings; but there are definite points where this character didn't seem 'natural'. In the end her behavior just is not consistent. I believe Hiro also exhibits some similar internal inconsistencies. In the end, I believe that Stephenson has to break the characters of their natural actions to make the story work. The puppeteer shows the strings, in some sense.Another problem I have with the book is the 'Lolita' scene. This book isn't 'Lolita' and to throw a random under-age sex scene into the novel, I believe detracts from the book. Not only is it totally out of place in the writing style up to that point; but also, one of the character seems to magically turn into something straight out of an anime porn fantasy (again, character inconsistency). I'm sorry, it really does read like some geeks interior monologue as he ogles a Hentai movie. The scene was just poorly written compared to the rest of the book; it was unimaginative and cliche.The last thing I'll warn potential readers about is the ending. Stephenson ends the book somewhat abruptly, in that there is no 'resolution' chapter in this book. I can appreciate writers leaving some things unsaid in the end; but Stephenson left loose-ends that were just blatantly ignored and or forgotten about. For the most part you know where things stand; but I would have left the book much happier if Stephenson wrote, like, another five pages to give some final resolve. Again, I can appreciate writers leaving certain points to the reader's imagination; but Stephenson doesn't write like that (how many pages of Sumerian myth did I read in this book?). Stephenson keeps tight control of the reader, leaving little to subtlety of descriptions or intentions, only to leave the reader semi-hanging at the end.Again, I know the above is rather scathing in some sense; but overall, I enjoyed the book very much. Stephenson managed to pull off what few could. Given how much fun the book is to read, the above criticism can be forgiven, if for nothing else, the creativity of the material."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"You should read this novel if you1. enjoy a dark vision of the future presented as comedy;2. appreciate masterful word play;3. like plots of epic scope and complexity;4. can live with characters who, while interesting, are not steeped in psychological complexity;5. are looking for a masterpiece of speculative satire."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Readers of this book need to take into account that it was written between '89 and '91, published in '92. Why? Because so many of his predictions and observations are pretty accurate or close to how things are now. If you didn't realize this, then it would seem cliched and unoriginal. In addition, the book is damn funny, it zips along at a quick pace and the dialogue is sharp and witty. Pick it up at your first opportunity and as soon as you start reading, you'll be hooked...."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've never been much of a fan of cyberpunk after reading William Gibson's thoroughly prose and character challenged Neuromancer. But Snow Crash gives me hope for the genre. Hiro Protagonist (nice play on words) is an out of luck pizza delivery dude in a world of city states, 20th century cliches run amok, and a lawless space betweend city states ruled by the Mafia and other groups. On the side he is a gatherer of information...information rules the world, and can be sold for a nice penny. Hiro (and his motley crew of sidekicks he meets along the way) discover that a Texas billionaire is bent on causing infocalypse via a religious cult he has set up based on ancient Sumerian mythology.I like nearly everything about this book. The gadgets, the characters, the setting. I loved the concept of the Metaverse and how avatars interacted within it. I did not care for all the Sumerian background. It was obvious that Stephenson knows a lot about it, and felt the need to stretch his wings and take us down that road. But, speaking for myself, I had no interest in Sumerian legend.I also noted that Stephenson changed voice halfway through the book. The dialoge and prose in the first half is fresh, witty, belligerent, daring, on the edge stuff. I mean, I read the first few pages of the book and was like: Wow, I've never read SF prose quite like this! The second half is hum-drum prose that thousands of other writers churn out. This has to stem from the fact that he wrote it over a 4 year period, thus losing some of the consistency of the prose.Overall I really liked Snow Crash, but couldn't really get into the Sumerian mythology aspects of it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The novel starts out perfectly - fast, hip, edgy, and with just the right amount of humor. The future world that Stephenson describes (both real and virtual) has just enough level of fine technological details to be incredibly real and possible. We don't know what's going on, but we have a feeling that this is going to be one awesome book.Then we hit the middle. And suddenly everything comes to a screeching halt, as we're presented with 50-page lecture on Pentecostals, Hebrews, Sumerian mythology and Kabbala. In a sense, it is expected. General formula of a thriller: confuse the reader at the start, explain most of the riddles somewhere in the middle while leaving off a few of the vital pieces, then reveal these closer to the end. In this case, however, the lecture clarifies virtually nothing. Despite all of Stephenson's attempts to keep it lively and in a form of a dialog, it's mind-numbingly boring and has very little connection to what is going on in the actual plot. Furthermore, its historical accuracy is questionable. I'm not an expert on Ancient Sumer, but I know enough about Christianity to say that Pentecostals are NOT part of Orthodox Christianity and that Resurrection story was not appended to the Gospels. The Gospels weren't even the first documents that talk about resurrection of Jesus. Paul's letters predate them by at least 10 years. Given how far off the mark Stephenson is when it comes to Christianity, it makes me suspicious of the rest of the information we're given.The lecture aside, the book continues, nowhere near the speed or level of intrigue set by the opening chapters. It also becomes very patchy. Characters enter and leave the narration with little warning or explanation. How does Hiro suddenly transform from a bum living in a storage facility to a fully loaded bike rider? At which point does everybody suddenly decide that he needs to be killed? Just what exactly is so special about a 15-year-old Kourier besides attitude-sans-limits that the Mafia actually decides to employ her services? All of these are either unanswered or given very fleeting and sketchy explanations.Finally, the novel drags itself to the ending, where another lengthy lecture is given, summarizing the earlier presentation and explaining in details what is going on. Well, as much details as can be given in a pseudo-scientific fictional book about a virus that is both computer and biological at the same time.Then the book ends. At least two major story lines are unfinished. What happens to Da5id? What about the hydrogen bomb that Raven was carrying? Just how exactly Juanita managed to master the Sumerian language? I could go on.This is a truly disappointing novel. To start out with such a bang and to go down in flames so horribly by the end, it may very well be said that the title of the book is what actually happens to it by the end."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Possibly this book was half decent in the mid 90s, but reading this book today it comes off completely ridiculous. The female character YT is written in an unrealistic and, I think, sexist manner. When I started the book I thought the first couple chapters must be a character having a dream or something, it couldn't possibly be the book I had read positive reviews about, but it was and it didn't get much better. Snow Crash managed to be completely idiotic at certain points, and hard to follow at other points.

I wasn't disappointed; Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash is a superb cyberpunk novel with fun characters thrown in.Hiro Protagonist (no, really...that's his name) is a sometime pizza boy in an America that has become fractured and conglomerated by corporations. However, his real a/vocation is his life on the net, wherein he is a sword-swing agent. When his net mogul friend, Da5id, is rendered brainless by a strange computer virus called Snow Crash, Hiro is thrown into an adventure with Mesopotamian mythology, mad mafia pizza moguls, a criminal whose weapon of choice is plate-glass spears, a massive floating island of refugees, and a cynical teenage skateboard courier. Stephenson has an eye for both satire and for enthralling description. Highly recommended for any fan of William Gibson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"While the cyber-punk subgenre certainly started with William Gibson's Neuromancer, it peaked with Stephenson's Snowcrash. Cyberpunk is 80's speculative fiction that tries to imagine Reagan's America in the 2020's. Cyberpunk is mall mythology, and it doesn't get any better than Snowcrash. The story follows Hiro Protagonist, VR-internet god and real world pizza delivery boy, and a young skateboard courier named YT through an American that is a shattered mirror of our own. Snowcrash suffers from some terrible late 80's action movie conventions (most notably some of Hiro's clunker dialogue and his terrible name), but more than makes up for it with some of the funniest prose ever laid down, and ideas so grand in scope as to make Isaak Asimov weep. For anyone who wants an intelligent read, biting with black humor, Snowcrash is the summer beach novel for you."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've been wanting to read this book for a few years, mainly due to all the positive word of mouth I had heard about it and the reviews on this site. Whereas I normally finish a book like this in a week, this one took me over a month, and I finally quit it with about 50 pages to go. One of the things I hate doing is starting a book and not finishing it, especially after investing all that time into it, but I just couldn't read anymore of this.It's not that the book was necessarily bad, it just wasn't to my tastes. I love science fiction and fantasy, and I love books about hacking, but it seemed like \\"Snow Crash\\" just kept on dragging on and on with no real advancement of the story, which kept getting more convulted. I'm not even sure what the plot was, because it seemed like Stephenson was more interested in introducing the reader to all these futuristic concepts that make up 90% of the book. I felt like the majority of the book's purpose was to describe a radically different view on America in the future, complete with an almost dissolved Federal Government and a world run by hackers and the mafia, and there was some story thrown in as well. But unfortunately, the story wasn't enough to interest me.If you're a fan of Blade Runner, Cryptonomicon, Neuromancer, and The Matrix, you'll probably like this book. For me, the \\"coolness factor\\" of a world that revolved around hacking and people carrying swords just didn't make for a good story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"At the outset we meet our protagonist, Hiro Protagonist (yes, it is a stupid name). It is difficult to tell exactly what is taking place. The narrator speaks in third person who is quite annoying at first but you get used to it; does not last through the whole book. Soon it becomes clear that Hiro is a pizza delivery boy who also thinks he is a samurai.Please don't stop reading after the first fifty or sixty pages as I almost did. I promise that it starts to make sense. The whole book is not about the process of future pizza delivery. If you stop, you will miss some of the best speculative fiction ever. Hiro must figure out who is unleashing a virus that can destroy minds through the Metaverse (the future internet). Rarely had a book raised my adrenalin levels as much as this did.I must admire an author who can take such a silly seeming idea and infuse it with so mush life and thankfully, Stephenson is writing faster than most people can read. From the reviews, it seems that this is something to be thankful for.Highly recommended to any Sci-fi fan not only hackers and programmers (I can barely check my email). jay."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"OK, so it's a bit Hollywood-esque & shallow. It's good cyberpunk escapism and an enjoyable summer read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Thanks to Neal's books, including &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, etc., I have suddenly become a great lover of the entire cyberpunk spectrum. &quot;Snow Crash&quot; has only solidified my newfound love with this sub-genre of science-fiction and I find myself thirsting for more. Such as another book, which is very oddly written yet still tells a great cyberpunk tale in my opinion, is &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;. It has also wound up on my list of good cyberpunk books."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I only picked up this book because I had seen a review on this site. This book is not in my usual style/genre of reading. But I am so glad I read it! Wow!What really appealled to me about this book is the setting in a future that you can easily confuse with tomorrow. It's set in such a way that this future is very credible and almost possible. The technology is certainly feasible! And the current events and ideas that make and define us today could lead to a future, as described in Snow Crash!The history and mythology were also very interesting and the dialogue was smart. The characters are fully fleshed. You want to hate Raven but there is something that make you like him, just a bit, against your better judgement.This book is a page turner. No matter your type of book, this is an awesome read."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash was Neal Stephenson's breakthrough novel and is the one that saw him being labelled inaccurately as a cyberpunk novelist. Snow Crash is a brilliant witty science fiction adventure.In the near future the nation state of America has broken down and people live in corporate owned mini city-states. The Mafia control pizza delivery and Hiro Protagonist a samurai sword wielding deadbeat hacker is a Deliverator of pizzas. Hiro is drawn into a complex plot to enslave people's minds when a computer virus/drug called Snow Crash is released onto the Metaverse. Trying to stop Hiro in his quest to save the world is Raven an Aleutian psychopath with razor thin glass knives and a Nuclear Weapon strapped to his motorcycle.This book is responsible for bringing into public consciousness many cyberspace concepts that are now becoming commonplace. The concept of the Metaverse and Avatars is now mainstream in MMORPGs such as Everquest and The Sims Online. Also the idea that the human brain is programmable and is capable of crashing has become accepted by neuroscientists and can be seen in the science of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.Stephenson demonstrates an ability here to dump a lot of information into your brain without you noticing, and although there are a few missteps along the way generally his science is sound unlike many SF writers.The one failing of the book is that the over-arching threat posed by L. Bob Rife and his plan to take over the world never seems threatening enough and dwindles in comparison to the actual physical threat of Raven.The world conceived of in the book is both a brilliant backdrop to the plot and a credible possible future that we may be facing. When governments lose the power to collect taxes then they cease to be of any use and citizens will seek the services of protection and education from corporations.If the first 25 pages don't get you hooked then put the book down, step away carefully and go numb your mind by watching television game shows."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I've been reading science fiction for over forty years now, and I have to rate 'Stephenson''s SNOW CRASH as one of the best. There are over 175 reviews above here, and they'll give you details. I'll just say that it's a great read, and it will bear re-reading as well."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It portrays a unique look at the future with an all powerful internet. It also analyzes the use of religion."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has written five books. The book that made his place in the literary world was Snow Crash. This book is based on Stephenson's idea of our future and how it is linked to our past. The United States' economy has crashed and little city states pop up all over the United States. These city states are formed by ethnic or cultural distinctions. They all meet in a place called the Metaverse. They always believed that the Metaverse is safe if you have enough &quot;medicine&quot; for your computer. Because of this belief they people do not believe that they can be hurt in any way, this is were the Snow Crash virus is most virulent. The virus only effects computer programmers because they naturally understand the binary code, they brain is \`programmed' to understand it. They are then feed directly to the brain an overload of the binary code which shuts down the higher reasoning sections of the brain and allows the ancient memories to surface. This ancient language is based on the Semitic language of ancient Sumeria. He traces the \`linguistic virus' through out history from the fall of the Tower of Babel to his futuristic virus.The only thing about this book that I did not like was the way it would jump around and add people that never really seemed necessary for the story. I do not usually read science fiction books, so I do not know if this is the usual way they are written. I still really enjoyed the book. I found the sections on the religion and mythology very fascinating. It made me question some of the religious beliefs that I took for granted, as well as, questioning our future.I think I am questioning the future in the same manner my parents did when they read George Orwell's 1984. The whole idea of Big Brother and being watched in comparison to being part of Little China or Little Sicily. I think that this could happen, look at all the hate between ethnic backgrounds here in the United States. Someone once said the United States is like a Melting Pot of cultures, others have said that is a Salad Bowl. I have always believed the Salad Bowl theory."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this years ago when it first came out and, after returning it to the library, it still stayed in my mind.

Then one day I picked it up, and I couldn't put it down! Read this book, force it on your friends, it is quick and well planned out and an excellent read. Now isn't that something we all wish we could find more of! :)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson began his studies as a physics major, then a geology major so he could obtain more time on his university's mainframe computer. He also began working on cars and agricultural labor to his present career as a writer. This is the first book that I have read by Neal Stephenson and it is definitely one of the best science fiction books I have read. I only wish I would have read &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; first. I do not usually read science fiction books, I usually stick with romance novels and Danielle Steel. This book was on a recommended reading list for my Internet &amp; Society class. I am elated that this was the one I chose because I could not put it down. I was warned as with others that Neal's books do not have good endings, but I thought it was good-could have been better though. The beginning has this &quot;I cannot put his book down&quot; draw to it, but during the middle it is cluttered and distracting. Cyberpunk is definitely a hip and happening topic now that we are heading into the year 2000. The plot was different from anything that I have read before, that is unquestionably what made me keep reading until two in the morning some nights. His theme about the Internet plays on the way the Internet could be in the near future. The Metaverse is an extraordinary idea that may happen before we know it. The plot was intensely interesting and unmistakably well thought out, but I have one question; Where does he get these ideas? Pizza delivery is without a doubt at its best and boy do I have respect for those delivery boys working for the Mafia. Y.T. is undoubtedly my favorite character in the entire book. She is fifteen and afraid of nothing. She has an attitude and she definitely is not afraid to use it and has a sense of what she wants and if she wants it she will get it one way or another. The Snow Crash virus was a very interesting idea and brought the book together in a realistic way. With the advancement of technology this sort of thing is not out of the question and may be what the future will hold for computer hackers. The down sides about the book are the really boring chapters about Hiro doing research with the &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot; The Librarian&quot; in his office in the Metaverse, Raven and his killing sprees with the shards of glass, the fact that Juanita just disappears to The Raft without a trace until the end, and what happened to Da5id? The names of the characters are lame, but they bring an insightful look into the future of what children have to look forward too. I really hated the parts about Y.T.'s mother. The Federal government is slim we all know that, but where did Y.T get her courage and sense of direction? Clearly not from her mother, the dedicated Federal government hacker."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson becomes the antithesis of Peter Drucker and Alvin Toffler.

In the meantime I'll have to endure the dry and flat prose of William Gibson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson has done it again!

Huge chunks of the book are taken up with explaining things to the reader, especially the parts about Summerian culture and language - 'look at me, I'm really erudite!' he screams at you. This is always a sign of inexperience in writing. Elsewhere the narrative moves along at a breakneck pace, with little real character development, though this I assume is part of the satire. Overall this book is like a little Jack Russell dog- eager to please, but so immensely irritating you feel like kicking it."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Excellent book.

I read it in one week on vacation.

The plot and characters are well fleshed out, the themes are appealing and well presented, and there is a nice streak of humor running throughout. Of course, it's also thought that Stephenson is prescient beyond the norm - there's a lot of science fiction that has become (or is becoming) science fact.Crash is almost a great book. Like Cormac McCarthy, NS demands a lot from his reader. You need to pay attention to really get at the meat of what this book represents. The themes are subtly interwoven, sometimes truly hidden amongst good dialog or a clever bit of prose. There are passages that bear re-reading, especially after you finish the book.What this book lacks is ... polish. For all of the layers, the humor, the plot lines, and the themes, there is a connectedness missing. I felt at times that I was watching a John Woo movie - all the pieces are there, but no glue.Don't worry - what NS lacks in sophistication as a writer, he makes up for by being a clever storyteller and a good journalist for a future that might yet come."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Read this book. Yah...I know...the description sounds dumb... who'd want to read a book about a pizza delivery guy?

It doesn't start a new genre, but the story moves faster and the character development is easier because the foundation is already there. _Neuromancer_ was first, but all other cyberpunk novels have to be compared with _Snow Crash_, a combination of mature cyberbunk ideas with the best wit and satire of Neal Stephenson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is somewhat of a new venture for me. The only other science fictions I have read were: Cobra Event, and Area 51. This book was pleasently surprising. The way Neal Stephenson writes will keep you interested throughout the book. His use of humor makes the pages fly bye. My only two complaints are that the book gets a little tedious in the section regarding ancient sumer(mainly history), and also, a book this great deserves a much better ending. Even with these downfalls, this is still an excellent book that I would highly recommend to all readers."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash by Neal StephensonA few pages into this book, I had to check the date of publication - 1992! Which meant it was imagined no later than 1991 - and much of the technology which was imagined is now a fact. Sadly, harpooning one's way down the LA freeways on skateboards has NOT happened.Definitely a book for the younger crowd; in fact, it gave me some insights into teenagers. The heroine is a delightful 15 year old girl, but a girl who was imagined by a boy, that's for sure. There were a few scenes which rang delightfully true - when she is taken in by an elderly man's courtliness, for example. I suppose the hero is the main character, but I didn't find him nearly as appealing as the girl.There are some interesting notes on class - p. 61 - \\"class is more than income, it has to do with knowing where you stand in a web of social relationships.\\"And a great quote - p. 121\\"Don't let evil into your operating system.\\" Or p.223 \\"The social structure of any nation-state is ultimately determined by its security arrangements.\\"p.140 got me to thinking about \\"personalized attention\\" and how hungry we are for it.p.147 made me think about what makes real real. It's a question raised by virtual reality, including the virtual classroom.p. 217 raises the idea of the story as incantation, a self-fulling fiction. Just what does fiction do to us?Unsatisfying : the parent/child relationships (p.226). Silence is the best stategm? I don't think so. This one posits the teenager who is silent as savior of her oh-so-out-of-it mother. Appealing perhaps, to teens, but not helpful.The analysis of religion is dismissive of faith. Fun as this book was, I won't recommend it to the teens in my life. It's a nam-shub (p.217) for sure."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I LOVED this book, and I usually hate reading.

The two of them stumble on to a vast plot to, you guessed it, take over the world.While the basic plot structure here is an old one, Stephenson brings fresh style to it and an interesting historical twist. The characters in this novel are fun and smart. In a writing style that I haven't seen before, Stephenson keeps the action fast paced, while still putting out a lot of substance.Its a fast read with some great content, and I can't say enough about the style. I highly recommend it as a change of pace from more traditional science fiction."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Snow Crash is simply the best Science Fiction book I have ever read. It is even better then Stranger in a Strangeland. Nuff said."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"My first impression of Snow Crash came from my younger son who was looking at it as it laid on the table waiting for me to get to it. He said something like, \\"The main character's name is Hiro Protagonist?!\\" and burst out laughing. Being incredulous, I grabbed the book and looked and, sure enough, that is the main character's name. The thoughts in my head ran something like this:\\"That is so dumb!\\"\\"That sounds like something that would come from a bunch of guys sitting around drinking.\\" You know, because they're drinking, they think it's funny.\\"Stephenson must not have realized the next day that it wasn't as funny as it seemed when he was drinking.\\"\\"It sounds like the kind of thing my oldest would have suggested when he was 5 and wanted to name his not-yet-born younger brother Hot-Speeder.\\" You know, if he had known the word \\"protagonist\\" at 5.\\"That is so dumb!\\"The thing is, though, Stephenson evidently did realize it was stupid, because he acknowledges within the book that it's stupid by having another character tell Hiro he has a stupid name. It didn't dissuade him from using it, though. His secondary character has a similar name in that she's called \\"Y.T.\\" which seems to have been used just so there can be confusion and have people call her \\"Whitey.\\"The second impression followed closely on the heels of the first. Hiro delivers pizzas (for the Mafia, but that's another story). Hiro is also an elite hacker and the best samurai swordsman in the world. He delivers pizzas. As I digested this information, I flashed back to an idea my oldest told me about when he was about 12: a ninja on a motorcycle, swords crossed on his back, delivering pizzas. He, at 12, thought this was a wonderful idea. At 12, it probably is. At this point in the book, I began entertaining the idea that this was just some kind of delusion from the hero, Hiro; that might have made the book interesting. But it turned out not to be; everything is supposed to be as it's presented.As you can see, my view of the book wasn't shaping into anything positive. But it gets worse... oh, it gets so much worse.See, the back of the book says the book is \\"...a mind-altering romp through a future America...\\" A future America. And that's the hinge that broke the whole story for me, because it's not set in the future at all. Whoever wrote the back cover blurb must not have actually read the book, and that's without excuse. It is even more without excuse that that's been allowed to stand through 19 printings of the book. It makes me wonder if anyone in the publishing industry ever actually read the book.Let me break this down for you.Hiro's father fought in World War II. Not his grandfather, his father. To be at all plausible, the story can't really be taking place any later than the mid-90s. The book was published in 1992, so, really, the story was happening \\"now\\" as it was published (because 3 years into the future is not a \\"future America,\\" at least not as it's presented in the book). So, basically, what we're dealing with is an alternate timeline world, which would be okay if1. it was presented that way2. there was some reason for the HUGE differences between the world of the book and our worldwhat caused the divergence (which happened sometime after WWII and, probably, after Vietnam)how in the heck did the technology get so advanced (because it's decades (at least) more advanced than what we have now (two decades after the book was written)Which is to say that I just couldn't buy the book from that perspective, because the world as it's presented in the book could never have gotten to the state that it was in in just a couple of decades from the divergence point. It's utterly ridiculous.So... I'm reading, I'm not very far in, and I'm having huge issues with the book. And it gets worse.The \\"partnership\\" between Y.T. and Hiro is only there because the author decided it would be. The characters have no motivation toward it. They meet and Y.T. says \\"hey, you wanna be partners?\\" and Hiro says \\"yeah, sure.\\" The problem is that Y.T. is a 15-year-old girl and Hiro is a 30-something guy with no job. The relationship is never mutual, either. Y.T. just feeds information to Hiro while occasionally being bossed around. She gets nothing in return other than getting to say he's her \\"partner.\\" It was dumb.But it gets worse.Early in the book, after Hiro has lost his pizza delivery job because he crashed the pizza car (see, so now he's a completely unemployed samurai hacker (pun intended)), he's in the metaverse, the virtual reality world of the book, trying to get intel he can sell. Some stuff happens including Hiro getting into a fight that just happens so that we can see Hiro's virtual sword skills. But! In the middle of all of this stuff in the metaverse, we cut to Y.T. who has gotten herself thrown into \\"the Clink.\\" She needs to be rescued, so she calls Hiro to get her out of her jam. This is pre-partnership and, I suppose, the impetus of the partnership. Anyway, Hiro shows up and rescues her, and they part ways. THEN, we go back to Hiro right where we left him in the metaverse about to have this fight. Basically, Hiro was in two places at once, because there is no explanation ever given about how these two events happened at the same time. Basically, Stephenson needed to break to the other character and never took into account the conflicting time frame.This is not the only time we see Stephenson have issues with keeping things like this straight, and this next bit has spoilers, so skip ahead if you have the misguided notion of wanting to read this book. Otherwise, read on!1. Near the end of the book, Hiro is explaining everything to some dudes (you know, your basic telling instead of showing, but it's worse than that (but I'll get to that in a moment)), and one of the guys asks Hiro why he needs to get the clay tablet. The problem? Hiro hadn't gotten to that part yet. Basically, Stephenson just has the guy ask a question that he, supposedly, knows nothing about so that he can dump the info to the readers. It made me want to gouge the pages. First, I don't need to have stuff explained to me (especially more than once!), but, if you're going to explain to me, don't do it in a stupid way like having a bunch of guys who don't have a clue about what's going on start asking questions based on info they don't have.2. During the climax of the book, the main tough dude bad guy is on a helicopter. He's been on the helicopter for a while. Except when he's suddenly needed to kill a bunch of people, he's somewhere else killing them before the helicopter arrives at the location. No explanation. Nothing. He's just already there. After Raven has killed all the dudes he needs to kill, then the helicopter with the head bad dude shows up. The helicopter that Raven had been on for chapters and chapters. I wanted to rip the pages out of the book (but I'm going to trade it in at the used book store for something that's actually good, so I refrained).So...There are all of these specific issues of stupidity in the book, way more than I've mentioned here, but the worst thing about the book had nothing to do with those things. And those were bad enough. I mean, if I hadn't been trying to find out why the book is such an \\"important\\" sci-fi book, I wouldn't have read it. I would have stopped at the point where I realized it was set \\"now,\\" because, really, that was a deal breaker for me, except I wasn't to anything, yet, that was giving me a reason why it made such an impact, so I had to keep going to find out.The beginning of the book has a bunch of inane action that has nothing to do with anything before we actually get to the inciting incident. After that, someone shows up and gives Hiro a special computer thing, and, basically, the computer tells Hiro everything he needs to know for the rest of the book. He never does anything to discover anything. The computer just tells him the story. And, you know, it's this long philosophical discussion with the computer (that goes on for, like, 1/3 of the book) that, again, reminded me of a bunch of guys staying up late drinking and someone says \\"what if language was a virus?\\" and they just went on and on about it thinking themselves all deep and crap and everyone wakes up the next day and realizes what a stupid idea it was. Except, well, everyone but Neal Stephenson. He wakes up the next morning and decides to write a book about it with his other stupid, drunken idea, the name of the protagonist, oh, yeah! Protagonist! And then threw in the stuff he fantasized about when he was 12, namely being a ninja hacker pizza delivery guy with a hot 15-year-old girl.Oh, yeah, did I mention that Y.T. is 15? Because she is. And she spends a goodly portion of the book being concerned with what a hot 15-y-o piece she is. (Yes, I know I mentioned it, but OH MY GOSH it's so constant in the book.)Oh! Oh, wait! So, yeah, there's this huge discussion with the computer, right, where the computer tells him everything. Blah blah blah. The whole plot is just explained to us without any action to go with it. So that's bad enough (actually, it's horrible, because, like, that's the HUGEST no no of writing: Show, don't tell, but Stephenson apparently thinks we wouldn't be able to figure it out if he showed us, or, maybe, he just couldn't figure out how to show us his deep, philosophical conversation with himself), but, at the end, he has to re-tell it all from Hiro's perspective to make sure we understood what he already told us, so we get to spend another couple of chapters with Hiro explaining the plot to people that aren't really important. Except that they are, but we never knew that until just at that moment when Hiro needs to explain everything to them so that they can take care of the bad guy. Basically, the book spends a lot of time telling us the story with action mixed in that's only loosely related to the plot.The only interesting thing in the book is Stephenson's vision of virtual reality and virtual worlds. Way back in '92, I guess I can see people getting excited about what he did with that stuff, since the whole virtual world thing didn't really exist, yet. Of course, it still doesn't exist via virtual reality, but virtual worlds are virtually a dime a dozen these days (sorry for the pun but not sorry enough to take it out (see what I did there? acknowledging it but leaving it in)), and some of them are even modeled on the idea of Snow Crash. It doesn't make up for how poorly written the book was, though. It's not the worst written book I've ever read, but I think it may have been the stupidest. I mean that. It has so many plot issues and plot holes and, well... maybe I shouldn't expect more, but, yeah, I expect more from big time books from big time publishers (and, remember, this was before the breakthrough of independent and self publishing). Someone, at some point, should have said... something."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"The 1st and 2nd chapters were some of the most interesting and intense chapters I have read in a long time, and all it does is talk about pizza delivery. Well, if he can write two chapters about pizza delivery highly interesting, then the rest of the novel, all 470 pages of it, must be more amazing because the whole book will not be about pizza, right? You're right if you say the rest of the book is about pizza. You're wrong if you say that the rest of the book will be even more interesting than the first two chapters. Sure, there are several points of interest that keep the book going, but it has major issues. There are several chapters where he is literally researching at the library and talking to the librarian (computer) about his research. Now that might be interesting if his research was based even a little in reality, but it's not. For those of you who like Dan Brown's novels, you might like this one, except about half of Dan Brown's religious assumptions are kinda almost there. Snow Crash is full of assumptions about religion that make no sense whatsoever, and you are tempted to believe them.Word of advice: read the book, enjoy it, but skip all the chapters with the Librarian: you don't learn anything useful and you'll actually enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Good light reading. Yes it's shallow and comic/Hollywood esq., but its fun and that counts for much. I wish though that book had an actual ending. There is a very real sense that two thirds into the book the author just decided that its time to tie up the story."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"...nothing in this book is particularly new. Neal Stephenson's vision of a comically fractured near future has been treated by a number of more talented authors, notably William Gibson. His weird &quot;plot twist&quot; about language being a driving force behind human development, is, well, courtesy of William S. Burroughs and his &quot;Word Virus&quot; concept (at least in the context). Don't get me wrong, I love to see authors borrow each others ideas in this kind of fashion, but when I read this I got the feeling that Neal Stephenson's prominence in the science fiction genre was due to one of those minor upheavals in preference and styles that come and go about once every five years or so...he doesn't do anything original, but he does it capably well, and at the time that happens to be enough. His later efforts have not notably proved me wrong. Even I can't deny the man's talent as a storyteller, though. Even though every fifty pages or so I had to burst out &quot;oh, come on!&quot; I kept turning pages...and isn't that what it's all about? One day Stephenson may find a way to keep us turning pages without those outbursts...I hope he finds it soon."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I will admit that my review is tainted by having read Cryptonomicron before reading this. Crypto was one of the ten best books to appear last year, but is a quantum leap forward as a novel. Snow Crash may have put Stephenson on the science fiction map but I but I'm not sure on which remote corner he appears. The characters are poorly developed, and their relationships even more poorly constructed. Hiro Protagonist turns out not to be the real hero in the end anyway (perhaps that is why his name is spelled incorrectly). The whole premise of the book is a little too bizarre for my personal taste.Parts of the book were amazingly well done. The Sumerian and Babel sections epecially, but the story didn't make me root for Hiro or against Raven. I really didn't care who won. In the end the real villain, Rife, gets so little attention as to be a mere add on. The ultimate hero Uncle Enzo is incompletely developed.I loved Crypto and perhaps my expectations were too high. The book left me flat except for the thought provoking subplot of language."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This Kindle book contains numerous typographical errors which, for me, ruin the experience. What a disgrace. Every single night I read it, I spotted an obvious problem."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"What Neuromancer started, Snow Crash maximizes. If Cyber-Punk is your thing, you'll love this. I didn't. If you're a young white male video-game fantatic, this is where it's at. I'm none of the above.For everyone else, those of us who know what a story is, what characterization is, what point of view is, this is a huge disappointment after the build-up. As a writer, I am not impressed. As a friend said, Stephenson has something to say; however, he's taken way too many creative writing classes and they get in the way of whatever that is. It's surprisingly easy to write this stuff -- no in-depth character thinking, non-stop action instead of what McKee calls the ebb and flow of pace and action, no rhythm, just top-volume jive all the way, way-too-long sentences using five-dollar words where a nickel one will do. And no real point of view. It's written in first person, present tense to up the immediacy, which may suit the fast-paced feel but doesn't allow for thought. At no time did I get any real concept of how the character(s) felt about what they were involved in. Just mindless go-go-go. Too much.Fast-paced, in-your-face, California fast-jive; wise-cracking, pissy-assed, slam-bam action-packed non-stop creative-writing razzle-dazzle word-mongering; no-pain, no-gain, no-fault law-ignoring fast-driving cyber-punk and boring.On an academic level, I understand the appeal.

But I can only suppose I skipped over the endless pseudo religious explanations that he uses to try to justify his 'reveal' of how the pseudo tech is supposed to work.The rat things are the very cutest. The sword fighting is good. The interface descriptions are good. YT is the main character, regardless of Hero being the tech warrior and super sword fighter. Stephenson doesn't seem to know what to do with him, other that have him say \\"uh huh\\" and \\"oh I get it\\" and paraphrase things in lower tech ways for the hard of thinking.I got very very bored with all the trivial detail that was supposed to show that early humans were nothing more than cheap computers. Biological organisms just aren't that simple or incapable of innovation. The more you learn about animals the more you learn that whatever humans do to differentiate themselves from animals the more similarities you find. It used to be tool use, but even crows fashion tools and even fish use them (wrass will go a long way to find just the right rock to beat open a shell fish).The tech hasn't stood the test of time either. We don't make audio tapes. Dude! MP3s! Just say stored. No need to reveal your aging tech. Too many CRTs too, some kids will never have seen one outside of a museum.In the end an interesting historic piece with a very flawed premise that is revealed in enough detail to allow it to fall apart."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Loved this book.

Everything is exaggerated. Pacing is uneven -- there's a long set up and then everything just ends. Maybe his later books are better."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Great book that is brought to screeching halts by long lectures on Sumerian Mythology. Comparing computer programming with ancient civilizations seemed far-fetched and out of place. The pages where Hiro is lectured by the Computer on were tough to get through and ruined the flow of the story. Seemed forced and didn't add to the story at all, ruined an otherwise great book that was years ahead of it's time."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Overall the book is fun. Not great by any stretch, but I can see the hype - 20yrs ago. My main issue with the book is the sheer volume of new things just thrown at the reader, especially in acronym form. Through the first half of the book I felt I needed a codex. It's fine to create a new world, but you have to go slower and write better frankly.My other issue with the book is the comparison to Ready Player One. Everyone who reviewed that book said people should read this book. Clearly they were remembering fondly through rose colored glasses. So because the comparison issue was there when I read it, I probably enjoyed it less.Then, and now, the appeal is to high tech teen boys, and I'm fine with that. But some actual character development might have been good. One reviewer here put it nicely - it felt like a Hollywood action movie.I would not recommend this book to anyone now, there is simply better stuff out there.

It took some effort on my part to finish it and not just return it to the library unread--fortunately I had not spent money on it nor sacrificed another tree.The deeper concept borrowing from Chomsky's ideas of deep syntactic structures and the virtual-reality world keep me from giving it one star. But, really, the sword-wielding hacker, the hyper-speed skater, etc. were simply too overplayed. (But, being a dog lover, I had a little affection for Fido, the dog with the exoskeleton.)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"At first, this book is difficult to read. It's the writer's own creation of cyber-punk poetry meets science-fiction/fantasy story. The sentences run on metaphors and insinuations. It's very hard, at times, to discern whether the author is stating something, describing something, or using a metaphor to describe what's going on. After a couple of chapters, you get the hang of it.The protagonist, Hiro, is an uber hacker. People work, play, and socialize in a Second Life-like game. The mob owns the pizza delivery chains and kills drivers that don't deliver on time. There's a few Mesopotamian gods and spells. There's also a skateboarder teenager with a giant magnet. Did I mention cyborg dogs?I wouldn't say the story is really great. In fact, if it were just a book written in plain English, I would probably give it three stars and not look at it twice. The writing style is what really captivates the reader and brings them back. After I began this book, I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated by the style and gauntly grace of the author's writing.I wish, wish, wish that Stephenson would write another book like this. The rest of his books usually star hackers, but don't have the same beautiful writing style. :("},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"It's a great book.

After a few chapters I was totally immersed in Stephenson's bizarre, yet oddly plausible, future reality. I don't read much sci-fi, but this is now one of my favorite books. I can't wait to read more of his work. This book was published in 1992 - it's way ahead of its time. In some ways, this book predicted the future popularity of Facebook and other social media websites."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I really wish that I liked this book. It was obviously well reseached and entertaining in some parts. But I just completely lost interest after about 100 pages. It tried to get to serious, and for me, this ruined the book. I can see why some people would love this book, but it is not for everyone. I hate books that take themselves to seriously when they dont have to. This book should have been about 100 pages shorter by cutting out all the useless information that was in it. I liked the pace of the book but the things that were happening were boring."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Too bad there is no MPAA rating for books (at least not that I know of, if someone knows a rating system for books then please let me know) like there is for movies. This book would otherwise be rated NC-17 based on the gory violence. Obviously it doesn't bother most people, but it bothers me. The language would also give the book at least an R rating. I could overlook the foul language but gave up a third into the book because of the gore. So if violence and sliced up corpses doesn't bother you then this might be a good book, otherwise be warned."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This review probably won't be representative of the average person that reads this book. This I freely admit up front. But as a big fan of Thomas Pynchon and someone who doesn't go out of their way to read sci-fi or any other genre fiction, I merely seek to warn others of similar tastes. So if William Gibson, Robert Sterling and Phillip K Dick are your literary gods, these comments probably won't sway you one way or another... if, on the other hand, like me, your interest in \\"Snow Crash\\" was aroused solely through comparisons to Thomas Pynchon and the like, this review is for you.First of all, it should be stated that Pynchon has become so synonymous with the whole tongue-in-cheek ultra-literary treatment of conspiracy theory (as well he should) that every two bit hack that chooses to incorporate secret societies into his/her work inevitably gets compared to Thomas Pynchon, regardless of their ultimate literary intentions. Neal Stephenson may be more than a two bit hack, but - regretfully - on the basis of \\"Snow Crash\\", not a whole lot. The only remotely Pynchonesque aspect of the novel is the existence of a secret language based on old Sumerian lore, which is not only monosyllabic but so simplistic that it's informational content deposits directly into the core of the brain: in other words, you have no choice over whether or not to believe it; just by hearing it the content becomes an inherent part of your belief system. This seems entirely ludicrous but apparently has some basis in certain linguists' theories, and is particularly Pynchonesque in this regard since it involves language itself, and Pynchon's works are as much about the ways that we communicate and experimenting with those methods as they are about plot (the latter almost an afterthought in TP's work).But here we get into the gist of the review, and why many people will feel I'm being unfair to Neal Stephenson: I believe, with not only his fans, his publishers, and - to some extent - the author himself inviting comparisons to Pynchon, it's not entirely out of line to illustrate why Pynchon soars while Neal Stephenson fails miserably. While I certainly intend to get into detail below, the overall failing of the book I feel is Stephenson's failure to weave this elaborate linguistic theory into a remotely convincing plot. The details on how this Sumerian language is propagated is extremely complex and well considered (whether it happens to have any basis in fact or not), but nothing else about the plot fits this description. Ultimately, then, \\"Snow Crash\\" reeks of Stephenson pasting someone else's ideas into his work with little apparent motive except to beef up the perceived intellectual validity of an otherwise vapid plot.Getting back to the Sumerian subplot, not only does the idea of this secret language echo TP (Thomas Pynchon, natch), but Stephenson (hereby NS) also interrupts the plot for a great deal of exposition, something TP also likes to do but, in my opinion, the latter enfolds it into the plot with a great deal more finesse than this author. Another example of where a different author succeeds at this approach is with \\"Moby Dick\\": whereas Melville skillfully creates suspense by interrupting the plot at key points in favor of \\"how-to\\" expositions on whaling techniques, NS just switches back and forth every few pages at random, whether a break in the action or (god forbid) a temporary cliff hanger warrants it or not.But here we are dealing with actual writing technique and, this being a work of fairly typical cyberpunk genre fiction, most people reading this are probably going to be far more concerned with the mechanics of the plot than on how it's actually laid out. Well, have no fear: with sketchy character development, implausible action worthy of a Jet Li movie and deus ex machina out the wazoo, there's plenty to fret over for everyone. First of all, the main character's name is \\"Hiro Protagonist\\". Now, this also is the kind of self-aware metafiction moniker TP might use, but at a much lower level of creativity: Pynchon would never go for something so obvious as \\"Hiro Protagonist\\", but again: NS seems to be trying to appeal to people who think the \\"idea\\" of Thomas Pynchon is a gas while finding the actual work of the man itself a bit obtuse. Yes, if Stephenson or his publishers are going to compare themselves to TP they should call this \\"Pynchon for Dummies\\".So you've got Hiro, who is seemingly the world's greatest swordfighter in both the real world and a simulated virtual reality where most people who can afford to do so spend most of their time. Not only that, but Hiro somehow finds time to simultaneously upkeep his skills as one of the greatest hackers in the world while still keeping his day job delivering pizzas for the Mafia. Yes, in this ill-conceived post-apocalyptic world of Stephenson's the Mafia has gotten into the pizza delivery business, and if that pie isn't on your doorstep within thirty minutes flat there's going to be hell to pay. The delivery boxes are even outfitted with a timer so that both the driver and the deliveree have a cinematic visual of the seconds ticking away (of course, people who want a free pizza would simply claim that the timers were set late to benefit the pizza company, making this expenditure a complete waste, but this kind of rationalizing has no place in Stephenson's universe).This world of Stephenson's is barely sketched out in any sense, at one point Hiro telling another character that the Mafia would be breaking the law if there were any laws left to uphold, while that same character's mother is later introduced as working for the government in an almost completely undescribed role. What role would a government have in a society that has decided into anarchy? This is a good example of how NS gets bogged down in creating cheeky, \\"cute\\" little details while letting the overall picture of his world dissipate into the ether. It all sounds amusing as long as A) you don't think too deeply on it, and (most importantly) B) you've never read anyone who does this kind of punk rock dystopia thing better. The problem is, if the story doesn't hold up to even the most stringent analysis it utterly fails at any kind of social commentary, which is the only thing aside from mindless action that \\"Snow Crash\\" would seem to have going for it.And of course I couldn't fail to mention Hiro's sidekick, a fifteen year old female courier who's the modern mall punk's wet dream: a girl who steadfastly scorns authority while at the same time remaining eminently doable (it should be noted for adults with weaker stomachs that, despite her age, this character has consensual sex with someone of obviously adult age during the plot's... ahem, climax).The only other thing I'd like to bring up is a common failing of sci-fi dystopias, that being the error of creating a vastly different physical world taking place well within the lifetime of those currently living/reading. No matter how you incorporate some serious economic collapse, boom, whatever... technology may change but it's never going to be feasible to architecturally gut an entire city - let alone a country - and rebuild it's infrastructure from the ground up within a few years' time, which is apparently the case here (the chronology is as sketchy as anything else in NS' world, but one character is mentioned as having served in Vietnam while both his and Hiro's fathers are mentioned as having been fighting near Hiroshima during WWII when the atomic bomb was dropped).Nothing in the story itself makes any sense, which leaves the enjoyment of \\"Snow Crash\\" solely in the hands of those who brazenly advocate this brand of cyberpunk penis extension fantasy. The book is filled with completely outlandish action sequences, nearly all of which involve technology which seems to have been manufactured solely to suit the characters' needs, not to mention the urge to make the average non-critical reader shout \\"cool!\\" every fifteen seconds (much like the lack of consideration economics play in urban renovation, there seems to be a similar lack of consideration toward how technology develops and is made available to the public; but then, if you're the type of person to believe that military-grade defense equipment will ever be made available to minimum wage slaves - ie. a pizza delivery boy - particularly when only a small portion of the population are even able to afford a PC [as is the case in \\"Snow Crash\\"] than most likely nothing I can say will ever convince you otherwise).Again, I do realize that most people who read this book will be exactly the type of people who go in for this sort of thing, but the bottom line is that \\"Snow Crash\\" is guilty of being touted as some sort of literary achievement when in actuality it's nothing of the kind. That being said, this sort of breezy plot-driven product does have it's fanbase, and if action heavy cyberpunk with minimal intellectual demands is your bag \\"Snow Crash\\" might be right up your alley.PS: lest anyone think I'm not giving Stephenson a fair chance, I'm in the middle of \\"Cryptonomicon\\" right now, and it seems to be succeeding in all the ways \\"Snow Crash\\" failed, so if he doesn't tank somewhere in the latter portions of the book I'll soon have a supportive review of that novel on the way, and from there I'll move on to the \\"Baroque Cycle\\" rather than backtracking. At this point I'm writing \\"Snow Crash\\" off to authorial immaturity and assuming his later works are his best. One way or another, I defy anyone to argue that \\"Snow Crash\\" is anywhere close to the equal of \\"Cryptonomicon\\", and if not why is it still worthy of 4-5 stars???"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Whenever someone's output is described as a romp, that is natures way of saying &#34;don't touch&#34;."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Sentence construction is an art that extends beyond your high school English teacher's boundaries of correct or incorrect. It's necessary, at a basic level, to ensure that a book's readable, but it can be also used as a tool, among other devices, to enrich an author's message. Stephenson's sentences in Snow Crash are so clunky, top-heavy, and distracting that it gave me a headache. The book is further weighed down by poor humor and cheap jabs.I tried hard to like Snow Crash. I thought that maybe if I can get beyond the writing style, I'd find myself immersed into a whole new world of ideas. But after a good bit of effort on my part, I had to give up. Consider this sentence from the opening chapter, which occurs during an action sequence involving high-speed driving:\\"He knows that when he gets to the place on CSV-5 where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured by the pseudo-Gothic stained-glass arches of the local Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise, it's time for him to get over into the right lanes where the retards and the bimbo boxes poke along, random, indecisive, looking at each passing franchise's driveway like they don't know if it's a threat or a promise.\\"Long sentences aren't inherently bad, this one's just awfully constructed. Structurally, the bulk of the sentence revolves around the \\"when...it's time\\" construction. The \\"when\\" leaves the reader anticipating the next clause which will, presumably, complete the thought. But while we're waiting for the completion, we're given an elaborate description of a view of just the corner of a billboard sign. The description is given merely to add a flare of style, since it contains no content that is meaningful to the reader. All of which would be fine if the description were more precise, but instead we're given a lengthy description of these arches and the unnecessarily long name of some irrelevant franchise. Had the sentence just ended there, it would merely have been a terrible sentence. Characteristic of Stephenson's writing, the sentence doesn't end there, elevating it from terrible to excruciating, as the next clause - intended to complete the \\"when...\\" construction - contains an even wordier description of the sort of drivers in the next lane. Not to mention the clumsy \\"it's time for him to get over into the next lane\\", which could easily be swapped for something more efficient, along the lines of maybe \\"he needs to switch lanes\\" - or just with anything that avoids a superfluous \\"it's\\", which immediately takes your mind out of the action by introducing the neutral and meaningless universal subject \\"it\\" smack in the middle of the sentence. Redundant with the previous clause, is another \\"where\\" construction, which is then used as an excuse to dive down a second whole rabbit hole of unnecessary description and detail. Needless to say, the poking and looking actions of passengers in the neighboring lane does a fine job of burying any muddled intentions that the sentence might have had under a thick layer of fresh concrete.All of which, mind you, is simply a thought in the character's head (i.e., \\"He knows that when\\"), and is occurring during what's supposed to be a high-speed action sequence. And all of which begs the question, how can you possibly be emerged in the action as you slide down numerous tangential clauses, or how could care about the technical intention of the sentence (i.e., what he knows) when you're thrown wordy proper nouns, and how could you simultaneously care in the least about billboard signs and retards driving cars, all at the same time?Labyrinthine sentences like these aren't speed bumps on the road, they're 6-inch round potholes and roadblocks. And Snow Crash is filled with them on every page. In them, Stephenson throws practically everything at the reader hoping he or she might bite onto something; you might bite onto pieces of it, but it's at the greater expense of losing everything else along with blocking any possibility of literary flow. No matter how hard I tried my mind was kept at an uncomfortable distance from the text as it stumbled over mindless clauses, unnecessary elaborations, and adjectives that were more distracting than descriptive. It all resulted in a gray unmemorable mess.It's not that Stephenson has bad ideas, it's that he can't effectively get them out on paper. Purchasing an audio version of the book might help, so that someone else has to read the sentences, but it's doesn't make up for the fact that the book's dreadfully written.I was annoyed by other stylistic techniques throughout the book as well. Curse words are sprinkled liberally throughout the narrative to pointless effect. They're used in place of more descriptive adjectives. Perhaps Stephenson used them to give the book a pulpy feel, but even good pulp consists of more than just four-letter words.And lastly Stephenson's humor often borders more on cheap than witty. The example that sticks out the most in my mind is his slang term - \\"bimbo-boxes\\" - for minivans. I don't own a minivan, or particularly sympathize with those who do, it's just a very superficial brand of humor - a cheap-shot at modern society, not particularly well thought-out or clever. Certainly a timeless piece of literature - even if it's farcical - should have higher standards than calling minivan drivers bimbos merely in passing. There are bigger literary fish to fry.This sort of humor pervades the whole book. Sometimes it serves a minor plot or thematic function, but more often it's just mentioned in passing, often replacing qualitative character- or world-building. If that's really what you're looking for then there are plenty liberal political/social commentary books, or go to a leftist protest, or check out a Michael Moore film. Just because it's in a sci-fi book doesn't automatically give this sort of humor more merit. Anyone can do it.I'm sure that there are great ideas in the book - had I read beyond the first eighth of the book, I probably would've come across more of them - but it got to the point where I couldn't imagine how they'd justify the work of clawing through grammatical jungles under the guise of \\"sentences\\" and elongated portions of fluff."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"A quick, cheap gorging but without much satisfaction.First for the good points that earned the book its two stars. The one thing that this book certainly didn't lack was imagination. The world which he has created is strange, bleak, and sarcastic -- and it's somewhat interesting, though not on any &quot;deep&quot; level. It is full of sometimes subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle critiques about the current (meaning 1992) world and the direction in which Stephenson thinks it's heading. There are plenty of reviews here which describe many of the critiques (franchises taking over the world, the absurb beaurocracy of the US government, etc), so I won't delve into them here.The book certainly had that cool techie factor that you'd expect from a cyberpunk novel. A virtual reality &quot;Metaverse&quot;; goggles allowing nightvision, infrared, millimeter-wave radar, ambient-sound processing. A fission-powered, gatling &quot;rail-gun&quot;. There's no shortage of such examples, and they're certainly fun to read about; though they're typically not fully fleshed out or justified in the reader's mind. The tech factor isn't as sophisticated as I'd like (coming from a Computer Science background). There are a few utterly ridiculous examples of future technology (such as the Metaverse representation of Rife's information network as a bunch of big colorful blocks with connections between them), but all in all it's enough to keep the interest of the average techie if he's willing to set aside reality.Bad Parts. Put simply, this book just isn't well written. I'm admittedly no English guru, and I typically criticise a book more on its content than its structure, probably because I'm not familiar enough with good structure. But if someone like me can say that a book wasn't well written, that's probably bad. It completely lacked any sense of flow. It's almost as if he had this story in his head and just regurgitated it onto the page (like a movie script, as some reviewers have pointed out). The whole religious subtext was well researched, but then very sloppily (though imaginatively) laid out. I was particularly disappointed in the end when I expected many of these creative subelements of the story to come together and tie up, and they were just severed.This shouldn't throw you off from reading Neal Stephenson. I'm in the middle of reading his (much more recent) book &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, and it seems the complete opposite of &quot;Snow Crash&quot;. It's much more mature, much better thought out, and with less flash. Honestly that makes it a little boring. I'd love him to find a happy center between these two extremes, but until then I recommend William Gibson."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"yebbi yadu mmmm yum zum hezzzz uhmmm dohj doh doh la la la mumu hehe yaya flim fum fee fi fo fum yetta yebii uhmm doo ya ro so mo no to uammm zummm"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a group of friends and comparisons to William Gibson.William Gibson wove an interesting tale with likeable characters, new ideas, a compelling plot, and smart writing. I list these things mainly because I found the opposite in Neal Stephenson's book.The characters are too one-dimensional to care about or like. The main character, Hiro, always has everything going for him. There's no humanity to the character because of the ever-present Deus ex machina. There's always an easy way out of everything and it makes the character very difficult to like. Other characters are introduced simply as fluff to Hiro's environment and they feel flat and uninteresting like typical comic book characters.Many of the Near Future ideas in this book have been executed better by other authors before Stephenson used them, and they come off as very analog and short-sighted. Things still have plugs and heavy modular parts which don't lend themselves to a feeling of future technology.The plot itself is interesting, but much of the content around the plot is tangent and unrelated. You can read half the book before the plot begins to develop. This would be acceptable if the first half were spent developing the characters or the setting, but I can't say that I believe it was.The writing itself does not even seem to reach a professional level. I don't know if that's the fault of the author or a failure of the editor, but timeframes are not clearly stated, paragraphs have poor or awkward transitions, and the chapters have no smooth segue. The book reads clunky and lacks finesse.Unfortunately, I feel that this is one of the worst books I've invested time in reading. For those that enjoy the books of William Gibson, I recommend you stick to his books, or find a shorter book to read from Stephenson. Your time may be better spent not reading Snow Crash."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"There are a lot of well written reviews for this book, and I'm not going to attempt a thorough review. That would be unfair as I didn't finish the book. But I just wanted to say that I didn't really like it. For some reason I found the style of writing extremely irritating. I think the author tries too hard to write in a cool style, but it ends up as a flashy, verbose, cacophony of words totally obscuring anything in the way of character development or plot. After a while I got so annoyed with the book I couldn't be bothered finishing it and took it back to the library.Some people might like it, but I found it unreadable."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I listened to an audio version of this book. I enjoyed the plot, and the characters were ok. At times, the audio version was hard to follow. This was especially true of the parts pertaining to Sumerians and Judeo-Christian religion, which also didn't hold my interest when they got lengthy. The foundational concept of the book was based on revisionist interpretation of the Bible, which might bother some people."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is my all time favorite in the \\"cyberpunk\\" genre... if you like William Gibson you'll love Neil Stephenson... Stephenson offers the same great \\"feel\\" but with a faster pace and more enjoyable tone.

After witnessing a colleague's biological mind get infected with a computer virus, he and Y.T.--a fifteen year old Kourier--must find a way from stopping the coming infocalypse.This book is dark, dark like a breeze wafting through a freshly napalmed forest. Normally, these kinds of books don't sit well with me. By saying this, it automatically labels me an out of touch, aging fogey who's not down with the sickness like the young, stylish, pimply kids giggling over naked girls on 4Chan. Yeah, kid, I know. I'm old. S'what?The book is dark and there's no getting around it, but it's not compeletly depressing. Why? This book is funny, funny like a wren hitting a patio door. This is William Gibson with a touch of Raymond Chandler. This is what what all near future dystopias (a.k.a. Cypberpunk) should be--unpretentious. It's a modern day world where cliches are taken to such frightening extremes you can't help but laugh. This is subtle humor at its absolute best.The first chapter is brilliant. Never has pizza delivery been so thrilling...or so terrifying if you don't get that 'za delivered in thirty minutes. Unfortunately, after chapter two, things die down a bit. It picks up in the last eighty pages or so, but then the story stops on a peseta leaving you wondering, WTF? Because of this, I only give it four out of five nuke-possessing Russians with poor impulse control.Read the first chapter for free on line, and then buy the book. Love or hate cyberpunk, a man as eloquent as Neal Stephenson can't be ignored."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This book could have been 5 stars.It starts out with a tantalizing introduction to what the internet could well become; a fully immersive 3-D experience where living an alter-life in the web is no more just fantasy. The Metaverse, as it's coined here, is what we all dream the Internet will become. A full-on society where the environment is so rich you are rarely reminded that you are in a virtual world. It is really impressive that Stephenson had the foresight in 1990 to see where the Internet was heading. The 'real-world' in this book is painted as an over-the-top, mega-franchise-controlled, techno-trash, highly-segregrated, over-inflated world. It's ironic that the real-world in this book is so unbelievable while the Metaverse is so believeable.In any case, the book is fun and full of wild ideas. For instance, the central idea of relating religion, viruses and computers is stellar. Also, great insight into the minds of computer hackers and programmers.But, the story steers away from the highly exciting Metaverse and settles for a rather silly, meandering plot taking place mostly in the real world. I think this book could have been a knock-out if it spent more time hanging out in the Metaverse, exploring what this amazing place could be like."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This was the first book I read by Neal Stephenson. Fantastic ideas! You'll say to yourself, \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" Beginning to show its age, as it was written in the age of fledgling networks, but before the age of the Internet. If you don't keep that in mind, you'll wonder why no one is using a web browser in this book. :-) If you do like this book, I'd recommend all the other books by him, up through the first volume of the Baroque cycle. Then his style becomes quite heavy and ponderous, like reading the dictionary."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Ummmm, dunno if I am quite as enthusiastic as Patrick Salsbury, but this is a great read. It is infectious, since it's an easy book to recommend to others, but I don't think my mind has been reprogrammed.If I got nothing more from it, at least I got \\"Bimbo Box.\\"Stephenson develops his own style in this book and continues it today. To suggest that his work is derivative of Gibson is nonsense. All ideas are derivative; it is style and use that make them novel or meaningful.Stephenson can be an easy read, or you can delve deeper into what he is writing and learn something. I love to read him because he includes so many disparate facts that it's like a smorgasbord of knowledge in a tasty format. Like all good novels, a simple telling of his plots ignores that the process is much more important than the product.He tends to think in broad sweeps, usually about pivotal points in history, with an emphasis on science. He loves to have double and triple plotlines going that refer to each other in surprising ways.Airport novel? Sure. In depth teatment? Sure. Great literature? No, but he's approaching it from Cryptonomicon on."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Around half-way through this book, I needed to put it down for a bit. It all seemed a bit too much. Neal Stephenson writes in a way that is shocking. The subject matter is so over the top that it shouldn't make any type of sense. Why would skateboards use harpoons on cars? Who goes to Pizza college? Why does the main character carry a Katana?But it really all does make sense. That's why the book seems overwhelming. The future he paints is so bizzare that it's easy to understand. Unlike Neuromancer with it's &quot;plausible&quot; 1980's view of the future, this book takes the future, puts in everything random and ties it together in a way it all makes sense.Even further, the language in the book is great as well. It's not filled with cursing, like many a cyberpunk book, and it feels upbeat despite the fact it's dystopian. A line that stood out to me in it is where they talk about Rastarfarian gunslingers in Compton. They never went into detail when you read it, but it makes sense.This book is a reccomend for either fans of Cyberpunk, or fans of the obscure, and slightly strange."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Hiro Protagonist, longtime unemployed L.A. hacker and greatest dork on earth, stumbles onto a new form of virus that infects not computers, but people, through their mind. He teams up with the Mafia and Y.T., a skater Kourier, to uncover media magnate L. Bob Rife's plan to enslave the populance and Raven's need for revenge upon America. In the process he digs into Sumerian history, tangles with the merciless Raven several times, and makes his way into the core of Rife's operation. At the same time, Y.T. does a lot of dirty Mafia work, gets kidnapped, and helps Hiro from oceanic lair.Seriously, Hiro is the king of Dorkus. Stephenson is not just otaku, he's a Nipponphile, and Hiro's his Marty Stu: A mostly socially-clueless coder who also considers himself a great swordfighter, carrying his katana and wakizashi everywhere, he spends almost all of his time in the Metaverse, socializing with most on the outside by killing them. Y.T. thinks of him as a total dweeb, but somehow his hacker ex-girlfriend still sees something in him. I think his geekiness amused me throughout the book more than anything else, along with Y.T.'s skater ethos; she almost never loses her cool. Ultimately, it's techno geek wish-fulfillment fantasy done right, and if that appeals to you, this book is for you.Neal Stephenson is the master of interposing hyperdescriptive passages and digressions throughout his novels, but the words flow so well that it doesn't grate too much. They mostly fall in one of three categories: Nifty, yes I know that, and Geez I don't care!, with an occasional no way pal. The book could never quite decide whether to be treatise or thriller, but by the end I did have a (very) specific idea of how he envisioned the future, and that contributed quite a bit to the story's flair. (Note: Chaps. 56 & part of 57 are 10 pages summarizing the events so far, should have been cut and should be skipped.)A few complaints about the end... no spoilers. Where does the US President come from and why? He does nothing. Why did Uncle Enzo not think about Raven bringing glass knives when that was discussed only hours ago? What happened to Raven's H-bomb? I think a few plot threads got lost in all that.And, you know, this is cyberpunk. I could take major issue with quite a few of the silly or mistaken assumptions, like the total ignoring of sustainable economies, or the fact that revivalism started here in mid-1700's in a movement called the Great Awakening, but I don't take it all seriously. I was irritated at some of the streams of raw historical/lingual information in the middle of the book, but the subject matter did interest me quite a bit. I love the way Stephenson can weave widely different disciplines into compelling stories and technologies. There is a lot of everything jam-packed in here, and while it's a tangle to sort out, it is enlightening and hugely entertaining once you do. I couldn't put it down for long. Definitely better and more expansive than its sequel, Diamond Age."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Stephenson combines fascinating vision with action and comedy beautifully. This book is awesome."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Interesting idea... but.. and this is a huge but... there is very, very little character development... no matter what the genre... if an author doesn't give a character a personality that I can delve into and go with I am bored, bored, bored with pages of technostuff no matter how brilliant. I like a lot of genre's, a good book is a good book. Snow Crash lacks characters that are anything more than a cookie cutter stamped out image.. this is the bad guy, this is the good guy, this is the chick.... not enough for me... sorry."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"Neal Stephenson's vision is of an American West Coast where the United States government barely exists, gated communities have become nation states, Admiral Jim and General Bob provide private military services at very reasonable rates, and the Mafia and the CIA have become multinational corporations. It's a characteristically cyberpunk dystopic view of the future, with a smile.He builds delivers this vision with a wealth of detail and a population of characters matched by pretty much no other science fiction writer out there, save the master himself William Gibson. However, after the first few chapters, I had to begin wondering, with the collapse of all central authorities in North America, just how is this society hanging together? How is it that the plethora of nations, corporations, and in betweens do simple things without a hitch, like spend each others' money? If we could sit down with Stephenson and has this out, maybe we could get some pretty convincing answers. But those answers are not provided here, so the impressive wealth of detail eventually looks like a thin veneer covering we know not what.Stephenson's marvelously convoluted story involves ancient Sumerian religion, a corporate chain of Pentecostal churches, viruses of the biological and logical varieties, hackers, Julian Jaynes's ideas about the evolution of human consciousness (delineated several years back in \\"The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind\\"), all involved in the mysterious nefarious plottings of a Texas oil magnate who has recently purchased the decommissioned U.S.S. Enterprise at a Navy public auction. You couldn't ask for a better premise.But a great premise is only a premise. Stephenson's handling of religions and mythologies both ancient and modern is superficial at best and quite often inaccurate, particularly with respect to the Hebrew prophets and the modern day Pentecostals. This would all be OK since \\"Snow Crash\\" is, after all, \\"just a story.\\" But if Stephenson didn't intend for us to take this material seriously, he would have done better to cut the pages of ponderous dialog we get from his characters on ancient Sumerian mythology down by a factor of about five.Violence is fairly pervasive in \\"Snow Crash\\" and not terribly well done. You really don't want your high school kids reading this book. Stephenson seems to be going here for a literary version of the kind of hip crimson artistry you can see in the early John Woo films. But he generally produces instead a literary equivalent of a thirteen year old's M rated video game fantasy.In summary, \\"Snow Crash\\" has its moments. There is no doubt that Stephenson can write. But too much blood and too much superficial cereberalism really mar the development of a promising premise."},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"This is one of my new favorite books! How could a cyberpunk lover such as myself not have read this until now?The plot is cool, the descriptions are cool, most of the characters are really engaging. I love how they talk to each other, and I especially love this day after tomorrow world. I can see so much of it already in our present circumstances. Really creative and yet well thought-out.The author has also predicted a ton of stuff before even the internet was really public: secondlife, google earth, avatars (the name avatar actually comes from this book, not the other way around.) And he has a good read on the music scene too.My only slight complaint is he maybe hit me too hard over the head with the Sumerian stuff, which I pretty much figured out the point in 2 seconds and did not need more than one chapter backing his plot devise up. Also the antagonist could have been better (I'm talking about Raven not the other guy).

This is a problem as all pizzas must be delivered within 30 minutes or all you know what happens. Shouldn't be a problem as he has 10 minutes to cover 12 miles. At least it's not a problem until he drives into an empty swimming pool short of his delivery spot.Y.T. who is a Kourier who was pooning (short version of harpoon which is explained in the book) his vehicle prior to the crash comes to the rescue and delivers his pizza on time thus setting up a relationship of both people running into each other at opportune times to help each other out.Hiro is also a computer hacker and according to himself the \\"Greatest Sword Fighter in the World\\".The adventure soon starts when an unknown enemy releases a virus called Snow Crash that incapacitates hackers like Hiro and turns regular people into babbling slaves.This all ties into the millennium old Sumerian Race and Religion having to do with everyone's base memory (core memory in computer circles).There is a metaverse where anyone with a computer can be anybody they want to be through their created avatar. In this environment Hiro lives in a posh house versus his real world digs which is a 20 by 30 storage unit he shares with a buddy.Both Hiro and Y.T. are on a collision course with the bad guys which includes Raven (maniac with a nuclear bomb attached to his motorcycle), Lagos (fellow hacker and miscreant) and L.

Anyhow, this is the book that hooked me and my momentum lasted through Zodiac, Diamond Age, and Crypto. All of those books are excellent. Lately Stephenson has suffered from what almost every successful author suffers from...a timid or non-existant editor. They write too much and no one can seem to tell them what bits work and what bits don't. With Reamde I see traces of the old Stephenson coming back though he is quite not there yet.

What is higher than highly recommended? I order you to read it!:)"},{"Title":"Snow Crash","review":"I heard several good things about this book and decided to check it out. It had a lot of interesting ideas, but had more than its fair share of problems as well.CharactersThe book follows two characters, Hiro Protagonist (yes, that is actually his name) and Y.T. Hiro is a 30 year old hacker who is also an expert swordsman. Hiro begins the story as a pizza delivery man for the worlds foremost pizza company, which is little more than an organized Mafia. Y.T. is a kourier who delivers packages for anyone who needs them to be delivered. Y.T. is 15 years old, and it shows a little in her viewpoints. But there were also several times when she seemed older than she was.SettingThe book is set in the U.S. in the future when our current system of government has pretty much fallen apart. The world is run by various corporations and military groups. A large part of this book revolves around the Metaverse, which is essentially a very advanced version of the internet. This was interesting as the book was written in 1992 and a lot of the aspects of the Metaverse described in this book are very similar to things that we're seeing online now.PlotThe plot was the weakest part of the book for me. The essential goal of the plot is to prevent a religious group from getting a stranglehold on more of the world through the use of a new drug called Snow Crash. My problem with the plot was that it jumped around a lot and didn't really get to the overall story plot until well over halfway through the book. This may be because the book was written 20 years ago and the technology used in the book needed more explanation than it does today. When it was first written it might not have had this problem, but 20 years later this doesn't work as well, which may just be an inherent problem with writing cyberpunk.EnjoymentI really liked some aspects of this book. Some parts were really interesting, and some of the ideas were stellar. However, I think it jumps around far too much and never really materializes into a solid story.Overall GradeNeat ideas, but seemed a little dated.5/10This and all of my other reviews are also posted on my blog.

I loved puzzles as a child and spent many hours for fun working the problems in this book (which may have paved the way for my PhD in Computer Science). I fished out my old copy recently to show my 11 year old daughter how I spent my spare hours as a child - *not* playing computer games of dubious educational value. I am sure that working the problems in this book helped increase my problem solving skills - in a different and more general way than I was learning in school.Of all the puzzle books and puzzles I ever owned, this is the only one I saved. The book has a wide variety of types of puzzles (not all involve numbers). While some are easy, most were challenging. The descriptions were charming, with Russian names of children and towns and quaint puzzle descriptions involving wells, or steam engines or household objects. All in all, a delightful, very educational puzzle collection."},{"Title":"The Moscow Puzzles: 359 Mathematical Recreations (Dover Recreational Math)","review":"Nice collection of problems which demand some creativity as well as varying degrees of mathematical prowess. Also populated with interesting anedotes regarding mathematicians throughout history.Although no mathematics beyond the high school level is required, the challenge lies in the ingenious application of even the most rudimentary math and logic necessary to successfully tackle these exercises. The problems range from rather simple to difficult. Some amount to raw logic riddles requiring little or no math while others offer the opportunity to fine tune one's skills in geometry and algebra. In addition to offering a rich variety of problems which will satisfy the needs of puzzlists at many levels, the editors have made a good point of dividing the problems into categories emphasizing different sets of skills including geometry, algebra, arithmetic operations, spatial visualization and logic. Such a delineation makes it easy evaluate strengths and weaknesses so you can focus on areas of improvement.Given the long history of this publication, several problems will be familiar to some seasoned puzzle enthusiasts but most will still provide a fresh challenge."},{"Title":"The Moscow Puzzles: 359 Mathematical Recreations (Dover Recreational Math)","review":"I greatly enjoy mathematical puzzles and brain teasers and regularly look for good puzzle books out there.

I liked it so much that I used to keep it in my car and solve riddles whenever I had to wait for someone. It is a great resource for all teachers; children are suddenly made quiet when you present a puzzle to them.I especially like the stick puzzles, where you can distribute a number of matches to students (by the way, it works with kids, teenagers and adults alike) and give them a puzzle. The advantage of this kind of puzzle is that you can give additional tasks to those fast-solvers; you do not have a story behind it.The organization of the book is excellent; it is divided by difficulty levels as well as by type of puzzle. For example, you have different levels of geometry problems and of sticks problems.Great book!"},{"Title":"The Moscow Puzzles: 359 Mathematical Recreations (Dover Recreational Math)","review":"As a 7th grade math teacher, I use problems from this bookto supplement my gifted pre-algebra classes, and to providea challenge to my math teams.

She prefers elemental language---hers is a hard-body and athletic poetry---but her sparsity never short-changes emotional impact, borealistic or far subtler. To wit, from \\"Youth;\\"\\"My sister and I at two ends of the sofa,reading (I suppose) English novels.The television on; various schoolbooks open,or places marked with sheets of lined paper.Euclid, Pythagoras. As though we had looked intothe origin of thought and preferred novels.\\"Her subject matter, if not the whole of the world and us in it, frequently takes the form of love---real love, passionate love, the opiate kind come riding zephyrs, powerful enough to border hystericism, such is its biological power. This focus also includes at times the unhappy aftermath, such as is found in \\"The Balcony\\":\\"It was a night like this, at the end of summer.We had rented, I remember, a room with a balcony.How many days and nights? Five, perhaps-no more.Even when we weren't touching we were making love.We stood on our little balcony in the summer night.And off somewhere, the sounds of human life.We were the soon to be anointed monarchs,well disposed to our subjects. Just beneath us,sounds of a radio playing, an aria we didn't in those years know.Someone dying of love. Someone from whom time had takenthe only happiness, who was alone now,impoverished, without beauty.The rapturous notes of an unendurable grief, of isolation and terror,the nearly impossible to sustain slow phrases of the ascending figures-they drifted out over the dark waterlike an ecstasy.Such a small mistake. And many years later,the only thing left of that night, of the hours in that room.\\"We get the whole of it: the event experienced, the event witnessed, the event's ramifications as prophecy, and finally the unretainable ecstasy and brutal wisdom of the high-country moment, returned to everyday living, so far as possible. Contrary to unpopular opinion, Gl&uuml;ck's latest work makes the most of idea and philosophy and pleasure, embodied in its paced and quiet understatement, signifying its origins in the truly genuine. The Seven Ages rings with the sharp strike of the authentic, rarely sinking into the echoes of sentimentality.Really, is another round of balloting necessary to induct Gl&uuml;ck into a mythical poetry hall of fame? This one goes on the first ballot.Read the book. More ripe delights await."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Let's break this down. Louise Gluck's reputation precedes her poetry, so much so that I persuaded myself into buying this book, sayiing \\"It must be good.\\"There are good lines:\\"Time was moving in one direction, like a wave liftingthe whole house, the whole village.\\"but the same poem (Radium) includes the shockingly cliche and ineffective:\\"we were growing up. Butit wasn't something you decided to do;it was something that happened, somethingyou couldn't control.\\"Really, Gluck? You give us an absolute gorgeous poem like \\"Ancient Text\\" in which \\"night and day, angels were/ discussing my meanings. Night and Day, I revised my appeals...I spoke only to angels.\\" More gorgeous lines like \\"when I didn't move I was more perfect.\\"Really, Gluck? You couldn't give us consistently good poems? Her strength--her simplicity, the way she constructs lightning-quick intelligent statements--ultimately turns into her weakness: flat, meaningless lines that sink into their own prosaic predictability. Some of the reviews for some reason mention Plath. I wouldn't want Gluck to go that far in her style (I'm not a fan of Plath's--shoot me). But in this collection, I could have done with more energy and not so many declarative monotonous poems.I was disappointed in this collection, though there are some great poems in here. Buy if you can, get a copy of it cheap and read poems like \\"Summer at the Beach,\\" \\"Ancient Texts\\" \\"Youth\\" and \\"Ripe Peach\\" and \\"Unpainted Door.\\"We must have higher standards for ourselves, though I really admire her commitment to intellectualism--a rarity in contemporary American poetry.Better luck next time, Louise."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"The Seven Ages is another amazing collection by Louise Gluck. Disagreeing with what is said in the blurb of my Carcanet edition, which says this book is the \\"strangest\\" and \\"most bold\\" (to date of publication), a lot of poems in The Seven Ages are relatively more accessible than those in Wild Iris.Readers have to slow down to read Louise Gluck to enjoy how the poet inserts pauses and controls the rhythm of her works, therefore focusing on the key element on each line, be it a verb, a noun, or even a punctuation mark. This is what I fall in love with her poetry after reading A Village Life, her latest full-length collection. I could allow myself some quiet time and be guided by her craft and wisdom.The first half of the book contains many strong pieces, while a few in the second half (which I less like) are a bit convoluted or could further be tightened in my personal views. Yet, just reading how Gluck opens her poems and the way she jungles simple poetic diction is enlightening. My favorite examples from The Seven Ages include:\\"I even loved a few times in my disgusting human way / and like everyone I called that accomplishment\\" (\\"The Seven Ages\\")\\"And from out of nowhere lovers came, / people who still had bodies and hearts. Who still had / arms, legs, mouths, although by day they might be / housewives and businessmen.\\" (\\"Moonbeam\\")\\"Familiar, recognizable, but much more deeply alone, more despondent. / She does not, in her view, meet the definition / of child, a person with everything to look forward to.\\" (\\"Birthday\\")\\"We had only a few days, but they were very long.\\" (\\"The Destination\\")\\"Even when we weren't touching we were making love.\\" (\\"The Balcony\\")\\"Sickness, gray rain. The dogs slept through it. They slept on the bed, / at the end of it, and it seems to me they understood / about childhood: best to remain unconscious.\\" (\\"Time\\")I would like to say particularly how much I love the Carcanet edition I have ordered. The book is slimmer than usual and the fonts are smaller , but it is exactly why I love Gluck's poetry more - compact, solid, something you hold in your hand, but you have to look up from the book, gazing into distance to think about what she really wants you to know about words."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Louise Gl&uuml;ck's 2001 poetry collection The Seven Ages features the style readers have come to expect from her: a somewhat simple writing style, a confessional style, and a strong point of view. The collection opens with several poems dedicated to the travails of growing older. The regret of forgotten dreams and the realization of death dominate the first quarter of the collection and infuse throughout the collection.However, Gl&uuml;ck's obsession with growing older brings her back to childhood the topic of much of the rest of the collection. It is through her childhood memories that Gl&uuml;ck recognizes the unmovable force of time. In \\"Radium,\\" Gl&uuml;ck writes:\\"And then fall was gone, the year was gone.We were changing, we were growing up. Butit wasn't something you decided to do;it was something that happened, somethingyou couldn't control.\\"This glimpse into childhood and the loss of times gone by is something of which everyone can relate from young adults to senior citizens.Permeating through the entirety of the collection is nature and the impact on our memories. In \\"Ripe Peach,\\" Gl&uuml;ck celebrates the joys of life through the simple enjoyment of a ripe piece of fruit. In \\"Copper Beech,\\" Gl&uuml;ck remembers her childhood through a single tree from her childhood home. In fact, the tree finds its way into a few other poems to resonate its importance.The overarching themes of Gl&uuml;ck's collection make it a nice read with no really jarring changes in theme. Gl&uuml;ck experiments a little with style but nothing overly experimental."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Louise Gluck has quietly become one of our greatest poets, building an impressive, meticulous body of work since the mid-1970s. The fact that she's also a winner of just about every major poetry award, pales in comparison to the naked searching, the brave confrontations, and the hard-won, deeply resonant wisdom her poems uncover. Deceptively simple, Gluck's diamond-cut lines encompass a vocabulary refined to the simplest -- purest -- of objects and emotions, that when repeated gain a kind of elusive, opaque mystery. Whether the subject is herself, her older sister, her lovers, time, memory, desire, or death, the cumulative effect is nearly catechismal -- and, indeed, reading Gluck is like going to church."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Louise Gluck's latest collection of poems reveal a new cadence to her voice.There is a directness of speech and lack of opacity which is new to her work.The poems as previously in her work inhabit the world of the reflective thoughtful person sighing in the noisy world .Memories and feelings for the past ,present and future beg to have sense made of them.I was struck by the description of seemingly endless days spent in her childhood on Long Island where time almost began to cease to exist.This is an excellent book don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Louise Gluck never backs off--she takes risks.

It isn't bad, but it isn't something that I'd recommend anyone run out and buy."},{"Title":"The Seven Ages","review":"Louise Gluck's last book, Vita Nova, had a spare brilliance about it, like a brightly lit room. One knew one was in the country of love newly discovered and savored, lost and comemorated. Yet the poems of The Seven Ages, it would seem from a selection of 18 poems in the January-February 2001 American Poetry Review, have cluttered a landscape that gave pleasure for its having changed little. The dominant theme or subject is difficult to determine given poems about family, unrequited love and nature as metaphor for adolescent pain. This would not be a problem if the quality were consistent throughout. The nearly religious tone one has come to expect in Gluck's poems dealing with identity and nature is present, and in excellent form. &quot;The windows shut, the sun rising./ Sounds of a few birds,/ the garden filmed with a light moisture./ And the insecurity of great hope/ suddenly gone./ And the heart still alert.&quot; (&quot;The Muse of Happiness&quot;) But this same minute description of things that seem motionless and graceful undoes itself in a different poem when it is followed by uncharacteristically vague language. &quot;The curtains parted. Light/ coming in. Moonlight, then sunlight./ Not changing because time was passing/ but becuase the one moment had many aspects.&quot; (&quot;Island&quot;) It seems we should be impressed by this transformation of moonlight to sunlight, but what are the conditions that would allow it to do so? Some of the colleciton's best poems would probably be those about the relationship between two sisters. They threaten, at times, to dive over the edge into a simple indictment of a painful childhood, as in the poem &quot;Mother and Child.&quot; But it is Gluck's description that maintains the reader's interest, as in lines about nail-polish:&quot;My sister shook the bottle. The orange/ kept sinking to the bottom; maybe/ that was the problem./ She shook it over and over, held it up to the light,/ studied the words in the magazine.&quot; (&quot;August&quot;) After a trim collection like Vita Nova, which was wrongly passed up for any of the three major literary awards (The National Book Award, The Pulitzer and The National Book Critics Circle Award), one would expect a similar follow-up, concise and richly suggestive. The Seven Ages may turn out to be disappointingly uneven."},{"Title":"Month-By-Month Gardening in the Mid-Atlantic","review":"At first glance, the book seems to be nicely organized, with month-by-month information for various types of plants/tasks. However, finding information about a particular plant can be frustrating, as the index is inadequate, and not detailed enough. For example, the index for azaleas contains a list of 27 different page numbers, which are not sub-indexed. This group of 27 pages actually covers a large section of azaleas as houseplants, and azaleas as shrubs. It would have been easier to find the information I was looking for if the index had listed \\"azaleas: houseplants\\" and then \\"azaleas: shrubs\\". Other plants suffer similar indexing fates.Another gripe is the lack of any easily found index information for pests or for weeds. I recently moved from the West coast, and have found that most of the pests and weeds are completely different. In fact, I have no idea what a \\"chinch bug\\" looks like, and this book leaves me in complete ignorance. The book mentions a chinch bug several times, but nowhere is there a picture, nor can I find chinch bug in the index.Likewise, I cannot find a picture of, for example, nutgrass. Nutgrass is mentioned a few times, but alas, this book fails to help me learn how to identify it.Overall, I am truly sorry that I spent money on this book."},{"Title":"Month-By-Month Gardening in the Mid-Atlantic","review":"I just moved to Maryland from a quite different climate and was unsure how to deal with the changing seasons in this part of the country.

Is it okay to plant ANYTHING this time of year? What about preparing my garden for the winter? How do I deal with humid summers?

While capturing the wonder of Europe's Renaissance \\"discoveries,\\" the book does not romanticize these voyages, plagued as they were by starvation, scurvy, mutiny, and inhumanity toward the new lands' native inhabitants. Even as the world map grew larger and more accurate, myths stubbornly persisted, whether in the form of Columbus's continued belief that he'd reached the Indies or Vasco de Gama's insistence that the Hindus he met in India were Christians.

His books communicated great truths in an understandable manner. His last book, released almost a year after his death is no exception. With grace and gentleness, yet with a passion for the truth of Scripture, he examines evangelicalism today. His conclusion is that we have lost much of the Gospel in our churches. The lives of many Christians differ very little from the world around us! He looks back to the truths of Scripture that transformed the church during the Reformation, and says that we must return to them if we hope and truly long for revival today. We need to recover the great Reformation and Biblical doctrines of Scripture Alone, Grace Alone, Faith Alone and Glory to God Alone.Here's a sample:\\"No people ever rise higher than their idea of God. Conversely, the loss of the sense of God's high and awesome character always leads to the loss of a people's highest ideals, moral values, and even what we commonly call humanity, not to mention the loss of understanding and appreciation for the most essential Bible doctrines...We deplore the breakdown of moral standards in the church, even among its most visible leaders. But what do we think should happen when we have focused on ourselves and our own, often trivial needs rather than on God, ignoring his holiness and excusing our most blatant sins? To listen to many contemporary sermons one would think man's chief end is to glorify himself and cruise the malls.\\" (pp. 151-152).Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace? is a much-needed reminder of what we should again believe, and why it matters."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"Whatever Happened To The Gospel of Grace?\\" is exactly the sort of book you might expect a traditional, Reformed pastor and theologian to leave as his final message to the world, for before this book was published, James Boice, long-time pastor of Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia went to be with the Lord. This book stands as a call to the church to rediscover the principles upon which the Protestant church was built. It was Boice's conviction that much of what passes as Christianity today is anything but. The church will only be able to be an effective witness for God when it returns to the foundation of the five solas that defined the Reformation (Scripture alone, Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone, glory to God alone).The book begins with a critical examination of the modern evangelical church. The author shows that where the evangelical church was once known for and defined by what it believed, today it is increasingly defined by its style. He is especially critical of the church growth movement, saying that this movement adjusts Christianity to the desires of our culture. The modern church does not understand that Christianity can only thrive by offering people not what \\"they already have, but what they so desperately lack - namely, the Word of God and salvation through Jesus Christ.\\" His thesis (found on page 36) is that \\"the chief problem [with the church] is that we have forgotten God and are not really living for His glory...the reason we do not think about Him is that we have forgotten the meaning and importance of these essential doctrines.\\" The doctrines he refers to are, of course, the five solas.He turns to an examination of the pattern of this age. He shows how the world's patterns of secularism, humanism, relativism, materialism and pragmatism have infiltrated the church. Perhaps even worse is the onset of mindlessness where people in the world and in the church no longer use their minds, deliberately choosing ignorance as a way of life. Set against these principles are the absolutes of the Reformation which need to be related to our culture in a new and relevant way.The bulk of the book is dedicated to an examination of each of the five principles. Each section is a fascinating, Scriptural study. Though he is a theologian, Boice was primarily a pastor and thus a great communicator. He relates difficult principles in a way that the laity can understand and not become overwhelmed.Having related the principles, Boice spends the final section discussing their application to our worship and to our lives. I found this section disappointing and for a time was almost convinced that it had been written by a different author. Where the first part of the book praised the Reformers, this section lauded the pope and Brother Lawrence. It also seemed to end very suddenly without tying the ideas together and providing a satisfactory conclusion.Regardless of my annoyances with final section I highly recommend this book. Boice left behind a thought-provoking study of the principles upon which the Protestant church was founded. He provides a respectful but at times necessarily harsh call for churches to re-examine their principles and determine if they truly are living for God's glory alone."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Boice's book titled &quot;Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace?&quot; It is a well-written indictment of the Church that we have strayed too far from the doctrines that brought about the Reformation of the 16th century.As noted, the section on the Five Solas was outstanding.I was struck by one particular aspect of the book early on. In it, Boice recounts Luther's objection to the Peasant War, and in objecting, Luther notes that reformation would come as follows:non vi, sed verboNot by force, but by the power of God's Word. That is how reformation will come today. Not by political clout or by enacting laws. True reformation starts from the bottom and works its way up; or better yet, from the inside out.soli Deo gloria,"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"This book by Dr. Boice (Ph.D., Basel, Switzerland) was a rich, fresh read for those suffocated by pluralism and relativism. When looking at the decay at the world, one is excited to read that the same decay was present before the Reformation. Dr. Boice expouses the same hope for today.Dr. Boice expounds the five reformational creeds (Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Sola Scriptura, Solus Christus, and Soli Deo GLoria), the impact that they had on their world, and the possible impact that they can have on our world. Boice notes the dangers that plague our churches and our homes, relativism and pragmatism, and how each of these creeds, immersed in Scripture, provide the elixir for our dying land. Also with these Scripture Creeds, he shows the impact that Reformation minded saints can transform society.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is not as deep as many of these type of works (as scholarly as he is, Boice is a pastor and communicates as one), making it a readable work that can be read in a busy schedule."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"Anyone wanting a good introduction to the doctrines of grace from a Reformed and Calvinistic perspective must look here. It is reliable and easy to read. It is geared towards the laity so anyone can pick it up and read it. The section on the 5 solas of the Reformation is very well-written."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"This was the last book Pastor Boice wrote before his death in June 2000 and if I must say so he really left us with a another jewel. His book, \\"Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace?\\", is divided into three parts and it's almost like getting three books in one volume. Part One (Our Dying Culture) is a straight forward, no nonsense critical analysis of our modern evangelical church. Boice describes a church that spends more time developing programs designed toward success (does it work?) and messages that are focused on the congregation's felt need and a dedication to growing a mega-church instead of fulfilling God's calling by protecting and feeding the flock of God through the Word of God. He contends the focus of the church has been turned inward, becoming a man-centered business rather than God-centered worshipers, rightly giving God alone the glory (soli Deo gloria). Boice's criticism becomes stern at times in this section. But anyone familiar with Pastor Boice, personally or through his writings, knows this is just a reflection of his great pastor's heart.Just like an epistle, after carefully pointing out the problems in the modern church, he moves into Parts Two and Three describing the practical remedy to a lost and wandering church. Part Two (Doctrines that Shook the World) covers the five \\"solas\\" of the Reformation (Scripture Alone, Christ Alone, Grace Alone, Faith Alone and Glory to God Alone). Boice was at his best in this section section, providing one of the clearest, most concise and biblically supported study of this area of theology I have read. He dedicates a chapter to each of the solas. I especially appreciate his use of the relevant texts, focused explanations, and very effective applications of each principle.After completing an excellent doctrinal section, Boice moves into Part Three (The Shape of Renewal)which is his application of the first two sections. I enjoyed parts of this last section, but not as much as the first two. Boice allows his personal preferences to really come to the forefront and this section will probably draw most of the criticism of the book. This section has a number of worthwhile parts and takes on more of an outline format, especially Chapter Nine, which I found to be the most helpful area of Part Three. For whatever reason, I felt Boice lost his focus in Chapter Eight and wandered around a little in his presentation of different aspects of true worship, which will be what I think is the most controversial part of the book. I have already noticed one reviewer really took exception to the information in this chapter.Overall, this was an excellent book and a worthwhile read and addition to any library. It's not written beyond the younger Christian, nor too shallow for the more mature Christian, either. I recommend this book. Part Two alone is worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"On June 15, 2000, God took James Montgomery Boice home to glory. He left behind some great books. His final book, however, which was actually published after his promotion, could not have been more appropriate or a more fitting legacy. Titled Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace? with the added subtitle Rediscovering the Doctrines That Shook the World, this book well addresses the contemporary church and how it has drifted far from its biblical and historical foundations.In Part 1, Boice outlines the problem in two chapters: \\"The New Pragmatism\\" and \\"The Pattern of this Age.\\" He masterfully demonstrates how secularism, humanism, relativism, materialism, and pragmatism have not only infiltrated the church but have now inundated it (my words). It is his contention, and I think it impossible to refute him, is that the church as a whole is, in virtually every area, embracing the world's wisdom, theology, agenda, and methods (his words). That sets the stage for what follows.Part 2, \\"The Doctrines That Shook the World,\\" is the heart of the book. In five chapters, Boice lays out in wonderful detail the five solas of the Reformation. Concerning \\"Scripture Alone\\" (sola scriptura), he writes:\\"The most serious issue [facing the church today], I believe, is the Bible's sufficiency. Do we believe that God has given us what we need in this book? Or do we suppose that we have to supplement the Bible with human things? Do we need sociological techniques to do evangelism, pop psychology and pop psychiatry for Christian growth, extra-biblical signs or miracles for guidance, or political tools for achieving social progress and reform?\\" (p. 72)Concerning \\"Christ Alone\\" (Solus Christus), after discussing three essential words for understanding what the Cross was about--satisfaction, sacrifice, and substitution--Boice then concludes:\\"It has been a popular idea in some theological circles that the Incarnation is the important truth of Christianity . . . and that the Atonement is something like an afterthought. . . . To focus on the birth of Jesus apart from the Cross leads to false sentimentality and neglect of the horror and magnitude of sin. . . . Any \\"gospel\\" that talks merely about the Christ-event, meaning the Incarnation without the Atonement, is a false gospel. Any gospel that talks about the love of God without showing that love led him to pay the ultimate price for sin in the person of his Son on the Cross, is a false gospel. The only true gospel is the gospel of the \\"one mediator\\" who gave himself for us (1 Tim. 2: 5, 6). If our churches are not preaching this gospel, they are not preaching the gospel at all, and if they are not preaching the gospel, they are not true churches. Evangelicalism desperately needs to rediscover its roots and recover its essential biblical bearing . . .\\" (p. 105)I was very glad for what I read in \\"Grace Alone (sola gratia) concerning Jonathan Edwards' contribution to the \\"free will\\" debate in his book The Freedom of the Will, in which he actually proved it is not free. As Boice recounts, while most people think the will is its own entity and therefore free to make a choice, Edwards viewed the will as part of the mind, which means that we choose what the mind thinks is most desirable. Boice goes on to further report that Edwards discussed not only the mind but also motives, which drive the mind to choose the things that are best. The crux again, however, is that man's mind does not want God or His sovereign rule because he doesn't think that is better. He wants his sin and invariably chooses it because he thinks that is better.Of \\"Faith Alone\\" (sola fide) Boice addresses today's abandonment of the very essence of true, biblical faith:\\"For many evangelicals faith is only mental assent to certain doctrines. It is something we exercise once at the start of our Christian lives, after which we can live more or less in any way we please. It does not matter in terms of our salvation whether or not this \\"faith\\" makes a difference. Some evangelicals even teach that a person could be saved and secure if he or she possessed a dead or dying faith or, incredible as this seems, if he or she apostatizes, denying Christ. In contrast to such an eviscerated faith, throughout church history most Bible teachers have insisted that saving, biblical faith has three elements: \\"knowledge, belief, and trust,\\" as Spurgeon put it; \\"awareness, assent, and commitment,\\" as D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones said\\" (pp. 137-138).Concerning \\"Glory to God Alone\\" (Soli Deo Gloria), Boice writes:\\"No people ever rise higher than their idea of God. Conversely, the loss of the sense of God's high and awesome character always leads to the loss of a people's highest ideals, moral values, and even what we commonly call humanity, not to mention the loss of understanding and appreciation for the most essential Bible doctrines. . . . We deplore the breakdown of moral standards in the church, even among its most visible leaders. But what do we think should happen when we have focused on ourselves and our own, often trivial needs rather than on God, ignoring his holiness and excusing our most blatant sins? To listen to many contemporary sermons one would think man's chief end is to glorify himself and cruise the malls\\" (pp. 151-152).Part 3, \\"The Shape of Renewal,\\" offers two chapters--\\"Reforming Our Worship\\" and \\"Reforming Our Lives\\"--that challenge us to renounce the \\"circus\\" atmosphere and the \\"what's in it for me\\" attitude that pervades today's churches and return to true Christian worship. While there are a couple of things in this section that bothered me--such as a praising of Brother Lawrence, for example--these do not diminish the pointed and powerful challenge for reformation. As for the individual Christian, Boice challenges in that last chapter that\\"the five areas in which the lives of today's Christians most need renewal are: 1) a fresh awareness of God's presence, 2) repentance, 3) an ordering of our lives by that which is invisible, 4) Christian community, and 5) Christian service. Significantly, these things will be developed in us as we begin to recover and actually live by the essential doctrines that I have been exploring in this book: [the five solas]\\" (p. 192).I cannot recommend this book highly enough and strongly encourage every Christian (especially leaders) to read it, heed its warning, and follow its counsel. As Boice writes, \\"I would like to see the beginning of a new Reformation in our day, and I hope you would like to see it too and are praying for it\\" (p. 65). Well, our dear brother did not live to see it. Perhaps we will. Are you praying for it?Dr. J. D. WatsonPastor-Teacher and author"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"I want to quote just a phrase here. \\"Most evangelicals will affirm inerrancy. But many evangelicals have abandoned the Bible all the same simply because they do not think it is adequate for the challenges we face today. They do not think it is sufficient for winning people to Christ in this age, so they turn to felt-need sermons or entertainment for \\"signs and wonders\\" instead.Todays' Evangelicals cannot be differentiated from Liberals or secularism. The word of God is despised by Evangelicals not by the world. They try to attract people by tools of the world not by the Bible."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"This book was a great help in solidifying my views of the 5 Solas of Scripture (Scripture alone, Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone, glory to God alone). These 5 views shook the world of Luther and Calvin's day and I believe with a firm, renewed grasp of them, a new Reformation can take place to re-establish them to the place of prominence they deserve to be in.Also, as a side note, I have purchased 2 copies of this book and given them away and will be purchasing another one to hopefully keep for myself to re-read again."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"Others have written in depth about why this book is an essential read. I will only add that you can trust James Boice to present the Gospel and not something else.... Too many popular Christian authors have detoured into \\"emerging church\\" tangents and have clearly forgotten that the real answers are not going to be found in sociological or political philosophies that are melded into a seeker-friendly message. Boice is on solid ground here and like a good friend he will not steer you in the wrong direction.This book is an essential counterpoint to all the emerging church nonsense floating around out there. The Gospel of Grace is all you need and Boice presents it to you here."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"\\"Whatever Happened to the Gospel of Grace?\\" is one of James Montgomery Boice's final books. He wrote it in response to what he believed to be the ignorance of God and neglect of the gospel of grace as the root problem of the church today. Instead of a focus on God and His gospel, the church has become focused on worldly success-large memberships, large budgets, programs up the wazoo, a nosedive in worship. Boice's belief was that only a return to the Word of God can change the state of today's church.Boice felt that the major emphasis of this change should be centered around the five foundational truths of the Protestant Reformation; that is, the modern church must have as its central confession the Five Solas of the Reformation. \\"Sola Scriptura, solus Christus, sola gratia, sola fide, and soli Deo gloria\\" must once again become the standard of theology and practice in our churches if we are ever to hope for a second Reformation. By the way, for those reading who don't know what these are, those Latin terms mean \\"Scripture Alone, Christ Alone, Grace Alone, Faith Alone, and Glory to God Alone.\\"Boice presents a convincing argument that we as a church have abandoned these five foundational principles. We have abandoned the sufficiency of Scripture; abandoned the exclusivity of the Gospel; abandoned a salvation given, not earned; abandoned trust in God through Jesus alone as the way of salvation; and abandoned the exaltation of the Creator rather than the creature. Instead we have taken on worldly substitutes that are but pale imitations. We have replaced sufficiency with ambiguity; exclusivity with relativism; the free gift with a salvation of works; surrender at our inability with self-confidence; and humble deference and awe with arrogant self-esteem or self-importance. Boice examines each of these five \\"solas\\" individually, building a case for each as the standard for Christian practice.He then moves toward application in the areas of worship and life. Boice does excellently in outlining the failures of modern worship techniques and concepts, showing them to be largely man-focused rather than God-focused. He points out very glaringly the Godward thrust of the old hymns, and challenges the reader to consider worship that has a Godward focus rather than personal enrichment.The final chapter on reforming our lives I found to be somewhat disappointing. While Boice soundly hammered home what is necessary to achieve reformation in our lives-i.e. lives of repentance, lives of faith, and lives of community-but he does little to give the reader practical suggestions of how to achieve this. He is long on theory in this chapter but short on application. I find myself wondering if this chapter was actually published unfinished.All in all, this book is a great precursor to his final book, \\"The Doctrines of Grace.\\" Indeed, they seem to be meant to be read in tandem, this one first and \\"The Doctrines of Grace\\" second. I would recommend this book to all of us; particularly one who is looking to bring about change in his or her church or ministry."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"This is a great book for us, Christians, to be reminded of the great truths that are in the Word of God. It gives us not only the study of the doctrines of grace, but also the state of Christianity as well. This book enlightens and teaches us the core message of the Bible. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to The Gospel of Grace?: Rediscovering the Doctrines that Shook the World","review":"Wow, this book really disappointed me. The theology in it - largely reformed - was great. I'm pretty reformed in my own theology, and there was a nice treatment of the five solas in this book (sola gratia, sola fide, sola Christus, sola Scriptura, and sola Deo gloria).But the real problems are in the false dichotomy (division) that Boice draws between churches that are sound theologically, and churches that aren't. He supposed (incorrectly) that if you believe in the sufficiency of Scripture, you will only sing hymns, avoid all contemporary worship, return to lengthy pastoral prayers during morning worship, and reject any contextualization of the gospel beyond running water and electricity.He then goes on to suggest that anyone who takes up a 21st (or even 20th) century contextualization - using modern worship, or any sort of program at all - is saying Scripture is insufficient. It's a silly proposition, although one I'm seeing a lately. It weakened the book significantly."},{"Title":"The Art of Watching Films","review":"This book was required for one of my classes in school.

But you need to recognize exactly what that is. This is a text book for undergraduates with little or no prior experience in film. It reviews very basic elements of cinematic craft, and encourages students to view films critically, to become personally involved with the film, and to express their reactions and thoughts about them. This is fine if you are someone who never realized that film is an art form; or if you know nothing about literary theory, dramatic structure, or art. It is a wonderful book for undergraduates, who sometimes do not actually know anything. It is an introduction to critical viewing, and to the basic elements of film.I bought this book because the reviews were good. But I really should have considered the source. If I were looking for a book on literary theory and history, for example, I would not be interested in one that started to explain basic thematic ideas like \\"man vs man and man vs nature etc. This book has the same problem. It is directed towards students who are just learning to use their critical and observational powers. It is really not sufficiently robust for someone who wants a firm and thorough grounding in film theory and historyI will also note that all of the photos in the book could have been put on the accompanying DVD. This would have enabled it to be printed on a lower grade of paper. This might have reduced the cost greatlyBut to be fair this book does serve its actual intended audience well.

Unlike this CD though, the audio episodes don't have a narration, but since I've got the scripts, it doesn't really matter because I know exactly what's going on. So I can give an honest review on this one.The story is great. It makes a great sequel to \\"The Tenth Planet\\" and introduces the return of the Cybermen well. The Doctor and his companions land on the moon in the late 21st century where the Earth's weather is now controlled by a gravity device on moon called the Gravitron. But the moonbase there has been having some trouble recently. A mysterious alien disease is spreading throughout the base, people have gone missing, and a range of strange malfunctions are threatening the very life on Earth itself. The Doctor suspects the Cybermen, and he is right. They invade the base and intend to use the Gravitron to destroy the Earth and mankind for good. The infected men who have disappeared are now under Cyber-control. It's now a race for the Doctor and his companions to stop the Cybermen before time runs out and the Earth is destroyed!It's not quite as good as \\"The Tomb of the Cybermen\\", but it does come close. If it had Cybermats in it then who knows. By both listening and watching the episodes you can get a real feel of the eerie atmosphere the dark and isolated moonbase creates. The Cybermen are certainly scarier than they were in \\"The Tenth Planet\\" and it has some great action pieces during the last two episodes. The cliffhangers were great and Patrick Troughton is as good as ever. I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Sunroom","review":"Beverly Lewis - By far the best Amish writer - EVER!

It is a touching story, \\"a shadow of what truly happened inside my young heart\\", according to the written testimony of the author.If you know of someone who is or has faced illness, death, or other human suffering, this is a small book that would be welcome to the inner needs of that person.

Her father is the pastor of their small church and struggles with his wife's illness, his responsibilities to his church and the welfare of his 2 daughters. Becky is sure the Sunroom must be a beautiful place and wishes she could visit her mother in person there, but first she has to live up to her end of the bargain with God.

His attempt to understand what the Framers of the Constitution believed judicial review to be would be much stronger with more detail to the controversies raging within states just after ratification about judicial review.

Here, the compelling story of the hunt for and sinking of the great German battleship is descriptive rather than analytic, but I don't mean by this that the book is not readable and enjoyable: it is. I started it one evening, thinking I'd get a few pages into it before turning in; I ended up finishing the book in a couple of hours (and I'm no speed reader). Moreover, I'd recently seen the very good 1960 movie 'Sink the Bismarck', which is based on this Forester book--and it still excited me. Not great as strictly history--Forester intended instead to portray events as they probably happened, and the result is persuasive, entertaining, and highly satisfactory."},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck.","review":"Interesting book.

I have read most of his Hornblower series and cannot find fault with any book he has written."},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck.","review":"CS Forester has proven with his Master and Commander series that he is no slouch when it comes to providing literary suspense on the high seas. In THE LAST NINE DAYS OF THE BISMARCK, he's turned that talent to a true-life history of the British hunt in the north Atlantic for the German battleship, Bismarck, during World War II.Just as the catastrophic US defeat at Pearl Harbor in 1941 seemed to result from a concatenation of small events, so too was the British sinking of the Bismarck a series of tiny twists and turns that, to give destiny its due, in many cases seemed to result more from good luck than good management - the serendipitous discovery of the Bismarck's location by a Swordfish torpedo bomber when the weather was so dismal and the skies so overcast that, by all good sense, the bombers should probably not have even been in the air; a chance shot that jammed the Bismarck's rudder and forced her to steam away from the coast of France when she was probably less than an hour away from Luftwaffe air protection; and, finally, Britain's preternatural good luck in being able to stay in battle against the Bismarck when they were literally within minutes of running out of fuel.The history is all well known, of course, and the ending will come as no surprise to anyone. But the joy and excitement is in Forester's ability to tell the story and relate the history with all the bated breath and suspense of the very best thrillers. If you enjoy history, then you'll certainly enjoy this brief re-telling of one of the decisive turning points of the WW II.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The last nine days of the Bismarck.","review":"I read \\"The Ship\\" by CSF recently and love it.

Campbell, Jr., is a selection of ten stories from _Astounding_ during the 1950s that are considered forerunners of the new, dynamic _Analog_. Perhaps they were. But I have never warmed to this anthology ever since I first read it in high school. Why is this so? The stories are all well crafted and readable. There are no real stinkers in the lot. But I cannot help but make a comparison with Campbell's earlier anthology, _The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology_ (1952). This book was packed with twenty-three classic or near-classic entries that have been reprinted many times over now and which have held up well over the years. _Prologue to Analog_ does not come close to this performance.The two stories that are the best _science fiction_ tales in the anthology-- certainly the two that are the most frequently reprinted-- are H. Beam Piper's \\"Omnilingual\\" and Christopher Anvil's \\"Pandora's Planet\\". The Piper is a scientific puzzle story about the decoding of a Martian Rosetta stone. The Anvil is about the alien conquerers who quickly find that Earth is too much to handle. It's an oft-told tale, redeemed by its humor and liveliness.Next is a novelette by Randall Garrett and Robert Silverberg, \\"Sound Decision,\\" which illustrates a simple but grim theme: The laws of nature trump the wishes of man. The verse at the beginning of the tale is by Garrett, and I suspect that he was responsible for the double meaning of the title.Three stories might be described as character portraits of a military nature: J.F. Bone's \\"Triggerman,\\" Joseph P. Martino's \\"Pushbutton War,\\" and Eric Frank Russell's \\"Minor Ingredient\\". The Bone is about a general who must decide whether to start a nuclear war, and the Martino is about an Apache pilot on an anti-missle missle. Both stories are competent but routine. The Russell is about an elderly gentleman's gentleman who shapes the character of a young space officer. It is filled with a warmth and humanity that makes it the best _story_ in the book, even if the science fiction is marginal.Three stories may be classed as light humor: Isaac Asimov's \\"Belief,\\" Rick Rafael's \\"A Filbert is a Nut,\\" and Roger Kuykendall's \\"We Didn't Do Anything Wrong, Hardly\\". The Asimov is the one about the levitating professor, the Rafael is about the madman who makes atomic bombs out of modeling clay, and the Kuykendall is about the teenagers who go joyriding in space. They are all fun but forgettable.Finally, there is Ralph Williams' \\"Business as Usual, During Alterations\\". Remember the Damon Knight story about how a matter duplicator brings about the collapse of civilization as we know it? Williams does a variation on this theme in which he suggests that civilization might be more resiliant than we believed. It is what used to be called a \\"thought variant\\" story back in the olden days of _Astounding_.With the possible exceptions of the Piper, the Anvil, and the Garrett/Silverberg, most of these stories would have been comfortable in _The Saturday Evening Post_ or _Colliers_. Where are the dazzling new ideas? The boldness of imagination? The originality of plots? The worlds radically different from our own? The sense of wonder? The individuality of styles? They are not there. This is a collection of homogenized stories that are largely Cold War fables. It tells more about the biases of John W. Campbell than what was the best of _Astounding_ in the 1950s."},{"Title":"AMG Concise Bible Doctrines (AMG Concise Series)","review":"Elmer Towns is the much beloved co-founder of Liberty University and the Dean of Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary.

What was most interesting, however, was the discussion of context that is so often missing from such work.

There are numerous enjoyable plot twists, a few surprises and whole chapters that could be edited out without sacrificing a smidgeon of understanding on the part of the reader.Main characters are often little more than caricatures of virtue or vice. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does temper any real development or evolution on most of the protagonists' part. Masons, Ormes, Furnivals, Stackleys and Duckwraths lolligag their way toward denoument, with good, not surprisingly, triumphant over evil. It's all very pleasant, but not much more than a good read.For me, Trollope's Can You Forgive Her?, with its stubborn battle of wills between protaganists and an ambiguous ending was far more satisfying."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"A young male friend chose to redirect the conversation with a lady concerning her husband when he sensed that....\\"the marital shoe was pinching her domestic corn\\".Terrific!!!"},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"Orley Farm is Trollope at his best (as good as the Barsetshire series), which means some of the best characterizations in the English language. Trollope's people are real; the beleaguered Lady Mason, charged with forging a will; the aged lover Sir Peregrine Orme; Madeleine Stavely, deeply but practically in love; the shallow, fickle Sophia Furnival and others are 3-dimensional figures that live and breathe. His satire of the so-called &quot;justice&quot; system is the best kind of satire: he just describes the court proceedings as they really are. The result is as up-to-date as today's newspaper. It is no wonder that Trollope's revival in popularity is continuing to grow."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"Orley Farm is Trollope at his most profound, and his most entertaining. It is difficult to ascertain what is best in this novel: the subtle, incisive examination of how legal systems cannot be impartial and, more fundamentally, how humankind looks after its own regardless of right and wrong; or the episodic journey with some of Trollope's most memorable (and always three dimensional) characters - the 'wrong' but completely empathic Lady Mason, the fiercely honourable Sir Peregrine Orme, the virile young Peregrine Orme and, most memorably, the gentle overwhelmed but staunchly loyal Mrs Orme - undergoing the pangs of Trollope's drama amidst ancient piles, undulating hedgerows and sequestered English fields."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"Orley is simply timeless. Just as in the Palliser series, the characters are the people all around you, in the office, in the news, and on the tube. Trollope's ability to understand the subtle differences that shape the mind of men and women is simply uncanny. If you are a truth seeker, this is a book for you. Anyone with exposure to a legal system with its basis in the English common law will understand the perceptive analysis it is subjected to in Orley Farm. The distinction between evil deeds and the often sympathetic humans that are their authors is one that modern American culture often forgets to make. Orley Farm is here to remind us. As a trusts and estates lawyer, I can not believe that I practiced for fifteen years before someone told me about this gem."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"Trollope was a master of the domestic situation. There is a scarcity of dialogue in Orley Farm, but the detailed explanations of the emotions, surroundings, and background of each character offers so much more than dialogue ever could. Anthony Trollope's Orley Farm is by far the best fictionalized trial drama that I have ever read. One would be hard-pressed to find another like it.I would offer the warning to those who dislike long, tedious readings that this work would not be for them. It is nearly 850 pages with very little action/dialogue. It more a study into the human psyche as it relates to guilt, pity, law, and the moral implications of all these things."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"An absorbing portrayal of a woman who is charged with forging a will. The reader doesn't know whether or not the woman is guilty until the middle of the book, and although the author indicates that we shouldn't have been surprised the revelation, I certainly was. The novel also has multiple subplots all of which are excellently carried on. We learn about the lives and interests of lawyers, country gentlemen, 'commercial men' (traveling salespeople) and the women in their lives."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"UPDATE about the Kindle Edition -- I have the free Kindle Edition and it is excellent quality in terms of formatting, navigation, and spell-checking. I just wish that all publishers who charge significantly more for their books would put the level of effort and quality control into their electronic versions.---------------I love Anthony Trollope. His writing style is very readable compared to Dickens or Tolstoy. His subject matter is oriented towards subjects which are still relevant today -- politics, money and power, women's rights, relationships. His character development and imagery makes it feel like you are there. His books aren't \\"pretentious\\" but just plain good stories that you an relate to -- even though they take place in the 1800s.One of the reasons I like them is it reinforces that many of the personal, moral, and emotional struggles you think about in your day-to-day life are exactly those that individuals have been pondering since the beginning of time. I think that we like to think that the problems we face are unique to our generation, our country (the US), our times, our families. When you read something like Orley Farm or the other Trollope books, you realize they are not and that there is still a lot to be learned from these \\"old guys\\".In addition, if you are looking for a good \\"escape\\" and a window into how the \\"other half lives\\", Trollope novels also give you that vehicle. You can imagine yourself as part of the British Aristocracy living in a life of influence and power -- which can be a lot more interesting than being part of middle class suburbia working every day just to make enough money to pay Uncle Sam, get health insurance and hopefully have enough paid time off to afford a 1-week beach trip every year."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"with Trollope, but this one is particularly overweight. A great deal is made - by Trollope and others - about the lack of suspense, which is said to make the novel 'realistic' (versus 'sensationalist'). Why? Anyway, we know from the beginning that the heroine forged the will, or rather the codicil (always a worry, the codicil). This means she spends 800 pages wallowing in terror and guilt. Others around her gradually find out; she wallows deeper and deeper with never a change of tone. This woman is TIRESOME. So is the bee in Trollope's bonnet about the adversarial legal system. As ever when nearing a political issue, Trollope uses it to bring in characters and set up oppositions, but he has no idea what to do with an idea, that is with an issue to be thoughtfully discussed. Given that this book slowly reaches a criminal trial, and that there is really no other serious plot, it becomes annoying to be told repeatedly that lawyers defend clients they don't believe in, and witnesses are badgered. The alternative hinted at - that the law should try to reach the truth - is awe-inspiringly feeble. Once the heroine is found 'not guilty', another non-surprise, and her son gives back the property fraudulently acquired, she is dropped with no gallantry into a fuzzy future in which she may, perhaps, the author hints, have one or two pleasant days. Though the book is treated by critics as a work about guilt and redemption, nobody seems redeemed, or changed in the least. How could they be, given the rigid Trollope rules of conduct.So why did I read it? Because of the richly populated, vividly conjured Trollope world - and also of course for the exciting hunting scenes. Which in some sense is the whole book. But if the heroine is the fox - and to support this, there is a thrown off line about foxes tails resembling womens' tails (you'd have to be a Victorian male to know what THIS means) - she spends an awful long time in the woods."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"One of the great novels of 19th Century fiction, with characters you will learn to appreciate and understand; not the kind of sensationalist fiction of Collins or Dickens, but a real probing into morality, responsibility and compassion. Set aside your summer, or perhaps your winter in front of the fireplace...do not pass this up."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"Orley Farm is the fifteenth novel by Anthony Trollope that I have read. I begin with this statement to put into context my thoughts on this work as compared with my reviews of other fine novels by Trollope, one of my favorite authors. With that bias concerning Trollope set before the reader, let me state that Orley Farm compares well with some of Trollope's finest work. As is usual with Trollope, he immediately takes us under his wing and speaks directly to us, not as an omniscient author, but as a careful observer who describes the behavior of the many characters that play a part in his story. We readers must form our own opinions, and the beauty of a Trollope novel like Orley Farm is that we do enter into the story and find ourselves giving advice and counsel to several of the important players in the drama. Sometimes our advice coincides with what Trollope thinks, sometimes not.Everything from beginning to end in Orley Farm centers on the great Orley Farm case. Lady Mary Mason, our heroine, is accused of perjury. Her enemies say that she lied about the facts of the will left by her husband and that Orley Farm, which she says was left to her son Lucius, is the true property of Joseph Mason, Lucius's older half brother. Joseph Mason and his accomplice lawyer Samuel Dockwrath dispute her claim to the farm. They hate lady Mason with a passion and they are determined to embarrass and humiliate her. Joseph would like to see a rope around her neck, but realizes to his dismay that this ultimate penalty is impossible.Lady Mason is certainly one of Trollope's most complex characters. She is a beautiful forty year old woman who has enormous strength of character. Both her beauty and her strength are much appreciated by some of those who know her. But no one except the reader knows the true depth of Lady Mason's personality. She appears honest and truthful, but Machiavelli would be impressed by her ability to deceive others to get what she wants for her son. With that said, she is also capable of great self-sacrifice for the good of others. In Lady Mason we have a person who on the one hand we can love, but on the other hand we know we must condemn. In this regard we are just like several of Lady Mason's best friends who are torn apart by their allegiance to her even as they know they must distance themselves from what she has done.Let me take a moment now to comment on the illustrated $2.99 Kindle edition for Orley Farm. Three things: First, the many illustrations are spread nicely throughout this eBook and placed appropriately in the story. Second, the illustrations by Pre-Raphaelite artist John Everett Millais are carefully drawn small works of art that perfectly complement the story. Third, it is possible to enlarge them to full Kindle screen size. This excellent feature allows us to see the pictures without a magnifying glass. I was pleasantly surprised not only by the quality of the many illustrations, but also by the flexibility the reader has available with the Kindle to enlarge and enhance the viewing experience.A genuinely entertaining story illustrated by many carefully drawn small works of art set in a pleasing and easy to read Kindle format make this Trollope novel and Kindle edition easy for me to recommend to those readers already familiar with Trollope and those who would like to meet him for the first time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Orley Farm (World's Classics)","review":"When I first read \\"Orley Farm\\" about 15 years ago (it was my second Trollope novel -- I've since read over 25 of them including the superb Barsetshire and Palliser series), it instantly became one of my all-time favorite books and Anthony Trollope was soon to become my favorite novelist. All of his fans know how he can create such realistic characters and make such pithy and still relevant observations about people and the upper/middle class human condition. Obviously, \\"Orley Farm\\" must be considered one of his best stand-alone novels. However, on re-reading the novel, I had a problem.Initially, let me say that I still consider it to be a near-great book and Trollope rarely tops the number of dead-on observations he made about people here. My problem is that the major plot makes no sense, and the secondary plot is extremely frustrating to read in modern times. First, let's consider the major plot of the alleged forgery (SPOILER ALERT!!!!). Are we to really understand that a sheltered woman like Lady Mason could forge not one, but three signatures so accurately as to fool writing experts (which undoubtely would have been retained in both trials) as well as the signers themselves? The same person who apparently had never forged another signature in her life? I don't think so.As far as the second major plot is concerned, I don't know about others, but it really started to annoy me that in 19th Century Victorian England, a man and a woman who were on the verge of getting engaged would spend virtually no time together, would not even kiss each other, and would refer to each other formally by last names until that magical post \\"pressure of the hand\\" moment when the woman finally agrees to become the man's wife. Perhaps it really was like that back then, but I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes in the scenes where Felix and Madeline would oh so tentatively try to express their feelings for each other. Sometimes I would literally shout out loud, \\"Oh for God's sake just run away to some remote part of the estate and roll in the hay a bit!!\\"Still a great novel, but I liked it better on my first reading."},{"Title":"Woodcraft,","review":"I picked up this book hoping Woodcraft might have to do with carpentry or somehow building stuff from wood. It doesn't. Woodcraft means camping, which is also fun. I've only skimmed through the book, but I find the authors tone very conversational and compelling.Unfortunately, it seems the original book had plenty of illustrations that are not included in the Kindle free edition. The text discusses the missing illustrations a good deal.From my scan of this book, I think it would be inspirational before a camping vacation.

Jane Hope moves from the North to live with her maternal grandparents in 1850s Chapel Hill, and has a hard adjustment to the gracious but slow pace of the South and the rigid requirements of propriety, although her older sister loves becoming a Southern Belle. This novel follows her through childhood to graceful young adulthood as the Civil War breaks out.

If you have never read Thelwell's work before, expect a sentence or part of a setence on each page with the most delicious black & white artwork to explain or describe the laughingly accurate reality of the topic.

Personally I haven't been fishing all that many times, but Thelwell's portrayal of the average angler is easily translated even for me.Not his best work but funny anyway."},{"Title":"Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces","review":"I purchased Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces two years ago. I was unprepared for its rigor. I am not a mathematics major, but I enjoy reading mathematics. My background includes calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and other applied mathematics, but I have not had a course in real analysis. W. A. Sutherland intended this text as the next step after analysis.After a brief foray, I retreated, placed Sutherland back on my bookshelf, and attacked some marginally easier introductory texts: Metric Spaces by Victor Bryant, Introduction to Topology by Bert Mendelson, and most recently, several chapters in Introduction to Analysis by Maxwell Rosenlicht. I periodically return to W. A. Sutherland's text to measure my understanding. I am now working on chapter five, Compact Spaces.I doubt that Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces would be foreboding to students that are familiar with real analysis. Sutherland understands that the abstractness and generalization can be difficult and shows concern with motivating the student. He repeatedly attempts to illustrate the value of generalization, especially in the study of continuity.Sutherland often uses a lengthy series of examples of increasing difficulty to illustrate abstract concepts. In his discussion of metric spaces, we begin with Euclidian n-space metrics, and move on to discrete metric spaces, function spaces, and even Hilbert sequence spaces. He introduces open sets and topological spaces in a similar fashion.The author occasionally suggests that the student might wish to make a geometrical diagram to help clarify some subtle point, but Sutherland includes few geometrical drawings in his text. His focus is clearly on proofs using the axioms of metric spaces and topological spaces.Sutherland highlights sections that either require more knowledge of abstract algebra, or for other reasons are thought to be more severe.Despite Sutherland's use of Introduction in the title, I suggest that any reader considering independent study might defer tackling Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces until after completing a more basic text. Possibly a better title might be A Second Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces."},{"Title":"Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces","review":"A lot of books on topology assume some basic knowledge of real analysis, which can throw a lot of readers off. This book starts from the very beginning, and thus is truly a great introduction. Each section has some good exercises, with even a few pointers at the back of the book for the more challenging ones. It starts with topological aspects, and then refers to them in the case of metric spaces (amongst many others), which is a much better approach than most other books, as the reader doesn't take the details of the specific to the general. A great little book, which is a must for most advanced maths Analysis courses."},{"Title":"Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because of its clarity, conciseness, and nice way of relating topological and metric spaces. This book is ideal for the student who is learning about these subjects for the first time, whether or not they intend to do more advanced work on the subject. The reader who wants to go on and learn about more advanced topics, should consult Munkres's book."},{"Title":"Illustrated Dictionary of Immunology, Second Edition","review":"This book has definitely helped me visualize and conceptualize processes and concepts that are so obvious to immunologists that it's impossible to look up a definition anywhere!

As such, if you liked the first and second stories (part two was \\"Autumn Rose\\"), then you will want to read this one too.This novel is a little shorter than the other two but still has the author's trademarks of grown ups dealing in an adult way with realistic problems, memorably sketched characters and tight plotting.Again we have a dual level story with two heroines: Lady Barbara Stanley, the close friend of Judith Ware Ballance, and Deborah Cohen, a Jewish resident of the old London East End. The heros are Lord Alexander MacLeod and Sir David Treves.The story is about how Lady Barbara, hoping for a marriage like that of the Suttons, makes a false start by becoming betrothed to the Marquess of Wardour. Through a lovely platonic friendship with Sir David, she comes to learn a lot about herself and her life views such that she breaks her engagement when she realises that Wardour does not come up to her most personal criteria as a life partner. Sir David accidentally meets Deborah Cohen and through her re-examines his Jewish faith and his role in both the Jewish and wider English community. He is loosely modelled on the Rothschilds who were so invaluable to Wellington's peninsular campaign.Alexander MacLeod is the grandson of a duke who wishes to make music his life's work in a time when being a working musician or composer was simply not acceptable to the higher echelons of the aristocracy and \\"polite\\" world of regency times. He has a critical impact on all of the main characters.The author writes about music, Judiaism, Tory-Whig politics and the class and social barriers of the times with authority and without \\"preaching\\" or \\"teaching\\". She wears her research lightly and makes such an unlikely topic come brilliantly alive in this story. Everything works out in the end but you realise that you have spent a few hours in the company of characters who have become very much alive. She particularly celebrates close friendship as demonstrated by some very touching scenes between Lady Barbara and the Duchess of Sutton.I could read a number of stories about the people we meet in these three novels if only the author provided them and I highly recommend this one as well as the other two in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Lady Barbara's Dilemma (Signet)","review":"If you are interested in discovering a new (even if out of print) Regency genre author I highly recommend Farrell - I was led to her by a terrific review of the first book in this group of connected stories \\"Miss Ware's Refusal\\" - it's top flight and I recommend reading that one first. This one is the third (I think, I'm still looking for others) after Autumn Rose.This is the story of Lady Barbara Stanley - best friend of Judith Ware - and her search for a husband. Her best friend and her brother have excellent loving marriages, so her standards for a future spouse are high. She thinks she has found him; he is titled, wealthy, NICE, and has a terrific and supporting mother. She even really likes his kisses. What more could a girl ask for? Well, someone who supports Lady Barbara's passion for music perhaps? Alec Gower is that violinist - however he is totally unsuitable from a social point of view.However, the real sticking point comes over Lady Barbara's platonic friend Sir David Treves whose own romance is not without problems. What is wrong with him? He's Jewish. Marjorie Farrell is to be congratulated on her well researched presentation of the Jewish \\"problem\\" in this time period in Britain.How all these problems are presented and then resloved makes for a highly enjoyable read, with thoughtful intelligent characters and no stereotypes- also no outside mystery and mayhem plot devices - just people trying to get their lives in order.

A huge house in the country, belonging to a wealthy family : the first daughter is a \\"jet-set\\" woman, far from ordinary human feelings ; the second daughter Carol, the heroine, is more engaging, unaffected, a lovely girl. It seems the boy she was engaged to was killed in the Pacific, but it's not so sure. Her brother is a WWII hero, but it appears there's something not so clear in his past. The corpse of an unknown young woman is found in the house, and we discover she's connected with the family. Incidents and accidents, attempts of murder and murder occur more and more often at night, and the police net closes on Carol. Well, of course, here comes a man, an ex soldier but not a super-hero, who'll help Carol and solve the mystery. The girl falls obviously for him, and all's well that end's well, but there's no preciousness in the story. The conclusion, as always, is unexpected and great. Old fashioned, yes, but to be read with great pleasure."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"I personally love mysteries set in the \`40s and earlier with a female heroine. This fits the bill! I love the details of the era and the writing style that comes along with writing in that time period."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart wrote some terrific mysteries dating back to the early 1900's. The Yellow Room, originally published in 1945, is one of her best. It is old-fashioned in a good way. This is a classic and very entertaining example of the mystery genre. There is a pretty young girl, a murder, suspects and intrigue involving the young woman's family and, of course, a dashing war hero in love with the heroine and only too willing to use every means at his disposal to get her out of the jam and solve the mystery. Rinehart creates a fun and exciting atmosphere for mystery lovers to enjoy, as well as a pretty good brain teaser.Young Carol Spencer is a likable heroine trying to recover from the loss of her fiance in the South Pacific. She longs to keep busy and wants to make herself useful in the war effort. She has been forced to care for her mother, however, as her selfish sister Elinor is too busy in her society functions to help. When Carol leaves New York for Maine to open up their home there, she discovers many unsettling mysteries.Lucy, the maid, is mising, and it is discovered that she is in the hospital with an injured leg. Someone chased her in the night and she fell down the stairs. Someone has been staying in the yellow room, even though no one was living in the Spencer's Maine home. Worse, there is a very dead young woman in the closet. When it is discovered that she came there asking for Carol, she becomes a suspect in the eyes of the local police.Dane is the war hero staying next door while he recovers from a leg injury before going back to his men. His past is a bit of a mystery also, and his meddling in the case is unappreciated by the local police. Carol doesn't know who to trust, and when her brother, a war hero as well, arrives, the mystery becomes murkier.Her snotty sister's car was seen the night of the murder, even though she was supposedly in New York. Was Carol's brother involved somehow? Who has been stealing her mother's fine china from the house? What was the dead girl's relationship to her brother and sister? Dane uses every man and instinct at his disposal to root out the killer and get to the bottom of things. Shots in the night and the mysterious actions of someone unknown, yet moving easily among her Maine neighbors, spell danger for Carol.The mystery is old-fashioned and so is the romance. Dane loves Carol before there is even a kiss. He puts himself in harm's way even though his future is uncertain, not wanting to put Carol through a long wait, and perhaps break her heart once again. This is very much a mystery where you can sense WWII and the changes it made in young men. The mores of a bygone era are in the forefront in this enjoyable and atmospheric mystery from one of the greats in the genre. For those who enjoy their mysteries in this vein, The Yellow Room is a lot of fun."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"That's what Agatha Christie had Hercule Poirot to state in one of her own great cozy murders, \\"The Clocks,\\" (1963). I agree with Agatha, (and with Hercule).Mary Roberts Rinehart was known for her complex plots and surprise endings (\\"Had I but known!\\") and this one is no exception. I also especially enjoy her mysteries because she almost always shifts the focus of the plot on to some edifice, usually a semi-spooky summer home, as the scene of her various cozy murders.In this case, a young woman is murdered and found, partially burned, in the summer home of an aristocratic lady, (the latter being yet another chief feature of Rinehart's stories). At first, the prime suspect appears to be evident but as the story evolves, the reader sees that there are others who might want this mysterious lady out of the way.Mary Roberts Rinehart lived from August 12, 1876 to September 22, 1958. She wrote \\"The Circular Staircase\\" in 1907, a spectacular mystery which launched her to national fame. That work sold over a million copies and is still a good seller today. \\"The Red Lamp\\" (1925) is another of her more compelling mysteries.\\"The Yellow Room\\" was written in 1945 which conveniently allowed Rinehart to produce the most sympathetic of all prime suspects: a military flyer. This is one whodunnit which pretty much stumps even the most ardent of mystery readers in their efforts to anticipate the ending. It's my favorite of all time.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This is a great old fashion murder mystery, which is my favorite type. It was quick and enjoyable, I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"Mary Roberts Rhinehart never fails to deliver a great story, filled with characters who elicit emotional reactions from her readers. This story is set in the midst of World War II; Carol Spencer's fiance has been reported missing in action, presumed dead, and she's traveling by train with her mother from Manhattan to her sister's house in Newport, RI, and from there to the family's summer home in Maine. When she arrives in Maine with only one servant, she discovers that the staff in Maine is not around for various reasons, and then discovers evidence of murder in the yellow bedroom. Typical of Mrs. Rhinehart, the book takes several twists and turns before reaching its satisfactory conclusion."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"It\`s the middle of World War II. The setting is the Spencer family\`s sumptuous summer house in Maine. Young Carol Spencer has gone ahead of her family to open it up for the season, with a cook and two maids. But nobody meets them at the station. When they finally get to the house, the housekeeper is missing, nothing is ready, and the phones have been pulled out.On top of all this discomfiture, one of the maids finds a body in the linen closet!Two parallel searches for the murderer are soon underway. Floyd, the self-important village chief of police, would enjoy pinning the crime on a member of the wealthy Spencer family. But Jerry Dane, recovering from a war wound in the neighborhood, intends to look deeper. Dane is a mystery man - handsome but unsociable, watched over by a another wounded soldier.Dane is delighted to have a puzzle to unravel while he convalesces. But matters get complicated when he begins to fall in love with Carol Spencer.The convoluted plot is a feast of cover-ups, accidents and misdirected suspicions. Just about everyone seems to carry a gun, and the guns go off rather easily. Everyone smokes incessantly, too. The rapid-fire dialog has flashes of humor.I enjoyed the portrayal of upper-class civilian life during wartime: rich people suffering from the lack of servants, no porters at the train stations, grave shortages of gasoline and gardeners, complaints about rationing and thin cream.Mary Roberts Rinehart has been called the American Agatha Christie. I find her less polished than Christie, and her characters more on the surface. But there's a dashing American quality to her writing that has its own unique appeal.

I'd definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Yellow Room","review":"This book is vintage Mary Roberts Rinehart -- upper-class family, grand summer home, all kinds of surprises and plot turns -- with an observant heroine who rises to the occasion and ends up escaping her stifling life as well.

I am particularly pleased that many combat veterans have told me that they enjoyed the book, and more than one has commented that the characters are realistic.Every other review of GRADY'S TOUR on Amazon.com is a five star review and written by a veteran. I would think that Mr. Chase might have suspected that his caustic review was out of line and unfounded.In 2007, MILITARY WRITERS SOCIETY OF AMERICA gave GRADY'S TOUR its top award in the historical fiction genre. In 2010, the Branson, MO. Stars & Flags Book Awards contest for books with a military theme and written within the past 10 years gave GRADY'S TOUR an honorable mention award.

Most books do not take on such a complete stretch of history, in this case, four years that covers both the war and afterwards.The book has some great action sequences in Korea that will satisfy almost all military buffs who enjoy reading a good war novel. The book goes into an area that most writers of this genre do not. It deals with issues beyond the war itself and takes on the great spy hunt at home by people like Joe McCarthy. It raises some questions and it might open old historic wounds for some people.Readers will get their money's worth; as the book is well over 500 pages long and is entertaining through out!"},{"Title":"Vincennes, In","review":"This is a must have book for anyone born in Vincennes, IN.I have ordered 5 of these books. I lived in Vincennes when Iwas a small child. After I received my copy, I ordered my Mother,who was born and raised in Vincennes, IN., one for Mother's Day. She loved it!!! In fact she wanted me to order her sister one and two for childhood friends who have remained close friends of hers over the years who were also born and raised in Vincennes.This book is full of postcard pictures of Vincennes.IN. The book is excellently done. Showing many of the Historical sites and History of this historical town.

The author created a program called PICTURE, which drew grid diagrams of many different shapes. Unfortunately, for many of the figures, the author did not give the formula used to create it. It would have been much better had he done so. For this reason, the book has not worn well over the years. The PICTURE program is also very obsolete, because now symbolic mathematical packages such as Mathematica or Maple can easily draw similar figures in a matter of seconds. Had the formulas been given for the figures, it would be easy to create and modify them to suit what you may want to draw."},{"Title":"The Impersonator","review":"The Impersonator is an intriguing and tantalising book.

There is nothing wrong with that: they are purchased by students as handy summaries of a book's contents.Even within the constraints of Cliff Notes, Andrew Bernstein could have done something to help students appreciate the literary sophistication of Ayn Rand's ANTHEM. These notes are little more than a summary (with, I concede, a few useful observations) of the book and a soap box for Bernstein to tell us how great Rand and Objectivism is, even when it isn't appropriate.Bernstein is associated with the Ayn Rand Institute (which advocates Leonard Peikoff's orthodox brand of Objectivism), which is fine with me, but he shouldn't use this book to propagandize for Rand and Objectivism. For example, when he says that Rand \\"helped form an institute to teach her philosophy\\" in 1958, was it so hard to mention that it was the Nathaniel Branden Institute?Before Bernstein pontificates, he should at least learn what he is talking about.

It speaks to a great mystery, and Ross Hamilton seems to take care to preserve that sense of what is unanswerable and unfathomable for the reader, allowing one to make-up one's own mind while shedding some light.These reviews weren't intended to be message boards or a venue for debate, but I noticed that one reviewer submitted two pieces which reduced the star average so much as to make the book appear mediocre and unworthy of acquiring. This kind of leverage goes against the written guidelines of this forum, and so I shall add a five star rating in the hope of countering that fellow's illegitimate actions. Because I have my own copy, I see that he did not bother to actually read the book as the author has requested, apparently selectively isolating various parts in what appears an effort to raise his own reputation.We here in the Ohio Valley treaure our Great Serpent, and the advent of Hamilton's book has made the earthwork's reputation for a mystery study entirely legitimate and quite welcome by both Native Americans and their white brothers and sisters. I have been to Serpent Mound on more than one occasion, and you can bank on it being truly a magnificant piece of architecture, however damaged it has become with time.

As a international radio show host for my show called Living A Spiritual Life with Tina Sacchi, I decided to contact the author, Ross Hamilton, so that he can be a guest on my show. I then was lecturing in Ohio and thought perhaps he would give me a tour of the Serpent Mound. We spent 6 hours together and discovered how passionate and driven Mr. Hamilton is regarding this largest effigy on the planet! He will also be a radio show guest soon and his podcast will be available for those who miss it. I understand that he occasionally conducts workshops at the Serpent Mound, so if you're going to be in the area, be sure to inquire about his workshop dates.This book is a chock full of information and challenges our imagination. Mr Hamilton describes the multitude of ways and possibilities on how this mound came to be. It touches upon how the mound relates to sacred geometry, constellations, alchemy, etc. etc. There has been no stone left unturned. Mr Hamilton's research is thorough and concise.The book is intense, deep and thought provoking. I know Mr Hamilton is in the process of publishing another book this year which perhaps would be a great beginner book to this condensed version.If you are intrigued about prehistoric architecture, then this book is a must!

And shares some conflicting points of view with supporting statements.

When I run across someone vehemently denying any other possibility due to staunch dogmatic platitudes revolving around \\"rational thinking\\" that automatically tells me there is possibly something more lurking here. I say this only because people who cling to any \\"belief\\" regardless of origin often will reduced to uivvering mess if/when their belief is proven otherwise. In this case, Newbrook's belief will probably stick until our culture advances enough to build time-travel and then go back to observe the origins of the Serpent Mound.Overall the book author's \\"belief\\" about the effigy seemed quite New Age to me as a scientist. But unlike Mr. Newbrook, I do not lash out with Occam's Razor at every belief that crosses me. For instance, we know the biblical Genesis account of creation is but a myth or story because we know the dinosaur era lasted millions of years preceding man. The proof is the bones left behind. For those who believe in Genesis, then I classify that as a useful lie until the believer tries to force me to believe in it too.The author offers several useful lies that may or may not provide you with answers. Much like Erik Von Daniken did with his Chariots of the Gods series it is fun to speculate and enjoy but it has no proof it actually happened the way he states it. Much the same with this book.I give it four of five stars and recommend it to you for an entertaining theory."},{"Title":"The mystery of the Serpent Mound","review":"Hamilton argues that there are historically and spiritually significant links between the Great Serpent Mound (Ohio) and the Greek alphabet.I say nothing here about non-linguistic issues in the book, but this should not be taken to mean that I see no problems on these fronts (I see many). I simply think it best to concentrate here on my own main relevant areas of expertise, namely general and historical linguistics and the history of the Greek language.One problem which is shared with most amateur proposals in this area involves the use of outdated comparative linguistic methods in 'establishing' historical links between words. It is demonstrably unreliable to equate (even tentatively) forms (from pairs of languages, whether known to be related or not, or even within any one language) on the basis of superficial, unsystematic phonetic similarities between forms with related meanings - even more so if the semantic link is not at all obvious. Most such cases will involve accidental similarity. Eg, there is NO basis for suggesting a link between &lt;ophion> and &lt;Ohio> (p 138). (This has been known for very many years, and now the statistics have been calculated.) In some cases it is actually clear that forms which are equated are NOT connected, because the etymologies are known; eg, &lt;thesauros> is clearly NOT &lt;theo-> + &lt;sauros> ('god-lizard') (p 151). The known historical phonology of Greek excludes this: the vowels in &lt;the(o)-> and the position and type of the inherent accent on &lt;sauros> differ between the two cases, showing that the forms are unconnected. In other cases Hamilton accepts a standard etymology but offers a redundant reinterpretation involving a 'deeper' sense. Eg, the letter-names &lt;o-micron> and &lt;o-mega> (p 147) very clearly refer to the LENGTHS of the vowels named (short and long respectively). There is no basis for an interpretation in terms of 'spirit'.The identifications of Greek letter-forms with parts of the Serpent Mound (pp 153-191) are essentially impressionistic and do not appear at all persuasive. One would need to see evidence that at least a high proportion of these identifications or the set as a whole should be preferred (eg on statistical grounds) to other possible interpretations and especially to the null hypothesis of there being no link between the Mound and the alphabet. The null hypothesis would appear to have the strength (in terms of Ockham's Razor) of a better fit with the lack of historical evidence of contact between the two entities. In addition, there are further specific worries here, eg confused comments about Etruscan and the origin of gamma on pp 156-157, inaccurate phonetics on p 191.Other points in the linguistic section (pp 141-152): 1) The Greeks did NOT invent the alphabet (pp 141, 150) but rather (as Hamilton actually acknowledges) adapted a Semitic (probably Phoenician) abjad to Greek, using consonant symbols not needed for Greek to represent vowels (this does occur in Semitic scripts but became universal in Greek) and (naturally) adding symbols to represent additional consonants and clusters requiring their own characters. This was clever but does not demonstrate any superior facility with Semitic symbolism. (Naturally, the senses of the Semitic letter-names were not carried over into Greek with its very largely unrelated vocabulary. By the time of transfer, the pictographic element in many of the letters was no longer obvious, in any case.) 2) The ordering of the alphabet as recited and used in dictionaries was derived from the Semitic scripts. (p 141) I know of no evidence that the numerological values of the letters had any significance beyond numerology. 3) There is no link between the earlier syllabic Greek scripts and the alphabet; in all probability, most Greek communities went through a period of illiteracy in the interim. (p 141) 4) Language naturally flourished in Greece (as elsewhere) even in the absence of literacy. The Homeric poems were originally composed by illiterates. (p 143) 5) It is not clear what would count as evidence for or against various mystical-sound statements about language on pp 143-147, or even what some of them mean. They appear susceptible only to subjective/ impressionistic confirmation or disconfirmation - which would naturally tend to involve unresolvable disagreements and thus could not carry much weight. 6) The counter-criticism of mainstream scholarly methods in these respects on p 151 is not adequately justified. 7) No good evidence is produced for the claims (p 144) that there is an important link between numerical symbology and the adoption of alphabetic writing and that the alphabet was very deliberately planned. 8) The choice and structure of the linguistic terminology is strange, eg (alpha), (gamma), &lt;CLASSIC dental> (delta), beta described as the 'mean' of the mutes (plosives), beta described in terms of manner (plosive) but gamma and delta in terms of position (velar, dental), the non-technical term &lt;guttural>, etc (p 144-145). 9) It is quite possible that some parts of the Semitic abjad system were derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs (p 144), but this does not show that any specific cultural influence is even likely, still less that any such influence later penetrated to the Greeks. 10) No good evidence is produced for the claims about changes to the spellings of letter-names and their motivation and significance, made in general terms on pp 144-145 and later in more detail (eg on p 156 for ). 11) The minuscule forms of Greek letters are late developments only. (p 152).Whether or not the general theory can be made to hold up (which one must doubt), Hamilton will need to address points such as those made above and to increase the sophistication of his linguistic discussion. Until he does this, he will struggle to attract the interest of experts in these matters.Reply to Drucker: the above is NOT an 'adamant rant' about this book, nor does it contain any 'dogmatic platitudes'. I merely rehearse various rational arguments that tell against the claims and proposals made in it. How else can one try to assess novel empirical claims? (Is Drucker really suggesting that rational analysis is inappropriate?! Surely not?) Naturally, Drucker is entitled to disagree and to argue back. And of course I might be wrong - and if I am so convinced (rationally) I will acknowledge this. Drucker is quite wrong if he thinks that my reaction to the book involves awareness or fear that 'there is possibly something more lurking here' which might somehow disturb scholars ('reduce them to a quivering mess'). We are perfectly accustomed to the challenge of novel theories. But if these theories appear irrational or poorly supported we will not accept them. Indeed, I have shown more interest in this book than most scholars would: I have taken it seriously and have bothered to review it. (There ARE cases of dogmatic rejection of novel ideas, some of which turn out to be correct - but this is much less common than is often suggested.) I myself doubt if time-travel is possible even in principle, but even if it IS possible and is one day achieved it will be a brave person who bets that Hamilton's theory of the origins of the Serpent Mound will thereby be confirmed. As things are at present, however, we must rely on the evidence that we do have - and on our use of rational thought to evaluate it and assess rival hypotheses concerning it. In this context, I do not understand why Drucker apparently eschews Ockam's Razor, which I think I use as appropriate. If Drucker thinks that there are powerful specific rejoinders to my specific criticisms, he should produce them. I will then consider them. Incidentally, Erich von Daniken's material is rather 'worse' than Drucker seems to suggest. It is woefully unscholarly."},{"Title":"The mystery of the Serpent Mound","review":"This book opens your mind.

The reference is apparently to my own earlier review. But rationality (including science) is exactly how we evaluate competing theories about the world. It is NOT out of date ('1950') and it is NOT the same thing as closed-mindedness or thinking inside a 'tiny box' (that does occur but is very rare in serious scholarship). If Hamilton wants us to accept a radically novel &amp; in many ways implausible account of the matters discussed, he must produce better evidence and argumentation than he does in his book. After all, if he is right, large parts of existing theories and ideas which are themselves very well supported must somehow be wrong. Perhaps 'reader from Great NorthWest', or some other admirer of Hamilton, can marshall evidence &amp; argumentation and rebut my criticisms (which could be expanded to considerably greater length &amp; detail). If so, I will cheerfully accept and promote Hamilton's views. If not, I stand by my criticisms; and on current evidence I am confident that other scholars would endorse them.

Schad has taken the insights of Goethe, Steiner, Portmann and others to new heights. He has looked at the form of mammals and suggested a new idea relating the entire form of the animal to its three main processes: nerve-sense, metabolic-limb and rythmic systems. Here the nerve-sense system refers to the brain and the nervous system, metabolic to the digestive and the limbs, and rythmic to the heart and lungs. The idea originated through the insight that an animal's form must be a product of its entirety all of its structures must be related to all others ie an idea of wholeness.From this simple three-fold idea Schad builds the form through the influence of these 3 systems, not strictly separate, but through an interaction of all 3 in the animal. The ungulates are thus most influenced by the metabolic-limb system, the rodents by the nerve-sense system and the carnivores by the rythmic system. He explains how structures such as horns and antlers form in the ungulates as well as dealing with quirky aspects such as the large canines of the musk deer and the reason for the spiraling of sheep horns and the oval/spherical shaping of deer antlers. He explains the colouring of each of these such as the spots of the carnivores eg jaguar, cheetar etc, the striping of the zebra and the overall colouration of the larger animals such as the bear and moose. Schad's argument is very convincing certainly since the idea based on evolution through natural seection fails to account for the various forms in a coherent way other than to talk about camoflouge and random mutations. Not to say these are not valid but the individual charcateristics are obviously far more than just random mutations. Portmann first suggested the idea of animal self-expression in their form, that is expression of their type not individual self-expression such as that of a human being, Schad has provided a viable reason for this idea and a way of classifying the mammals in a way which makes sense in a form-sense rather than simply a method based on characteristic structures which appear haphazard and exist for no reason. Through this system he allocates places for the various mammals within their families which make sense by being based on the influence of the three-fold processes.There is much that can still be done in this regard including a fuller account of the environment and the systems, a way of understanding the other animals such as the invertebrates possibly through another such idea, the understanding of evolution of animal ancestors using such ideas. This approach has much to support it, however it also has weaknesses. It is important as Schad says at times that we never loose sight of the animal itself and not get lost or too captivated by the idea itseld especially when it no longer applies in the new situation. I felt at times that Schad was himself doing this. Luckily his obvious belief in Steinerian anthroposphy was not stressed too much and a good objective analysis was possible, this is not evident in the last chapter on man although the ideas there appear reasonable. Again any determined approach to a phenomenon such as the form of animals must proceed through a way where the animal &quot;tells&quot; you its secrets rather than being forced into a straight-jacket of previously formed ideas. Goethe himself stressed this throughout his scientific researches and today it must be stressed again. This is the objectivity science craves.This book is worth every cent you pay, I'm looking forward to the new edition yet to be issued. This new edition is in progress. Excellent although doubts remain, something appears to be missing, food for further research."},{"Title":"Mean as hell,","review":"More than fifty years ago I read Dee Harkey's account of his experiences as an old time western lawman, and \\"Mean as Hell\\" still sticks in my memory as the best account of what it was like to wear a badge in the old days.

I found that I was very familiar with the places mentioned in the book as well as some of the people. Good read whether you are from Carlsbad, New Mexico or not. History is history and it is in this book. I remember my Mother pointing out Dee Harkey on the streets of Carlsbad and his Daughter Myrtle, a prominent Physician in Carlsbad. I have also found out recently that I am distantly related to Dee Harkey.Ken Edmondson"},{"Title":"Mean as hell,","review":"I must open by saying that part of my interest in this book is that I am a descendant of the author. I still have family in New Mexico and therefore it is easy for me to connect with the author.Having said that, this book is just a fun read if you are interested in the culture of the American west in the late 19th century. The author is not really a writer, and it shows in the way he writes, but if you imagine an old man sitting on a porch spinning tales about arresting the man who shot Billy the Kid or how he and his family were trapped inside their cabin for several days by Indians, it becomes a relaxing and fascinating read that offers real insight that is lacking in movies and documentaries.This is unfiltered, unproduced history and it is worth the read.

Where possible, fonts were listed in the named typeface, if not, Courier was used.\\"In fact, Courier was used 69 times.Considering this is a book ABOUT fonts, the fact that they couldn't obtain the typefaces is just unnacceptable.There is a short chapter on each designer, with a list on the side of the typefaces they designed. With some of them, the typeface is spelled out in that font. Makes sense right? Well, then in other (69 to be exact) cases it is spelled out in Courier (a typewriter-like font), making it seem like that is the font they designed. But on a few, you'll see that failed to obtain almost ANY of the fonts the designer was responsible for, so on the list, it looks like that person designed 10 identical fonts that all look like Courier.I also found several obvious typos that should never have made it to print.BUT - information and pictures are very interesting and well done, giving insight into their work and highlighting designers that aren't recognized enough in my opinion. Still, I would say do not buy this book. Not unless it is reissued with corrections. If the fonts were there, I would give the book 5 stars.

Allan Haley goes to fourteen different type designers including Matthew Carter, Jonathan Hoefler, Erik Spiekerman, Carol Twombly, Tobias Frere-Jones and David Berlow to ask each one of them how they design type. This great book also includes information on how you can make cool fonts for hard cash (trust me, it is not a get rich quick craft, your hard cash may be a few coins a day at years end), Multiple Master fonts and a fantastic type timeline.This book makes an excellent addition to Michael Harvey's Creative Lettering Today for the beginning to the master type designer."},{"Title":"The Strategic Enterprise: Growing a Business for the 21st Century","review":"If you are even thinking of doing business in the new economy, get this book!

Bishop persuasively describes how to rethink the strategic planning process and guides the reader step-by-step with case examples in both the service and manufacturing sectors.I liked this book, especially Bishop's methodology of how to think about and serve the customer. However, I questioned the writer's use of the words &quot;all&quot; and &quot;most&quot; throughout the book when the evidence is an interpretation about how the world works.

The author makes some very good cases for his vision of the new company structure, one which I personally think is both workable and think makes sense. While he doesn't necessarily provide a clean blue-print for re-organizing or building from scratch, he does give a great thumb-nail sketch that any reasonably intelligent business leader or entrepreneur could follow.

But it is also a great book to own if you are only going to own one. It is divided into five sections: basic grammar, rules that govern sentence structure, diction and the dictionary, writing mechanics, and the writing process in a variety of styles. I love this book because it is laid out so clearly and simply! The first section begins by defining all grammatical terms with examples, offering not only the basic terms but also those that even experienced writers hear but are not exactly sure of in meaning, like predicate nominatives and appositives. The rest of the sections build on this beginning, again clearly and effectively. Chapman's tips and strategies to the writer are also good as you get further into the book. The index at the end is thorough and clear as well, so you can start there to investigate any English language question you might have. I am a freelance writer and teacher, and I use this book often. I couple it with Edward Johnson's THE HANDBOOK OF GOOD ENGLISH for a text that offers more writer's commentary and examples (but is not as clear and concise as Chapman's!), and the two serve me very well. If you only want one book, though, go to Chapman's.

It is divided into 12 monthly chapters each with 31 single-page readings, so it could easily be used as a daily devotional.Each chapter is devoted to a different religious tradition: Hinduism, Buddhism, Zen, Taoism, Native American Religion, Traditional African Religion, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Early Christianity, Christian Mysticism, Islam, and Sufism &amp; Sikhism. The chapters each begin with three pages summarizing the origins, teachings, and distinctive features of the faith and a fourth page suggesting how to apply its insights to your daily life.This collection is set apart from other world religions anthologies by the beauty of its design. The book is printed on glossy, full-color stock. Each monthly chapter has a distinct border design. The only flaw is that the print is rather small and would be difficult for someone with poor eyesight to read. Still, the book would make a handsome gift for anyone interested in world religions.While the book is beautiful and contains a nice variety of readings, it is not a very useful tool for scholars. Most of the pieces are abridged and occasionally paraphrased from the original, but these adaptations are not specifically noted. Sources are indicated by author and book, but more specific information like chapter and verse are omitted.However, if inspiration is your goal, A World Religions Bible is a fine collection of inspiring words attractively presented."},{"Title":"The Guideposts Parallel Bible: King James Version, New International Version, Living Bible, Revised Standard Edition","review":"I bought this item for my dad and he was very impressed with its condition.

Covering topics like gentrification, homelessness, police brutality, racism, homophobia, US militarism, Third World debt, Reagonomics, the prison industrial complex, environmental destruction, and more, this book is a heart-wrenching and powerful testament of social struggle and resistance. As a gay man living with AIDS, I was especially moved by the portion of the book by Tobocman and Peter Plate dealing with AIDS activism back in the eighties. Thanks to the sacrifice and solidarity of activists back then younger seropositive people like myself are still alive. So, thank you Seth Tobocman, ACT UP, and everyone else who insisted that people like me have a right to live. With every re-print of this book, Tobocman adds more material. In this expanded new edition, Tobocman includes material on Mumia abu Jamal, Amadou Diallo, Brad Will, Tristan Anderson, the economic crisis, and the wars in Iraq and Palestine. As you can tell, this is really an amazing book. If you're at all interested in anti-authoritarian politics and movement history, do yourself a favor and read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"You Don't Have to Fuck People Over to Survive","review":"The powerful graphics and engaging text make this book a &quot;must have&quot; for everyone who knows who Peter Plate is, who has listened to Nick Cave or been to a Fugazi show.

I started taking piano lessons in high school after several years of playing by ear. My teacher ordered this book for me telling me that the book was very self-explanatory and to go through it at my own pace, asking her any questions I might have. She never told me what she expected me to have learned by the next lesson. I might add that I was a self-motivated student even though my parents are the ones who suggested I take lessons and who found me a teacher. My weekly lesson was showing her where I was in the book and playing a few exercises or pieces to demonstrate how I was progressing. She would offer suggestions and answer my questions. This book is great for self-learning. Everything is there: sight reading, theory and technique- all very clear and easy to understand. Since the book is for older beginners the sight-reading pieces are not trite like you might find in other beginner books. There are many familiar folk tunes and famous melodies. I highly recommend this book for anyone no matter your age!I must add that although this is a great book for self-learners, it is still great to have a teacher for the weekly encouragement."},{"Title":"Beginning Piano for Adults (GP 23)","review":"I'm a second year adult student, plugging along...The book is a bit thick on work and thin on explanation.However, with a teacher to review your efforts, it is a very good blue print or map for how to procede at getting better.If you need a beginner book, start with those and work forward.As always, find a teacher to work with and stick with it!"},{"Title":"Beginning Piano for Adults (GP 23)","review":"....and I was very disappointed with this book.

I liked James Bastien's children's piano books a lot better."},{"Title":"Beginning Piano for Adults (GP 23)","review":"I took piano instructions many years ago using this book, then quit. When I resumed lessons recently, my instructor recommended the Piano Adventure series (adult). I was unhappy with them and ordered the Beginning Piano for Adults on my own. I'm happy that I did. The instructions in this book are what I think of as deep, rather than broad. By that, I mean that the lessons are designed to \\"hammer home\\" each lesson by giving you a varied and thorough exploration of each lesson with small sub-steps included that move you along without you knowing that you are. (For example: the early lessons in rhythm are combined with lessons on chords and arpeggios. Then you are encouraged to practice rhythmic phrases while transposing into various chords.) My interest doesn't flag and I don't find myself getting bored. The one negative that I find as I begin using this book is its insistence on teaching all of the chords up front. Its not really necessary to learn all of the sharp & flat chords right at the beginning since the back section of the book doesn't make much use of more than the first few simpler chords (C, G, F) (D,A,E). Although my instructor continues to like the Piano Adventure books, I use this one for practicing, warm-up exercises and further education on my own."},{"Title":"Beginning Piano for Adults (GP 23)","review":"I have been a piano teacher for 50 years and have taught students of all ages, including in private homes, in a music school and in a college.

Continuing with the well presented material, the student can learn theory and technique to become an accomplished player. An outstanding feature is that following their plan to provides comfort in negotiating all keys.

However, things go teribly wrong when the cosmic storm moves at an astonishingly acclerating rate. The cosmic radiation changes and mutates their DNA... changing their very lives and future.*CHARACTERS* - Here are brief sketches of the characters from the book and upcoming summer movie for the year 2005...Dr. Reed Richard (Mr. Fantastic) - A scientific genius whose ultimately problem is thinking too much before taking any action, Reed inevitably becomes the leader of what will become the Fantastic4. His new powers enables him to stretch and contort his body into any shape.Susan Storm (Invisible Girl) - Reed's ex-girlfriend who still harbors feeling for the scientist while continually being frustrated by him, has the power to make herself become invisible and create force fields.Ben Grimm (The Thing) - Reed's best friend and former astronaut-from-Brooklyn, he's known for his surly manner and dry humor. The radiation mutated him into a rock-like, superhumanly stronge 'thing'.Johnny Storm (The Human Torch) - Sue's hotheaded younger brother, he's known for chasing thrills (not to mention the ladies...). His abilites include engulfing his body into flames and flying.Victor Von Doom (Doctor Doom) - The financier for the whole expidition into space, he is Reed's long time rival who is now a billionaire industrialist. Though many believed him to have been kept safe from the radiation, he actually did not escape the 'incident' unscathes and unchanged...*REVIEW* - \\"Fantastic4\\" was a very, VERY enjoyable read, one which I could not put down without wanting to pick it back up again. I was quite impressed with Peter David's writing; he chooses his words well, using every 'cliche' so uniquely that it's quite novel to read about the 'solid' Ben Grimm, 'smoking' Johnny Storm, and etc.As the other reviewer commented, some of the 'physical' humor/action is slightly awkward to read at times, Johnny's ski 'trip' coming most to mind. I'm sure that on screen it would come off better (hopefully).On the other hand, the book gives much more details which I know for a fact that will never be portrayed well in the movie. Peter David gives a nice insight into the minds of each of the characters, most especially that of Ben Grimm. The turmoil in him from being 'the Thing' is well written.*CLOSING* - I was quite impressed with the novel and though like many of the recent movies F4 has a lot of action, some even 'unnecessary' to some degree, I am looking forward to the character development, if well done, could make this on par with the likes of superhero movie giants, \\"X-Men\\" and \\"Spider-Man\\"."},{"Title":"Fantastic Four","review":"These days I don't often read tie-in novelizations of upcoming films, preferring to wait and experience the actual movie, which most would agree is probably the best way to discover a story designed for the screen. But novelizations can often be fun, and this one was written by the talented comic book writer Peter David (who adapted the film script written by three other folks), so I figured I'd give it a whirl.Sadly, if the movie sticks close to the story in this paperback, it will end up being a wasted opportunity to bring something great to the screen. In the comments that follow, I'll discuss this book, but I'm really talking about the movie on which the book is based.Overall, Mr. David does his best to make the story work in book form, toning down idiotic sight gags (yes, Reed Richards gets kicked in a sensitive place by Ben Grimm when Reed tests Ben's reflexes with a little hammer blow to Ben's newly-rocky knee), but in the end two adjectives come to mind to describe this story: silly and thin.What's depressing is that this is the Fantastic Four, the title that established Marvel Comics' famous formula of heroics combined with melodrama, where the heroes can save the world one issue but not be able to make its lease payment on their headquarters the next. Where wonderment and imagination permeated every issue of the original FF comic book no matter the personal dilemmas taking place. Other movies should be looking in reverence to the Fantastic Four movie to see how a super-hero movie should be done. Sadly, though, it's probably a good idea that other films don't emulate this one. Because this Fantastic Four movie, based on what's in this novel, doesn't trust its own pedigree, and instead cynically includes touchstones from our \\"popular\\" culture to make the story more \\"approachable\\".It's not amazing enough that Johnny Storm can burst into flames and roar through the skies. No, we better have him first discover his powers while snowboarding with a hot nurse, catching fire while gaining speed on his board. Then, the next time he displays his powers, it's while participating in an X-Games/Extreme sports tournament, bursting into flames while doing stunts on a cycle. I can almost hear the story conference: \\"What do the kids like these days? I got it, snowboarding and all that Extreme sports stuff. Let's work that in somehow.\\" Since when does the FF need the latest hip & trendy gimmicks to sell what they're all about? Did the X-Men movie need to do this? Did Spidey? Why did the producers feel the need to \\"help\\" the FF this way?The Dr. Doom stuff is okay, but just so, well... thin. Doom is nothing at all like the classic villain in the FF comics. Here, he's just a guy who's mad at Reed Richards for frustrating his attempts to make money from the cosmic storm experiment, and for wooing Sue away from him. These are believable motivations, but not very interesting ones. And having Doom slowly turning into a being of metal, ala the X-Men's Colossus, was a needless change. Doom's \\"superpower\\" was always his intellect. Insane intellect, but intellect. And why NOT keep him as the monarch of the fictional Balkan country of Latveria? There are tons of examples of male monarchs in recent history (Prince Rainier, for one), monarchs who studied in the U.S. during their formative years and could have met a Reed Richards type and established an uneasy friendship. Then Reed could have went to his friend- now a monarch in Europe- and asked for funding for the cosmic ray experiment. But here Doom is just a boring Donald Trump type, with a little scientific knowledge. Hey, I know super-hero movies need to make some changes from the original comics source material, but why take out great, entertaining aspects of the original material and replace them with watered-down stuff?I could go on and on, but I'll just make one or two more quick observations: Picturing Jessica Alba as I read this novelization, I began to feel that she is much too glamourous for the role of Sue Storm. I have no problem with her being in the movie, but she would have been better off as one of Johnny's girlfriends. Or better yet, as Alicia Masters. Wouldn't that be a kick... the monstrous Thing's girlfriend geing hotter than any of the women following Johnny around? It would add an interesting subtext to Ben's and Johnny's friendship, his secret jealousy of Ben's girlfriend. But, no, they went for a much simpler and less interesting idea: let's make Sue really hot.To end on a positive note, there's a pretty good battle at the end in the streets of New York (though it doesn't really do anything new), and, earlier, a nice scene in a planetarium between Reed and Sue, as they begin to reach out to one another. And, without revealing too much, the producers leave things open for the return of Dr. Doom in a sequel, a Dr. Doom much closer to the conception of the character in the comics. We'll see.But, in the end, and just from reading the novelization, I'd give the story a C/C- (readable but nothing special) and the characterizations a B/B+. And, who knows, if they don't junk up the movie with too much rock music, and the Extreme sports stuff doesn't take center stage TOO much, we may still have a watchable movie that will permit the production of a better sequel.Oh, one final thought: none of the criticisms mentioned above are Peter David's fault. He didn't write the movie, only this novelization of it. He remains an entertaining writer who did his best here, though one gets the feeling he wrote some scenes through gritted teeth, and refused to fully embrace those scenes containing especially heavy doses of dumb-ness. But I don't think anyone will hold that against him. After all, most people agree with the old saying that says (paraphrased in a less vulgar way here) there are certain things that simply can't be polished."},{"Title":"Fantastic Four","review":"The only reason this didn't get a five is because I need to actually see how Doom translates on the screen...being a Doom fanatic, it will be important to see how this works.Overall, the characterizations are flawless for the F4...The Thing is miserable over his rocky exterior, the Human Torch is arrogant, cocky, and a ladies man, the two of them bicker back and forthy like they should, Invisible Womanis the motherly type, trying to keep everyone focused and offer support. She is also the director of genetic research at Von Doom Industries.

Also upon learning that the always ''fantastic'' Peter David was writting the tie in novel,my anticipation grew. David has captured on page what I as a moviegoer had always pictured a F.F. film to be.

Even more disasapointing is that I enjoy many of Peter David's original works. When he \\"adds\\" to pump up the story...to make this into a book...it is useless, boring wasteless stuff.

All he has to do is convince billionaire (and nemesis) Victor Van Doom, to help him reach a cosmic storm in order to observe it. While Victor agrees to the use of his private space station, the price is almost all profit made from this research. On the space station, Reed and the rest of his team: best friend, Ben Grimm; ex-girlfriend, Susan Storm; her hotshot brother, Johnny Storm; as well as Doom himself, are shocked when something goes amiss and everyone is exposed to the cosmic storm.Back on Earth, they discover that the cloud has altered their DNA, giving each a type of super power. Reed, Susan, Ben, and Johnny band together in an effort to analyze what has happened to them and find a way to reverse the effects. Mr. Fantastic: Reed has the ability to stretch and contort his body. The Invisible Woman: Susan can make herself invisible and create an energy shield. The Human Torch: Johnny is able to go up in flames- literally- and fly. The Thing: Ben is now rock-hard and has superhuman strength. Unfortunately, Van Doom has also been given powers, and unlike the others, decided to use them for evil. Now he is bent on revenge for the loss of power the cosmic storm fiasco caused and will do anything to destroy Reed and the rest of the \`Fantastic Four'.While the Fantastic Four novelization was not up to the same level as others have been, it was still a good read. There were a couple discrepancies between the book and movie, which was a little annoying. The storyline itself focused on how the FF got their powers and why they became a team more than anything else. The book makes the characters seem a little more real, which I liked."},{"Title":"Fondue (Quick & Easy Series) (Quick & Easy (Silverback))","review":"This is a nice, useful book. It's short, with only sixty pages, but it does manage to pack a fair amount of info in there, and include some very nice fondue recipes (how many fondue recipes are out there, anyway?) It focuses more on dinner, rather than dessert fondues, but has a wide variety of styles, so there should be a recipe for every taste here.Szwillus uses five main categories: Cheese fondues; Oil fondues; Stock fondues; International fondues; and Side dishes and sweet fondues. She includes a recipe table, which shows a list of the various recipes and whether they are easy or hard, can be made fast or take more time, lists calories per serving, and other criteria by which to pick a specific one.

Among the topics covered are validation, risk and return, options, capital budgeting, capital structure, dividend policy, working capital management and financial analysis and planning. The author bases his various examples and illustrations on India, one of the fast growing economies in the world.Although the book is written in simple, straightforward English, it is not meant for those with little or elementary knowledge of finance and accounting. Postgraduate students of business studies, accounting, commerce or management as well as finance executives should find the book very useful in developing their skills in the analysis and interpretation of financial statements and data.Since the exercises and cases are from a developing country (India), students from developing countries should benefit by learning from examples that are more familiar and applicable to their environment. Since business is now increasingly on a global basis, readers from developed countries will also benefit from insights into the perspectives of developing countries."},{"Title":"They Asked for a Paper","review":"Good collection.

I would have considered this a 4 star book save the wretched ending.Frankly, I think the &quot;hero&quot; is a cad and a bounder and I predict that this marriage will be happy for about 2 - 3 years, right until she has the requisite heir, and then he will be out philandering with a bit of muslin or willing widow. What Mona Gedney has created here is the backstory for one of those awful marriages that so many Regency heroes are the product of: a love match turned to implacable hatred, where the husband and wife can't be in the same city, much less share a home or a bed. Read through the end of this book, and tell me that you don't see the breakdown of this marriage down the road.That being said, the characters in the novel, save the hero, are delightful and fully fleshed out. The story is riveting, with lots of twists and turns that keep you reading right up until the end. Once I was down to the last dozen pages or so, I was wondering if there were pages missing - there didn't seem to be any way to clear up all the twists in the story so quickly. The book ended rapidly, with a couple of pages of exposition that were highly unsatisfying and did not live up to the promise of the rest of the book. This is one book that would have ended better if the heroine had ended up alone at the end, as it is rather obvious that the author intends the other gentleman for another lady. All of these issues could have also been resolved (there are circumstances that I might be willing to forgive the cad) in a longer novel. I think the author was truly hampered by having to tell this story in a short form Regency."},{"Title":"A Love Affair For Lizzie (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"A better title for this book, would be, IMO - LIZZY GROWS UP - you'll see why if you read this book.This is a very hard review to write. LIZZIE'S LOVE AFFAIRS is an exceptionally well-written book. There are so many elements that are in place for a really top-of-the-line, superb read. The writing is exceptional, the characterizations are really, really good, the people in the story come alive, and the scenery comes alive as well. Ms. Gedney is one of those rare writers who can make you feel what she is writing about - I actually *felt* Vienna, the setting for most of this book... However, as the previous reviewers have mentioned, there are some very basic problems here, and it really is a pity, as this did have the potential of being a truly outstanding read.Matthew and Lizzie have grown up together. As they get older, they slowly fall in love, and they informally agree that they will get married as soon as Matthew comes back from the army. Lizzie agrees to wait for Matthew to come back, and she has no desire or inclination to \\"see the world\\" herself - Lizzie is a \\"homebody\\" and is quite content to live abroad vicariously through her sweetheart's letters, until ... they seem to stop coming... and until.... The final letter where he informs her that he is now engaged - to someone else.Lizzie develops a plan to go abroad with a family friend, not to win him back, you understand, but to show him what he has lost...The only problem, and the MAJOR problem with this book, is the ending. At about page 200, I realized that this author would need another 200 pages, at least, to finish up all the loose threads, and there are only 60 pages left. Well, I was right. Almost up until the very, very end, we have no idea how the book will end, when suddenly, she chooses, they get married, THE END. Worse than the quick finish is the melancholy tone of the last twenty pages - not only do we not understand the ending, it doesn't even seem as though the AUTHOR understands the ending, she writes about it almost as you would a tragedy! When you read a romance, you expect a happy ending, but this book does NOT have one. True, \\"they\\" get married, but it seems as if even the AUTHOR was not sure of their \\"happily-ever-after\\" - she spends most of the book explaining why she CAN'T marry him, and suddenly she marries him? Was this because this author was not sure how to end it, and just finished it off quickly? Was it because she had a deadline, and wasn't finished? Was it because she did not have enough length to explain her ending, and would have made more sense if she would have more time to explain it? Or was it simply because, she had made herself such a tangle that even she herself couldn't see a way out for anyone to have a happy ending?Truthfully, I don't know why the author ended this book the way she did, but I do know that if you were looking for a happy ending kind of a story, you will not find this a satisfying read. And that's really a pity, because this book had all the hallmarks of a truly great book. This book had almost everything else, I especially loved the way Lizzie is portrayed, as a real person, and how she learns about life, and how she changes throughout the book. I also like the way this story came alive.But unfortunately, without a good and satisfying ending, everything else falls into the background. Like I said before, that is really, really a big pity, because this book REALLY had tremendous potential. This would have been a five star PLUS for me, if not for the very disappointing ending."},{"Title":"A Love Affair For Lizzie (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"When Lizzie Lancaster was 15 years old, she was in love with a man she had known her whole life: Matthew Webster. When Matthew leaves for war, they have an understanding. Someday, Lizzie and Matthew will be married.Three years later, Lizzie receives a heart-renching missive from her beau. Matthew is engaged to another woman--a Miss Teresa Blackwell! Lizzie is determined to show Matthew she is more worldly than he realizes. She decides to take matters into her own hands. With a friend, Lizzie travels to Vienna... where Matthew is.The back of the book fails to mention the OTHER man who becomes a large part of Lizzie Lancaster's life. Daniel Thoreau, an American, becomes her traveling partner and fast friend.I enjoyed this book very much. Every character lent something special to the story. I especially enjoy books where the heroine is courted by not one, but two (nearly three, in this book) suitors. It makes the book less predictable. &quot;An Affair for Lizzie&quot; was definitely unpredictable--and it was flavored with sweeping intrigue.Unpredictable indeed! I was stunned by the last two chapters. Actually, &quot;stunned&quot; isn't the appropriate word. I felt slighted, devastated and heartbroken. I wish I could have sat down with the writer for a few minutes to tell her to CHANGE THE ENDING!!! In my opinion, it was incredibly rushed... and Lizzie wasn't with the right guy (I'm not going to say who I think the &quot;right guy&quot; was. After reading this book, however, I am sure you will agree with me). It seemed so obvious to me. *sigh* Oh well...Had this book ended in an unhurried, APPROPRIATE way, it would have easily gotten 5 stars from me. It is interesting the whole way through--and it's better than anything I've read from Mona Gedney thus far. I would recommend it... though bear in mind you might be disappointed. Why the author went in the direction she did, I have no idea."},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"I read this years ago in an anthropology/sociology class in college, and I can say that it still carries as much weight today as it did then. Jay manages to weave entertaining narration with factual reporting, resulting in a moving work that points a critical finger at our society. I've actually met the author, and can say that he is an honest, engaging and professional writer. At no point did he milk the drama angle of this work, nor use it to further his own agenda. I noticed another reviewer called this book &quot;socialist junk&quot;; to this person I say: just because this work is a testament to some of the failures of America's precious capitalist model does not immediately make it socialist. Moreover, if socialism means having a conscience about racism and socioeconomic discrimination, then sign me up!"},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"This book provides a thorough account of the aspirations and expectations of two male peer groups residing in a public housing project. Both peer groups, although originating from similar class locations, have distinct aspirations resulting from their racial lived experiences. The peer group consisting mostly of young black men (The Brothers) supported the achievement ideology that we live in an open society. They viewed the hardships faced by previous generations was a result of racial discrimination barriers that (theoretically) cease to exist. They applied themselves in socially acceptable practices such as excelling in school and keeping out of trouble. In contrast, the peer group consisting of mostly young white men (Hallway Hangers) rejected the achievement ideology and had low aspirations of their position in the labor market. They realized through family and friends that their chances of getting out of the projects is slim leading most of the Hallway Hangers dropped out of school and smoked dope, among other illegal activities. Despite the disjuncture of both groups' levels of aspirations, both failed to get out of poverty. MacLeod hung out with both of these male peer groups in an effort to understand their daily meanings of the role of education and their future aspirations rather than relying exclusively on statistical data.I give this book four stars because MacLeod failed to take into consideration the aspirations and expectations of young women. Instead he concentrated solely on the role of race and class. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand how societal structures restrict and limit the actions of individuals. Furthermore this book challenges the myth that education creates a level playing field for all regardless of race or class (and gender too ~ although not addressed here)."},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"This book gives an excellent insight into the lives of teenagers living in a low-income neighborhood. The book calls into question the American achievement ideology and forces the reader to reconsider his or her pre-concieved notions on poverty and its causes. The truth is that people aren't poor because they are lazy; they are poor because of numberous structural barriers in society that basicly trap them into poverty. This book is excellent for anyone interested in the social structure, but it would be better for someone who has never thought about the way society works and has the kind of closed-mindedness that cause many upper and middle-class people to view people of lesser social standing as lazy."},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"This book explores the lives of two groups of inner-city teenagers. One group adamently believes in the achievement ideology, and the other group rejects it. Hence the title, the outcome for both groups is the same. I recommend this book to those who refuse to cast away their pre-conceived notions that those who live in poverty are lazy and stupid. This book is a painfully real account of the different ways in which society plays a detrimental role in the lives of the less fortunate, while allowing the upper class to place the blame on the victims themselves (in the name of the acheivement ideology)."},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"I read this book from cover to cover (which, in its current edition, is quite some doing) and was absorbed by the reality of the stories all the way through. It's not always the easiest book to read, but the fact that the author really immersed himself in the lives and world of his subjects for several years, seeking to truly understand them, is evident on every page. Tracking two groups of lower-class men from 'the projects' (one black and one white) for more than twenty-five years, the book remains the gold standard for exploring the issue of social mobility over the life course in the United States. That the original edition was written before the author even graduated from college, and that he went on to a career as a parish priest instead of an academic sociologist, makes it all the more impressive.The author does have his own biases, but he never draws conclusions that aren't supported by the evidence. And the evidence is overwhelming: it usually takes more than a 'good attitude' or a 'strong work ethic' to get ahead in America. It also takes many of the substantive and symbolic resources that middle-class children take for granted, yet middle-class parents are careful to pass down to them. Meanwhile, the mistakes and poor choices that middle-class youth easily overcome can be devastating for poor youth, starting a downward spiral from which it is very difficult to recover. Lastly, this book describes in vivid detail what all the statistics report: that, on average, poor black children have more ambition than poor white children. It isn't for lack of *wanting* the American dream of a middle-class life and a willingness to play by the rules; it's the lack of other things which MacLeod discusses: inside connections to good jobs, mentoring and sponsorship, and frankly, in some cases the 'right' skin color. Yes, racism is alive and well among U.S. employers, especially those hiring entry-level employees in major metro areas. Ironically, the 'Brothers' refuse to see this racism as an obstacle, choosing instead to blame themselves for their failings -- thus we cannot explain their disappointing outcomes in terms of a 'victim mentality.' Meanwhile, the white 'Hallway Hangers' frequently resort to racist explanations for their own inability to get or keep a job. It's the white subjects who claim racial victimhood, not the black ones.By midlife many of these men, black and white alike, are struggling personally and professionally. And yet most are persevering, one way or another. And there are some exceptional cases too, where an individual has 'made it' into the middle class. But they are the exceptions that prove the rule, and the rule is this: where you finish depends a lot on where you start. It's certainly possible to rise up out of poverty, but it's certainly not likely -- for reasons that have as much to do with unsupportive (or even opposing) social structures as they do with individual (in)action and choices. Mainstream culture is no help, either. It's not that most of us hate the poor, it's just that we fear them, misunderstand them, have no patience for them, or prefer them less than the more affluent (people more like us).This book isn't a 'liberal' book, even though its author's own political agenda is clearly identifiable as such. He doesn't pull any punches; he holds his subjects accountable for their actions, whether positive or negative. Yet he does so with gracious humanity, possibly because of his calling as a minister of the gospel. I wish that every conservative would read this book, and could do so with an open mind. How often do we speak of people we know so little about? At the same time, I wish that every liberal would read it, too, and acknowledge that capitalism has a vital role to play in developing poor people's lives and communities. Although the author didn't emphasize its significance, I took note of the fact that the real standouts in the book are both successful as self-employed entrepreneurs. Liberals should welcome business education and entrepreneurship as a more effective and efficient path out of poverty than any number of government programs. Poor people -- especially poor men -- need more steady well-paying jobs, to be sure, but we need to stop thinking of them exclusively or even primarily as job-holders and start seeing them also as job-creators."},{"Title":"Ain't No Makin' It: Aspirations And Attainment In A Low-income Neighborhood, Expanded Edition","review":"This book does a great job of investigating class structure in America by taking out the issue of race.

If you read this book and come out with the view that \\"they should have worked harder\\", then I believe you are only accepting the view that these people projected onto you. THEY believe they won't make it, so they don't do any work. Also to these Calvinists, maybe you'd like to do a little research of your own into the US education system, especially concentrating on the amount spent on these individuals.

I was forced to read this text for a Social Anthropology class. The boys that MacLeod follows throughout his research fail because the just didn't try hard enough. The one boy who almost succeeds fails not because of social constraints but because he could not shed his tendancy towards poor behavior- such as having children at too young an age.This book only reinforces the \\"poor me\\" mantra- \\"its Capitalism's fault, it creates poverty.\\"Coming from \\"ahem\\" less than savory roots myself, I can tell you that Capitalism's fostering of competition does nothing but good in society. Those who have the drive to succeed, do so (I'll be attending my first year of law school in the fall), and those that have no self dicipline don't succeed.No amount of education can change that. While the boys followed in the text didn't have the greatest educational beginnings, one of them did make it to a community college and could have made it further, but blew it by getting a girl pregnant. That's not capitalism's fault - I think its more the fault of the \\"free love\\" culture.

Sarah Burton is technically the main one; but the tapestry is enormous, and Holtby has such a sure touch for characterization that she breathes life into even the minor figures.In breadth of scope and generosity of heart and mind, Winifred Holtby reminds me of George Eliot. She seldom judges, though she obviously has her preferences and dislikes. She sees the interrelationships of all classes and all actions.But Holtby is a better stylist than Eliot. She is both clear and poetic, both brief and profound. Her apprenticeship as a journalist served her well. She gets right to the heart of feelings and facts, yet they shimmer with life and richness.She is particularly good on the imponderables--why a sensible and self-confident progressive like Sarah Burton should fall so incongruously in love with a feudal troglodyte like Robert Carne; why Carne should sacrifice everything for his neurotic-and-psychotic wife Muriel.She is also good on depicting the sweep of history. Though her characters are real people, they are also emblematic of historical trends: the long slow death of the landed aristocracy, the encroachment of urbanization and industrialization, the flattening of tragedy and democratization of hope.A wonderful book"},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"I hope the recent BBC/Masterpiece Classic version of \\"South Riding\\" will compel more people to read this beautiful book, and I hope its publisher will issue a new edition here in the states. It is superb.In \\"South Riding,\\" Winifred Holtby presents a mosaic of Yorkshire life in the 1930s, exhibiting profound understanding and compassion for a wide array of characters of different classes, ages, and aspirations. There are probably about 15 main characters involved but she is so skillful in describing each of their circumstances that I had no trouble keeping track of them as I progressed through the book. Each chapter is like a perfect short story of its own, providing a character's background or motivation, introducing an obstacle or conflict, showing people as allies or at cross-purposes, always moving the action forward.\\"South Riding\\" has everything: family love and family dysfunction, selflessness, greed, romance, loneliness, poverty, wealth, sex, births, deaths, folly, nobility, humor, hope, despair, good and bad government, conflict, compassion, corruption, and both sad AND happy endings! It is similar to George Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\" in its ambitious, broad canvas of English life and its attention to individual detail. But I agree with another reviewer here that it is less long-winded and preachy than Eliot (sorry, George). Holtby's style is brisk and clear and very easy to read. I believe \\"Middlemarch\\" was set in 1830s England, and I wonder if Holtby was consciously writing a \\"Middlemarch\\" for the 20th century. She certainly succeeded admirably. Sadly, \\"South Riding\\" was first published in 1936, a year after Holtby's death at age 37.Having read the book, my only regret is that so many of my friends have not. Perhaps the 2011 TV adaptation will give it new life. To those who liked the TV show, please DO read the book. As is often the case, the book includes more detailed plot and characterization. It's beautiful and wise, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"I would never have read this if a friend had not lent it to me with the news that Masterpiece would soon be airing the dramatization of itSouth Riding. It took me a couple of chapters to get into the story. Unlike other reviewers, I did have trouble keeping so many characters straight and was too lazy to keep looking back at the list with descriptions at the beginning of the book. It was also a little annoying to keep being switched from character to character every chapter or scene, but that is a typical writing device. But, soon I was completely engrossed in the life and times of the characters of 1933 South Riding, Yorkshire. What a gem of storytelling. By reading the book so soon prior to watching the BBC production, however, I was quite critical of the show. They left out so much! They would have done much better to have dramatized it over several episodes as Masterpiece Theatre productions used to do in the good old days. I did find the casting superb, and I'm sure if I had seen the TV production later or had not read the book, I would have found it fine."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"It's difficult to summon enough superlatives to adequately describe this ambitious, epic novel. Other readers have rightly compared \\"South Riding\\" to Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\" and the two books are indeed very similar in theme and sweep. Holtby drops a literary magnifying glass on the fictitious Yorkshire city of Kiplington and its environs; her characters range from gentry farmers to rural slum dwellers and everything in-between. Her everyday heroes are a struggling, reactionary farmer, an elderly and maternal alderwoman, a fiery and progressive school teacher, a bright girl desperate to escape the slums - and so many more. The book begins slowly and there are so many characters and threads to follow, I found it slow-going for almost 100 pages. But when it finally took off I was absolutely riveted. The cover blurb on my copy of \\"South Riding\\" indicates that it is primarily an \\"opposites attract\\" sort of romance, but this book is far more ambitious and compelling than that, showing how ordinary people did and did not adapt to the broad social changes of the 20th century. Holtby's writing is very straight-forward but there are some extraordinarily lyrical passages and moments of exceptional insight, beauty and grace. I am so glad I stuck with this book - it is just spectacularly rewarding.There is a minor character in the book, a middle-aged woman who is dying of some unnamed wasting disease. Her story is not as well-integrated to the plot as are other characters, and I wondered why she was included. Her purpose in the narrative becomes very poignant when you realize that the author was terminally ill as she wrote \\"South Riding,\\" and that the book was published postumously after her death at age 37."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"As every schoolboy knows, or at least as every schoolboy knew before the local government reforms of the 1970s, the county of Yorkshire was traditionally divided into three ridings, North, East and West. Those schoolboys who inquired (as I did) why there was not a South Riding were generally told by their schoolmasters in a lofty tone of voice that as the word \\"riding\\" derived from an Old English word meaning \\"a third part\\" it would be illogical for there to be four ridings rather than three.Winifred Holtby clearly also seems to have felt that there should have been a South Riding, as she used this as the title of her best-known novel. She is not writing about the area around Sheffield which is today known as South Yorkshire, but which in the 1930s was still part of the West Riding. Her South Riding is her native East Riding by another name; like Hardy, she used the device of disguising real places under fictitious names. Hull becomes Kingsport, Beverley Flintonbridge, Bridlington Hardrascliffe, and so on.Although written in the fourth decade of the twentieth century, \\"South Riding\\", is in many ways a traditional nineteenth century novel. With its linear narrative, omniscient narrator and panoramic view of a wide cross-section of society it is reminiscent of the work of Dickens, Bennett and the George Eliot of \\"Middlemarch\\". Another literary influence appears to have been Charlotte Bronte. The portrait of Robert Carne, an aloof, patrician Yorkshire squire struggling to cope with the burden of a mentally-ill wife and to bring up a young daughter, owes a lot to Edward Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre\\", and there are certainly similarities between Carne's wife Muriel and Rochester's wife Bertha. (Holtby's contemporary Daphne du Maurier also drew upon \\"Jane Eyre\\" in her \\"Rebecca\\").Holtby was politically on the Left; she was a convinced socialist, pacifist and feminist. A combination of political radicalism and artistic conservatism was, however, more common than one might think. In some leftist circles it was customary to decry artistic modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism\\". Holtby herself did not go so far. She was by no means hostile to the modern movement; she wrote, for example, a critical appreciation of Virginia Woolf. She believed, however, that a novel with a traditional structure was a better vehicle for conveying social and political ideas to a wide audience than a modernist one, and \\"South Riding\\" is very much a novel with a political message. Much of the book describes the proceedings of the South Riding County Council and the struggle by the reformist faction on the Council to bring about social reform in the teeth of much determined opposition from conservative elements, of whom Carne is the most prominent. The eight sections into which the novel is divided are named after various committees of the Council, such as \\"Education\\" or \\"Housing and Town Planning\\".I will not attempt to summarise the plot, as there are numerous interconnected strands, following the fortunes of a large number of characters drawn from all sectors of society. The most important strand deals with the relationship between Carne and Sarah Burton, the headmistress of a girl's school, who falls in love with him. As Carne is a traditionalist landowner, deeply reactionary in his political views, and as Sarah in many ways represents the author's own social radicalism, theirs might seem an unlikely romance. (Sarah's close friend, the elderly Alderman Mrs Beddows, is a portrait of the author's own mother). Yet Holtby, unlike some writers with a political agenda, was not so prejudiced that she refused to see any good in her opponents. She makes little secret of the fact that she finds Carne's politics deplorable, but allows him some good qualities as a man. He is not a capitalist ogre but a man who, by his own standards, tries to do his best for his wife, his daughter and even his workers and tenants, despite his straitened financial circumstances. Most of his income comes from farming, and farmers have been badly hit by the Great Depression of the 1930s.Another of Carne's good qualities is his honesty, a quality not shared by all those who claim to speak for progress. Another important thread in the book is a scheme by the Machiavellian Councillor Anthony Snaith to develop a piece of land for social housing. Although such housing is indeed desperately needed by the poor of the district, Snaith's real purpose is to make a good deal of money from a complicated land deal. One of the most vividly-drawn characters is Snaith's hypocritical associate, Councillor Alfred Ezekiel Huggins, a devout Methodist lay preacher and equally devout womaniser who somehow manages to reconcile both his womanising and his corrupt scheming with his conscience. Joe Astell, a radical Socialist Councillor, is not personally corrupt, yet in his zeal for social reform allows himself to become associated with Snaith and Huggins's scheme, something which Carne resolutely refuses to do.A third major plot thread involves Lydia Holly, an academically gifted schoolgirl from a poor working-class family whose future is threatened when her mother dies and she is forced to look after her younger siblings. Mrs Holly is one of a number of characters suffering from terminal or life-threatening illnesses. This reflects the fact that Winifred Holtby was herself seriously ill while writing the book and knew that she did not have long to live. (She died, in fact, shortly after completing it and did not live to see it published).Yet this is not a morbid or depressing book; in many ways its conclusion is an optimistic one. Although the book was written at a time of economic hardship, Holtby does not dwell on misery but offers a positive message that conditions can be changed for the better, and her optimism can be admired even by those who do not share her political analysis. My one criticism would be that there are perhaps too many plot threads, making it difficult to follow the changing fortunes of so many difficult characters. Overall, however, it is a powerfully written depiction of English provincial life during its period."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"I saw this presentation on Masterpiece Classics, and had never read...or heard of the book. Usually, when I enjoy a play, or movie, I like the book even better, so I decided to read the book. I really enjoyed it. It was a new find for me....always nice, and a treat. I found they had done a superb job with the play, following the book nicely. I'm only sorry the author did not write more books, as I'm sure I would read them also. The heroine was 'before her time' with lots of energy and wonderful goals. You even come to enjoy and sympathize with the antagonist before it's done. Nice touch, delightful read."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"This is my absolute favorite British soap-opera story...tremendous acting, very involved characters, a deep weaving of village life..the good and the bad. On top of having the dvd I managed to get a copy of the book and am further enthralled, Holtby was a superb writer and 'South Riding' has been compared to 'Middlemarch' in the scope of the story of an era long gone and all of the characters within. I have watched the dvd dozens of times, know all the dialogue by heart, yet never tire of always seeing something new which i had missed in the past. Good casting, marvelous characters, some quite funny, some to pity....a truly remarkable story....too bad we did not have many more from the author. I wish there were folks I could discuss my feelings with about this series and book."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"I just finished South Riding for a book club. I'm not sure who chose this book or why--perhaps the BBC miniseries was good. This 500+ page book should have been about 200 pages to speed up the plodding, boring storyline. Nothing terribly interesting happens, and I never truly engaged in these characters. When things finally seemed to be interesting, an important character died. Overall, this was a LONG, disappointing read. I don't agree with the hype about Miss Holtby's craft."},{"Title":"South Riding","review":"I loved the main, strong school principal character.

Set in Fiction with characters and dialog, back room dealings and alternative motives are played out chapter by chapter. The writing is excellent and plots complicated. I saw the series on PBS and am pleased to read the original text by the author. It is a great historical lesson in government. Plus the intriguing romance angle keeps me turning the page."},{"Title":"Sky Ape","review":"I must freely admit that I don't get this series about a millionaire/freelance detective gorilla who sometimes zooms around on a jetpack. The black and white artwork is pretty sweet, although sometimes the stylistic shifts are a little jarring. But the story-which is nominally about his quest to recover the &quot;suspense jacket&quot; in order to understand his pas-careens so wildly around, jam-packed with absurdity and digressions, that it's hard to maintain an interest. I would say it's worth checking out for the artwork, but don't even try to follow the story."},{"Title":"Sky Ape","review":"This could be one of the strangest comics I've ever read... it's reminiscent of the works of Grant Morrison and FLAMING CARROT, but draws a bit more from the world of MONTY PYTHON, THE KIDS IN THE HALL and Woody Allen. The story concerns a talking gorilla who happens to be a crime-fighting millionaire but spends most of his time drinking beer and playing RISK with his buddies, an odd assortment of half-witted sidekicks (though one of them, a chick who turns into a bird and looks a bit like EMMA PEEL is very cool). The gorilla, whose name is Kirk, is looking for clues to his past, of which his only clue is a series of odd visions in which he's a player for the BOSTON RED SOX. When he is presented with a strange case--to help uncover THE SUSPENSE JACKET, which allows the wearer to see the past and/or future--he feels it could be the key to figuring out his origin once and for all. The story is about as far from linear as you can get--Kirk and crew zip from place to place and scenes just sprout out of nowehere or end abruptly a la MONTY PYTHON. Takes a bit of getting used to (especially the scene where, without any warning, Kirk and a gang of 10-speed bicycles take on ninjas, guys in hot dog suits, and a giant penguin) but folks looking for a truly unique, truly hilarious and seriously \\"different\\" comic book will love SKY APE. The website... is a hoot as well."},{"Title":"Back Toward the Future","review":"From the Back Cover of the Baker Book House 1989 Edition:Biblical prophecy comprises one of the most rewarding topics of Bible study.

Of the collection of SAT books on my shelf, this entry from Barron's is the one I use most often for supplementary practice and reinforcement.Barron's approach is to give much practice on writing and evaluation essays while providing much practice in specific components of the essay like main idea, supporting details, sentence variety, and parallel structure.The grammar section is wonderful because it touches on all the types of errors typically found in the SAT writing section. Plenty of practice is provided for the student. (Note that I just used the passive voice, an unacceptable sin on the SAT.)The design and layout of the book are good, and the font is very readable. In other books of this type I've encountered multiple errors (unintended) in the practice tests, and questionable \\"correct\\" answers with which my students and I have had issue. The Barron's book is no exception. Because of errors in the practice tests, this probably wouldn't be a good book for a student to use independently. It's best used with a tutor who can point out the annoying and unnecessary errors.I'd like to see a better analysis of incorrect answers with a breakdown by specific topics. For example, it would be helpful to pinpoint areas needing practice such as pronoun agreement or comparisons."},{"Title":"Writing Workbook for the New SAT (Barron's SAT Writing Workbook)","review":"I purchased this workbook because i got a 500 in my writing section of the SAT.

First, a good workbook needs tons of practice drills. While this has 4 practice tests, if practice test were what I was looking for, then I would go to the \\"blue book\\" put out by college board, which has 10 tests. Moreover, the tests will mirror the actual exams better than any other book since it's made by the test makers themselves. Second, a good workbook needs to dissect the skills and concepts that are on the test and drive them home to the readers and give them sufficient practice that will translate into higher scores on the exam. But this book doesn't have enough content or practice on the skills and concepts. Third, a good workbook needs to have excellent explanations because increasing your skills doesn't come from empty practice alone, you need to be TAUGHT, and the only way teaching can take place in a book is through very detailed explanations. While the explanations are decent for the practice tests, there are no real explanations to the drills!Overall, this is ok, but there are better choices for workbooks and better choices for practice tests."},{"Title":"Writing Workbook for the New SAT (Barron's SAT Writing Workbook)","review":"I got a 2400, and I am pretty sure it was due to this book.

This book targets specific grammar exercises in each section, so you become adept at recognizing the specific problems in every sentence. There is a plethora of multiple choice practice; I did not even complete the whole workbook.However, this points to one drawback: this book really cannot teach you how to write well on the essay. It only can offer you a few tips, and an example of two, but self-imposed practice is the way to go, and have others read your writing afterwards.I RECOMMEND this book if you need hardcore prepping for multiple choice.

In &quot;Timemaster&quot; we still have the outstanding science -- with enough of an improvement in character and plot to satisfy most Sci-Fi fans.When dealing with his &quot;neg matter&quot; plants -- and the opportunities such creatures would provide for relatively intstaneous space and time travel, Forward continues to fill his books with life forms radically different from anything we have (or can really imagine) on Earth -- and make them believable.This one is a good read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"I have read several of Dr. Forward's books, and this is, by far, my favorite---I read it twice and am considering a third reading. Dr. Forward writes &quot;hard&quot; science fiction, and Timemaster is no exception, sticking closely with the known laws of physics. The concepts presented in this book are intriguing and Mr. Hunter's solution to the problem of his nemesis in a delightful surprise. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"Space entrepeneur Randy Hunter discovers a kind of space-dwelling plant composed of negative matter, which allows him to develop interstellar spaceflight and time travel, not to mention acheiving all of his dreams, winning the girl, foiling his drug-addicted rival, and becoming an all-around great guy. ... Author Robert L. Forward never lets us forget how wonderful and brilliant he thinks his hero is, which came off as more than a little self-congratulatory since I couldn't shake the feeling that he was meant to serve as an alter-ego for Forward himself. There is much juvenile one-upmanship between Randy and his cartoonish arch-rival, Oscar, who is just as bad as Randy is good and whose dislike is never explained as anything more than jealousy (but then, who wouldn't be jealous of such a terrific guy as Randy). I found the key plot device of the Silverhairs to be ludicrous and uninteresting. The sole saving grace of this book is some fascinating business toward the end concerning time travel and the interaction between the Randys of various time periods. Had this aspect of the story been more prominent, it would have been a better book, but instead it is buried among juvenile characterizations and dull plotting."},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"I like most of Forward's books. To this day, I'll often bring Dragon's Egg and Roche World down from the shelves to give them another glance or two.Sadly, this is the least of his work. The protagonist is a shallow bit of more-than-obvious wish fulfillment. This is a character that starts off by saying that his goal is to become the wealthiest person in the universe and to live forever. Mind you, this is a person who already starts out as a billionaire, so we're not exactly talking about some sort of Heinleinian competent man who pulls himself up by his bootstraps. This is a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth who's only ambition is to replace it with a platinum one.This is compounded by the fact that the central plot device that drives him towards his mastery of space and time (seriously, these descriptions of him are actual chapter headings!) is the accidental discovery of an alien life form that excretes matter with negative mass.The book is best when Forward takes time to consider the implications of negative mass, although I'm hesitant to call it hard science-fiction given that Forward is basically postulating a blatant violation of known physics and then methodically working his way through what such a violation would imply. It's a clever sort of logical game, but it veers away from his normal standard of sticking with known and reasonably extrapolations of physics and taking them to their logical conclusions.Along the way, we get swipes at all sorts of things that we can infer that Forward hates, including and especially (remarkably enough) animal rights activism. His antagonists are nothing than a bunch of bleating straw men whose only function is to be repeatedly knocked down by the neigh god-like hero of the story.The overall effect is a story that seems petty, self-indulgent with a weak-as-water plot.As I said, Forward has written some remarkable stories, but this is not one of them. Every author has a worst book and this one is it."},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"I'm a fan of sci-fi books, having read everything from Asimov to Zelany. I was hopefully this would be a good book considing what others have said about it. To put it bluntly, this book stinks.The hero is absolutely perfect, achieves everything and wins the girl. This may be an acceptable character to a target audience of 12 yr olds (see Johnny Quest or Asimov's Lucky Starr series) but just proves annoying to anyone beyond a middle school level education. Every other character proves to be just as badly developed as this. The science may be real and plausible but nothing else about this book is."},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"Reading Robert Forward's books is just plain fun. Forward takes an idea and develops the hell out of it and does everything you'd want to see done plus a few things you haven't thought of. In Timemaster the key discovery is that of negmatter. The ramifications of that discovery for one very lucky entrepreneur are explored. A high velocity space drive, wormholes and time machines fall out this one discovery and Forward explores them all, within the frameworks of a somewhat juvenile plot. It is the ideas and exploration that drive this story, and I read it with a delight that I can only remember from my days of reading Campbell-era SF when stories weren't so dystopian and serious.If you like hard, idea-driven SF, you don't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"Timemaster","review":"Billed as the \\"definitive\\" book on time travel, Timemaster disappoints on so many levels it's pointless to list them.

Did he not realize that people would move on and change in almost every way by 2036 - 2050?This book feels like it was written by Ayn Rand! The slagging of animal rights activists and the worship of wealth and over-consumption completely ruined what was left of the plot for me.

The sexual trysts were less than reviting, and the book was promoted as akin to \\"Sex in the City\\". Hardly. The front cover was far more titillating than the pages following. I completed the book due to my\\"once started, must finish a book rule\\"; and it was a book club selection. Rachel's writing style didn't capture the elements that might have made it a great read. It should have been a sophisticated story; however, the writing style didn't catch it. Sorry!"},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Obviously, this book is not a primer on how things are in China today. Nor is it an informative read if you have knowledge of Chinese and its people. To myself, however, I found the book entertaining and informative. The mid-1990s were a transitional time for China, and looking back, one can imagine how much things have changed since then.Translating some of the Chinese that Ms.DeWoskin uses was helpful to me, a member of the laowai. I had only wished the publisher had used pinyin instead of italics. The copy of the book I purchased is from the UK, published by Granta.The main irritant I found while reading the book was the assumption everybody's family got to travel around China when they were children. Ms. DeWoskin sure led a more learned and priviledged life than many in my proletarian circle. However, that is why she was able to write the book."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Rachel DeWoskin gives an account of her several years in China, straight from completing a degree in English at Columbia University in 1994, and staying until after the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. The time period of the book was one of significant change in China, with creeping capitalism and enormous economic changes occurring as a result.Childhood trips to China and studying Chinese in college gave her significant preparation, but the book describes some of the significant differences between Chinese and American cultures that make the Chinese seem mysterious and inscrutable to Americans. The book is a fascinating look at China's love-hate relationship with America.DeWoskin starts with a job with a PR firm for American companies doing business in China (trying to avoid making elementary mistakes that would embarrass them in China, with varying degrees of success), and chances into a role in a Chinese soap opera at $80/show that ended up being viewed by hundreds of millions of Chinese (the \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing\\" show of the book's title).I read this book after reading Ben Mezrich's Ugly Americans, as I wanted to read more about Asian culture (with a focus on China as an emerging economic power rather than Japan)--this was a good, lightweight introduction to some of the cultural differences in the context of an individual woman's somewhat amusing stories of her experiences there."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I really had to laugh reading the other lengthy online \\"reviews\\" about this book. I have doubts the other reviewers even read the whole book (it sounds like they read the dust jackets).I have a feeling this book was published only becuase there are so few \\"armchair\\" travel books or modern memoirs of China that it's lack of quality is overcome by the fact there is no competition.Ms. De Woskin writes this self-indulgent book with a \\"gee-whiz\\" look how lucky-I-am self promotion that comes out clearly in the text. The entire book is disingenous- as if we are all to belive that cunning and shrewdness are not involved in landing a starring role in a tv series and her quick ascent in a foreign corporations corporate ladder. And her idiotic lacing of factoids on Chinese history reads like an seventh graders poor essay \\"On China\\".What is utterly galling is her revelation that due to so-called \\"prior travel arrangements\\" she could not stay in China for the funeral of one of her best friends whom she was with on the night of his death and then exploits his story for her book-suggesting he had \\"shady\\" business dealings and sordidly tattle-telling his sex life.Give me a break, Rachel, lots of people have lived abroad, if you were shrewd enough to achieve everthything else you certainly could have managed a phone call to the airlines for something so important. But no better to exploit the story than actually have to be a real human being.Your parents should be ashamed and your readers along with them.Incredibly enough the author tells us her childhood was spent visiting China. How ridiculous is this claim when every one of her experiences with the Chinese quotodienne (sp?) is simply a rehash comparison of \\"it's not like this in America\\". One would think at least one prior trip to the country would have elevated the discourse.This book is a WASTE Of time and money from a ridiculous, immoral human being. It would have been more aptly titled \\"How I did a Chinese guy and the crickets taste like chicken : a memoir from an overly self-involved, overeducated jerk.Do not buy this book if you want travel info get National Georgrapgic travel book on China and read up Pearl S.

It was bland, like a dish without salt and spices.

I could not read more than a third of it."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This is a book about the western women and her depravity. It is about what the west produces, namely models, who only want to degrade themselves. Let us begin with the cover. A degrading picture of a western woman. It is all she has learned, the west offered her freedom to choose her life, it gave her possibilities, it didnt forcibly put a burka on her. And this is the result, degredation masquerading as scholarship. Some parts of this book may intirgue and titilate and keep the reader interested, some parts try to show how the west is influencing China. but let us recall who is telling the story? A self hating western woman who sees only other cultures, hates her own, and yearns to be scnatilly clad in another culture to attract foreign men. Not a suprise that the people profiled in this book, one is involved in threesomes, and the other two are abject racists, refusing to date their own people and 'only' dating those from another race, a program that is an insidious and sad as it is to be a racist and only date ones own. To judge based on race is wrong, and tragically it is all the westerner has learned. In an attempt to appreciate other cultures all the west does is obsess over them, self hating, never judging, and in doing so judging.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Having lived for much of the period from 2001 - 2004 in Suzhou, (about 50 miles west of Shanghai), I can categorically say that Rachel DeWoskin's new book, FOREIGN BABES IN CHINA, gets nearly everything right when it comes to Chinese culture and interpersonal relations. Her book is a fascinating account of a city, a country, and a culture in transition. The people around her, and she herself, suffer the contradictions of tradition versus modernity, socialism versus entrepreneurial capitalism, blind patriotism versus Westernization, and government control versus individual freedom, yet everyone zooms ahead to find their own way even as the book's timeline approaches the millennium.Ms. DeWoskin arrives in Beijing on something of a lark, a college grad with an English degree, a little Mandarin, and a desire for something adventurous. She has taken a position with the Beijing office of an international public relations firm (we later learn that \\"P.R.\\" sounds uncomfortably like the Chinese word for an unflattering body part) but quickly finds the work empty of content. She unexpectedly gets offered a spot as one of the two foreign female leads in a new Chinese soap opera entitled \\"Yang Niu Zai Beijing,\\" or \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing.\\" She is duped into signing a contract for far less than she's worth to the producers (there are still relatively few attractive young Western women in Beijing in 1995), and a series of acting misadventures and cast romances ensue. DeWoskin can barely separate her real-life feelings for her hunky co-star Wang Ling from their respective romantic roles in the soap opera. In the end, \\"Foreign Babes\\" is a huge success throughout China, and Ms. Dewoskin is recognized everywhere she goes as Jiexi, the \\"loose\\" Western woman who steals a married Chinese man (Wang Ling's character, Tianming) from his wife and takes him to America.The author eventually quits her P.R. job and takes on a series of small acting and spokesperson roles, and even takes a brief turn as a runway model. Along the way, she meets and briefly profiles four young Beijingers (two female and two male, despite oddly labeling their chapters, \\"Biographies of Model Babes\\") and describes their lives, beliefs, and aspirations. Each is fiercely independent and nontraditional, seeking to find their own identity and purpose in a newly-opened society. These four people are sometimes misinformed and often obstinate, even foolishly obstreperous, but there's no doubt they are brave, going where relatively few in their country have gone before.DeWoskin develops close relationships with each of her four Beijingers, including a live-in relationship with the actor/screenwriter Zhao Jun. The last one-third of the book details her post-Jiexi life, which seems to devolve into clubbing and bar-hopping punctuated by occasional vague hints at working. Two tragedies -- the sudden death of a close Chinese friend juxtaposed against the mistaken U.S./NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade -- bring DeWoskin's relationships and her Chinese life to an abrupt end just as the 20th Century is drawing to a close. It is time to go home, to find her place in her native country.Ms. DeWoskin tells her story in casual prose with easy pacing. Her writing is sometimes poignant and other times humorous. The reader feels her confusion about Chinese life and language; she doesn't even learn until later that her Chinese name, Du Ruiqiu (Du for DeWoskin, Ruiqiu to sound like Rachel), actually means \\"Bumper Harvest.\\" She finds huge cultural gaps and differences with everyone around her. She makes repeated cultural faux pas, but muddles through nonetheless, just like any American in her place. Interlaced with her story are bits and pieces of Chinese history and language. Ms. DeWoskin also offers a number of surprisingly on-target, passing observations about Chinese life and culture: the importance of face, women covering their mouths when laughing, lack of winter heating, foreigners' prices, women holding hands but not hugging, and a host of others. Combined, these little bits add to a greater whole, creating a \\"Beijing atmosphere\\" that effectively complements her personal story.It is hard not to see FOREIGN BABES IN CHINA as a coming of age story, both for the nave, young college graduate author and for the country in which she is perpetually an outsider. She uses China and the Chinese for her own adventure story as surely as they use her for her \\"exotic\\" foreignness. This book is also a story about cross-cultural personal relationships, about roles assumed and played out, about what is thought and said, and not said, between any two people, complicated a hundredfold by cultural differences and ways of thinking. In the end, Ms. DeWoskin's confused, conflicted, and ultimately lost relationship with Zhao Jun may well serve as a metaphor for the instability, and perhaps the utter hopelessness, of the larger Sino-American relationship."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Rachel DeWoskin spent a great part of the 1990s in Beijing, China first as a post-college lost soul looking for a good job opportunity, and finally becoming a national soap opera star and remaining within the powerful and frustrating lure that China holds over many Western expats.I myself spent the year 2000 in Beijing as a study-abroad from college and a part-time English teacher. I gobbled up \\"Foreign Babes\\" as soon as I read the review in EW magazine. I can categorically say, as a relatively kindred spirit to Ms. DeWoskin in many respects, that she nailed Beijing in every possible aspect 100% correctly. I usually refrain from overgeneralizations, but let me put it this way: my personal journal from my time in China reads almost exactly like this book.There is a bizarre love-hate that most Americans in China have with their host country. At once exotic, larger-than-life, enormous, confining, frustrating, ancient, ultra-modern and flagrantly obsessed with Western imports the China of DeWoskin's pages is the China that anyone who up and goes to Beijing right now will find. She even hits on and offers some fascinating analysis on the difference between Chinese and Western patriotism, linguistic nuances that make intimate communication nearly unattainable between the two cultures, and delivers beautiful character studies of wily Western expats and locals from all walks of life. Her characterizations of the people that populated her dusty, seamy Beijing are so honest and human that I could swear I've met them (in some cases I probably have, of course). Oh, and she's right about the ease of attaining celebrity in China. Though I wasn't on TV, I had a friend who wound up a talk show host in southern China and I myself never was able to shake off the constant stares and comments from Chinese shocked that I could speak their language.There was a slight slow point in the last quarter of the book, in which the expansive nature of the narrative caved in a tad as the author focused in on a small group of her friends, however I took this in stride and do not fault her for it, as it becomes apparent after some reflection that the individuals on whom she focused were integral to her life there. The culmination of the narrative in the awful Chinese embassy bombing incident in Serbia in 1999 is absolutely perfect even in its dreadful raminications, as it affords DeWoskin an opportunity to wrap up her story with a bang, and certainly no pun is intended here.I can see where some of the negative reviewers may be coming from, as I myself am biased in my inclination toward acceptance and engrossment in this book considering my own experience in Beijing. Perhaps not all readers will find the story and characters as real and endearing as I, but for the reader seeking to know what it is like to live in Beijing as an American or even for those who, like me, are looking to revisit the miasmic cultural enormity that is Beijing, China I can offer my highest recommendations for \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing.\\""},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I teach modern Chinese history at a Midwestern university.I discovered Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China by Rachel DeWoskin when I heard the author's interview on public radio earlier this summer. I was intrigued by De Woskin's comments in the interview and wanted to know more about her experiences. I have to admit that I have watched many a trashy soap opera in China whenever I visit and so I picked up the book for fun this summer expecting a light summer read. I was quite surprised by DeWoskin's insights, however, and will definitely assign this book for my class, \\"The United States and China.\\" This is not a book by a China specialist for an audience of China specialists but DeWoskin clearly did her homework for this book. This is one of the best memoirs ever written by a casual American visitor to China.DeWoskin explains early in the book that she felt a connection to China. Her family often spent time in China when she was growing up due to her father's academic research interests in China. Yet this book goes far beyond most visitor memoirs I have seen. It carefully interweaves common language phrases in use during her stay with aspects of pop culture, business and social interactions, Chinese perceptions of Americans, and key political events. The overall effect is a rich mosaic of China in the 1990s that Americans all too often miss or mis-read.What makes this book so useful to students is that DeWoskin presents an honest and often very entertaining view of her life in Beijing as she tries to find her way. She does not try to hide the mistakes she makes adapting her \\"classroom Mandarin Chinese\\" to Beijing slang (not the usual vocabulary students learn in school!) or relationship difficulties with Chinese business associates, friends, and intimates.I would recommend this book for anyone planning to work or study in China."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This book is not as fluffy as the title may suggest. DeWoskin is very insightful about Chinese culture (at least for the period it covers and primarily for twenty-somethings). She also captured a really important time of transition that bridges the post-Tiannenman crackdown and the seeming increasing openness in China that we see today. As an insider living in the country, she describes incredible contrasts between the evolving consumerist, Americanized city life and the (to a degree) still traditional living conditions for those in the outskirts and rural areas. She also holds no illusions that this is a fundamental shift in Chinese policy and culture, but a continuing process that has gone through many iterations over thousands of years. For all this seriousness, it is a fun, engaging read that is not only well-written, but also casual and free-flowing. Because it is based on her personal journals, it is primarily the experience of one, twenty-something American, but she also includes enough research, history, social and literary context to give it some weight and heft."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This is not a travel book about China. It is too specific about a time (the 90s) and a place (Beijing), about social interactions among \\"expats\\" and \\"locals\\", and very much about roles and confusing roles.RDW tells us how she came to Beijing as a very young expatriate executive in 1994, how she got \\"discovered\\" as a TV actress, how she met Chinese and foreign friends, how she left after 5 years that must have changed her. It is a very personal recollection.Since I can relate to many of the elements of the \\"story\\", I enjoyed RDW's book very much. I was there at the same time, in the same office building, in the same party places, markets etc. Probably we met at least in the CITIC elevator, but we did not meet due to too many other differences - age maybe the most important among them. I remember vaguely the stories about her soap experience. I never watched the Foreign Babes show, but I remember the press coverage.RDW is a great writer, very observant and with a tremendous sense of humour. Every China expat should be interested. Everybody with an interest in intercultural encounters should be very interested. Everybody interested in China beyond the numbers should love it."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Rachel DeWoskin arrived in Beijing during the mid-90s, among the first wave of Westerners to see the city since the protests and reprisals at Tiananmen Square a few years earlier. During her stay, China relented from rigid socialism, opened up to foreign capital, and incorporated western business practices. On one level, \\"Foreign Babes\\" is the story of this process. DeWoskin's descriptions of these cultural convulsions are pithy and delightful. From the introduction of Coke and McDonald's (and the resulting obesity epidemic), to the latest trends in Chinese rock music and performance art, she was a witness and an insider - the perfect guide.DeWoskin was not just an anonymous tourist, though, she was a pop-sensation. Starring as an American temptress in China's version of Beverly Hills 90210, her weekly seductions were seen by half a billion people each week. Hundreds of fans mobbed her on the streets of Beijing and followed her through stores, buying whatever random products she put in her bag.But the heart of \\"Foreign Babes\\" is not the fascinating backdrop of Beijing in bloom, or the glamorous and sexy soap opera, but the relationships between the characters. Sparring across a huge divide of language, politics, and culture, they must shed stereotypes and find a personal space in which to understand each other - not as American or Chinese, but as individuals and friends. DeWoskin possesses an astute social sensibility, a pitch-perfect ear for conversation, and the gift of spot-lighting the most awkward - and revealing - moment in any interaction.Just going to China after college was adventurous. Signing on for the TV-show was audacious. Most impressive, however, was DeWoskin's ability to bridge the gaps and surround herself with friends in a foreign country. Impressive, but not surprising, since the author's warmth and grace are apparent on every page."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This is one of the first books that I've read from an American with no prior knowledge of Chinese culture can have so much insights into the nuances of relationships in the country. I am surprised and delighted that Rachel has written so frankly about her feelings at work, with other expats, and the different emerging personalities in China. This is a book for all who is interested in learning about the other culture, striking out on one's own and understand the subtleties of an increasingly global world.Having moved twice, once from Shanghai to US in the late 1980's to moving from the US to Hong Kong last year, I find Rachel's balanced account of a place seen from the outside world and a place experience personally experienced by an individual especially refreshing. She is able to spot the dynamics between foreigners and natives, Taiwanese and Mainlanders, City and rural residents with so much insights and humor. This is the first book that I've read that addresses these unspoken issues so candidly and without pretention, as if I could walk in her shoes for her years there. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Very well-written and some good insights. The author is perceptive and had some interesting experiences in 1990's China (change in China is so rapid that her account is historical, not contemporary, already). One forgets at times how young she is until she has to deal with a personal tragedy at the end of the book and reverts to childhood. The only flaw is that the author has been somewhat corrupted by political correctness which sometimes leads to paralysis in her thinking. She's a foreigner in China, just accept that and go forward -- unfortunately, she gets over-analytical at times, tying herself in knots about what the Chinese will think of her foreigness and navel-gazing about her own motives. Trust your instincts and just be yourself. Skim over these parts and the rest of the book is interesting and well-written. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This is one of the most entertaining and informative books I have read in a very long time. I have been to Beijing once and I now live in the very multicultural city of Toronto. The author deftly weaves the scripted story of the soap opera in which she acts with her real story on the streets and clubs and offices of Beijing. In a style of writing that is clear but deeply nuanced and humorous, she relates the lives of young men and women in a rapidly changing China, dealing with their own kind of culture shock, even as she deals with hers.The chapter \\"Model workers\\" talks of the emerging, very non-Maoist profession of runway models. Brief, capsule biographies of the author's friends in China who are both typical and extraordinary, painters, actors, and fellow office workers, provided me insights that I will long carry with me. The story is told in part with quotations from her actual conversations, quotations from the show script, lyrics from popular songs, and brief quips about historical women recorded in the ancient \\"Lives of Eminent Women.\\" Together these constribute to a fine tapestry that reveals many truths about our complex multicultural lives without judgement and with considerable affection."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This book is both smart and fun. On the one hand it is about an American babe who stars in a Chinese TV soap with funny stories to tell; and on the other, a glimpse into China's vast cultural landscape that is shifting as we speak. The seduction by the foreign babe is a metaphor for the impact of the West on the middle kingdom. DeWoskin has a smooth as silk grasp of language that is kind to the reader. Well done."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"A fascinating memoir of life in Beijing during the last half of the 1990's. Rachel DoWoskin had just graduated from college with a degree in English and a love of poetry when she moved to Beijing to take a job that didn't completely suit her, working for a PR firm trying to persuade the Chinese to try donuts and other western products. In the five years that she was there she also starred in a popular Chinese soap opera, lived in illegal foreign housing and made many Chinese friends who ranged from artists to entrepreneurs. Her account is thoughtful, informative and articulate."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"When buying \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing\\" I was expecting a interesting look at the experiences of Ms. Dewoskin' life in China, and to some extent I got that. I did however also get too many generic historical and cultural explanations. I like reading China memoirs to learn about culture and cultural differences through the experiences and encounters of the author. Sometimes historical background explanations are necessary and helpful, but in this book they are mostly not.I can still recommend the book if you have an afternoon or two to kill, its a light read and enjoyable enough. I have been living in China since 2007 and many of the situations she encounters are still valid. I think people who have an interest in China or have lived there will find it a mostly entertaining read (but skim the history lessons)."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I got this because I'm currently learning Chinese, and thinking about visiting China some day. Rachel is an excellent writer, very observant of detail (her own emotions and others' behaviors), but not drowning the reader in irrelevant and wordy prose. Rachel spent several years in Beijing, really making an effort to be absorbed in the culture, and the experience pays off. I would love to read her experiences if she decides to try living other places as well!"},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"One thing that I wondered within the first several pages of the book was: Why did they use so much white space and large print in the book? It could have been something like 175-200 pages with different typesetting, but instead was about 320 text pages. Could this have been to give the feeling to the reader that the book was lighter than it actually was? As it happens, the book was just about the right number of pages, striking that oh-so-delicate balance between enough detail to keep the reader interested but not so much so as to make the book bloated.1. The prose is very good and witty in most places and very labored in some (I am still trying to figure out what on Earth the author could have meant when she referred to \\"rebellious vegetables\\" on pp. 46.) Overall, she had a very cute, witty way of using words (another stellar example of superior Ashkenazi verbal intelligence?).2. Her observations about cultural faux pas that happen in meetings (and in other places) were very prescient and interesting.3. I could have done with the characters for the Chinese expressions embedded in the text. After all, the people who are likely to read this book are China hands, and so learning a few new words while reading would not hurt.4. How big could that TV show really have been? She said that it was seen by 600 million viewers, but I can't find a single copy of it on [...] (either by inputting Chinese characters or English words). I can find movies and music videos from all the way back into the early 1980s, but not one of this show. I also looked to find the movie \\"Manhole\\" directed by the person whom deWoskin referenced, but could not find that anywhere, either.5. The cross -ection of people that the saw in her life was not quite the same that I have seen in my many years here (in EFL and Chemistry teaching). I don't question the general accuracy of her observations (she tries very hard to be balanced and respectful), but wonder if they are time dependent (these events went down about 15 years ago and things in these later years seem very different) or location dependent (these events took place in Beijing, where the government is much more present). In any case, when this was written, VCRs were still in very popular use and so that gives us an idea of how long ago this happened.6. I very much liked her characterizations of the different people that she met-- especially the time that she spent dealing with the artists. It seems that it works much the same way in China that artists start out as juvenile and petulant anti-establishment brats. And then the pressures of actually earning a living and paying bills redirects their focus. I don't believe that she made efforts to be exhaustive in her characterizations of the expat scene, but that she took a number of very judiciously chosen examples from among many. From there, she made her points about the flux of Chinese society *at that time.*Overall, this was a good use of several afternoons' worth of reading time and a good break from heavier reading fare."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This was a unique introduction to Chinese culture that I have been looking for given an upcoming trip in 2008. There are numerous books on how the economy, businesses, politics, etc. of China have changed and how they have affected the world around them. However, this perspective rings true because you come to the realization that world governments represent the interests of their people yet rarely do they give an accurate portrayal in what those people are like. You get a sense of how far China has come and yet how far it still has to go. This may sound incredibly condescending but on the flip side, the outside world has come a long way in understanding China yet still has a long way to go. It was also great to learn a few Mandarin phrases in pinyin which you practice saying to yourself while reading. It is a refreshing departure from more supposedly scholarly books about China."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"A touching, personal account of life and culture shock in late 1990's Beijing. This book provides humorous insight into what it's like to experience the intricacies and contradictions of Chinese life as a foreigner."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I found the book disappointing, given the rave reviews on amazon.com and the dust jacket. I teach a Modern Chinese History course and am looking for a book that captures the dramatic cultural changes underway in China. I currently use Jianying Zha's \\"China Pop,\\" which is brilliant and immensely useful but about ten years out of date. Ms. DeWoskin just isn't in Zha's league. Furthermore, since her memoir describes the mid-nineties, it's not as current as its 2005 publication date suggests. This is an enjoyable book and a quick read, but little more than that.\\"Foreign Babes\\" is more descriptive than analytical. DeWoskin chronicles her own struggles in the shifting landscape of a changing Beijing -- her efforts to understand the language, negotiate the terrain of gender, fit in at work, and make friends. She is appealingly honest about the ethical compromises she makes and the confusion she faces. Yet ultimately, this book is about her, and thus it is of limited use for students of China.DeWoskin occasionally makes awkward attempts to frame the book as something more than it is. Her decision to introduce each chapter with an excerpt from the vacuous script of \\"Foreign Babes\\" is a mistake, since the absence of social, historical, or political overtones in the script only serves to weaken the potential wider implications of her own work. She is more sure-footed when describing her friends and acquaintances, yet here she cannot achieve the kind of depth and subtlety that Jianying Zha, a truly bicultural and bilingual journalist, offers us in \\"China Pop.\\" Both books give us real people, the individuals who face the torrent of change in China; but Zha knows what to make of the conflicts she describes, whereas DeWoskin leaves us with pictures but no larger meanings. Zha's chapters on art, the media, and pornography provoked a rich discussion in my classes. Students wondered aloud about China's identity, its ability to handle democracy, and the tensions between generations. There just isn't enough detail in DeWoskin's book to satisfy our hunger for information about China. Her references to history are exceedingly brief -- one could get much more from a short travel guide -- and we have no sense of whether the people she meets are in any way representative. This is fine for a memoir, but limits the book's usefulness as a text in a classroom.Ultimately, in DeWoskin's memoir, China is just a backdrop. Those of us hoping for an insider's look at the new China will have to keep waiting -- perhaps for Jianying Zha, who is reportedly working on a sequel to \\"China Pop.\\""},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"When I travel, I like to bring a book with me that would be considered \\"light reading.\\" I picked up FOREIGN BABES IN BEIJING because it was described as a \\"Sex and the City\\" set in China on the dust jacket. The author moves to Beijing to work in PR and suddenly finds herself on a Chinese soap opera called \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing.\\" Sounds fun, right?As I started to read it on the airplane, I was suddenly transported back to my freshman foreign governments class in college. I wasn't expecting a dull history lesson on Chinese government, culture, and word definitions. I'm sure the information presented is fantastic...if that's what you're looking for. I, on the other hand, was looking for humorous stories and adventures in China, a la Chelsea Handler. I felt quite misled by the book's title, summary, praises, and photo on the dust jacket.After 50 pages in, I realized that the memoir wasn't going to be full of lighthearted humor and debauchery as I was led to believe. I gave up and said z&agrave;i ji&agrave;n (goodbye) to Foreign Babes."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Having recently spent 2 weeks in Beijing, the content of this book was most interesting to me. Rachel Dewoskin engages her reader as she relates her experiences as an American who breaks down barriers in Beijing. The courage and adventure she exhibits through her stories are enviable and her experiences are quite entertaining. Juxtaposed against the old culture of China, Rachel shows us the deep desire of the Chinese to understand and grasp Americanism. But, she also exhibits how very wrong preconceived ideas can be. Her experience seems to echo my own impressions--that there are at least 2 Chinas (if not more). Foreigners get to see one of them, but the other \\"Chinas\\" you may only glimpse or not see at all. A good book. A good read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Just riotously funny. What a fantastic read. So much smarter than most \\"girl\\" memoirs. I actually couldn't put this one down."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Rachel Dewoskin, freshly graduated from Columbia, travels to China in 1994 to explore a culture which has fascinated her ever since she was young. Working in an advertising agency in Beijing, she is offered the opportunity to play the part of JieXi (presumably, a chinese translation of Jessie?) in a chinese soap opera on national TV, about foreign babes in beijing. What results is some really interesting insight into how Chinese at the time were viewing foreigners, and how they thought foreigners thought of them. It's really revealing, for example, that they chose to portray hot, sexy Chinese men seducing foreign women, rather than the other way around. (hehe, that specifies the direction of cultural \\"penetration\\"). Also, on the show, JieXi's characters wears fur coats, elaborate jewelry, and dresses sexy, despite just being a foreign exchange student -- because that's what the chinese masses want to see. It's Chinese propaganda and a vehicle for advertising of a rich lifestyle and prosperity, to a China who was just beginning to open up to commercial activity in the 90's. It becomes incredibly popular when it is shown and reshown on national chinese TV.In some ways the description of the show it reminded me the way they have \\"token\\" Caucasians shown on Hong Kong TV. They're despicable characters, and the men are always shown making moves on say, the chinese heroine, who is portrayed as sexy, but knows better that waste her time with these \\"hamsup gwai lo\\", dirty/horny white guys. Also, caucasians are routinely portrayed as speaking crappy chinese and acting like buffoons.It was pretty good, although I think the book deteriorates into some messy personal stuff at the end. One note... the book is written in english, but is smattered with Mandarin pinyin. So although DeWoskin tries to translate a lot of the chinese words, it's not always clear what she means unless you understand Mandarin (thankfully, it wasn't too hard). Also, the translation is kinda funky. More literal (it's kinda cool that she takes note of that, being a poetry major), but sometimes I think it would have been more appropriate to translate the meaning rather than what each word meant.I was really intrigued with Anna, the chinese girl who's incredibly rebellious (although in some ways still very chinese), and likes to date Caucasian men. I thought her contradictions were worth delving into. Or the chinese men, who Rachel dated, but still remained psychologically closed to her. But Rachel tended to describe experiences only from her american-perspective, and I felt that wasn't *as* eye-opening to a reader who's pretty familiar with the western/foreign view already.Then again, when you visit a foreign culture, you're often forced to examine your own cultural perspective. I guess I wasn't that impressed with what she came up with. Too much drama, for one thing, and ai qing de shi (love business). But it's an fascinating recount of the experience. Just don't expect it to be journal-worthy or an ethnography, because it's a bit too sloppy for that."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"Rachel DeWoskin's \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing\\" is a delightfully insightful and earnest look at the life of a \\"laowai\\" in Beijing. As a former \\"gaijin\\" in Japan, I was struck by the similarities of life as a foreigner in China and Japan, and reminded of the delectable contradictions involved in living a lifestyle rich and dynamic yet ephemeral, in a land where one is simultaneously revered and treated with suspicion, going about a daily life that is both new and mundane. DeWoskin is in a unique position as an intermediary--her work is not of the artsy-yet-ignorantly-detached genre of, say \\"Lost in Translation\\" but neither is it the experienced, old-hand writing of an Alex Kerr. Her language abilities open doors but her short-term status makes every experience memorable and unique.DeWoskin's experiences outshine those of the typical \\"laowai\\" and yet she refrains from self-congratulatory preening of the \\"Aren't I cool? I'm a TV star!\\" variety ... her accounts are intelligent and above all REAL. I've never been to Beijing, let alone starred on a TV show, and yet I could relate to every experience of DeWoskin's on a personal level. Like all expats, she learns about herself and her host country, but above all she learns how to live life. While there are no Zen-like enlightenments, she still comes home a better, wiser, and different human being than the woman who first touched down in Beijing.If Amazon allowed 4.5 ratings, this would be a solid 4.5 but I'll round up to congratulate DeWoskin's skill at creating a book that is easy to write but difficult to write well--the trials and tribulations of the Outsider in a land far, far from home."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"First off, cons: this book does not have a story arc because it is a memoir, so the end is a little anticlimactic (sp?). Also, not to give any plot away but there are some parts where you may find yourself not liking the narrator or wishing she didn't do/say X/Y. Some people may find this book a little gimicky or overly self-promoting.The pros: a thoughtful account of one person's experience in China. I say one person because this is definitely not The Definitive China. For different takes seeRiver Town: Two Years on the Yangtze (P.S.),Iron and Silk, andThe Early Arrival of Dreams: A Year in Chinaamong others. River Town especially though.This book, though, is a little on the lighter side. Entertaining and not nearly as sordid as the cover would have you believe. The first time I read this book on the recommendation of a professor, before I went to China to study for 6 months. Coming back, it was assigned by the same professor for a class. We especially discussed the term \\"nuance paralysis\\" that she has coined to explain the movie-star like feeling life has when one lives in a foreign country whose language and culture one does not entirely understand. It actually was really well suited to an academic discussion of how one approaches life/travel in a foreign country. Overall highly recommended, along with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I loved this book! But, like some of the other readers with positive reviews, I went into it slightly biased. Her descriptions of a expats life in Beijing are dead on and really reminded me of when I was in China. I found the things she went through, people she talked to, Chinese words she used, and feelings she had very amusingly familiar and had a hard time putting this book down.That being said, I'm not sure if someone who hasn't spent time in Beijing (or China) would really appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"My mother picked this book up for me because I had been in Rachel DeWoskin's mother's English class in high school and rememebered her talking about her daughter who had just gotten a job on a Chinese soap. My mom always picks up books that I really don't care about because of some crazy connection she has to the author. Anyway, that being said I decided to try to give this one a try because I heard Rachel speak on NPR and I thought what the heck. well, let me say, within 3 days I was finished with a book that I could not put down. It was one of those books that you stay up late reading, even though you're exhausted because you have to know what happens. Some of the ironies were hard to believe, but whether or not Rachel used some poetic license it was an amazing read. I found myself rooting for Rachel and Jiexi. I have also been in the situation of defending \\"America\\" which I have always found odd given my own relatively leftist leanings and related to what Rachel said about the embassy bombing and her feelings of \\"Americanness\\" that she never felt at home. A great read."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"\\"Foreign Babes\\" is an enjoyable and informative read. Rachel DeWoskin - daughter of respected University of Michigan and PriceWaterhouseCoopers Sinologist Ken DeWoskin - recounts her tales of moving to Beijing in the 1990s where, through happenstance, she falls into the role of Western temptress Jiexi in a government-produced nightly soap opera called \\"Foreign Babes in Beijing.\\" At its peak, \\"Foreign Babes\\" had a nightly viewing audience of 600 million making DeWoskin literally an overnight sensation.Where the book excels and is really enthralling are the stretches where the author details the making of the show and the reaction to it on the streets of Beijing. DeWoskin has a great eye and ear for people's reactions to her (and their inability to seaprate her off- and on-screen personas).Where the book bogs down is where (as other reviewers on these pages have noted) DeWoskin's circle narrows and she focuses on a small group of close friends. These stretches feel claustrophobic. Because they end in a tragedy and are undoubtedly deeply personal to the author, I feel like a cad saying that these latter sections are \\"Foreign Babes\\" weak links.Regardless, I think Foreign Babe's overall feel is best summed up by a quote provided on the back cover by Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner which reads: \\"Anyone who has ever traveled beyond their comfort zone will relate to DeWoskin's insightful, delightful story of being an American transplant in China, the most foreign of nations.\\" Yeah, that's got it exactly right. Rachel DeWoskin boldly decided to live an exciting life, plunged right into it at age 22, got it all down on paper, and convinced noted publisher W. W. Norton to distribute and promote the tale. Hats off to her."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"A good read, funny at times. In a way, this book is not exactly about the \\"new new China,\\" but \\"recent new China,\\" for the described events happened more than 5 years ago, a generational period on the Chinese time scale. DeWoskin is charming, self-deprecating, and going out with interesting people including Cui Jian. Do not look for any substantial, observant description of the capital and its people in this chattery book. She is after all a babe, living a half-real, half-dreamy life in Beijing. Never an insider, she is but a sweet, lovely guest who is invited to watch China and be watched at the same time."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"This is a delightfully humorous memoir, written by a young woman whose first job out of college was at an American firm in Beijing. That led to her being cast as a \\"foreign babe\\" [the English translation] in a Chinese soap opera. I read this book weeks before my own trip to Beijing. Though I am a different generation, I found her paragraphs about Chinese views of Americans to be very useful--and accurate--for my own travel."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"The basic premise of an innocent abroad landing a starring role in a cheesy Chinese soap opera was enough to get me to read the book. And that element of the book doesn't disappoint: it's fun, the dialogue at the end of each chapter is silly, and I enjoyed googling a little bit of video from the program.However, really this book is not very well written. The soap opera is just a small part of the actual novel, and mostly comes in a big chunk at the beginning. A whole hell of a lot is given to the author talking about the generalities of China, in a very cliched way. Hey, no kidding, it's big, and the pace of change is very quick? It comes off like reading a Wikipedia page. The author also is very quick to give sweeping, shallow opinions on Chinese and American media.The author also talks about her relations with other characters, there's a girl who likes foreign guys and thinks China is backwards, a guy who is very nationalistic and given to page-long speeches about it, and no it's not interesting.Really it's a novel written by a 1st person narrator who portrays herself sympathetically, but isn't very sympathetic. This is particularly true towards the end, when she doesn't attend the funeral of a close friend who she was with when he died, because she had to go on vacation.It's a very sharp contrast to the rest of the novel, in which she depicts herself as a naive but good-hearted innocent abroad. She excuses her own behavior with a shrug, but it feels manipulative and false. There's a movie in pre-production, and really I think the story would be better told in a more objective 3rd person, and with less silly exposition."},{"Title":"Foreign Babes in Beijing: Behind the Scenes of a New China","review":"I first heard of Rachel DeWoskin a few weeks ago, when I picked up her one of her works of fiction, \\"Big Girl Small\\", which I loved. I immediately looked up other books by DeWoskin and discovered that she had written a memoir about her time living in China in the mid-90's. The title of her memoir \\"Foreign Babes In Beijing\\" refers to the title of the very popular Chinese soap opera that DeWoskin found herself cast in as Jiexi, an all American girl and temptress to one of the married Chinese male characters.This memoir is just plain crazy and impossible to put down. DeWoskin did not move to China with any interest in acting, but went to the audition on a lark and she just seems to go with the flow with regard to experiences and people that come her way. She probably embraces a foreign culture in the best possible way, making many friends that lead her multiple opportunities.She has interesting things to report regarding stereotypes ( both through her TV show and in the general public) and how they can perpetuate false ideas. The stereotypes on the soap opera are often completely ridiculous, but shine a light on how even minor perpetuated falsehoods can cause damage when trying to break down cultural barriers. Sometimes people want to believe what they have been told, rather than listen to the person in front of them and form a real relationship. This is not to say that DeWoskin doesn't form many real relationships with Chinese friends, but she is often finding herself having tread lightly and defend her culture and misrepresentations. This theme is rampant throughout the book.This book was endlessly interesting and a great read if you love memoirs or travel journals.[...]"},{"Title":"Waterloo","review":"Most of the books that are available to Americans on the subject of the battle of Waterloo were written by English authors. We have been programmed so to speak to see the battle from the English and Wellingtons viewpoint. What makes Commandant Henry Lachouque's WATERLOO unique is that it is a translation from the French and written from the French point of view. This fresh approach gives insight into the purpose and vision of Napoleon. The great English historian David Chandler writes in the introduction of the book &quot;History is an arguement without end.... we may not agree with the Commandant... but we defend his right to express it.&quot;I have read as many as 20-30 books on the Battle of Waterloo but there are particular details which I have only found in Lachouque's WATERLOO. He gives information on different French military officers which is easily overlooked by English authors.Lachouque has a writing style which carries the reader forward almost effortlessly so that students who may not enjoy history but need to examine Waterloo will find this book helpful for their purposes.Chandler does bring up a valid critique of the book which I might mention and that was Lachouque failed to recognize his sources. Commandant Lachouque is deceased and Chandler and all other students of Waterloo would have appreciated knowing what were some of his first hand sources.Another reason I consider this such an excellent book on the Battle of Waterloo is the illustrations contained in it. The Museums of five countries contributed artwork in the book. There are over 300 illustrations many in color. I have never seen a book on Waterloo with as many prints and maps. Many of the prints are from Commandant Lachouque's own collection. These of course would not likely be found in an English historical study. Some of the artwork includes prints of uniforms, the panorama mural which is displayed at a museum at Waterloo itself, plus numerous portraits and drawings.This book is a favorite of mine and through the text and the illustrations Lachouque has successfully brought to mind and heart the sound of the trumpets and the guns and the shouts &quot;Vivi La Emperor&quot;."},{"Title":"Christmas Cooking For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"If this is the first Christmas you have actually had to prepare the festive feast, this book is for you.

My son-in-law, who loves to cook but is lacking a lot in patience and aptitude, shocked the heck out of our entire family the first year he married my daughter, by coming to the dining room table with chain saw in hand and commenced to carve the Christmas turkey!

How I wish this book had been published about ten years ago. (He is still cooking and basting, by the way, but has traded the chain saw for less ominous utensils.)Like all the &quot;Dummy&quot; books, this one will bring a chuckle or two but at the same time save the reader from making some drastic mistakes when preparing the Christmas feast.

It is a great way to tell a story. We have sam suday and the mytery at the ocean beach hotel. My kids love to hear it over and over, even my 9 yr old. We would love more of the sam suday books!!"},{"Title":"Sam Sunday and the strange disappearance of Chester Cats","review":"This book may be the strangest book I've ever read. The plot itself isn't too weird, but the manner of presentation is, well, strange. The book starts off with the discovery made by Mrs. Cats that her son Chester is missing. \\"Where can my Chester be? I miss him. Lolly and Polly miss him. Dicky and Ricky miss him. Terry, Merry and Melvin miss him. The house is empty without him!\\" (Considering the size of the house, it would always seem empty unless a big herd of elephants moved in.)As it gets later in the day and Chester still has not put in an appearance, Mrs. Cats call the police, who send Sam Sunday the detective. This is where the story really starts to get strange. It almost seems like a weak attempt a humor, which, at least for me, fails completely. When Sam gets to Mrs. Cats house, he starts to question her about her son. As soon as he has a teeny bit of info about when he disappeared and what he likes, he says \\"Enough! I will find your son or my name is not Sam Sunday!\\" He then jumps in his car (which is really neat looking by the way) and drives off to a series of different places based on the small amount of info about Chester's hobbies.First Sam visits the zoo, then the library, then a gypsy camp, and then finds him in the aquarium. At the zoo he asks if they have any cats. The zookeeper says they have lots of cats. Then Sam says he's looking for one with an earring, and the zookeeper tells him to try another zoo. Next he goes to the library, where he asks the librarian if she has seen a cat that loves books with \\"Gray coat. Yellow eyes. Gold earring in one ear.\\" The librarian says, \\"I have not seen your gypsy cat.\\" so Sam goes looking for Chester in a gypsy camp. When he gets to the gypsy camp, he sees a cat with a gray coat, yellow eyes and a gold earring. He grabs the cat, but then a gypsy lady yells at him because that cat is not Chester. While Chester's earring is in his left ear, this cat has their earring in his right ear. \\"That's a fact, ma'am.\\" is Sam's response. Then the gypsy looks into her crystal ball and says that Chester is near water and fish. Sam then rushes off to the aquarium, where he finds Chester. After a short discussion, Chester gets in Sam's car and is taken back to his mother, Lolly, Polly, Dicky, Ricky, Terry, Merry and Melvin.Not only is the story told in a singularly weird manner, the pictures are strange as well. All of the cats that have speaking lines and all the cats in the cats in the gypsy's camp all walk on two legs. The only cats that don't do this are Lolly, Polly, Dicky, Ricky, Terry, Merry and Melvin. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be pet cats, or what. Why would a cat be keeping pet cats? But on the other hand, why is there some distinction between Chester and what I would otherwise assume to be his brothers and sisters? Other than that, the pictures are well drawn, even if the choice of colors is slightly different from what I would of picked. One point perspective is used very well and to good effect in this book.In short, my first sentence pretty much sums up all I feel for the book. This very well may be the strangest book I've read.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"Mielziner: Master of Modern Stage Design","review":"Wow!!! Ms. Henderson has written an amazing book. Not only does it have the most beautiful color reproductions of Mielziner's work I've ever seen and in profusion, but she has also written a rich and detailed biography of Jo Mielziner.I had been waiting for this book, but it exceeded all expectations. It is a invaluable history of modern American Stage Design, covering all the important personalities in fascinating detail, tracing the artistic progression and growth of American theater.Anyone with an interest in American Theater in the 20th Century will benefit and be informed by this book. Her breadth of knowledge is astonishing and her digressions into side alleys are always informative and fascinating. She uses facts and figures to illuminate the shifting perspectives of the &quot;business&quot; of Broadway. And her analysis of design trends are intelligent and enlightening.

As a history of 20th Century Broadway Theater it is a must have."},{"Title":"Mielziner: Master of Modern Stage Design","review":"Mary Henderson has given us an invaluable insight in the world of Jo Mielziner. So often the names of creative people who ensure that a production &quot;works&quot; are never known or easily forgotten by the viewing audience. The set and lighting designs of Mielziner for plays and shows like A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman, South Pacific, etc. were considered brilliant and groundbreaking by the theatre world of his time. Mielziner also greatly influenced modern stage design (the East Room stage in the White House and the Denver Center Theatre, for example) and with his art and creative insight put his unique stamp on the world of modern theatre until this day. An overview of his work was long overdue. But Mary Henderson has given us far more than that. She has given us Jo Mielziner, the person, by providing fascination facts and photographs of Jo's private life.

The book lacks a critical bite, at times seeming a little too biased towards its subject. Mielziner comes off as having flawless work, with any bad results being caused by narrow-minded or misguided collaborators.The book also disappoints in that while it has many renderings, it lacks any ground plans, or sections, or other working drawings. It's very difficult to get a true sense of someone's design without seeing a ground plan. Perhaps they are not available, or maybe they didn't seem pretty enough to include.To be fair, Henderson has done a great service to the theater community in writing this book, and while she doesn't give herself freedom to do close readings of Mielziner's designs, the comprehensiveness of her work does have its own value. It's too bad - in the end she has successfully argued her case of Mielziner as a seminal figure in theatrical design, but she doesn't follow through and give his work the critical assessment deserving of a true master artist."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"Lawrence Block is one of my favorite authors.

The police can't help but Scudder has a way of spending time and foot leather that can come up with answers.An AA friend suddenly dies and again Scudderlooks to see what the real situation is. On thisone he gets involved with a woman who testshis sobriety.Both cases fortuitously intertwine and Scudder has answers that he doesn't know what to do with.The book shows a side of Manhattan seldommentioned in the papers, except when crime isinvolved. It is a truthful and realistic tellinghow people act basely"},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"&quot;Out on the Cutting Edge&quot; follows the two best novels in the Matthew Scudder series, &quot;8 Million Ways to Die&quot; and &quot;When the Sacred Ginmill Closes.&quot; It is also the first novel in which Scudder conducts a case (in this instance two cases) while not in an alcoholic stupor. We catch up with Scudder a few years after he joined AA. He has a sponser and has managed to recover control of his life. His day to day existence, meanwhile, hasn't changed much. He still lives in a residential hotel and still conducts cases off the books as &quot;favors&quot; for friends.The two cases are interesting. One is for pay; a family wants to know the whereabouts of their missing daughter. One is personal; an AA companion apparently commits suicide just before he is ready to confess his sins to Scudder. Both take Scuder in some unlikely directions and the payoff is typically messy. Meanwhile, author Lawrence Block introduces one his most interesting side characters to the series, the Irish gangster Mickey Ballou. Overall, this is a solid Scudder novel that is not quite on par with the best of the series. But any Scudder novel makes for excellent reading."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"Once again Lawrence Block has managed to blow me away with another fantastic Matt Scudder book. This one is about a guy who is looking for his daughter, who went off to New York to try and find fame. He hires Scudder to find his missing daughter, but the only problem is, there arent many leads. He searches and goes through all the motions and has stumbling blocks in his way, but manages to get around them. I wont tell you the rest, because I dont want to ruin the book for you, but I will just say this. THE ENDING WILL SHOCK YOU!!!!!"},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"Matthew Scudder takes on the Bad Guys with calm and purpose. He's the most laid back investigator going and lately the most sober. Both AA and crime compete for attention."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"I love the Matthew Scudder series. I hate that Amazon has decided to require a certain number of words to submit a review and will use this statement on all reviews to show how I feel. The only reason I am doing this is for the merchants who sell through Amazon and need positive to feedback to continue being allowed to see through Amazon."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"This is yet another great Matthew Scudder book by Lawrence Block. This guy knows human nature and the streets of New Yorkand it's denizens up close and personal. Great believable characters and a plot line that is imaginative and believable.He understands the AA program and some excellent insights into the people who attend meetings. His characters are portrayed perfectly whether it's the street patios or the black or Irish ones, the way they speak us spot on.I can't recommend Lawrence Block highly enough."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"Matt Scudder, ex-cop, ex-husband and father, unofficial private detective, and now a recovering alcoholic for several years (you're never \\"ex-\\"), takes on a commission for an Indiana auto dealer trying to discover what's become of his daughter. She came to New York to break into the acting world, and then disappeared. Shortly after starting his investigation -- which doesn't really go much of anywhere for some time, even though he's putting in the hours -- Scudder is approached by a guy from one of his many AA meetings who wants Scudder to help with the 5th Step: Confessing your sins. Matt agrees; it's what recovering drinkers do for each other, when they can. (Alcoholism and its effects is almost a character in this book in itself.) But then the guy turns up dead in his apartment, apparently of autoerotic asphyxiation. Matt, for whatever reason, doesn't like the look of this, and begins poking around. And then he becomes physically involved with the woman who manages the building where the man died, which is not going to take him where he hopes it will. Scudder lives in a rather gray world and that's certainly evident here. It's not a depressing story, exactly, but it's not what you could call an exciting read, however engrossing it may be. And the resolution of the first case definitely will give you the willies. This is also the book in which Scudder first makes the acquaintance of Mickey Ballou, the \\"Butcher Boy,\\" a literally bloody-handed member of the underworld, with whom he bonds in an unlikely (but generally convincing) fashion. Not the best of the series but far from being the worst."},{"Title":"Out on the Cutting Edge","review":"I have read other Matthew Scudder books and this recent book is on a par with the others.

When I first bought it I wasn't sure I would like it because I thought it was all about out-of-body experiences, but it turned out to be much much more. It's an autobiography about this guy (Steve) who is an aspiring actor- song writer and he's searching for so much more in his life. It's a fast read, and really good ! It has the feeling like he and you are just sitting in his living room, and he's telling you all this stuff he's experienced and learned.....like you're a friend of his and you can't help but be pulled into his adventures !! It's also funny, which I love. Check it out !"},{"Title":"The wind leaves no shadow","review":"This book is \\"on loan\\" in each guest room of the Old Santa Fe Inn in Santa Fe, NM. My husband and I stayed there our first night of a Southwest road trip, and I so enjoyed the first few chapters of \\"Wind Leaves No Shadow\\" that I purchased a copy for myself. Great grounding in the early history of New Mexico from the perspective of a young woman who ultimately owns her own gambling salon in old Santa Fe. Spanning the area's rule under Spain, New Mexico, and ultimate statehood - plus gold fever, ongoing Indian conflict and tension with all parties plus Texans - I recommend the history and the adventure!"},{"Title":"The wind leaves no shadow","review":"This rich tale of one of Santa Fe's illustrious characters, Dona Tules, is a novel but with a lot of historical data woven through the story of this woman's life. In a country dominated by men-- Spanish, Mexican and Indian-- Senora Tules overcame her \\"pobre\\" beginnings and immense struggles and evolved into a very successful businesswoman in Santa Fe's early history and growth as a significant US city. She was clever, used her red headed and beguiling ways to turn political leaders and soldiers to mush. She played a significant role in early Santa Fe history. Learn about her struggles, successes, local characters that make up this fascinating time and her influence on the powers that be as well as the commoner. It is a riveting tale tho much of it true \\"biography\\" with some literary license thrown in. Ruth Laughlin is a wonderful writer having lived most of her life in Santa Fe. For a more in-depth writing of Santa Fe history her companion book, Caballeros, is a must. A shame we do not have more of her writings."},{"Title":"Out There, Somewhere","review":"\\"Out There, Somewhere\\" is an adventure in perspective; a perspective humankind does not often take. From the minds of aquatic animals, John Morano swims his readers through the foreign world that surrounds and dominates the islands we call Earth. Though the oceans occupy more than 2/3rds of our planet, our outlook is primarily land centric. Morano cleverly floods the foundations of our point of view, with a new way of thinking.Humans are seen as part of the world, but not as the whole of it; despite what we might want to believe. Detailing the plight of the captive marine life in an aquarium called SeaTopia, \\"Out There, Somewhere\\" is a story filled with much more than the blank eyed stares and circular swimming we've grown accustomed to watching on our weekend visits. When natural tendencies are curbed by the confines of captivity, predators and prey adapt their relationships and create rules that allow for peaceful coexistence. But the forced water-share breeds behaviors that are alarmingly familiar to us. Morano's world offers a reflection of our own as it details the oppression of those in power, the fear of those in want of it, and the peace of those with faith. A story filled with speculative philosophy and a \\"fishtian\\" spirituality, \\"Out There, Somewhere\\" is thought provoking and inspirational to readers of all ages and species.The \\"man-tide\\" is witnessed from the waters of our world and found guilty of a negligent disregard for the balance of nature. The rescue efforts we so often celebrate are shown through the eyes of those who only need to be rescued because of humankind's misdeeds. Morano exposes the ignorance and naivet&eacute; of humans while revealing the possibility of a culture and theology we have overlooked in the waters around us. Several schools of thought are explored as Morano reveals the viewpoints of an inquisitive stargazer, a defiant octopus, a brave little shrimp, an authoritarian remora, an accepting manatee, a heroic wild dolphin and his confined pod, a spiritual angelfish, and an ancient and powerful coelacanth.While humankind carries the blame for its crimes against nature, its compassion is also displayed through the actions of devoted caretakers at the aquarium. Each of them battles with their desire to free and their need to confine the sea creatures under their protection. As ambassadors from the sea, the marine animals held at SeaTopia are representatives of their kind. They can be seen as missionaries, living in a foreign world so that they may enlighten those who visit with the worth of their existence. As diplomats from the wetter 2/3rds of our planet, their captivity in some misguided way actually inspires humans to know and appreciate them.The considered rights and wrongs of the story come to judgment in an exciting climax. Is it Mother Nature that sets things right, or the fishtian god Seaqoyit that brings the ocean to the shoreline aquarium? Does that wall of water destroy or does it inspire a vision for the rightness of how things should be? As a story filled with friendships in faith, despondency with hope, and cruelty that stirs compassion, \\"Out There, Somewhere\\" washes the reader with an experience made human through its sea life. From SeaTopia, where no one starves, except for variety, and no one hungers except for the freedom of the seas, John Morano shrinks our world into the microcosm of an aquarium and invites us to come have a look at ourselves."},{"Title":"WAP Servlets: Developing Dynamic Web Content With Java and WML (With CD-ROM)","review":"The author makes a good attempt at describing how Java Servlets could be used for a WAP application. Though the intention of the author is good, the examples are made unecessarily complicated to demostrate simple concepts that could confuse a beginner. The Servlet version used in this book is rather outdated (v2.1) and the discussion on WAP and WML is just enough to explain the examples specifically developed for this book. There is also a big chapter in this book explaining the outdated servlet 2.1 api.Given the high cost of this book, the readers are better off buying a book on WAP and a book on Servlets separately.

Unlike some books, it doesn't have pages of very short descriptions of cat breeds. I find these very boring, as they tend to say the same things from book to book. These have no relevance to actually taking care of your cat. This book has enlightened me on several things about taking care of my cat. Much to my cat's distaste, I no longer feed her mass market pet food, but follow the simple directions found in the book. I also moved my ageing cat indoors, where she seems much less stressed.

They are absolutely addicting! :)"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"A tale of two paternally related sisters -- as usual Rebecca Bloomwood, the center of attention, and her new husband Luke Brandon have just returned from a very long honeymoon and traveling around the world to find out that Rebecca has a sister that nobody in her family has ever known about -- until now. This woman is not anywhere near what she thought she would be. Rebecca is the infamous shopaholic and her newfound sister is a conservationist, activist, responsible, frugal, you name it, everything Rebecca is not.. The two clash and the entire book is basically about the struggle for a relationship on Rebecca's part to make this woman she's never met before in her life be the sister and best gal pal she never had.I think this book was just a filler novel. Don't get me wrong -- the book was enjoyable and an easy quick read just like the others in Shopaholic series, but not nearly as comedic and funny as the others to this point. It seemed a little repetitive. People want to see Rebecca Bloomwood-Brandon do something other than self conflict over buying a new pair of kitten heels."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was getting a little worried in the beginning that Becky would dig herself into a ridiculous anxiety-inspiring situation that I couldn't see the bright side of. And yes, she sets you up as usual, but having her alter ego- the sister that is so completely opposite- and yet you realize partially the same, was a very nice angle on a trusted formula. Kinsella writes such a perfect little read- fun and diverting, and it's NOT about getting the guy, idolizing the perfect shoe (well...)... or like such other awful chicklit. This is tight and fast and is about... economics, friendship and compulsion. Definitely worth a read. I also can't wait until shopaholic & baby."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"It's so refreshing to see a character that we already love still making us laugh book after book!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I loved the first 3 Shopaholic books. Sophie Kinsella is one of my top 3 favorite authors but I think she could have done a better job on this book. Although it was funny and entertaining in some parts, Rebecca Bloomwood has lost some of the flare and humor that made us fall in love with her in the first place. Recommended read, but if you loved the first 3 books, you will be mildly disappointed with this"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I've always liked the shopaholic series because it's relaxing and funny to read. Reading them is a great break from reading more scholarly works. They are great beach, airplane and weekend books. This one is no exception.Basically the plot is Becky finds out she has a half sister from before her parents were married and wants to be best buds with her. But Jess hates shopping, spending and Becky's constant (well meaning) lies to her husband Luke.Set against the backdrop of Becky returning for her ten month honeymoon and Luke going back to the corporate world big-time, Becky's parents on a therapy cruise and Suz, Becky's best friend having twins and finding new friends this book is an equation for Becky to a major shopping meltdown! But our favorite material girl can be surprising and all fans of Becky will love this latest installment in her life.I'm hoping for another book soon. Four stars."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This takes a slightly different tone than the first three Shopaholic books. Returning from world traveling on their honeymoon, Becky and Luke hit some rough patches in their marriage. As the situation develops, you can't help thinking \\"Oh, noooo, Becky, don't do it.\\" But of course she plows ahead making the situation with her husband and her newly found sister go from bad to worse.Earlier Becky seemed self-centered, but here her actions seem more selfish. I tried to figure out why it was painful to read some of the developments. Kinsella hits too close to home sometimes with her seemingly light story of regretful situations that everyone falls into at least once in their life. Remember saying something unkind about someone and then turning to find them standing there? How about postponing telling someone you have goofed and their anger when they do find out? Kinsella makes us squirm a little as Becky goes through these situations.Happily it all works out for the best and the reader ends on an upbeat feeling.I recommend reading the first three shopaholic books before starting this one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"If you haven't read any other Shopaholic books, don't start here. Starting at the beginning will endear the reader to the character of Becky Bloomwood and set up the rest of the series. No book so far has been able to compare to the humor and fun of the debut Becky Bloomwood novel, Confessions of a Shopaholic.For fans, they can expect Becky to be the same, with inaction on the financial front and passive lies to get her way or to avoid dealing with situations. In this book, we're introduced to the complete opposite of Becky, Jess, who is almost a caricature of herself in her thriftiness (a scrub brush made out of an old onion bag and coffee grounds which are re-used for weeks). The dramatic action of this book comes when Becky and Jess inevitably clash.There's a great twist to the book that I didn't see coming, and I liked the way it wrapped up. Another reviewer has suggested that Kinsella branch out into other characters and have Becky make a cameo appearance in another novel. I think that would be a great idea."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky is back once again, but this time as Mrs Brandon and with a new long-lost sister, courtesy of her father's dalliance with a stewardess.While Becky assumes that her sister will be much like herself, she soon finds out that this is not the case. In fact, Jessice could not possibly be more different than Becky. Some of the best scenes involve Becky trying to assimilate Jessica into her world and vice versa.Becky continues to be a sweet, faulty but loveable character who you will root for time and time again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I totally disagree with other reviewers saying Becky isn't likeable anymore and this book wasn't as good as the other three. Personally, I think it was my favorite. It seems that as the years have gone by, Becky has stayed the same and been unharmed by the bumbling mistakes she creates by her own idiocy. However, in this novel, the most important thing in her life (shopping??? no) might very well be lost. This is serious in Becky's string of nonstop shopping adventures and Angel bag coups. How she makes it out alive is hilarious, touching and made me feel so good. In the previous three novels, has Becky not been ridiculous? And she delivers full on, bringing unwanted attention to yourself in a public place because you cannot stop laughing out loud, hilarity in the fourth go.Becky's sister, Jess, is so different different from her. She is such a funny and refreshing contrast to Becky's inaneness. Becky is so ready to love her and be soulmates. Of course she's going to be a little disappointed....and it's hysterical. But as people go, there's always a lot more going on under the surface than meets the eye. Course Becky doesn't realize that...and goes on to feel pathetically sorry for her designer clad self. Poor Bex!The only thing I didn't like was that more attention wasn't paid to Suze and Bex's relationship. But I am positive that the next go will have more Suze. Yeah! Hurry Sophie Hurry! And Thank You So Much For This BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read all of the Shopaholic books and \\"Can you keep a secret?\\" and I was extremely happy when I saw that a fourth book was coming out. I read the book in 3 days and I loved it. Although, I think that the Jess story was not as interesting as Becky's previous antics. Something that happens at the end of this book makes me think that a fifth Shopaholic book is on its way. I love this book and hopefully you will too."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I read it in one night... I just couldn't put it down. If you like Becky Bloomwood, this will not disapoint you.

After he proclaims to hate the activity, he goes off for a shopping spree with two expert shoppers, hoping to garner some inside understanding of \\"why\\" women do it. By day's end he says, \\"I am starting to understand how women make this shopping thing more exciting. They turn it into gambling.\\"Bingo! It's as if Stein spent the day with fictional Becky Bloomwood, world-class shopper extraordinaire and heroine of Sophie Kinsella's fourth installment in her funny and bestselling Shopaholic series. For Becky, shopping IS gambling. Gambling with her credit limits. Gambling with her bank account balance. And, in SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER, gambling with love and family.After nearly a year of world travel, homesick Becky and her new husband Luke curtail their honeymoon to return to England. Becky soon learns that a year is a long time, and though her shopping tendencies haven't changed (well, maybe they've gotten worse, if that's possible), other things have changed. For instance, in her absence, her best friend Suze seems to have found a new best friend, Lulu. And Becky's mom and dad are acting strange and secretive...for good reason. It's not long after her return that Becky finds out she has a half sister --- a dream come true for Becky.With Suze distracted by motherhood and her new friend, Becky shifts all her focus and enthusiasm to her new sister Jessica. \\"The point is,\\" Becky observes on their first shopping excursion together, \\"we're here! It's a fantastic day, sunny but not too warm, with tiny cloud scudding across the blue sky. As I get out, I look around the sunlit street, feeling all buzzy with anticipation. My first shopping trip with my sister!\\" Sounds great, doesn't it? Not so fast. Jessica, it turns out, is not the shopping enthusiast Becky is and, in fact, is frugal (a word foreign to Becky).Becky's high hopes of an idyllic sisterly relationship with weekend manicures and pedicures, forays into Versace shops, and lazy afternoons at outdoor cafes gossiping over lattes are dashed quickly. And, as if familial trouble isn't enough, Becky's novice marriage is on shaky ground too. Not thinking, Becky promises a questionable character that Luke will help him market the opening of a new hotel. When Luke finds out what Becky has committed him to without his permission (and all because the gentleman in question bought her a handbag!), he is livid. And, in Becky's eyes, it looks like Luke is beginning to prefer mousy, practical and cheap Jessica to her.Everything is on the line for Becky: her marriage, her sister, her friendship, her allowance! As in all the Shopaholic books, Kinsella gives us an over-the-top, almost unbelievable, but highly comical Becky, ever gambling, this time trying to buy time with creditors and win her husband's love back. Kinsella gambles too: Becky verges on formulaic (how much more can she buy, and how many more clever letters can she write to avoid paying bills?) --- but it's a winning formula. Becky is as funny as ever, and you can't help but root for her.--- Reviewed by Roberta O'Hara"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Where can I even start? This is pathetic. I think her other books were okay, with the first and last being acceptable beach reads. In this book however, Becky's personality unfortunately took such a turn for the worse that reading it hurt my stomach.Anyone who lied this much to his or her spouse would have no marriage whatsoever. I just cannot understand it. I wonder, does Kinsella think that this type of behavior is acceptable? Does she act like this? Where does someone get these ideas from? I am just disturbned by Becky's thought processes and rationalizations in lying to Luke regarding purchaces. If I buy anything I tell my husband what and how much....he does the same. It is called honesty. Becky's character really is quite sick.The idea that someone would take a ten month honeymoon if money was ever even a possible issue is ludicrous in and of itself to begin with, but then to buy ridiculous amounts of furniture and have it shipped and forget about it and then buy a two thousand euro purse and lie about it...why would this be interesting or funny? It is just sad.Then when she was found out by her husband and sister regarding the ridiculous debt and ebay addiction she had aqcuired she still was unable to or maybe she refused to cut back on little stuff at the supermarket...and that was where I drew the line. She had an internal temper tantrum and was unable to distinguish between wanting a needing, something an eight year old can actually do.In real life people who have compulsions to lavishly and needlessly spend money on magazines, clothes, luxury food items, appliances and furniture, who try to buy love from others, who can only find pleasure in shopping, who drink champagne and wine constantly, who join gyms to use the juice bar and look cute, who have the thought processes of a six year old, who judge others by their outfits, and hide bills from their husbands are what I call spoiled, immature, irresponsible, impulsive children, not cute spunky characters in chick lit novels. The worst book I have ever read.If you want a good chick lit novel go for Marian Keyes. This is garabage.If Becky Bloomwood were real she would probably be have a mental or personality disorder. It is not funny or cute or endearing. She is not cute, witty or likable. I would recommend having her put under the supervision of a psychiatrist if she were a real person. As it is, having read all these horrible books, I need therapy. What a waste of time and money. I should have known better."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I hunted, I mean, HUNTED for this book b/c I absolutely ADORE The Shopaholic books. They are witty, fun, and very easy reading. This book was a HUGE disappointment for me. Makes me even more grateful to GOD that I didn't spend my hard earned money! First off, I would agree with a poster further up who said that after four books, with marriage and all that and Becky is up to her same old schemes...CLEARLY, there is a deeper issue than just spending. She just gets into mess after mess and you would think that after marriage, she would have learned a bit. The sister plotline was just a stupid, STUPID, and unbelievable idea. Jess was the most horrible person. She was ungrateful, RUDE, pretentious, and just a plain old witch. I kept wanting to smack Becky upside her head for overdoing it trying to be her friend/sister. It got on my nerves. Actually, the entire book got on my nerves.This book, along with The Undomestic Goddess, seemed like cheap ploys to capitalize on SK's previous success. They were both way over the top.I really hope this is the last of the Shopaholic series b/c there's no sense in ruining a perfectly decent series. Sadly, it may not be over because (scroll for spoiler)**Becky ends up preggo at the end of the book.**"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm sorry to be writing this type of review, since I've enjoyed Sophie Kinsella's books in the past. Can you keep a secret? was fresh and funny and different from the compulsive shopping theme. Having Becky move to New York and having her get married were good plot ideas that kept the theme alive. Now I think it's time to move on. This book was like the 10th season of a sitcom that started out as a hit. The first 100 pages were superfluous, more of the same old, same old. Nothing was mentioned about a sister. This could have been shortened and Jessica's story fleshed out. Becky is now close to 30 and she still comes off as naive, immature and irresponsible. Even if she is a bit of a ditz, though, she can be likable. There is nothing to like about Jessica and that turnaround at the end is just not believable. Jessica was one of the most rude, ungracious, obnoxious characters I have seen from an author who knows how to create them. Luke also showed an extremely churlish side for most of the book. I think this story line is running out of steam. It's just not fun to read anymore and I know the author can do better. I'm anxious to try her Undomestic Goddess and see how that goes. She needs to give Becky a rest."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I tried to love this book, I really did, but I just couldnt.

I'm starting to lose sympathy for Becky, she just simply refuses to grow up and learn. That was cute for a while, but I'm starting to feel like Jess - that she needs to grow up! She's still making the same stupid mistakes and still expecting others to just cover for her and it started to get a bit old in this book.That said, Ms. Kinsella is still entertaining and funny, so it was an easy read. However, I think this character has run her course - unless she can find something new to do with Becky."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have read and loved all of Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic novels. The novels are light and fun and it is always a droll trip to read about Becky Bloomwood's adventures in retail therapy. Shopaholic and Sister, though not as good as the earlier novels, is another romp starring the shopaholic we know and love. Rebecca Brandon (her new married name) is having the time of her life with her husband. They have spent almost a year making honeymoon trips around the world. But when she returns to London, things are different. Her parents don't seem pleased to see her, her best friend Suze has found a replacement friend with motherhood in common, and there's the little issue of having purchased far too much furniture and souvenirs in every country she had visited, not to mention maxing out her secret credit card by buying the most expensive and trendiest handbag in the world. But things start looking up when Becky discovers that she has a long-lost sister. She is thrilled to have a sister and potential shopping partner -- except that said sister is the exact opposite of Becky. There are various fun twists throughout the novel.There are lots of funny moments in the novel that center on Becky's uncontrollable spending. The excess furniture is the funniest bit in the novel. But the novel isn't as good as the previous installments because Becky goes into overdrive in pretty much everything. She was overly cheerful and somewhat delusional in the other novels, but here she is that way all the time! It was like she had overdosed on caffeine and other stimulants. I know she's supposed to be annoying, but it is kind of off-putting because now her annoyance is just over the top. She gets especially overwhelming in the second half of the book. There is also the factor that Becky and Luke have misunderstandings and incidents not unlike the ones from the first three books -- i.e., Becky keeping secrets from Luke. I was entertained nevertheless. I wanted a fun, no-fuss read and I got it. I enjoyed Shopaholic and Sister. Based on this novel's bit of a cliffhanger, there will be more shopaholic books in the future. I just hope that Ms. Kinsella tones the heroine's enthusiasm down a notch or two."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Like The Princess Diaries, I feel that this is a series that should have ended after the third installment. There is such a thing as quitting while you are ahead. The intent of this novel clearly isn't to provide fans with another hilarious adventure of the main character, but to simply ride off the success of the previous three. It was completely unnecessary. I hope Ms. Kinsella cares enough about her writing to know that she should discontinue the series after this book.The plot is the same as mentioned by previous reviewers. Becky shops, gets in trouble and is bailed out. As usual. Does anyone else find it completely unbelievable that someone as resourceful and smart as Luke would be interested in someone as vain and selfish as Becky? And that \\"twist ending\\" wasn't a big surprise to me. I saw that one coming a mile away.Overall, it was an alright novel. It felt a bit rushed though. If only authors knew when to stop a title and move on..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Having been so shocked and surprised to see that there was another \\"Shopaholic\\" book being published (in the UK a number of months ago); I asked myself...what's left?? Becky has bought (and sold) every designer shoe, sweater, bag, scarf, etc known to man - she's gotten married to the man of her dreams - escaped from a crazy mother in law - and known the wonders of a family that will love her during any of her crisis. What is there left to tell..... Well, in age old soap-opera fashion, give the girl a long lost sister. To be totally honest - this was a stretch for me. I found little be excited about - except the beginning (during the honeymoon - classic Becky).All in all --- I found the storyline farfetched and pretty unbelievable. I think this might be a dead horse that needs to be left alone.Don't get me wrong ---- I love the Shopaholic books. Adore them; I just don't want to see them turned into something cheap.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I am a big fan of Becky Bloomwood. I loved her first three books, Shopaholic, Manhattan, and Ties the Knot. However, this book was not as good as those. I am, sadly to say, starting to get a little annoyed at Becky. Does she ever learn her lesson? Her and I are the same age, yet she continually repeats the same offenses and covers them up with lies. Why Luke stands by her is beyond me, which only perpetuates her childish behavior. Like I said, I enjoyed her first three adventures, but with Sister, I feel that Kinsella only wrote it to continue the series without coming up with anything really fresh and new."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I absolutely love the \\"shopaholic\\" series. As a shopaholic myself, I lose myself in them and I feel almost as if she is an extension of me (a far extension)This book, however, was not up to the standard of the rest of the books. I've read \\"Confessions\\", \\"Takes Manhattan\\", \\"Ties the Knot\\", etc and while this book was entertaining, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the others. Worth a read though"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I first started reading the shopaholic series when I was in London 4 years ago. While this book didn't measure up to the other books in the series, it definately is a fun light read. I'm not sure how I feel about how it fits into the series, but I can't wait for Shopaholic and Baby. If you want a quick funny, witty read, you can't go wrong with this."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I read the book, loved it, and even cried at one point. Then I read some of the reviews before posting this. If you have such bad reviews, I must suggest that you don't read the next book. However, if you are like me and enjoyed every book in the series including this one, then hang on for Book 4. I read this book and others like it purely for their fictional content and romance-comedy style."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"My daughter suggested that I read the Shopaholic series and I have to admit -- I couldn't put them down. They are great light reading as they go quickly and the story line is entertaining as I know people just like this! I travelled a lot this summer and they are perfect for the plane and airport.Just plain fun. You will need to read the others in the series first."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"From reading all the other reviews, I see that people are disappointed with this book, whereas I completley disagree. I loved this book [even though it was a little farfetched at times] & I practically devoured it. The Shopaholic Series makes me laugh, & this one did just that. It slightly pissed me off though, that Becky was trying so hard to impress her sister, but I'm glad for the happy ending & that there will be another book.I don't care what everyone else thinks, I can't wait for Shopaholic & Baby !!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I LOVED this book. Ive followed Becky through all her trials and tribulatiuons and every good and bad time with Luke. This book had me feeling so sad through quite alot of it due to everything with luke and her sister being nasty. But it was a phenomenal book, i can't wait for more about Becky,"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky, Becky, Becky, she continues to do the most outrageous things making this book as funny and heartfelt as the first three books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm very dissapointed with the outcome of this book. I may not even finish reading it. so far I've read the forst 300 hundred pages and I've laughed only once. I don't know what all the rave is about. If you want a good read as I did-don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Okay, I admit, it's my own fault. After the last Shopaholic book, I should have never gotten this one. I guess I'm a Shopaholic as well. I couldn't care less about Bex or anyone else in the plot (was there a plot?) They should stuff it all in their contrived Angel bag and be done with it. Please, no more, we can't take it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. In this book, Becky is an airhead. Same boring plot, nothing new.I can't bring myself to finish reading the book, it's so boring."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Paperback $7.99Kindle $12.86Outrageous - a paperback is much cheaper than the e-book.That's what is called ripping off customers!Shame on you, Amazon and publisher!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I thought this book was excellent! Once I started, I couldn't ever bring myself to put it down. Kinsella put a lot of twists into this novel. It left me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole story. I would definately recommend this book to people of all ages, it's one of my favorites. I hope that Kinsella pulishes another sequel because I just can't get enough of her books!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"some definite laughs but not as fun as the other books in the series..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This product was in excellent shape upon arrive, but it came MUCH later than I expected! :("},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Sorry ladies. This book made me so mad (because I spent so much money on the hardback version). It is my fault, because the last shopaholic book pissed me off, but I must have forgotten that the day that I yearned for a nice chick lit read and picked this book up. The main character has no redeeming qualities at all; she is no Bridget Jones or Jemima J. And, the writing is overly simplistic. Yet this Sophie Kinsella is making loads of money, which is kind of ironic since the main character spends her money on crap and Ms. Kinsella is doing nothing but dish out the kind of crap that the character would waste her money on.This character is stupid, selfish, and Ms. Kinsella has a warped sense of marriage. In fact, it is the whole vision of marriage that makes me see this book as decidedly unfunny and backwards. There is a reason why this character identifies most with a 13 year old girl.Because I don't want to be completely mean, if you want a book by this author get Can't Keep a Secret(?)..the character and plot are not as bad (but get it at a discount or in the library because it ain't worth retail price). Alternately, you can check out Helen Fielding's Olivia Jules character (absurd...but palatable) or Jane Green's novels if you are looking for British lady humor."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Okay i have not read this book, but i have read the first three. I enjoyed the first three but i'm sorry but this one sounds idiotic. Just so you know Shopie is coming out with a new shopAholic book SHOPAHOLIC & BABY. You can just imagine what'll happen. And i agree Bex needs professional help...like moving into a happy house?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky and Luke have been on their honeymoon traveling the world together for the past 10 months but when Becky gets an invitation to her best friends Suzes twins Christening, they decide to end the honeymoon early and come back home.Becky has grand ideas of how she will be greeted after being away for so long but she is soon let down. Her parents acted very strange when she showed up at their house and it turns out they had good reason. Becky has a step sister that she knew nothing about. She immediately dreams about shopping with this long lost sister but it turns out that Jess is very frugal and hates to shop.I was really expecting more laughs and fun with this book but Becky spent way to much time feeling sorry for her self because of her relationships with Luke, Jess, and Suze. I am still looking forward to one more book in this series to see how life ends up for Becky though."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"love this book, so much fun!! I literally laughed out loud several times while reading this book, and I am 22 years old. I would highly recommend this book and any of sophie kinsella's other books"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Very entertaining; enjoyed the last third of the book the most. This woman reminded me of a couple of people I know!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love all the shopaholic books and Becky Bloomwood is a hilarious heroine. This book was great fun when Becky meets her long lost sister who hates shopping. A must for Sophie Kinsella fans!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I'm the type of person that likes to finish a book series once I've started it, especially if I've read two or three of them. After the third book I had gotten pretty annoyed with the main character and her lack of punishment for all of her lying.That being said, I'm glad I continued this series because this fourth book makes her out to be much less annoying. While she did drive me crazy the whole first half of the book, she has some redeeming qualities for the second half. For comparison, before she just lied and lied and lied all the way to he end where everything just fell in to place, this time she actually realized her mistakes and wanted to fix them before it was too late.I'm hoping these qualities continue (somewhat, otherwise where would the shopaholic part come in to play?) in to the future books. I like books with some sort of moral.Aside from that, the book was a quick and easy read. Even if I hadn't liked it, wouldn't have wasted much of my time on it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I hate to be a downer, but I'm getting slightly tired of the shopaholic books. I know, I could just stop reading them, but something compels me to continue. I do find myself enjoying them, but get a little annoyed with the situations Becky puts herself in. This is how a shopaholic book goes for me.At the beginning of the book I'm having fun, enjoying getting reacquainted with Becky and catching up on what happened since the end of the last book. She's happy and carefree at first and still on the right path. A few chapters go by and I can see the writing on the wall. It doesn't appear Becky hasn't learned anything from her last disaster, she hasn't grown up and matured at all and she's headed toward disaster again. The whole middle of the book is spent with me shaking my head at awe at how someone can be so clueless and hurt so many people around her. I get really frustrated seeing her try to validate all her irresponsible decisions and act as though shopping can lead to ultimate bliss. Then in every book she somehow manages to repair everything and seemingly grow up and learn from the disaster she created.With each passing book the drama gets a little more annoying. It was OK for a young girl living with her best friend to be ignorant and stupid. But as Becky grows up and takes on more responsibility and gets married it would be nice to see her slowly grow as a character also. It seems Suze has made this transformation. I'm not saying Becky should totally change, but since I'm following Becky through multiple books it would be nice to see her as a growing, changing woman. But, I do usually end up getting a lot of laughs out of these books, and I see a tiny sliver of myself in my late teens and early twenties in her. Kinsella is a very talented writer and knows how to write a bright, uplifting book. I appreciate that coming from reading mystery and suspense novels mostly. These books are the breath of fresh air I need when I start taking life to seriously.With all that being said, I will probably end up reading the next shopaholic book, because somehow I get roped into the book and really enjoy seeing how she patches up her life and makes good on all the disasters she created. I'm curious to see how things go when she has a baby. Hopefully I'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"All of the Shopaholic books (and I have read all of them) are just wonderful. Although probably written for the younger adult, I am 71 years old with a 31 year old daughter, so can relate to a lot of what she writes. The books are the kind you can't put down, funny, and leave you wanting more. I wish Sophie would write more in the series. I have loved getting the books from Amazon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I know I'm a little behind in the Shopaholic reading, but I think this was the best book yet. It definitely gave more insight into Becky's faults as well as her strength. I really enjoy how Sophie Kinsella doesn't let Becky become just totally ditzy and shallow but actually does give her real sets of skills. Of course, the other reviewers have already outlined the general plot, so I won't get into it, but this book is definitely a fun read and great for fans of the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This shopaholic book really cements Becky's character. Yes you want to say no don't do it Becky! many times but more importantly it shows her vulnerable side. In addition, you will be a little upset with Luke and Suze at parts. But if you don't see yourself in this one then maybe you shouldn't keep reading this series! I disagree that the sister is shown to be a better person. She has faults like everyone in this book and in life. So maybe that's why this one is so special. Still just as funny."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This has been such a fun series to read. If you love girly books than I recommend that you read all of the Shopaholic's. Never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Very funny boook, it made me laugh out loud! The loveabl Becky Bloomwood is back with a bang in this story when she finds out she has a sister, Jess, who is the complete opposite to her and hates shopping. Good girlie fun!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another great addition to the Shopaholic series - Sophie Kinsella once again brings Becky, a quirky but lovable character back into the fray with a wonderful mix of weary world traveling, sisterhood and of course, more shopping!!We pick Becky up at the end of a 10-month honeymoon with her new hubbie Luke - they've been all over the world and Becky's got a lot of shopping to show for it - but it's easy - she just buys and has it all shipped home - she'll worry about where to put it all later! Becky decides to surprise her parents and her best friend Suze - by arriving in England unexpectedly. Becky's in for a rude surprise - she seems to have been forgotten by her best friend Suze, who's had twins since Becky left for her honeymoon. Along with the twins, Suze's got a brand new buddy that doesn't seemed too thrilled about Becky's return. Even her parents don't seem too thrilled to see her and there's some girl lurking in the background - who can she be? Well, Becky finds out that she's got a sister! It seems that before her parents met, Becky's dad had a romance with a flight attendant and never knew that she'd had a baby girl that she named Jessica. Becky is thrilled to hear about her sister and decides that the best way to bond is by...what else? Shopping!! She quickly learns that Jess doesn't like shopping (Gasp!) and basically finds Becky to be irresponsible and shallow. Becky is determined to change her sisters' mind and travels to the English countryside where Jess lives in order to bridge the gap and find her way into her sisters' heart. Will Becky and Jess become soul mates? Will Jess learn to love shopping? Sophie Kinsella delights her readers once again as she takes us on adventure to find out!During all the action, we get the story from Luke's perspective a little more - we see why he loves Becky so much and in seeing her through his eyes, we learn to love her just a little bit more!I read a few books between the last book (...Ties the Knot) and this one, but I found myself falling back into the story easily - It was nice to hear about Becky again! This was a fun story and the ending leads you right into the next book in the series - that's right, I think it might be time for our Shopaholic to have a Baby!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This was a good book but it was my least favorite of the series. It is worth reading if you've already started the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Bloomwood Brandon has done it again... she really cannot be upfront with anyone when it comes to mishaps, but isnt that why we all love her. This book is very comical, and you will still root for Becky even if you know that she should really let others be privy to important information.I did find Becky's sister a little on the snobby side (snobby as in attitude not moneywise). I thought Becky tried very hard to make a relationship with her, and the sister was very resistant to this.In the end, things turn out all right, but Becky's journey to \\"everything will be fine\\" will have you laughing. Pick this one up for a funny light read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I was nervous when I started reading this one due to many of the negative reviews, but I have to say, I was happily surprised! I just became a fan of the Shopaholic series and I just love Becky & Luke! I really didn't think their relationship was given enough attention in this first book, but it picked up from there and I will have to say the reader really gets to get in deep with their relationship in this book. I have to agree with a previous reviewer who compared Becky to Lucy Ricardo - that's exactly who she reminds me of. In Sister, I did not find myself feeling as frustrated with Becky for not owning up sooner. Unlike others, I thought she had grown more in this book. She seemed to own up to her mistakes much quicker (there were just SEVERAL to own up to in this book). I really think this one was my all time fave of the series. I have the next one (Baby) ordered already and can't wait to read it. But I do admit that I'm a little sad that it's the last one. I really hope Sophie Kinsella finds a way to bring us more Luke & Becky!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another really cute Shopoholic book. It won't win a Pulizer, but it will keep you entertained. It's a funny, light read and the characters are endearing."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is actually the first book I have read out of the Shopaholic series. Mainly that's because it was the only one my library had.This book was funny and great for a lighthearted read which is a nice change from the books I usually read.I only gave this book 3 stars because it was just not one that pulled me in. The main character, Becky, is amusing but reminds me of Amelia Bedilia (from the children's series) because she is such a simpleton! She obviously is blonde and at times it was annoying that she thought so plainly - not taking a hint or thinking more before acting.I will read the other books in this series since they got better reviews than this one. Maybe this one was the dud of the series!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I hate to say anything bad about the series I love so much, but this one was just not up there for me. I love Becky, but this could have been better. I would never not read it- and I'm glad I did. I was slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The book that I purchased was brand new and in perfect condition and it only took like three days for it to be delivered."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I enjoyed a lot reading this book and actually it was the first one I had read among all Shopaholic series. In book, the story deals with all sort of emotion and human relationship including the romance, family hood, friendship, sadness, nostalgia, sisterhood and so forth. Even though the book is often considered as chick lit or something like that, I think the themes and settings in this book are very meaningful and captivating."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"As usual, Becky Bloomwood is fun and enjoyable, you can never go wrong with any of the books in this series. I'm glad I found this author."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I almost passed this one up because of the neg reviews here but I thought what the heck, I might still like it and I did. It's not as good as the first 3 in the Shopaholic series but I don't regret reading it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is my fourth book in the series, and I'm still enchanted by Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood). Yes, her material obsession is ridiculous, but it's funny, too. And her basic sweet optimism and boundless positive energy makes the reader ready to forgive her just about anything. The regular supporting cast is here -- Luke (who finally finds himself exasperated with Becky ... I wonder what took him so long, and am glad to see he's human), Suze (and her horsey new best friend) and her parents (who have a wildly funny conversation about Becky, Cher and Kylie Minogue). There are new characters, too, like Kelly, the dreamy small-town girl who should have been Becky's sister, and Jess, the thrify and sensible environmentalist who is Becky's sister. If you're a fan of the series, I recommend this edition whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Having enjoyed the other three Shopaholic books, I wasn't sure how this one would compare - the plot summary left me skeptical that it'd be much good. And while the plot is based on something you'd never expect from her parents, the book itself turned out to be sweet and - I thought - better than the last installment in the series.There's the familiar shopaholic storyline (she spends too munch, makes a mistake, tries to hide it, mistake blows up, but everything is happy in the end), but the journey to the end was fun. Becky's siter, Jess, is shown to be a tightwad who seems to only be interested in rocks and doesn't want to really get to know her new family, while Becky fantasizes of them going shopping together and laughing the way sisters do. After a disasterous time together, Becky realizes that she had more of a sisterly relationship with Suze. But Suze has 3 children now and seems to be more content to spend time with her new best friend, another mom.I liked the fact that this book went more into the relationships between the people instead of just focusing on her spending habits. You got a better glimpse into her psyche, which was nice.If you've read the other three books, definitely check this one out. It may not be the most creative book in the world, but it won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While this is my least favorite among the Bloomwood stories, it was still a great read. In this story, Rebecca's wishes seem to come true when she finds out that she has a long lost half sister. She immediately assumes the best, and believes she has a new best friend. Not to mention that the timing couldn't be better, since Rebecca's long time friend Suze, seems to have moved on and made new friends and experiences without her. But nothing ever goes as planned in Rebecca's life, and she and her sister couldn't be any more different. I found this story to be a little too unbelievable, but it was a fast read, and worth my time. I hope you like it!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I bought this book and read it from cover to cover in a matter of 4 hours on a plane ride. Needless to say, this was a quick read. The format of these books are always the same, Becky has this fab life; Becky lies, buys and schemes her fab life into total chaos; Becky fixes all the chaos and lives happily ever after. Although, this time, Becky seems to be even more shallow and scheming than usual. I liked the introduction of the sister and thought that all of the debacles in the \\"Northern Country\\" redeemed this book from the utter depths of predictability. No matter what, I'm going to read the Shopaholic series, and I liked this book, but it is clearly the weakest of the 4 books in the series. If you are a fan of the series, its worth the read, and it will leave you wanting more Becky."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Well, just finished with this book and I have to say it was good overall but I was disappointed with Becky's attitude. At times she was REALLY pathetic and dumb and it was almost like embarassing to read that she was like this. The marriage between Luke and her just seems so unrealistic because she does some horrible things and her and Luke just seem so mismatched. In the beginning things were funny and I was laughing out loud like always but then the story kinda changed for me. And I felt I could not relate to Becky as well as I did with the other books. This book just made her look dumb, not spunky like the other books. But I am looking forward to the next book...I won't give up on this series!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Really enjoyed this quick read! Refreshing topic and fun reading. Liked the focus on different relationships and their evolving growth."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"love the shopaholic series, great read, suspenseful, definitely worth it, highly recommend it, fun chick-flick novel, you will love it"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I readConfessions of a Shopaholic(the first in the series) a couple of weeks ago based upon the strong recommendation of a friend. It was a very funny, light-hearted read that I was sad to see end. Typically, I am not one to go through a series very quickly since I rotate genres and will often go three or four months before going to the next installment in a series. That hasn't happened here at all --- I just finished this fourth installment and have already downloaded the fifth to my Kindle. I can't exactly put my finger on why this has captured my interest, but I am enjoying this group of books immensely and find them highly entertaining.Shopaholic & Sister (Shopaholic Series)is the fourth entry into this entertaining series. The characters are continuing to evolve and Becky is maturing (sort of) as the novels progress. I have been very interested to see how Ms. Kinsella has managed to come up with fresh story lines and new situations while staying true to the characters --- she has done an amazing job at this. By introducing the character of Jess, she has added a new dynamic and some twists and turns. These books fall into the category of funny, entertaining, fluffy reads that have me chuckling with disbelief. As narcissistic as the main character is, I think I would find her irritating but don't. She is funny and crazy and I love seeing how she gets herself into and out of all these ridiculous situationsGood, lighthearted read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book was not a great read. Similar to the I Love Lucy character but less endearing. Disappointed by the writing and voice of the author - maybe young adult readers? I probably will not read any others of the series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Well, this one was quite cute, too. I liked it quite a bit! Although some minor details bothered me, but it really doesn't detract from the fun of the series, really. I mean, they are supposed to be silly books - and this one with its rather outlandish plot was the silliest of them all. I must admit, however, I am disappointed that the next book is the last in the series... I really did not expect to enjoy this series as I much as I have!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book was easy to read, funny and just very cute. I definitely recommend this book/series to the ladies who want a good laugh and to forget about everything else. Enjoy! I know I sure did. I loved the whole series of books and definitely think the books are much better than the movie."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down. It's probably more interesting to woman, but still great."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky is back and up to her usual tricks. She and Luke return from their 10-month honeymoon where Becky (of course) spent too much money on souvenirs and had them secretly shipped home. Upon returning, she discovers she has a half-sister that she never knew existed. Becky dreams of a blissful sister relationship - but is shocked to learn Jess hates shopping. In fact, the two have nothing in common. In usual Becky form, she makes a disaster of the situation but manages to fix it all in the end. Perfect light reading -- even if you spend a good deal want to knock Becky upside her head."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love the whole Shopaholic series and expected to find this one just as enjoyable. However, the stepsister made me uncomfortable. This is an important read to understand the whole story and appreciate Shopaholic and Baby all the more."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Like all of Sophie's books - I could not put it down when I got it. I actually have all of her books now. She is a very good writer."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky and Luke return from their world wide honeymoon to a new world. Suze apparently has a new pal and Becky's parents are harboring a secret. Poor Becky feels lost. Then her parents reveal that she has a half sister that she never knew about. Becky dreams of shopping and bonding with her sister so imagine her surprise when her sister HATES shopping and everything that Becky holds dear. Once again Becky is getting herself into trouble with her shopping and what is a girl to do? Filled with wonderful situations and humor the fourth shopaholic book delivers just as much as the first three."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This one wasn't as funny as the first 3 or the last, but I enjoyed it just the same. Another great one by Sophie Kinsella."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Reading them out of sequence is a little confusing - like how did the main character and Luke hook up in the first place and then how does she end up with a half sister if you skip this one. GREAT READS ALL OF THEM. You might consider ordering all of them at one time so they are on hand as you will want to go straight from one book to the next like I did. Definitely a 5 star read as you will never figure out how the main character will actually get out of the mess she has gotten herself into. I plan to wait a few months and read the series again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Well, the fourth book in the series starts off with Rebecca (Bloomwood)Brandon still stuck in her aggressively shopaholic ways, and to my great dismay and disgust, she repeats behaviors from the past that only land her in a heap of hot water!!! Can't she ever learn? Rebecca tells a huge white lie, which always snowballs rapidly into a glacier of deciet and consequently ruins the trust of everyone around her. She is the ultimate woman that nobody wants to know any longer! Honestly, it starts to get old, but the author, Sophie Kinsella is still able to keep the story line spinning in a most entertaining fashion. It's nice to hear of her best friend Suze, grow up to be a mature modern mother and wife, and the story sparkles most of the book through. The problem is that her newfound half-sister is a miserly tight-wad, and doesn't enjoy the shopping whims of Rebecca. They clash, and then something extraordinary happens that brings them close to one another. It's a bit far-fetched and somewhat unbeleiveable, but her sister saves the story line because she causes Rebecca to examine her immature freewheeling spendthrift ways and corrals her into being frugal. YES - frugal!I ended up not liking either person at all, but the story still held my intense interest throuhout the book. That's the thing about Sophie Kinsella's writing; she really knows how to draw a reader in, hold them suspended in disbelief, and then she lets them down for a surprise ending again and again! Amazing writing! I enjoyed this book, but honestly, Rebecca needs to quit the spending act and become a more responsible, economical shopper; one who realizes she can only use so much in her lifetime, and what about the rest of the world who isn't so endowed? I LOVED the book, especially the parts that made me laugh aloud.Now you go ahead and buy the 4 book series like I did. Easy and fast reading that all shoplucky gals will LOVE!!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky Bloomwood Brandon is back and as funny, vulnerable, and lovable as ever. I am amazed that Sophie Kinsella can keep the humor and laughter coming with this ditzy character, but she does. Frankly, I felt this was the best of the series thus far.We meet up with Becky and Luke in the 10th month of their round-the-world honeymoon. When an invitation to the christening for Suze's twins arrive, the travellers decide to head back to London. Of course, there are a couple of stops along the way, like Milan where Becky studies \\"local artifcacts\\" (Versace shoes) and lands the biggest fashion coup of the year by claiming a genuine Angel handbag thanks to a lot of help from a somewhat shady character who will, needless to say, be back for a proper thank you.Becky's return is not what she envisioned, however. Not only has Suze acquired a new best friend, but her parents are acting very strange. For good reason as it turns out. A previously unknown sister has emerged from the past. Seems Daddy Bloomwood was quite the rogue before he met Mama Bloomwood. Becky immediately begins to fantasize about replacing Suze with this new sister. She dreams of watching chick flicks, eating peppermint creams, laughing, and most of all, shopping with her new-found sister Jess. Alas, Jess is not at all compatible with Becky. Not only is she a dedicated activist and rock collector, she is....dare we use the word.......FRUGAL! And she does not approve of Becky's addiction to shopping at all.Their relationship makes for lots of laugh-out-loud moments and even a few misty-eyed ones. Following their relationship's development and explosion is a true trip into the heart of Becky Bloomwood and what makes her a character millions have fallen in love with.So if you want to see Becky running barefoot over hot coals to get a 5-carat aquamarine at half price, interfering in Luke's business and placing him in an insufferable position, and taking the hiking trip to end all hiking trips, pick up the latest issue in this always-delightful series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic & Sister is the newest installment to what was supposed to end at a Trilogy. Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood) and husband Luke Brandon have just decided to end their year long honeymoon around the globe. When they arrive back at Luke's penthouse they are bombarded with the more gifts and mementos than they could remember buying. Along with that, there are things that get thrown at the newlyweds to juggle. Bex finds out her best friend forever Suze has replaced her with a snooty Lulu, her parents are in counseling, and she finds out about a long lost half sister. Bex has been put on a strict budget due to her vast spending habits. On top of that, she owes a very important man a favor for getting her fab Angel bag. Her sister is a rock loving fanatic that would rather due her accounts than go shopping. Becky doesn't understand why her sister hates shopping I mean after all they are sisters. Becky pulls crazy antics yet she's lovable, funny, and able to turn what seems like the worst situation into one that is unforgettably hilarious and becomes a shining star in the end. The entire Shopaholic series including Shopaholic & Sister had me gripping the covers in anticipation. I hope that Sophie Kinsella will continue to write about my most favorite characters including Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood) again and again."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This latest in the Shopaholic series begins with the ending of Luke and Becky's \\"round-the-world\\" honeymoon. They've been everywhere, and Becky loves her new \\"laid back\\" husband. But some things never change--like Becky's spending habits. By the time the couple returns to London, Becky has all but forgotten about many of her purchases--until they are shipped home; in TWO trucks. The couple arrives back in London early, to surprise their loved ones (especially Becky's beloved Suze, who is about to have her new twins christened)--and are more suprised themselves. Becky's parents share some shocking news with her--she has a half-sister!! And in typical Becky fashion, she fantasizes about her sister--and pictures them getting their nails done, sharing sisterly secrets, and of course shopping together. The announcement of a long-lost sister comes none to soon--as Becky has discovered that in her absence, her best friend Suze has replaced her with the insufferable Lulu, who shares her love of horses and of motherhood.But Becky's meeting with her sister does not go at all as she pictured; and despite Becky's best efforts, she fails to win Jess over. A disastrous weekend spent at Becky and Luke's flat results in a heated argument--and the sisters part ways.A joy to read, this is just a tidbit of the fun that awaits fans in this fourth installment of the series. Becky's shopping obessessions become entangled in Luke's business ventures in ways that readers just cannot see coming. Laugh out loud FUN!!DYB"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"to be honest I was a little disappointed over this newest addition to the series. I have always found Becky Bloomwood to be loveable, flighty, and fun, but in this books she comes off as arrogant, spoiled, and dumb. It could be due to the fact that her penny-pinching half sister Jessica comes off as a saint, in that she is down-to-earth, responsible, and independent. Like the other Shopaholic books, it's a quick read and you think you know what's going to happen but then that \\"twist\\" comes in and throws you off, which I love, but there is a different atmosphere to this book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book follows in its predecessors' footsteps, but lacks the captivating essence that the first three had. Becky is still as lovable and charming as ever, however her spending habits have become tiring and you wonder how after three money fiascoes, she still manages to go over her credit limit. At times, you cringe at how flaky and dense Becky can be, when all you want is for her to wake up and see the real world. Kinsella begins to weave in some intriguing plot twists, but doesn't expand them as well as she could have. Some of them just disappear after being mentioned in a few chapters. Overall a nice read, but could have been an excellent read if both the plot lines and book length had been extended."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I should start by saying that I have enjoyed all of Sophie Kinsella's books that did not revolve around Becky Bloomwood (i.e. Remember Me? The Undomestic Goddess, etc.) However, I'm really surprised by how popular the Shopaholic series is. Even though I constantly reminded myself, \\"Remember! This is supposed to be a light and fun read,\\" I found it impossible to think of Becky Bloomwood/Brandon as endearing, flighty or funny. Becky Brandon is irresponsible. She is immature, selfish and materialistic. She hasn't an ounce of common sense. She gets herself into terrible situations by lying (by omission) to her loved ones. Instead of facing her problems head on, she sticks her head in the sand and tries to avoid them. And then through a twist of luck she miraculously gets herself out of these messes without actually learning anything from them.It is difficult to enjoy a book centered around a character that is so difficult to respect. How can you relate to someone who frivolously spends thousands of dollars, hides her Visa bills, fibs to her husband, messes with his business and tries to buy her sister's love? I'm supposed to like her because she did all these things with \\"good intentions\\"? I don't think so. I really tried, but this book just didn't do it for me. My opinion is obviously in the minority, so I wish other readers the best of luck with this story."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Shopaholic and Sister was a huge disappointment. There were so many cliche moments, it seems Ms. Kinsella has cranked this story out under pressure from the Publisher, not from wanting to continue Becky Bloomwood's story. Awful plot, annoying characters, and Kinsella offers nothing new. I now hate Becky Bloomwood , and I used to love this character. Becky has become a useless moron. AVOID."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While Becky is an amsuing character and the first few books were a lot of fun to read, I don't think I'll read more if this series if Kinsella writes them. Becky's shallow behaviour in the early books is funny, if not entirely realistic--but the fact that she hasn't developed at all as a person by book 4 in the series is rather amazing!Of course, this is not a book anyone should pick up for startling deep revelations into the human condition--it is meant to be a good time, a series of funny anecdotes that don't tax the brain or develop the characters. And if that is all you're seeking, it delivers that....but I guess I like even my light reads with a bit of substance!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"It must say something about me that I sympathized much more with Becky's long lost frugal sister Jess, who at least has some sense. And I feel sorry for Luke--does anyone know *why* he was attracted to somebody who is so completely clueless about money and life in general?This book does redeem itself in the end, though, with Becky having the incredible revelation that she's been *gasp* spoiled all her life with people around her willing to forgive her faux pas and her goof ups, and parents who unconditionally accept her, and the great luck to get out of her scrapes. Heck, Luke pays off her huge credit card bills!Jess does exactly what i've been wanting to do to Becky for the past three books---tell her exactly how shallow and superficial her interests and concerns are."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is a cute book, but definitely not as great as the first three. This book seemed far-fetched and at times a little ridiculous. I love Sophie Kinsella and her writing style, but this one did seem a little inferior to the previous three. Maybe the Shopaholic series needs to end!! Don't get me wrong, I love, LOVE, LOVE, the Shopaholic series, but like all good things...they must end...gracefully and well-respected! Think of all the great TV shows that just went on too long!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I made it through books 1 and 2 without being sure if I was charmed or repulsed by the main character. Book 4 arrived before 3, so I started reading. How very dreadful! Becky's inability to focus on anything except shopping and her own personal needs, her constant lying about even trivial matters, and her fundamental stupidity got to be too much."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Seriously -- Becky Bloomwood is a pathological liar, incredibly irresponsible, and refuses to learn from her mistakes. On top of all that, she's a complete dimwit. I have to admit I keep reading this series because I always hope she'll learn her lesson (and because I shortsightedly purchased all five of the current books at once.) But it really is getting to be just too much. If you haven't started the Shopaholic series yet, save yourself and read \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" instead."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While Shopaholic & Sister is not the best of the series it is good enough. The book is another delightful escape into a fantasy life which, despite potential or temporary despair, always concludes with a sunny ending. The characters are well drawn. For serious readers like me, it is nice to take a break from depressing themes and insert a Shopaholic book once in awhile."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"These Sophie Kinsella books are the best. Honestly. Probably second only to Bridget Jones in my chick-lit ratings.Anyway, this story carries on the Shopaholic series with Becky finding out that she has a long-lost sister. Oh fun! A shopping buddy! BFF necklaces! HooRAY!Only thing is, the sister hates shopping. She's more of a nature girl. Likes getting her clothes at goodwill and such.Madness ensues, of course. What will Becky do to be close to her sister? Will her sister hate her for being materialistic? Oh the drama!Funny book, worth the quick read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I really liked this book it wasn't my favorite of Kinsellas book BUT it did make it unbearable to wait for the next book Shopaholic and baby. I have really enjoyed everything she has written"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The latest installment of the Shopaholic Series is just plain dumb. Becky after arriving back to England from her almost year long honeymoon discovers she has a long lost sister! In addition, she still only cares about shopping and lying to Luke about how much money she has been spending and the things she has been buying (did we not go over this in Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, and Shopaholic Ties the Knot?). Seriously I wished they had just skipped the long lost sister (which by the way makes no sense and is completely dumb) and focused on her trying to re-fit into all her friends' lives' and how hard marriage really is or something!This series has stopped being cute and funny it is not tedious and draining. I am sick of Becky getting herself into messes and everyone around her forgiving her for being such a brat and irresponsible.Also spoiler* at the end of the book we find out Becky is expecting, so I am sure there will be another book coming out fairly soon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I highly recommend this book as a fun, funny chick-lit treat. It's the kind of book that provides a light and relaxing retreat from both a busy day and during sudden flashes of girliness.\\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" is definitely light humor. Nothing 'deep' about it. But it accomplishes its aim--light-hearded humor, a young woman's intense love of shopping, exploring various parts of the world.Definitely a good way to live every young woman's fantasy of falling madly in love with a smart and rich and caring guy, traveling the world, and shopping until she drops.A must-read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I don't know what it is about this writer, but I bought AND read all of her books in a 4-5 month period. I NEVER do that, especially if I know that I have all of the books because I don't like to read a book over and over. I read these as slow as possible and used it as a luxurious escape. Great fun and highly recommended!! GET THEM ALL!!!!! Make sure you read the Shopaholic ones in order though... Have fun!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I think I enjoyed the first shopaholic book, then I took the second one, and I still liked it. Then the third, not bad. Then the fourth, then began to dislike Becky. I think I will stop read more story of hers. It seems her adventure falls into the same loop. Obsessed with shopping, then got fight with Luck and other people, then eventually and magically, what she has done ended up with victory. And Becky became a new Becky, Luck and other people started to love her again.Nothing new. Everything predictable. But it is a easy read. You can finish it in one day."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"What can we expect when Sophie Kinsella publishes yet another instalment in the Shopaholic series? A lot of shopping, of course, strains in her relationships, quirky parents, more shopping, increased debt, etc.In this book, intitled Shopaholic & Sister, the story opens with Becky and Luke ending their ten month honeymoon around the world and returning to London, where Becky finds that the people around her have gone on to find new friends and even a new family member! Since her faithful readership had never heard of a sister before, they will quickly have figured out that it can only mean that Becky's father learns of a child he never knew existed.Becky tries to cope with her return to the real world and to Luke going back to working long hours. So she keeps herself busy finding homes for the mountain of souvenirs she purchased on the honeymoon. And so she discovers eBay! As well, she is determined to get to know her new-found sister and that they should be soul mates, but they are complete opposites of each other.This story is filled with the usual antics that are to be expected by the warm character that is Rebecca Brandon (n&eacute;e Bloomwood). All the ingredients are there, as well as an opening at the end to lead the way for another novel in this series. In my opinion, this book proved to be more interesting than Shopaholic ties the knot. It is a quick paced, entertaining story about a woman you will not so soon forget... especially on your next shopping spree.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Sophie keeps writing the most delightful and entertaining books. Nothing earth shattering - just fun! Clever and witty. She should be required to write a book every month!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Sophie has a unique way of expresing the way we shopaholics around the world feel and act. This book has everything, from romance to friendship and from chaos to lots of fun, she did it again.I can't wait for the next shopaholic book."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have to admit that the novels in the Shopaholic series are some of my absolute favorite chick lit books around. So, be aware that this review is based on the UK version of this book, since I couldn't wait for it to be released in the USA and had bought it the moment it became available in the UK.So here we are at book four. Becky is now happily married to Luke, is traveling around the world with him on an extended honeymoon, and still has a desire for shopping. However, after about nine months of schlepping around the world, they decide to return to reality. Overnight Luke turns from the hippie-like nomad he'd been on the honeymoon into his old business-like self again. Becky meanwhile can't wait to get home and surprise everyone and share stories about their world travel.Upon Becky and Luke's return to London, however, she discovers things aren't quite the way she expected. Her good friend Suze has a new best friend named Lulu, who doesn't seem to enjoy Becky's company much. Luke has discovered the extent of Becky's shopping to such a degree that he's put her on a budget. Worst of all, Becky's parents drop a bomb - she has a long lost half sister! At first Becky is extremely excited, as she's always wanted a sister. However Jess is the exact opposite of Becky. She is frugal, cheap, and not very open. After a few disastrous meetings, it doesn't seem much will come out of their relationship. They just have nothing in common.Things take a turn for the worst when Becky's spending, as usual, gets completely out of control and threatens to destroy their marriage. On a whim she decides to go visit the small town her long-lost half sister lives in and make peace, no matter what it takes. Will she succeed, or will she make an even bigger disaster out of things? Or has Becky truly gone too far this time?\\"Shopaholic and Sister\\", I have to say, is now one of my official favorite book in the series. It had the truly insane adventures and hilarity that only Becky Bloomwood could get herself into. This time, they include: a horse-ride which Becky managed to turn into an impromptu shopping trip that had me rolling with laughter; an exciting shopping trip in Milan that resulted with Becky buying a purse for $2000 Euros; and the scenario between Luke and Becky when the two lorries full of junk Becky had purchased on their honeymoon arrived at their tiny new flat. And that's only the beginning. Sophie Kinsella outdid herself with Shopaholic and Sister in my opinion. I cracked up with laughter more than once, shook my head at Becky's antics, and even found myself touched with some of the issues Becky had with her sister and best friend Suze.As the other books in the series, \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" is well-written, engaging and full of colorful characters. There are a few over-the-top scenarios in Shopaholic and Sister that some may shake their head at, and some may get annoyed with Becky's obsessive-compulsive behavior, but I didn't. I absolutely loved the book and highly recommend it to everyone. People who have enjoyed the Shopaholic books until now won't be disappointed with this latest installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Somehow, Sophie Kinsella has managed to write the same book four times and keep it fresh. The story begins on the honeymoon of Luke and Becky Brandon. Becky is up to her old tricks, shopping everywhere she goes. After traveling on her honeymoon for 10 months, she misses home, so she and Luke decide to go home early to surprise everyone. Only nothing goes as Becky planned. Her best friend has found a new pal and her parents are acting strange. Plus, Luke has turned back into a workaholic. Becky's parents finally give her news-she has a long-lost sister. Becky quickly starts planning sleepovers and shopping sprees, but when she meets her sister, Jess, she turns out to be serious and frugal. Eventually, they clash and have a big fight, and then a bargain Becky struck over a handbag causes a rift with her and Luke. Left with nowhere else to turn, Becky hunts down her sister in the village where she lives and manages to wake up the town. Jess rebuffs all of Becky's attempts to reconcile, until Becky follows her up a mountain and sustains a fall. The women end up finding some common ground before being rescued. Becky also reconciles with her best friend and her husband, and everything turns up roses. The book is a lot of fun, just like the others, full of laugh-out-loud moments, and a hint of more to come. A very fun read for a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Finally, a chick-lit sequel that's almost as good as the original. I was disappointed in the 2nd and 3rd installments of this series, but this one I liked a lot.Kinsella was wise to entwine Becky's materialism with a sort of naive optimism. She really believes that if only she had the right outfit, or took her sister to the right store, everything would be fine. Although she's shallow, she's never mean, so she remains likable throughout.I also liked the fact that this book had a sympathetic science nerd-girl character. Jessica was a bit of a pill, but she was still a decent, moral human being. I hope to see both characters again in another sequel--maybe Shopaholic and Baby?"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"If you have read any of the other Shopaholic books, then this is a MUST READ!! I loved it! I cannot wait until the next book comes out.."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This was the most mature of the series, in my opinion. Becky finally wises up about her spending habits when she finds out she has a sister who is completely her opposite. There were several funny passages throughout and it was pure entertaining. However, that said, there were a few parts toward the end that lagged but overall a nice fluffy read."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I absolutely loved the first three Shopaholic books, so when I heard that a fourth had come out I bought it right away. Sadly, I was just disappointed. Shopaholic and Sister is definitely not as well written as the first three. This is also the first book where Becky really irritated me.However the story was cute and it would be a good quick read. I recommend it, just don't read it expecting a book quite up to par with the first three."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"There's no other character like Becky Bloomwood! This 4th installment to the Shopaholic series leaves readers happy and begging for more- at least I am!In this book we find Becky & Luke finishing up on their honeymoon- arriving home with much more than they took- thanks to Becky's shopping. Coming back home is a bit of a downer for Becky though as her best friend has a new friend, her parents are acting weird and Luke has thrown himself back into his work. And once Becky finds out why her parents are acting strange- that she has a long-lost half sister...things don't improve much for her. While she tries everything she can do to get close to the sister she never had, it's obvious that they have nothing in common & are complete oppisites. They don't even get along...I really loved this book. Kinsella always does a wonderful job of bringing new characters & situations into each book that keep the story interesting & enjoyable to the very last page. And the very last page has a great surprise that has me anxious to read the next installment. If you haven't read this series- you have to run out to the store & buy them all, this is an excellent series that's a lot of fun. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Rebecca Bloomwood has gotten considerably dumber, and it kind of made me want to just go over to her and knock some sense into her. The ending was very cute. Basically I wouldn't start reading the first 3 because of this one, but if you already read the other ones then you might as well."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have to say Sophie Kinsella, I am disappointed. So far, I have faithfully followed the Shopoholic books because they are funny, endearing, and always imaginative. This one? I thought that Becky Bloomwood was scary. Instead of being an overly creative, but always down to earth shopoholic, she was a crazed, 2000$ purse obsessive shopoholic. Truth was, I just didn't relate to Becky. At all. Usually, I laugh about her adventures, this time, I thought: What in the heck is wrong with you? I related more to her straight laced rock loving sister then to Becky. This book was kind of a surprise to me, as I expected the next Shopoholic book to be about a baby. Clearly, the one AFTER is. This book seemed like a cop-out \\"Make more money\\" effort. It still had its funny moments (The part where Becky walks across hot coals to get a necklace is Funny!) But for the most part, I just felt bad for Luke. He married a money-crazed compulsive liar. Don't expect to much from this one."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"If you have enjoyed the previous books about Becky, this one will definitely live up to your expectations. Becky is bright, funny and goes out of her way to bond with a sister she never knew she had. Let's just say she goes way out of her way to bond with her \\"non\\" shopaholic sister who she has absolutely nothing in common with. Through trials and tribulations with Jess and her husband of 1 year, Luke, Becky shows that even though she is a shopaholic, she has a heart of gold and that is why people love her!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"....and I really hope she doesn't! I love these books! If you got sick of Becky in the previous books, don't bother with this one. If you still love Becky despite her constant mistakes, you'll love it!I have to say in this book I even gave Becky credit for her cheery and optimistic attitude. She's almost TOO good to people even though she's got the shopping disease! I can relate so easily that it just makes me want to shop even more!If you love the series, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Although Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood)may not be the brightest, her trials and tribulations are a fun and light read. The time passes quickly and before you know it you have maxed out the book like Becky maxes out credit cards!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Sophie Kinsella had proven the lighten can stike 4 times. But the 4th time might not be as brillant. In this book Becky seems to have lost her sparkle a little. While in some ways she still the same whirlwind that we remember her as, but in other way she's a little to over the top. The book is still an enjoyable read, and the ending does brings the old Becky's spirit back."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"While I never did read \\"Confessions of....\\" I really enjoyed all the other books in this series, and this one is no exception. We are introduced to Becky's unknown sister in this story and she sure shakes Becky up. Can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"In all, Shopaholic & Sister was a great read. Like all her previous books, this one was full of humor and a meaning. Even though at times I found Becky to be very irritating because of her out-of-control behavior and narrow mindset, I really did enjoy this book. It was great fun to get to catch up with how Becky was doing after marriage and I just can't wait for another shopaholic book!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I really enjoyed the first three Shopaholic books. I've read and re-read them, laughing at becky's antics, admiring Kinsella's ability to put us in her heroine's shoes.But, about halfway through this book, I felt frustrated. Becky appears to have learnt nothing! She still shops too much and too expensively. She still keeps secrets from her husband (and herself, to a point). She still has wild expectations and comes crashing down when they don't go her way.While the writing is still fun, it was just too much to see a character go through the same destructive actions over and over again. If another Shopaholic book is written, I'd want to see if Becky has actually grown up before I'd buy it."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This fourth installment of Becky's trying tribulations is the worst. The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. I don't understand how Kinsella's editor didn't draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. And her endless, excrutitating 'inner' reflections. Becky's exploits aren't amusing anymore. Her purchases on her honeymoon aren't wacky. They're bewildering. For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste, Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. And oh yes, then she discovers a long lost sister. That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. I am not making this up. It's all there in the book. And none of it is even remotely entertaining. And now God help us, Becky is pregnant. AARRGGGH!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I really enjoy the whole series of these books. After devouring the Stephanie Plum series by another author I was looking for a series that made me laugh like that one did. I could so relate to the heroine in the Shopaholic books. I like her have learned how to justify buying anything on sale!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"easy to pick up and finish in a short time- lighthearted, great story line"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"SHOPAHOLIC & SISTER by Sophie KinsellaJanuary 3, 2006Amazon rating 4/5 starsHere's the 4th installment of the adventures of Becky Brandon (Nee Bloomwood), and she and her husband Luke (the multi-millionaire) are on their 10-month honeymoon around the world. As the novel opens, they are in the middle of a yoga session when she becomes distracted by a jewelry salesman... anyway, Becky is still the same fun-loving fashion obsessed money-spending gal that we've grown to love over the past few books.Becky and Luke are ready to return to London, and upon arrival there are a few surprises for Becky. She learns that she has a half sister, Jessica, and her best friend Suze has a new best friend, leaving Becky with no best friend. Becky's homecoming does not go as planned, to say the least, and Luke is very upset about all the souvenirs that Becky bought and had shipped to London over the past 10 months. Not a good thing! Becky's spending problems are out of control!Becky is excited about meeting this sister, thinking she has a new best friend. Unfortunately, this does not go as planned either. Jessica is nothing like Becky. In fact, she's the exact opposite of Becky in nearly every way. Jessica is as frugal as they come, and (heaven forbid!) she doesn't even wear makeup!As the novel continues on, Becky gets into more trouble with Luke by getting involved with a shady business associate, and soon she thinks their marriage is on the rocks. What is Becky going to do now to fix things?I loved this 4th book in the Shopaholic series, and I am hoping there will be another one. The book ends with a surprise note, paving the way for yet another book in the series, so I'm crossing my fingers..."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The honeymoon is over and Becky and Luke are thrust back into their lives in London. This time Becky is in between jobs and trying to help Luke with his new project. Only this time, there's a twist.What Becky was so excited to see at home, her family, Suze, the shops - weren't exactly prepared for her surprise arrival. It turns out Suze made a new friend and Becky's father has another daughter from a previous relationship. As ecstatic as Becky is to have a new sister, things don't go quite as planned.Everyone changes, her parents are suddenly in love again and into therapy and Suze is a mother of three with her new friend hanging around and it seems Luke has more in common with Becky's new, horrible cow of a sister. Everyone is turning against her! Find out what crazy things she does to try and fix the situation, she's hilarious!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Becky\`s back and this 4th book does not disappoint. Becky is no doubt still as naive, still with absolutely no control of her spending habits yet big-hearted as ever. I felt sorry for her that after a 10 month away from home, everybody that used to care about her doesn\`t seems the same anymore. However, at one point I thought she really was too naive to think that her sister Jess and her could click and have a nice sweet gals-night-in when Jess shows plainly no appreciation of her efforts. But her perserverance paid off in the end. The ending was really touching with the people at cumbria showing so much compassion for her. All in all, its a great come-back. I look forward to the 5th installment."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Another chapter in the shopaholic series & Becky is at it again. Not only is she now a happy newlywed, but finds out she has a sister!This latest addition to the series is simply delightful. Becky is hilarious amidst all her antics & drama. &lt;laughing to myself even now> I must say there are some seriously funny parts in this one. The horse she takes with her shopping is one of my favs.Can't say enough about this book or the series alone. If you haven't tried the series, this one is fine to start with, as each book gives background from the beginning. Eventually though, it would be ideal to read \\"Confessions Of A Shopaholic\\" & go down the series from there.I am so enamored with adorable Becky. Reading this series gives me a much needed break from reality!Grab this quickly- you will not be disappointed! Also excellent for a gals bookclub!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This was an amazing book!! I finished the book in 2 days and I feel like I'm exactly like the lead character Becky! Her thought flow process is exactly like mine!! I would highly recommend this book for anyone who likes Sex and the City or any other book by Sophie Kinsella. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I loved this book as much as the other ones. I am a die-hard fan of Sophie Kinsella and I think everything she writes is wonderful. Although it was good I still think that Becky shouldn't be quite as careless and stupid. I mean how many things can you do in just one book? A lot apparantely, according to Becky. I still love her though and hope Ms. Kinsella will continue with the series. Becky's pregnant!!!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This book just didn't feel nearly as fun and lively as the other books in the Shopaholic series. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good easy read but if you haven't read the others in the series you probably would be a bit bored."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This is another funny and exciting chapter to the series! Highly recommended reading!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I have not read the first two of the series but I have read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and this one. Shopaholic Ties the Knot is superior to this one, I found, but this is still incredibly fun, an extremely easy read, totally escapist. It is true, Becky is floating in the clouds, absolutely optimistic and ridiculously out of reality and to tell the truth it never irritated me in Shopaholic Ties the Knot but in this book I found it to the extreme and I commend Luke, her husband, for putting up with her.All in all the story line wasn't as interesting as Shopaholic Ties the Knot, which I absolutely loooved, but Shopaholic and Sister was still cute and fun. Definitely worth the read, can't wait to read the first two and Shopaholic and Baby, I love this series!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"Having read all of the books in Kinsella's Shopaholic series, I couldn't wait to read about what embarrassing situations that the ever-lovable Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) would get herself into this time.I just love escaping into the light-hearted world of these incredibly likable characters. My only complaint with this book is that I was left wanting more!Kinsella certainly delivers in Shopaholic & Sister, which is an immensely entertaining afternoon read full of the familiar antics of the good-hearted (albeit hopelessly ditzy) Becky. Fans of the Shopaholic series will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love Sophie Kinsella. She is a great writer that can make you laugh. I like all the wit and humor that she puts in her books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"It is a light and funny book, something we need to read so that we forget our problems and stressful lives. I would like to say: \\"Thank you, Sophie Kinsella for making me laugh!\\" It was a real pleasure to read all of her books. I wish there were more of them."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"i thought that this book was so good. it was funny and lighthearted and even though it is obviouse that becky has always been spoiled and is very materialitic, we love her anyway.she is so honest and messes up all the time that it makes us all feel better.i couldn't put this book down from start to finish and can't wait to read shopoholic in manhatten. just reading the title, i know i'm going to love it. overall a great read as always with the shopoholic books."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"The \\"Shopaholic\\" series takes a wide turn in this book. Becky has a long lost sister! Becky is excited...a new shopping buddy! Especially since her best friend Suze is all tied up with 3 babies and a new dry friend, Lulu. However, Becky's sister turns out to be the complete opposite of her, but when Becky's marriage takes a bad turn, she turns to her sister to \\"learn her frugal ways.\\" This book will have you gripped from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"I love all of the books in the Shopaholic series, have read them all, and have also listened to them in audiobook format. The other 3 books in the series were read by Emily Gray, a wonderful, straightforward actress. This book however, the 4th in the series, is read by Kathryn Kellgren, and it's a labor to listen to her. She uses the most perposterous accents, and it sounds like she is reading a fairy tale to a bunch of children. I will NOT buy any more audiobooks if she is reading them. Sophie, please! Use Emily Gray for all of your audiobooks!"},{"Title":"Shopaholic & Sister","review":"This fourth installment in the 'SHOPAHOLIC' series was, as usual, laugh out loud funny and will keep you wanting more of that ever lovable Becky Bloomwood Brandon! All of the characters you have grown to love are back in this one with a couple of new equally off the wall characters sprinkled in.When Becky and Luke return home from their ten-month long honeymoon around the world Becky expects nothing to have changed. However, quite to her surprise her parents seem to be a bit distracted, her best friend Suze has found a new best friend and Luke has gone right back to his old work obsessed self. So saying that Becky's homecoming was not exactly what she expected would be an understatement. But when Becky's parents inform her that she has a long-lost sister by the name of Jess, Becky is through the roof! This is the answer to all of her problems she now has a soul mate who will never let her down. Someone who will be there for her through thick and thin, someone to eat peppermint creams, watch chick flicks and, of course, shop with. But when she meets her sister Jess she turns out to be the exact opposite of Becky, she hates shopping, has no overdraft and knows how to stretch a dollar until it can be stretched no more. Needles to say that Becky and Jess have a hard time connecting. And after a big blow up she and Jess decide that they are just too different and to go their separate ways. However when Becky feels her marriage is in trouble she knows that Jess is the only one who can help her.When Becky goes to Jess' hometown of Scully the real fun begins. We are introduced to a host of new characters. And Becky manages to get herself into more trouble than ever and finds her true passion...frugality?!I am such a huge fan of this series! And I love it that Kinsella left us die hard fans with an opening for a fifth \`SHOPAHOLIC' book...I will be pre-ordering that one!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],z={key:0},q={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=f("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",j,[(t(!0),a(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(t(),p(m,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",z,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const W=u(x,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-0cafa2f2"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/38.md","filePath":"drive/38.md"}'),N={name:"drive/38.md"},O=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{D as __pageData,O as default};
