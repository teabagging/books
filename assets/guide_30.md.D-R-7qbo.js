A slew of business books have published since the original release of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon,\\" but few can match the simple and effective words of advice the reader receives; only a handful exceed it. The fundamental premise of Babylon is living below one's means (by saving at least a minimum of 10% of earnings) and having money work for you (passive income.) Clason solidifies these concepts by an engaging narrative readers can quickly identify with even today. I thought the emphasis placed on asset protection first, and selection of knowledgeable advisors to invest saved money with as particularly valuable. All too often the focus is on rapid returns without adequate investment of time with the potential pitfalls of an investment.

George S. Clason's \\"The Richest Man In Babylon\\" is one of the best books I have ever read.I read this book just over a year and-a-half ago when I first became interested in entrepreneurism. Though the book doesn't directly focus on entrepreneurism and business, but the lessons learned can definitely be applied in so many different ways.The book explores parables from the ancient city of Babylon, one of the richest cities known to man. Throughout the book you follow the lives of various businessmen who go off into the world to make something for themselves. It shows the struggles they encounter and the riches that come about from their hard work and determination.Each chapter is treated as a different lesson and goes into depth of how each lesson can be applied to your life by using the characters from each chapter to teach you numerous lessons.

Sometimes I read book with that claim and there ponder, 'Did XXmillion people REALLY read this literary effort?' I guess there must be a lot of bored people at airports with a poor judgement of cover-copy as I!So, what of TRMIB, is that worthy of the 'more than two million sold' stuck on the front of my book? the answer is YES! Yes indeed it is! I discovered TRMIB by accident and decided to give it a look over, neither in debt having any problems in the financial department per se. I was still spurred on by the other Amazon reviews into giving it a glance over; and how glad I am. Though I say \\"having no financial problems per se.\\" if the truth be told, I guess we could use a kick in the wallet and a 6 A.M. roll-call in that department. If you are in need of that then look no further. What this book offers you is a fool-proof formula to financial success, based not upon get-rich-quick-pull-rabbit-from-hat school of economics and good housekeeping. No, what Clanson has done is to develop pre-war spendthriftness into a simple yet effective Art. he has taken the basic principles of financial success and laid out clear rules towards that goal. What he has NOT done it to kid you that if you read this book you'll be an instant millionaire, or any such fictitious claims. Presented in the format of a series of fictitious conversations and tales Clanson time and time again relays the basic truths to financial security and financial success, based not upon external forces; rather based upon your own abilities to keep what you EARN (you have to work for your success) in your wallet, and not in someone else's. In the case you do find yourself in financial jam and have the desire to get yourself out Clanson offers a formula for that too.What I thought was impressive about this text was the simplicity of the ideas, the logical and rational way they were laid out and presented and the sheer accuracy of his approach. Maybe in this age Clanson's views will find less receptive ears, but anyone who can walk the path he guides us too can shortly achieve financial independence and attain victory over their leaky wallet.

As an adult living in the U.S., I am reading them again to my children, but this time in English. This is an old classic, and it is very entertaining.Asterix and Obelix live in small village in Gaul that Julius Caesar never succeeded to subdue. In this story, the village bard (whose musical talents are beyond frightening), is kidnapped, and sent to Rome as a gift to Julius Caesar. Even though the villagers rather not hear his voice again, they set out to rescue him. However, before he is home safe and sound, he will have his chance to perform (torture more accurately) for Julius Caesar and the citizens of Rome.I find that children the age 5-13 usually really enjoy these books, not just mine. These comic books are a great way to teach children ancient history. Naturally, the adult needs to help with the differentiation between fiction and history.

It has a simple but engaging story, the excellent tongue in cheek humour, the delightful animation and plenty of play on words that always raise a smile. This has so many aspects that make this particular book enjoyable, be it the various funny names (Odius asparagus for example) or nice touches like Obelix collecting Roman helmets as a tally of the soldiers he has beaten up, this book is charming throughout. This follows Asterix and Obelix as they go to rescue their bard Cacofonix who is captured by the Romans and is condemned to being thrown to the lions. The only way they can get to him is by becoming Gladiators and it is here that the real fun begins. Of course there is much Roman bashing, the inevitable pirates will get sunk and I'm sure there is a roast boar or two in there and it is these common themes to each book that delight fans, whilst the individual stories keep you from getting bored with the format. If you haven't tried any Asterix books yet then this is a pretty good place to start, it has all the aspects that have made the series so beloved and it is a great story to boot. I have read this many times and still enjoy it and I'd say it is a pretty safe bet most other readers will as well.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Asterix the Gladiator","review":"I have been a fan of comics for more than 40 years now and the Asterix books have been among my favorites for about 35. In general they embody a combination of winning characters, intelligence, fun, and virtuosic artwork that is almost unique in the power of its totality.This is one of the earlier stories, maybe the second one written, but already we can see not just the seeds but the vigorous young shoots of genius that will soon burst into full bloom: the fully-developed historical setting, the trademark joke names of all the characters, the surprising juxtaposition of ancient and modern, the incisive social commentary, and above all the humor. The artwork is a bit more polished than the initial episode too; the growing confidence of the two creators is almost palpable.This tale features Cacophonix the bard, though he remains \\"off screen\\" for much of the book. The treatment of the historical phenomenon of the gladiators make this an enduring classic of the series."},{"Title":"Asterix the Gladiator","review":"Asterix and Obelix go to Rome and give us an opportunity to have a look at how some of the common Roman place must have been like.

It's a fairly enjoyable story, and worth a read for Asterix fans.The Prefect of Gaul is heading back to Rome for some leave, and tradition says that he must bring back something for Caesar. He decides to bring a Gaul from Asterix's village, as their reputation suggests they might play well as gladiators at Circus Maximus. Cacofonix the bard is captured and taken away, and Asterix and Obelix head into Rome to get him back, sailing with Phoenicians, taking a Roman bath, and trying their own luck as gladiators.It's a bit subdued, the story, but it's still pretty interesting."},{"Title":"Asterix the Gladiator","review":"more humor from asterix and obelix... in this episode the duo try their hand at becoming gladiators...."},{"Title":"Asterix the Gladiator","review":"The nasty yet clumsy Romans capture the village bard, Cacofonix, as a gift for Caesar from the Prefect of Gaul. However, due to their ever-so-common feat of destroying Roman encampments, Asterix and Obelix are informed about the bard's kidnapping and they immediately set off for Rome to rescue him. The story runs along very well, placing the two fiesty Gauls in a couple of hilarious Gladiator bouts at the &quot;Circus Maximus.&quot; Even the Roman Emperor Caesar is on hand to make things a little bit difficult for the Gaulish duo.This book is a fun, exciting adventure and it captures the heart of the reader with its beautiful art and creative story telling. Most Asterix titles are aimed at a teen/adult audience and they cleverly integrate many historical events in to their plots. There is also a deeper satirical presence throughout these books, and for that reason I feel that children under the age of 12 or so would not quite appreciate the humor. The violence is more along the lines of black eyes, dented armor and missing teeth, and hence should not worry a parent too much.

This leads to forty-eight pages of relatively constant conflict, along with a slew of jokes about awful voices and parsley.Goscinny and Uderzo are not subtle. (I remember thinking this even back in the Tintin-collecting days, when I was seeing a panel or two at a time, as opposed to a whole book.) Those picking up Asterix for the first time are going to be quite disappointed if they're expecting all the nuance and subtlety of today's better graphic-novel efforts. But for those who are just looking for a good time, Asterix and Obelix are rather like the comic-book version of a Schwarzenegger flick; turn your brain off and have a good time. ***"},{"Title":"Experiences in science: A workbook to accompany Science for better living : complete course","review":"I wish that I could give this book a higher rating than I have, for the subject matter is one that I find of enormous intrinsic interest. Moreover, Dr. Chaitin is one of the most important contributors to this field of the last 30+ years.My reasons for being disappointed in this book may well be the reasons others enthusiastically endorse it. Dr. Chaitin himself, in his preface, places this volume as the one thing he would most wish to save were a disaster to wipe out the rest of his oeuvre.The sub-title of the book is \\"A Course on Information Theory and the Limits of Formal Reasoning.\\" This sub-heading I find to be quite misleading. The book is not a \\"course\\" on any thing -- rather, it is a collection of a very small number of informal papers that Dr. Chaitin has given in recent years, and a very large number of pages devoted to LISP programs that can be used to demonstrate aspects of his extensions to the results of Turing and Goedel. The collection of articles seem largely redundant to me; any one of the articles by itself would be sufficient to summarize the rest of the book's contents. As for the programming, that should either have been provided in the form of a CD-ROM (as only someone of a genuinely \\"special\\" nature would actually sit down and manually type in all those instructions) or a functioning URL (such URL's as do appear in the book do not seem to be working as of this writing, Mar. 2007).I was hoping to get something more comprehenive, and that could function as a stand-alone text. This book seems to be neither. The technical details are all to be found elsewhere, and the functional aspects that might translate into an actual course of study are simply not to be found at all. Dr. Chaitin notes that the original technical work of his, published in the 60's, had a formal error that has since been corrected. Quite frankly, I would rather have that work plus a footnote regarding the later developments, than this volume which (sadly) I find of no real help. (I have since ordered and received a used, 1987 imprint of his \\"Algorithmic Information Theory\\" as printed by Cambridge.)Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, I would very much liked to have seen this \\"course\\" developed as a *COURSE*, rather than as three more or less popular, and largely independent, lectures. These lectures seem, at best, only to minimally build upon one another. A more integrated and coherent work that developed its subject in a step-wise manner, rather than repeating itself with only slightly different glosses, is something that I would have liked much more.My background in logic and computer science, while not trivial, remains that of a studious and committed autodidact. It is possible that someone with less of a background in topics of formal reasoning than myself would find this book of enormous value. For me, however, it lacked both the technical details to make it a worthy struggle, and the pedagogical depth to make it of significant value."},{"Title":"Experiences in science: A workbook to accompany Science for better living : complete course","review":"The book is composed of a small set of speeches given at various occasions to maths students.Each speech share the same topic and is build almost according to the same plan, and merelyintroduces the research area of G. Chaitin from a very high standpoint, without giving any details.So this can hardly be considered as a course.The book is very frustrating because at several places the author jump over many expected details because he says he lacks time, yet in the following speech he again skip over details because he still lacks time. One would rather have an actual course that's diging from chapter to chapter into the core of the matter, instead of having to repeatedly read an introduction."},{"Title":"Progressive relaxation;: A physiological and clinical investigation of muscular states and their significance in psychology and medical practice (The University of Chicago monographs in medicine)","review":"Very technical book about the art of physical relaxation, the release of residual tensions from the neuromuscular system of the body, including the mind. The author believed that the way to relax the mind was to relax the body. \\"If the patient is shown how to relax the voluntary system, there later tends to follow a similar quiescence of the vegetative apparatus. Emotions tend to subside as he relaxes.\\" Relaxation must be cultivated until it becomes a habit, until it proceeds \\"automatically with little or no clearly conscious direction.\\" Relaxation is \\"the negative of doing.\\"This book has important insights to offer, but non-professionals will likely find it too technical, even unreadable at times.

I shouldn't say that because even though I was 'forced' to read it for an English class, I never made it through. I think I got about 30 pages into it after maybe a week or two of trying to get involved with it. All to no avail.

One must place themselve in the time. You will end up asking What, Why, and Who! Take your time and finish it..."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"I was required to read this novel for an American Ficiton class in college. Most students would rate required reading very low just because it is required reading. Wieland has a low rating because it deserves it, not only because it was required. As an English major I love to read but Wieland tests any readers ability and patience. Brown's writing style is comparable to James Fenimore Cooper's Deerslayer - extremely descriptive and at times, without a difinitive end. The many themes that are found in the novel are outdated to today's readers and will have little if any effect on the interest of the novel. The grotesque theme of familial murder mimicks the writing of Edgar Allan Poe. If you are a Poe fan, Wieland may interest you. For those that are not Poe or Cooper fans, I would suggest looking for reading elsewhere. Wieland is time consuming and not worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"Charles Brockden Brown's importance in the field of American literature is indisputably very high; thus, how unfortunate it is that his works are so unknown to us today. Were it not for H.P. Lovecraft's mention of him in his essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature,&quot; I myself would remain ignorant of his very existence. Brown is arguably the father of the American novel, a brave pioneer in the era of the early Republic. This man set upon himself the noble purpose of writing fiction for a living, going against the wishes of his family and the dictates of contemporary society. Had there been no Charles Brockden Brown, there may never have been a Poe--at least, not Poe as we know him today.The story is an Americanized Gothic romance. The spirit of Gothic literature pervades the tale, but the setting has been transferred from old castles and courtly settings to a recognizably American rural landscape which is preeminently beautiful rather than spooky. The horrors described so effectively by Brown are borne in the minds of the characters. The female protagonist Clara narrates the tortured history of her family. Her father dies mysteriously, perhaps by spontaneous combustion, ostensibly due to his failure to follow God's will in his life. She enjoys a happy adult life with her brother and his wife until a stranger named Carwin appears and quickly becomes a part of their inner circle. Carwin eventually becomes Clara's tormentor. She, her brother, and their mutual friend Pleyel all hear mysterious, unexplained voices warning them of danger and imparting fateful news on several occasions. Her brother, deeply religious like his father, is greatly affected by these phenomena--how much so we learn later in the novel. Carwin fatefully destroys Clara's life when his evil designs paint her as a harlot in Pleyel's eye. Her unrequited love for Pleyel is now met with his condemnation of her--the agony of the charges against her is particularly poignant in the early American era in which the story takes place. On the fateful night, she discovers Carwin hiding in her home, and he admits to having had murderous designs on her. Her sorrows are greatly magnified the following day by the murder of her brother's wife and five children by none other than her own beloved brother. She blames Carwin for having influenced her brother to commit murder, but we later learn that dementia itself is almost surely to blame for her brother's wrongs. Before the tale ends, she faces a confrontation with both Carwin and her murderous brother, an experience which she is fortunate to survive.The tale itself is wonderful. The suspense Brown draws out and continually heightens is first-rate. Clara's encounters with voices and human spirits hidden in the darkness of her bedroom are spine-tingling. The language of the novel does make it a work that requires some concentration on the part of the reader and may serve to frustrate some, but I think it greatly magnifies the horrific aspects of the tale. The dialogues of the actors are admittedly overdramatic and drawn out. No one speaks in this book; rather, everyone makes speeches. The protagonist often resorts to long laments of her great woe and asks how she can possibly go on with the story. Despite such dramatics on her part, though, Clara is clearly a brave, independent woman (reflecting Brown's strong and admirable commitment to the rights of women). Overall, the tale delivers a buffet of the passive voice style of writing, which I for one refuse not to love; even the most unimportant sentences are graced with a flowery, beautiful aspect.In terms of the Gothic element to the story, one cannot say that the supernatural aspects are wholly disproved in the end--to some extent they are, but not to such an extent that Wieland's murderous actions can be explained by them. Clearly, Wieland did hear voices other than those made by Carwin the biloquist. The air of mystery that remains about Wieland's dementia and the causes of it makes the ending more successful than I feared it would be once I learned of the power of ventriloquism exercised by Carwin to dictate many of the related events. My only complaint is with the final chapter, which is basically an epilogue in the protagonist's journal. Inexplicably, it introduces a new character to explain something about a minor character whom I frankly could not even remember."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"Charles Brockden Brown has been almost completely forgotten today. Unlike the more famous James Fenimore Cooper, who is often accorded the title of the first American novelist that Brown should bear, Brown's reputation is largely borne up by those few literary critics who love the earliest roots of American fiction. &quot;Wieland&quot; is Brown's best novel, and still quite readable today as a Gothic novel (although the secret of the villain seems rather mundane today, as the 'power' he exhibits has been played largely for laughs since the days of vaudeville and radio). Brown was born in Philadelphia in 1771, trained in the law, was one of the first to try and make a living as a writer in the early years of the American republic, and died young in 1810. If you like Gothic novels, or you have a passion for early American literature, you will enjoy &quot;Wieland.&quot; Myself, I prefer him to Cooper, who has been forever rendered laughable in my mind by Mark Twain's hilarious essays on Cooper's literary sins."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"This Modern Library edition is the finest available paperback edition of Wieland. The cover art is compelling, the margins are wide enough to notate, the paper is of decent quality, the text is authoritative, Caleb Crain's introduction is even better than Norman Grabo's introduction for Penguin, and, as if that were not enough, we finally get a couple of Brown's oustanding short stories--not the lame, too-often anthologized Somnambulism, but Thessalonica, an astonishing, apocalyptic tale of civil strife, together with several other pieces worthy of note. As an appendix, we get the viscerally appalling, absolutely hair-raising, newspaper story which Brown fictionalized as Wieland (one wonders whether King and Kubrick read it too for snowy axe chase in the Shining)."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"These days, one rarely hears of Charles Brockden Brown unless one happens to be a literature professor/student. Brown has somehow managed to disappear from the radar, but I smell a revival in the future.I absolutely loved this book. Not only is Wieland the first American gothic novel (1798), but it combines elements from the seduction novels that were also popular at that time. And more importantly, this work speaks to the precariousness of America as a nation at the time of writing. The book is loaded with metaphors, right down to the names of the characters.Throughout the novel, battle lines are being drawn between religious belief and the hard science of the Enlightenment. The author, in many ways, shows us the many gradations between light and dark--but most of all--draws a very interesting parallel between Clara and Carwin, the only two narrators. \\"Wieland\\" proper is directly followed by another piece called \\"Memoirs of Carwin the Biloquist\\"...you must read these two pieces in conjunction in order to realize the full gravity of Brown's genius. If you are willing to commit to a close reading, you will quickly find that things are not always what they seem. You will also likely begin to realize a bizarre parallel between the two narrators, which you may find deliciously surprising if you are anything like me.The book was actually fashioned after a true story about a man who killed his wife and children in \\"the name of God.\\" If that doesn't interest you, I don't know what does! If this book tells us anything, it is that we must rely on all of our senses, not just one, if we want to survive. In this work, characters rely heavily on hearing alone...and many pay severely for it.The Modern Library edition is a bit expensive but it is a terrific copy and includes the actual newspaper article describing the crime---not all of the publications of Wieland do this.The only other thing I want to mention is that there are some genuinely creepy things going on in this book, and the beauty of it is, none of it is supernatural. The psychology of man is a very complex thing, indeed, and this novel proves it.Very satisfying and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"The Modern Library has done a wonderful job with this package of Charles Brockden Brown, featuring Wieland and Carwin the Biloquist. The stories themselves have been covered adequately in other reviews, so I won't spend time discussing the importance of the first American novel, or Brown's ingenuity. One thing that's not discussed much in reviews is the fact that this 1798 novel is told by a female narrator imbued by Brown with a character that would do any modern woman proud. But the power of the novel lies in Brown's exploration of complex psychology. I've never studied the connection, but my bet is that Henry James owed a lot to this novel.If you're going to read Wieland, and if the quality of a physical book matters to you, this is the edition to buy. The quality of the book is the highest you'll find in a softcover. Even the cover is stunning. The production quality is better than any competing edition. Many other editions use old printing plates. The print in this edition is new, crisp and clear and the paper is worthy of a hardcover book. (If you don't care about production quality, you can spend less for the same words in another edition.)But there's another consideration if you take literature seriously. Not having seen the book itself, I made my purchase decision almost solely on the fact that Modern Library includes the newspaper article which inspired Brown to write the story. There is no modern book or movie that beats the gut-wrenching violence of that article. It's a sad reminder that our culture and society have invented nothing new in gruesomeness and insanity since 1796. I suggest reading the article before you read the story itself - it will disabuse you of any notion that Brown manufactured a plot beyond the pale. Even if you don't care about the quality of paper or print, that news article may be worth the extra dough you spend on this edition.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It's worth the $23 I paid for a softcover book. This one will stay in my library."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"This is very firmly a late-18th/early-19th century novel, but shouldn't be shied away from as boring or staid. Yes, there is a perfect and pure heroine who faints away from time to time, but really the narrative is almost entirely plot-driven and a real page-turner. Setting a gothic romance among American Quakers proves to be an interesting conceit, as is allowing the swooning heroine to narrate the whole thing herself. The tale also has many elements of the mystery, and Carwin's long soliloquy presages in many ways the final scene of a detective novel, where the investigator reveals everything and all becomes so suddenly obvious. (That explanation, in this case, may seem to us a bit silly but I understand it was much more exciting in 1798.) Those who follow the 50-page rule (of which I seriously disapprove) may not make it out of the initial exposition and into the real story, which would be a shame, because soon enough the plot takes a much more exciting and breathless turn.This was not just an enjoyable and unusual execution of the gothic novel, but simply a good read, and a fascinating precursor to other American writers like Edgar Allen Poe."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"This book has a very original plot line. The influence of the bazzar, mystical death of the father of this family set off much questioning and fear when similar occurances happen decades later.

A woman hears voices whispering in her closet, but when she opens the door, she finds nothing there. Her brother experiences what he thinks is the voice of God, ordering him to commit horrible crimes to prove his devotion.Sounds like elements from a Hollywood horror movie? They're actually some of the mysterious and frightening things that happen in this early American horror novel, written by a man who was also a religious scholar and one of America's earliest feminists. Like a lot of early American novels, the style is somewhat effusive, veering between staid rationality and near-hysteria, and it's somewhat intricate sentences may be a bit long-winded to some modern readers. I've seen it compared to Edgar Allen Poe and Stephen King, but I think it's more fair to compare it to Henry James or Nathanial Hawthorne, since the horror is generally more psychological and a bit understated. But it's that understatement which makes it all the more chilling..."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"I had never heard of Charles Brockden Brown before, until I picked up an anthology entitled _American Gothic Tales_. The excerpt from this novel intrigued and horrified me enough that I had to read the entire story. I wasn't disappointed. Ghosts, mysterious voices that drive completely pleasant, complacent people to do mad things - I read the whole thing in a few hours. His storytelling is reminescent of Poe, although that is incorrect to say, as Brown came first. A shame that no one hears about Brown, as he is definitely a classic.Four stars out of five, because I did not care for the epilogue; it feels a little tacked on."},{"Title":"Wieland : Or, the Transformation","review":"I'm a collector of early American religious fiction, (my oldest book is from 1826) and a friend recommended \\"Wieland\\" to me as one of the earliest American novels. I found it interesting, both as an example of the early Gothic genre and as a sort of Americana.The phrase \\"sort of Americana\\" indicates one of my issues with the book. While the protagonists are American in the sense that they are born here and the action mostly takes place here, their outlook is essentially European. None of them need to work for a living, and their life of leisure is that of European aristocrats, beautifying their estates with mock-Greek temples and pursuing European patents of nobility when older family lines are reputed to fail. Some people are merchants and others are landowners, but no one is a mere farmer or a laborer or even a doctor or lawyer.In addition, the writing style is labored, copying the European style of works such as \\"The Castle of Udolfo\\". No word of one syllable is used when a synonym with two is available, and the more elaborate the language, the more emotional the scene. Even a reader such as myself, who enjoys orotund phraseology, finds it very heavy going.What makes the book worth reading is the story. Based on a true incident, \\"Wieland\\" tries to understand both the external circumstances and the interior mental state of a man who commits terrible crimes for reasons of religious conviction. To accomplish this, Brown posits both an external trigger (a ventriloquist who convinces the main character that he's hearing a divine being) and a hereditary tendency, but still, the crimes and their basis seem to be, sadly, peculiarly American--based on the idea that an individual's impression of God's Will has to be more correct than law, tradition, or even the express words of the Bible. We're still getting in trouble in the same way--and sometimes to the same terrible effect."},{"Title":"Taking Cover (Wingmen Warriors) (Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 1187)","review":"Kathleen O'Connell is a by-the-book Air Force doctor who has learned how to deal with top-gun pilots.

On that ill-fated night, Tanner learned of the carjacking, rape and murder of his beloved twin sister. In his darkest hours, Kathleen's kiss was a lifeline. These days Tanner lives by the squadron motto, \\"Anything. Anywhere. Anytime.\\" He knows that nothing he does will bring his sister back, but good deed is like a smoothing balm over a raw wound. So being grounded by now Captain Kathleen O'Connell for pinched nerve frustrates him to no end. Especially when he is only six weeks from his rescheduled upgrade from copilot to aircraft commander.Kathleen believes that Tanner is as stubborn as he'd been at the Academy his freshman year. She had been in junior year, and their forbidden kiss could have had them both booted out of Academy. Their current clashes are legendary, and this latest grounding simply underscores their irritability toward one another. Unfortunately, their Squadron Commander overhears their arguing and gives them a new assignment. For the next month they will work together to investigate a C-17 accident. By getting away from the rest of the squadron, eating together, riding together, playing together, and spending every waking hour with each other things should settle out. Or not.Author Catherine Mann provides another powerful look at the people behind the uniform in TAKING COVER, the second novel of the \\"Wingmen Warriors\\" series. Kathleen is like a warrior goddess, independent and fierce. Tanner has fierce need to serve and protect, driven by the death of his sister. Their clashes spark strong chemistry, and their time together exacerbates the situation. Indeed, close proximity brings about strong emotion and intense motivation that results in violent clashes and wild need.

Today, twelve years later, Kathleen is a successful flight surgeon and Tanner a successful fighter pilot who are however trying very hard to avoid each other. Until Tanner needs medical assistance and Kathleen is on duty. And the sparks fly! However, their commanding officer overhears their fight and decides to send them on a common mission so that they spend some time together and start appreciating each other.Kathleen is a successful professional who hides behind her science because past experience has shown her that emotions are unpredictable and lead only to pain. Of course the accusations of her ex-husband didn't help her to build up her self-esteem.Tanner has his own ghosts to struggle with. His parents' difficult relationship and his sister's fate have coined his character deeply. Contrary to Kathleen he's much more extroverted and although one could expect a man like Tanner to be a brain dead alpha male he's anything but.The story line isn't anything special but what is absolutely worthwhile is the relationship and its slow development between Kathleen and Tanner. I very much liked how Tanner slowly slowly unraveled Kathleen's character. The more he did the more he fell in love with her. The author captured these moments perfectly and entertained me to the utmost.

What I like about the Milner's is that they don't hesitate to give their textbook a personal slant: they provide their own perspective on theories and research as it relates to English instruction, and their classroom ideas are essentially their own preferences, based on reviewing lots of different sources. I personally can't stand it when a book comes out with the same old KWL charts and whatnot, so I love that many of the ideas in this book are novel and not familiar to most English teacers; it definitely stands out from similar texts."},{"Title":"Bridging English","review":"This is a very helpful and well written text on teaching.

While this is common within my non-textbook ebooks, it's unusual for my electronic textbooks. It makes it nearly impossible to use in class, especially if the teacher bases assignments off certain pages. I actually had to rent a paper copy of the text so that I could complete my coursework and follow along in class. It's a good book, but if you are purchasing it to use for class, I'd stay away from the electronic version and go with the old-school, paper copy."},{"Title":"Bridging English","review":"This textbook is packed full of great information for current and future teachers of English.

As the pages unfold and the years pass by, many wonderful and graceful gifts emerge that are often taken for granted. But which is the greatest gift? That will be left for you to decide and add to the book in the final pages...This hardcover book, with its insightfully simple message and vibrant images (by illustrator Amy Gohman), will make an ideal gift for any expectant parent or guardian or their child at any milestone in their life.

There are few who can do this with class as this writer has done. I never rave about a poem unless it's touched me deeply. The work inside this paperback is priceless.

This makes fun reading even if you're not into wishing - though the author makes a point of taking wishing out of the superstition category and placing it in the human realm of stating goals, relating it to current practices of affirmations, and suggests that wishing works best when rooted in reality. This book lifts itself well out of the fantasy area by quoting poets and sages - many well-known names. I can see this as a general book to fill many gifting needs, from graduations, new jobs, get-well wishes, and the wishingest time of all - birthdays."},{"Title":"Entre padres e hijos: Un clsico que revoluciono la comunicacion con nuestros hijos","review":"Conoc&iacute;a el libro por referencias.

If you are familiar with books from this era, they are usually published in segments and later put into one full book, (such is this case). Details on the four sections of this book are as follows:Book 1 & 2: Story of a man named Paul Flemming, who lost a loved one and is on a journey through Germany. This is almost entirely thoughts on philosophy discussed between himself, his good friend Baron (who departs at the end of the second book), people he meets, people telling stories and sharing opinions, most of which is naming and contemplating the works of other famous writers, poets, artists, musicians, songs and so on, and reflecting their own sentiments of the works.Book 3: Much of the previous, now in Switzerland, but with an introduction to a good friend Mr Berkley and Mary, who shares similar interests and he quickly comes to love. But in telling a story, he embarrasses himself and decides to leave with his friend, Berkley, to continue his travels.Book 4: Now with a more negative outlook, Flemming travels with his friend when a storm follows and Paul falls ill. After a few weeks, he begins to feel better, and Mr Berkley reads to him. Soon fit to move on, the story continues. Paul is more on the subject of life and death, and with, (at least to me,) an unhealthy interest in graveyards. I guess he's in a transitional period. He meets more people and is inspired by their stories. At the end, he hears the voice of his Mary in the next room and dreams of her. But instead of seeing her, he leaves to continue his travels.Mostly theory and observation, but not enough practice. Given his circumstances, I'd imagine he'd be going through changes. Some interesting introspection and thoughts on life; though, if you're looking for a story with a definite feeling of beginning, middle and end, this is more of a philosopher's book told through the heart of a young man in the midst of a deep existential crisis.PS. I'm under the assumption, also, that Longfellow chose the name Hyperion from the uncompleted epic poem of John Keats (as Longfellow seems to be a fan), since the poem talks about despair of the Titans and their fall to the Olympions. Keats temporarily gave up because it felt too Milton-esk (which Longfellow seems to also be a fan) and from tending to his brother who succumbed to death from TB in 1819. Later Keats attempted continuing the poem (The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream): \\"framing it with a personal quest to find truth and understanding\\"..... Of course, for all I know, Longfellow mentioned this in the Introduction, which I did not read...Ah, as for aesthetics, this is a lovely little edition."},{"Title":"Trust Fund Babies","review":"This book reminds me of old times!

The writer gives the reader an insider look at Palm Beach Society in the same style Sanders did.The plot is decent for a first timer and the dialouge is fun and fast moving.This is a great book for anyone who felt disappointed by the new, post-Sanders McNally books. The book isn't a true replacement for the old Archy books, but it is a fun read."},{"Title":"Trust Fund Babies","review":"Great mystery! Couldn't put it down, a must read for any vacation."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"It's sometimes said in theatre that it takes a talented comic to play a tragic role successfully--and that the reverse is not true. Pratchett has the born comedian's deep and loving understanding of the tragedy of the human condition, and it is his gift to us to make us laugh instead of weep...Tiffany Aching, unquenchable heroine of \\"The Wee Free Men,\\" faces new challenges as she leaves her beloved home on the Chalk Downs to begin her training as a witch. New faces, new landscapes, the half-scary company of girls her own age, and a very ancient quasi-evil thing, pursuing her for her powers inborn...No one does it like Mr. Pratchett--this blend of irreverent humor and resonant, edge-of-myth magic. The puns are inexcrably bad (when the Wee Free Men try to impersonate a human being, animating a scarecrow, the one in the head complains, \\"I talk to my knees, but they don't listen to me.\\"), and the magic is undescribingly profound--Tiffany, as did her grandmother before her, seems to embody the very essence of the land she loves. Impossible to do every moment of one's waking life, of course, and Tiffany has to learn the value of not-quite-lies, half-truths, and stories. Granny Weatherwax, witch extraordinaire and my absolute favorite Pratchett character, plays a much stronger part in this story than in \\"Wee Free Men,\\" mixing her pride, her practical psychology, and the most intricate of magics. It's a wonderful, wonder-full story, and I can't wait to read more of Tiffany as she grows."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This book, which is a sequel to \\"The Wee Free Men\\" has got one of Discworld's greatest young adult heroines AND some old favorites like the Nac Mac Feegle (the sheep-stealing, kilt-swinging little blue men), Granny Weatherwax, and Death, Himself.Pratchett brings his usual weird energy to the story of Tiffany Aching, a nine-year-old sheep-herder's daughter, who is also a witch. She proved herself in \\"The Wee Free Men\\" when she rescued her sticky little brother from Faerie AND became Kelda (Queen) of the Nac Mac Feegle--at least temporarily. Anyone who hangs around with the little blue men for any length of time will soon be glugging Granny Aching's Special Sheep Liniment and saying things like \\"Ach, Crivens!\\" and \\"oot.\\" However, Tiffany wants to become a \`real' witch, not just the Nac Mac Feegle's wee big hag. So off she goes to apprentice herself to Miss Tick (a split personality if there ever was one).Unfortunately for Tiffany, a fell creature comes crackling out of Faerie, searching for the mind of a powerful but untrained dealer in magic. It needed a new mind/body after months of drifting in the void. A young witch's mind would be like a dollop of Cheese Wiz on the Cracker of Life.The Wee Free Men ken the weird beastie that's tracking Tiffany, but she herself doesn't have a clue. She thinks her biggest challenge lies in confronting a snobbish clique of goth witches, who absolutely jingle with occult jewelry, but don't seem to have a clue as to what a real witch does.\\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" has a wonderful climax where Tiffany and her feisty blue friends go face-to-face with Annagramma, the leader of the jewelry-laden apprentice-witch clique. To top matters off, the young sheep-herder's daughter participates in the celebrated Sheercliff Witch Trials, confronts her inner monster, and goes a round with Death, Himself:\\"I WAS NOT EXPECTING A NAC MAC FEEGLE TODAY, said Death. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE WORN PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, HA HA.\\"\\"The Wee Free Men\\" is the first book in a trilogy starring Tiffany and the Nac Mac Feegle. Read their continuing adventures in the third book, \\"Wintersmith.\\" I can truly say these books changed me forever--at least, they changed my vocabulary--\\"Ach, crivens, ye daft loonies, don't just sit there and watch yer life gae doon the cludgie. Read these books!\\""},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"My review for Pratchett's \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" reads almost exactly like that for Pratchett's \\"Wee Free Men\\" (the prequel to this book). First, and most importantly, I don't care what the \\"official\\" write-ups for this book say: this is not just a book for pre-pubescent youth. Outside of the fact that the protagonist is an 11-year old and some of the behavior/situations are somewhat simplified (i.e., it doesn't have the layers and layers of meaning buried in Pratchett's other works), this is standard Discworld fare. Some mild complaints are that the book appears to finish up just after the middle. However, that was a faulty assumption on my part and I quickly saw what Pratchett intended. Also, Granny Weatherwax isn't quite in character: she's too warm. I've marked the book down from five stars to four because of the mild simplification, but other than that, it's pretty darn good."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Once you've beaten the Evil Fairy Queen, there's not much to do but to continue your education. So you go away. Going away is important, because... well... It allows you to come back. What you don't know, is that you're being followed. Not by your unpleasant little brother, not by the boy you obviously don't like, but by something that cannot be killed (not even by your little helper strange-looking blue kinda fairy fighers). And that's only the beginning of your adventure! Once you set out into the real world, you'll meet the Biggest Witch of All again (not that she would ever agree she was actually The Witch In Charge). You get to meet Death. Personally. And your blue kinda fairy fighters kick some ass! If you ever want to read a serious adventure, don't leave this on the bookshelf! You'll find out what it takes to be a witch (and to wear a really nice pointy hat)."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Good adventure.Stays interesting and makes it seem like your almost one of the characters yourself.Would be a good read for younger folks.."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"great book in the series - Wish Terry all the best and hope his daughter writes some more about Tiffy Aching for us devoted fans!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Book 2 of the Tiffany Aching series of books by Terry Pratchett. Equally clever and funny and interesting and engrossing as the first. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This sequel to \\"Wee Free Men\\" continues the adventures of Tiffany Aching, the young up-and-coming witch of the Chalk lands. She is off now to the mountains to learn witchery with Mrs. Level, who has two bodies and an invisible servant named Oswald. She meets other apprentice witches, including some troublesome ones and some friendly ones, and makes new friends. Then an evil being called a hiver comes along and takes her over, and Tiffany becomes a terror. She abuses people and steals and turns people into frogs. It takes all the skills of Mrs. Level and the Nac Mac Feegle and Granny Weatherwax to save Tiffany from the hiver, with Tiffany herself contributing some good ideas for how to go about it. Things get a little squirrely in the mountains for a while until Tiffany comes up with an idea for getting rid of the unkillable hiver for good. The importance of good friends is highlighted in this book, as Tiffany's bacon is saved several times by her friends, and the importance of independence and a quick wit comes out as Tiffany struggles with the deadly hiver. The Nac Mac Feegle provide their swords and comic relief throughout the book, and Tiffany learns some important life lessons and grows up a little more. This book should be fun for children and adults alike."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"My library files the Tiffany Aching books in young adult, which is why it took me awhile to find them. This &#34;older&#34; adult discovered that it reads just fine, so I don't know how the publisher decides to market a book as &#34;YA.&#34; Terry Pratchett is always a good reader, and I quickly became a fan of this young girl who was a witch but didn't want to be a witch, and the wee blue men who came to her aid when it suited them. For Pratchett fans, a nice change of pace from the Discworld novels."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I love all of the Tiffany Aching stories, this is the second one and brings out all aspects of the stories. Also the introduction by Miss Perspicacia Tick is a must read. Didn't I review this story before?"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Actually, there's not much to 'waily' about in this one. I liked it a lot. Poor Tiff is put-upon by the local teenage witch coven, which actually reminded me of those putative Valley Girls in my review for \\"The Wee Free Men.\\" But why do I take off a star? I'm so tired of the \\"Granny Weatherwax saves the day\\" plot line. Even in the older Discworld books like Maskerade and the others, it seems like everything is at an impasse and only Granny (not Nanny, or Magrat, or any other witch) can save the day. And this is another one of those books. Tiffany is in trouble and the only way to get out of it is for the Feegles to summon Granny Weatherwax. And of course Granny takes over most of the rest of the book, even though it's a book about Tiffany and the Feegles. Still, the story is satisfying, if a little confusing at times."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"\\"A Hat Full Of Sky\\" is a hilariously delightful romp with a lovely validating under-rumble. I recommend it to any person young of heart or wishing to become so."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"George Lucas is supposed to have said at some point that the storyteller who could get inside the head of an eleven-year-old girl could make a fortune. Well, never having been an eleven-year-old girl (but having a daughter who is that age now), I'd say Terry Pratchett has managed remarkably well here--and the fortune is all the readers'.This second installment in the Tiffany Aching series follows the protagonist through a wonderful adventure as she looks at what being a witch--haggling as her riotous little friends the Feegles put it--is all about. The story is fun, thought-provoking and (for Pratchett especially) tightly plotted. And Discworld fans will cheer when Tiffany gets to meet Granny Weatherwax--truly two witches worth knowing!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This book is written for young readers in mind, but it can be enjoyed at any age. This book is well-paced, imaginative, informative (teaches one or two words not in most vocabularies), original, and expertly written.This fantasy takes place in the Discworld series and centers on the continued adventures of Tiffany Aching, a young witch who wants to learn more about how to be a good witch. This book is the sequel to The Wee Free Men. Unlike The Wee Free Men, it does not focus on Tiffany Aching realizing she has witch powers - instead it focuses on her developing those powers. This book has amazing character development."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Not just for kids, the adventures of Tiffany and the Nac Mac Feegles are very entertaining."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This is a charming story of a witch in training, the second book in a series of three by the same author (the others are The Wee Free Men, and The Wintersmith). This story can change your preconceived ideas about witches and what they do for living- in a good way. Funny and witty, it presents human values that will most probably stand the test of time. The growing up of Tiffany happens among daily chores, in an atmosphere impregnated of just the right amount of suspense, and populated by fairy creatures bound to make you laugh."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"The Tiffany Aching stories by Terry Pratchett are fabulous!

Tiffany sets out to do her apprenticeship with Miss Level. While Tiffany carries out the mostly mundane tasks of caring for the sick, she experiments with her own magical talents which have begun to surface. Thank goodness for the return of the Mac Nac Feegles, as well, who are back to protect the \\"big wee hag\\" as she contends with the mysterious and dangerous Hiver.Full of Pratchett's wry British humor, this is a book for young and old alike.

This book, and this series, are great for kids, and especially girls who are coming of age.

Like any Pratchett book, a definite 10 of 10."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"First things first - do not let the \\"young adult\\" tag on this product dissuade you from diving in.Now, as to the book itself, we find ourselves, as usual with Mr. Pratchett, on Discworld, the magical flat world sitting on the back of four elephants, all of whom are borne on the back of a great turtle, who soars through space. Yet we aren't dealing with such majestic themes and images here. We concentrate our tale upon a slight little girl, one Tiffany Aching. She is coming into young womanhood, which is trying enough, but certainly more trying when one is a novice witch, even one as powerful as Tiffany. Maybe even more so because of it.Tiffany, you see, is trying to learn the ropes of witchdom, which means she apprentices herself to various witches to learn the ins and outs of the life. This she does, even though it means she has to leave her homeland (there are no more witches where she lives on the Chalk). So, leave she does and she starts to learn.But somewhere along the way she attracts the attention of a being as old as the universe and as powerful. And this being wants. What it wants, it comes to realize, is little Tiffany Aching.But Tiffany, in addition to being a powerful, if somewhat untried and novice, witch also has additional protectors. The Nac Mac Feegle! The Wee Free Men! The person who first said that big things come in small packages was almost certainly describing the Feegles. The Pictsies (as they are wont to be called) protect Tiffany from, well, everything. They think she belongs to them and they're not really keen on thieves, unless it's them doing the thieving. And drinking. Oh, and don't forget the fighting. If they can do that in service to their witch (their \\"hag\\" as they call them) then all the better!Pratchett has woven another magical, haunting, hysterical, tragic tale of the little things of being - life, death, power, duty, and maybe justice.Or maybe we are dealing with majestic themes, after all. With liberally sprinkled episodes of thievery, fighting, cussing, and boozing, which the Feegles will tell you makes up almost the entirety of being. One can only love a creation like the Feegles, although I would advise a distant and general kind of love. Up close affection from a Feegle generally involves a headbutt.A brilliant series and one I'm looking forward to completing, if, as reported, the next book after Wintersmith is the finale.Bravo Mr. Pratchett!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"The Terry Pratchett genre is not one that I have delved into before.

However, you?ll really want to read the first volume (&quot;Wee Free&quot;), first, or the plot of &quot;Hat&quot; won't make as much sense to you.In the previous volume, Tiffany Aching, a young independent farmgirl with witch-like powers, overcomes an evil queen to rescue her brother with the help of a clan of drunken, riotous &quot;Pictsies,&quot; six-inch kilt-wearing men painted blue and swearing like truckers. In &quot;Hat Full of Sky,&quot; Tiffany goes off for formal witch training, only to be taken over by a &quot;hiver,&quot; an evil being who stirs up all one's worst urges. Under the hiver's temporary influence, Tiffany becomes a kind of &quot;mean girl,&quot; pushy, self-interested, inconsiderate, and obsessed with clothes.It strikes me as remarkable that Pratchett (a middle-aged man, after all) could get the internal struggle of the pre-teen so exactly right: wanting to be popular and able to satisfy every urge, but with a wee small voice inside, fighting those urges in favor of a better self.As in &quot;Wee Free Men,&quot; the Pictsies are terrifically funny; the best bit is when the Pictsies climb over each other like acrobats and throw on human clothes to disguise themselves (as a single human) for a journey: they confound their fellow-travelers when the stomach complains out loud to the head, and the gloved hands walk off in opposite directions.Both full- and pint-sized readers will laugh and enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Tiffany Aching, the heroine of WEE FREE MEN is back for a second adventure where she heads off to learn the ways of being a witch. And folks, let me warn you now that Terry Pratchett isn't about to send her off to a mysterious school of magic where you get wands with stars on them and learn how to do spells that go twing. Learning to be a witch on the Discworld is another kind adventure entirely! At its heart, this is a coming of age story for Tiffany, who must face down a deadly threat called a hiver, and come to terms with her own self.There's plenty of Terry's whimsical humor and wry satire to keep readers smiling and chuckling. Especially when the Nac Mac Feegle make their appearance in the story, of course! These little blue-tattooed Pictsies are delightfully irreverent and contentious, causing havoc and hilarity wherever they go. Along with the humor, however is a good solid dose of heart. I do believe Mr. Pratchett has done an exemplary job of making us care about the characters and creating believable, fallible and lovable. I was surprised at how much I came to care about the Mac Feegles new kelda, Jeanie as she struggles to take on the role she's been born for. Jeanie isn't a main character in the story, but her presence and other little touches like her, fill Pratchett's story with echoes of meaning and magic.If I have one complaint about this book, it's that it felt too short. Events happened so quickly that before I knew it I was at the last page of the story. I did feel as though there were places where the narrative could have been expanded upon, characters who were not as fully fleshed out as they could have otherwise been. Still, for the younger reader, a shorter read is likely to be appreciated-and Pratchett can pack quite a punch even in a shorter form such as this!Discworld fans that hungrily scoop up every new book by Terry Pratchett will be delighted to see Granny Weatherwax make a return appearance. This time the most formidable witch on the Discworld stays for more than a cameo role, with delightful results. Readers discovering Pratchett for the first time, you might want to grab WEE FREE MEN and read it first since it first introduces Tiffany Aching, but it isn't necessary to do so. If you enjoy these books please look for Pratchett's other young adult books: THE AMAZING MAURICE AND HIS EDUCATED RODENTS, and THE BROMELIAD TRILOGY. If you're looking for more adult fare, please be sure to check out all of Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. And have fun!Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Terry Pratchett is my favorite author.Most of the authors on my Top 10 list got there on the basis of a few good books; Robin McKinnley's \\"The Blue Sword\\" and \\"The Hero and the Crown\\"; Tolkein's \\"The Hobbit\\"; Elizabeth Moon's Paksenarion Trilogy; David Webber's \\"Mutineer's Moon\\" Trilogy...With Pratchett, it's easier to list those of his books that I don't like. There's only one (\\"Eric!\\"), and even it has its moments.I suppose that now I have to explain why I like him so much. The reason is simple. He is wise. He is ALSO funny, which allows him to present his wisdom in a way that is readily accessible.As a case in point, I am a soldier. I know the nature of my peers. Pratchett's books about CDR Vimes, which I collectively refer to as The Watch Trilogy (although there's now more than three volumes) is a masterpiece of insight into the nature of wearing a uniform. There is nothing at all heroic about CPL Nobbs or SGT Colon, and I've known many individuals very like both of them. Yet, when the time comes, and society needs someone to stand in the gap, they're there. Flaws and all. And beside them are people like CPT Carrot, who is virtue personified. CDR Vimes may not be virtuous, and he'd be horribly offended at being called noble, but he is good. And he does what he does because he loves his people. (I recall the comic scene where he states that the city is a woman, and he loved her even when she kicked him in his teeth.) The armed forces have the same mix of personalities that intermingle with complex interaction. We're not heros. We're people. Pratchett is one of the few authors who understands that enough to write it believably.But as much as I enjoy Pratchett's Watch Trilogy, I love his Witch Trilogy (also more than three books at this point). Esme Weatherwax is, perhaps, the most complex character that I've yet to see written into any book. She is a woman who is rigidly moral, because she understands that she is very close to being evil. It's by sheer willpower, and never being willing to act immorally, that she remains good. She is grim and dark and terrible... and good. She defined herself at one point as a woman who stands on The Boundary.Throughout history, there have been people who stand between humanity and those things that threaten it. Soldiers, Firemen, Policemen, Teachers, Authors, the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, the Wizards of Unseen University... Many of them ARE grim and dark and terrible, but they're often the most effective; their society is protected from whatever evil those Boundary-Watchers have set out to fight.And how does this relate to the charming young Tiffany Aching, and Pratchett's books about her, the second of which is \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\"? Tiffany Aching is used to contrast Esme Weatherwax. She is not grim, nor dark, nor terrible... Yet.Tiffany Aching is a Boundary-Watcher. But she is a young and inexperienced one. Given time, she will either grow into another Esme Weatherwax, or she will forsake The Boundary to become a wicked witch. The trilogy of Tiffany Aching is, at its heart, a guide book to the path towards maturity as a Boundary-Watcher. It warns against beginning to cackle. It explains the importance of being accountable to comrades. It lays out the mindset that a Boundary-Watcher must hold. And, it even does so in a believable way. Tiffany Aching DOES have failures of virtue (like the incident in the wand store, or with the old man's money), just like a real person. And the moral that Pratchett draws from those situations is that while certain actions may fall short of virtue, you can still show your worth in the way in which you respond.I pay to Pratchett the greatest homage that I can with these words:He understands.And to make him all the more impressive, the book is written in order to teach without being intimidating. Few non-Boundary-Watchers will pick up Dave Grossman's book \\"On Combat\\". Yet many will approach Pratchett's Tiffany Aching books, which discusses the same mindset and role in society, because of the expectation and joy of a good story. The story of a plucky young girl pitted against evil forces is certainly entertaining enough in its own right to amuse those who have no desire to explore the mindset of a Boundary-Watcher.And so, I think I shall end with this observation. There is a Zen quotation that states, \\"If you understand, things are just as they are. If you do not understand, things are just as they are.\\" I understand the fact that whether or not I understand is insignificant to the Great Scheme of Things. Yet what the quotation does not explain is why I still feel a great need to understand, in spite of the insignificance of understanding. For several months, I asked myself the question, \\"Why do I try to understand then?\\" I finally came up with an answer: \\"You laugh at more of the jokes.\\" Humor and understanding go hand-in-hand. Pratchett understands this."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"We purchased the CD version of this book on our cross-country journey this summer. Our daughter, aged six, picked the CD out based on the description on the back of the CD cover. Neither my wife or I had heard of the author or series before.We were very happy to discover that this is a wonderful and delightful tale! It is one of the rare children's books that both adults and children can enjoy. There were many times when all of us were laughing at the same time. Mr. Pratchett's sense of humour is, to say the least, unique.The tale is told independently of the first book in this series. You are told enough background information to know what is going on and at no point do you feel like you should have read the first book.As to the plot, it is full of blue little men with red hair, witches and a nasty creature that takes over the heroine. Everything is settled in the end and the world goes on.As a final testment to the book: our daughter demanded that we listen to the book on the return journey and neither my wife nor I complained.PS My daughter wants you to know that she thinks the book rates a \\"100 percent.\\""},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"One can only admire what must be going on in an author's mind to create stories like A HAT FULL OF SKY! Tiffany Aching, young heroine of The WEE FREE MEN, is back capturing the attention of young and older readers alike. Terry Pratchett has woven a new thread into the Discworld, adding a refreshing, new dimension to the already rich collection of characters, landscapes and goings-on. The Chalk, home of the Achings, is a remote rural region, far away from the bustle of Ank Morpork. The soft rolling hills, evolved in ancient times from the seas of the ages, are part of an area where reality meets magic...While Tiffany, now 11, has been cautiously applying her special skills, inherited from her much-loved granny, she does not really understand what they mean and how to apply them. It is time to *learn* the witching business properly. With the help of Miss Tick, the headhunter for young witches, she leaves her beloved Chalk to take up \\"service\\" with an experienced witch, the complex Miss Level. Contrary to common assumptions that young witches might learn to fly on a broomstick or concoct magical potions, Tiffany's new life can only be described as tiresome and tedious... Her chores have more in common with a nurse's training as she follows Miss Level to attend to the old, sick and lonely. While she is much appreciated by their charges, Tiffany has a more challenging time to fit in with her fellow witches' apprentices. The trials and tribulations of the witches' teenage years are no different from those of \\"normal\\" girls: vanity, jealousy, peer pressure. Pratchett has a wonderful, sensitive touch when characterizing this motley group. Tiffany's search and acceptance of her own, real *hat* and the hat itself are wonderful metaphors for her coming of witch-age.Tiffany has several magical talents. With telling herself \\"see me\\" and \\"see me not\\" she can step out of her body to observe her surroundings undetected. She also has the capacity for \\"third thoughts\\". Those are thoughts that \\"watch the world\\" and \\"think by themselves\\". They have helped Tiffany in her fight with the Queen of the Fairies in WEE FREE MEN. But they also can be trouble. Combined, these talents can also prove dangerous. The Nac Mac Feegle, the funny wild bunch of tiny blue men, a special kind of fairies, are the first to realize that danger is brewing for Tiffany. The hiver, an ancient entity that cannot die and moves from host to host, to absorb their minds, has set its ambitions on Tiffany. She would be an ideal candidate to be taken over... Rob Anybody and his brothers, have a special bond with the young girl, the \\"big wee hag\\". Their adventures are always hilarious, yet their efforts to protect Tiffany and to reach her before the hiver does is one of those gems that will stay in the mind of the reader. Mistress Weatherwax, the most revered of the old witches, is well known to Pratchett fans. Here, in her attempt to support and protect Tiffany, new sides of her personality are revealed. The confrontation with the hiver, while unavoidable, develops in unexpected ways.A HAT FULL OF SKY is a delight of a story, for readers with a young mind, whatever their actual age. As Pratchett fans have come to expect, it is filled with good humour, imaginative witticisms and magic fantasy and, at the same time, with deep understanding and empathy for the foibles of humans and other beings. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Ah, the lovely sight of a new Pratchett novel in my mailbox....This time, eleven year old Tiffany is leaving her beloved Chalk, off to apprentice to a real witch, the somewhat odd Mrs Level. Add in an ancient, bodyless creature who want to take over Tiffany's mind, a rather unique poltergeist, a coven of junior witches, the indomitable Granny Weatherwax, and of course the Nac Mac Feegle - four inch tall, red-haired, blue skinned pictsies who will drink, fight or steal anything.This is, technically, a children's book, but falls into that rare but treasured class of literature that can be read with equal enjoymenet by children and adults alike. Pratchett's insightful, humorous view of human nature, if anything, comes through more clearly in his children's books, and the use of language is certainly not watered down for younger readers.In summary, an excellent read for all ages, and a satisfactory sequel to the Wee Free Men.And track down a copy of Only You Can Save Mankind by the same author while you're at it..."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"As an avid Terry Pratchett reader, I believe there are two kinds of his book: good and great. A Hat Full of Sky is of the good variety, as it stands on its own. However, I believe it's a great chapter in the larger work of the Discworld series. He has something very important to say here about responsibility, about relationships within the community, and about deep morality . . . I think that Pratchett's sympathies lie deeply with his witches, and watching this witch grow up is his lesson to us . . . I laughed and cried, and went away for the better.(And ignore the Harry Potter comparisons. While I think Rowling is a fine author, Pratchett is the better storyteller, in the old, old sense of the term. His stories crackle with the energy of seeing all the parts of ourselves leaping back at us.)"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Now as a general rule I don't go around buying up every children's book that I find particularly amusing. I often find that I love so many of them that to buy them all I'd have to be either rich or a particularly good shoplifter. Yet when Terry Pratchett's, &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; came out I found myself actually buying it, it was so good. Not wanting to make a habit out of this sort of thing I decided that the next time I came across a great book I'd just read it in the bookstore. The next thing I knew &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, the sequel to &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; had was published and I began reading it. It was only after I publicly embarrassed myself by laughing uproariously in front of the other shoppers in the store that I had to face facts. I was going to buy &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; too. I did, I read it through, and I loved it. Though maybe not as moving as its predecessor, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; truly deserves to be read by anyone who thinks that fantasy and humor should become synonymous.As we remember from &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, Tiffany Aching has recently done battle with the Queen of Fairies, armed with only a frying pan and the help of some violent pictsies. The Wee Free Men, as they call themselves, have decided to keep Tiffany safe by keeping a close eye on her at all times. It turns out this eye might not be close enough though when Tiffany becomes the object of a hiver's desires. Hivers are creatures that move from powerful creature to powerful creature, taking over their minds until there's nothing left in the body but a shell. When Tiffany, witch in training, finds herself a victim of a hiver (a creature no one has ever killed before) it's with the help of her bright blue friends that she is able to face it down.Now, the first half of this book is everything you could hope for in a story. The Wee Free Men decide that the best way to rush to Tiffany's aid is to make themselves appear as human. Therefore, they fill up some old clothes and attempt to work together to walk as a single being. Needless to say, this is not without its failings. While the Wee Free Men are riding in a carriage towards Tiffany the other passengers in the stagecoach view the &quot;man&quot; with fear (especially when the buttons on his trousers pop open and a small redheaded man sticks his head out to talk to them). About this point I was gasping for breath, trying not to draw too much attention to myself as I laughed at the book. Sometimes I think that Pratchett's the funniest fantasy writer living today.Unfortunately, somewhere around page 185 the book slows down. Less attention is paid to the Wee Free Men and far more to Tiffany and Mistress (now called Granny) Weatherwax. This is all well and good, but part of what I liked about &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; was the fact that its little blue characters (I've heard them referred to as drunken tattooed Smurfs) appear regularly from the beginning of the story to the end. Here, they kind of drift off and the book forgets about them. Worse still, there are about five different endings to this story. You think it's over.... And then here's another ending right around the corner... Before you meet yet ANOTHER ending five pages later. The action doesn't rise and fall towards the end, it falls and falls. And falls some more.None of this is to say that the book is bad. I'm still happy that I purchased it. I just don't think it's quite as good as the original. Let's hope that with the future books in this series that equal attention is paid to Tiffany as there is to her little blue drunkards. If not, I can only quote the response the Wee Free Men themselves might have.&quot;Oh waily waily waily&quot;."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"The Editorial review from Washington Post, above, lacks perspective. JKR's minor characters have psychological depth while Pratchett's are two-dimensional? Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, what a bizarre comparison. They're two different writers. It should be noted that Pratchett started the Discworld series in 1983 (Color of Magic) when JKR was only 18 years old. He established his style long before JKR published Philosopher's Stone in 1997. All of his books are like this, for the most part. He simply used his existing Discworld template when he wanted to comment on the Harry Potter world, and thus created Tiffany Aching. If witches in Hat spend a great deal more time riding broomsticks and casting spells than they did in Wee Free Men it's because Pratchett is purposefully referring to Harry Potter's magical education. Correct, Miss Level's cottage is no Hogwarts. That's the point. With Tiffany Aching Pratchett gets to play with, gently satire and generally enjoy both Harry Potter's brand of magic and the commercialized airy-fairy Wiccan brand of magic, and mix some real old British magical lore in, too. Note that I am a Potter Fanatic.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Hat Full of Sky and the other Tiffany Aching stories. I can't recommend them enough. Humorous, likable, thought provoking and excellent."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I really, really enjoyed this book. Of course, I also loved \\"The Wee Free Men,\\" so I was primed for it. I enjoyed seeing Tiffany's journey continue. She had been accustomed to doing things by feel and making them up as she went along. Now she has to work within a structure, and she doesn't like it much. Nor is Tiffany alone. Rob Anybody, the Pictsies' Big Man, is a newlywed, and he also fumbles the unwritten rules of marriage.I also really enjoyed the contrast of the humble, helpful hedge witches vs. the overblown, haughty ones who sincerely believe clothes make the witch. If I have one small complaint, it's that the bossy, obnoxious Annagramma hadn't been slapped down harder by the end. That's just me, though. In real life, obnoxious people can often go for quite a long time without having a clue as to how wrong they are.Deby Fredericksauthor of \\"The Magister's Mask\\""},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I think I have read most of Terry Pratchett's books, and enjoyed them all.

If he is, I haven't read it yet. I picked up my first Pratchett book over 20 years ago and have been a fast fan ever since. Many an evening has been whiled away with one of his treasures and a glass of something refreshing.A Hat Full of Sky is the continuing saga of Tiffany Aching. Now I know this book is targeted for Young Adults, but I really believe anyone of any age will enjoy this book. Tiffany is now 11-years old and in many ways wise beyond her years. But she is still 11, and not always able to think things through as an adult would. So without being aware of it, she attracts the attention of a 'hiver' a formless being that is pursuing her. And this time she can't rely on Mistress Weatherwax (better known as Granny to the chosen few) or the Nac Mac Feegles. Although the last point is debatable. All well that ends well though.Terry Pratchett is the master at imparting wisdom and even advice, but done in such a way it is palatable.

There is a bit less of the deeper social and political satire of the rest of the Discworld series, but there's still plenty of humor in the antics of the Nac Mac Feegle, along with a bit of social and morality themed satire that I feel would be very appropriate for young readers."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Everything The Wee Free Men did, A Hat Full of Sky does even better - and when you take into account how good Wee Free Men was, that's a heck of an accomplishment. Sky takes place not long after Men ends, with Tiffany coming to terms with who she is and starting an apprenticeship under the tutelage of a local witch. Of course, the Nac Mac Feegle are never far behind her to keep her safe, but neither is something else - something that seems to have malevolent intentions and an unnerving focus on Tiffany. It would be easy to focus on how much Sky made me laugh - and it made me laugh a lot, and really hard - but to do so would run the risk of giving away so many of the best lines and moments, even though pulling them out of Pratchett's beautiful prose would ruin some of the magic anyways. (That being said, the disguise implemented by the Feegle creates some of the funniest moments I can remember reading in a book - not just Pratchett, but any book, period.) But I also want to focus on the raw beauty and magic that Pratchett can create, most notably in the book's climax, which stands much of what we've assumed on its heads, (literally) opens new doors into whole new worlds, and gives us a glimpse of a universe that's staggering in its complexity and surprising depth and humanity (so to speak). As I said about Men, Sky is technically a YA novel, but there's no difference between this and Pratchett's other work - it's just as complex, just as solid, just as funny, just as wonderful, without a hint of the patronizing tone that so often sneaks into YA books written by \\"adult\\" authors.

Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat \\"Bite me!\\"I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Having only read the adult Pratchett books, this one was rather startlingly different.The story is another in the ongoing (I gather) adventures of young Tiffany Aching, 11, who has discovered she is a witch. {The first one was, I believe, \\"The Wee Free Men\\".} There are oodles of delicious characters, the Nac Mac Feegle -- a tribe of pugnacious and diminutive warriors who talk a rich Highland brogue; Mistress Level, to whom Tiffany has been appointed a sort of apprentice; Petulia, a wispy young woman of Tiffany's age who has trouble managing her broom, and many others.Like Douglas Adams, Pratchett's writing has a delightful improvisational quality that is far more true to life than some of the highly-planned stories out there that leave one emotionally exhausted, but in retrospect are unconvincing. Yes, there are a few stock situations: the big show-down, such as a Quidditch match often is, but that's hard to avoid.There is a great deal more warmth in this book than there is in Pratchett's adult books. It takes a little getting used to, but I for one was not displeased. His affection for the heroine is tangible. Her constant commentary on the events rings true; it's been a long time since I was eleven, but I seem to remember my own thoughts going on similar lines. Tiffany's determination to be ruthlessly honest, and failing sometimes, seems familiar. (I must read the other reviews, to see if a young lady has done one.)An enthusiastic thumbs-up. Only 4 stars for some editorial lapses, and what seem to be some unexplained episodes. Perhaps they would make sense if I had read the prequel, or perhaps some of Mr Pratchett's thoughts didn't quite arrive on paper (or got ripped out!)Arch"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I enjoyed the first book so much, \\"Wee Free Men\\" that I had to read the second book, \\" A hat full of Sky \\" .

While this series takes place on Discworld, very little of the normal people and places familar to readers are mentioned - except for Granny Weahterwax, who makes a prominent appearance in this one.Young witch-in-training, Tiffany Aching, undergoes a deadly threat which needs all the assistance she can get from the Wee Free Men and Granny Weatherwax. Any more would spoil the story. It really can't be read as a stand-alone book though - you really need to read Wee Free Men first."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Terry Pratchett strikes again with sword-sharp wit and nail-biting suspense in his sequel to \\"Wee Free Men\\" titled \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\", which continues the story of one 'big wee hag' named Tiffany Aching. Tiffany is out to learn how to become a proper hag and she's ready for anything- memorizing potion ingredients, casting spells and... doing chores? Who knew that witchcraft entailed milking a nanny goat with a mean kick or trying to help clueless villagers? However, danger follows Tiffany as closely as the Nac Mac Feegles follow the scent of alcohol. This time instead of a fanatical Queen of Fairies, the danger is a disembodied swarm of minds called a 'hiver' and it's tracking Tiffany like a bloodhound because it sensed her power and wants to take over her mind. The hiver needs Tiffany's mind and body because the *last* person that it took over is now *dead*. Crivens! Will Tiffany be able to get out this scrape with her mind intact?I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has read \\"Wee Free Men\\" and Terry Pratchett's other works, as well as to newcomers scratching their heads and wondering, \\"What in the world is a Nac Mac Feegle?\\"Terry Pratchett's style is full of wit so sharp you could cut yourself on it, profound insights to life, and (In the case of \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\") the hilarious 'Wee Free Men' otherwise identifiable as little blue smurfs in kilts with ferocious fighting spirit and foul mouths. (Crivens!) \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" is a wonderful follow-up to \\"Wee Free Men\\" and I would not change a thing about it."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I had to read this book as an assignment for a Seminary class on Leadership. I was sceptical that a children's book about witches would be applicable to a master's level college course. My scepticism was unfounded. This is a good, fun read. But, more than that, this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it's characters. I recommend it to \\"children\\" of all ages!!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Tiffany Aching is back, a little bit older, and about te set out to undergo some training as a witch. Unfortunately Tiffany has been targeted by a Hiver, a nasty entity as old as the universe and unkillable. The Nac Mac Feegle (Pictsies) become aware of the Hiver and want to warn Tiffany, but their leader holds off at first as Tiffany was a rival. But eventually the small blue men are on their way to the rescue.Tiffany, meanwhile, has been apprenticed to Mrs. Level who has a very unusual personal trait. But oddities aside, Tiffany begins her training unaware that the Hiver is after her. Eventually all th plot threads come together with both humor and seriousness until the whole thing winds up in a very satisfactory manner.Terry Pratchett has produced another wonderful young-folks book written in his usual style of wit. Pratchett manages to do a perfect job of getting across the brogue used by the Pictsies without making it harder to read. Not many books make me laugh out loud but I received a few odd looks on the train when this book made me laugh. Check it out."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This is the second book in the Tiffany Aching series (after The Wee Free Men and before at least a couple more with the tentative titles of Wintersmith and When I Am Old I Shall Wear Midnight).Tiffany is now eleven, two years have passed since the events of The Wee Free Men and the incident with the Fairy Queen. She's learnt a few tricks since then, like the ability to step out of her own body, which is actually very handy when your only mirror is too small and you want to check if your hair is well combed at the back of your head. Although she likes wearing that invisible hat Mistress Weatherwax gave her.Now Miss Tick the witch is bringing her to the mountains, to Miss Level's cottage to be more precise, an old witch with two bodies, where she shall begin her apprenticeship.Her news friends, the other witches' apprentices, and especially Annagramma Hawkin, mock her because she's only good at sheep and cheese, and Miss Level only helps old people or acts as a midwife and she's not even doing proper magic, and of course Tiffany's not even wearing proper witch clothes with stars and sequins, let alone a real witch hat. In the end, Tiffany's apprenticeship turns out to be not exactly what she expected, but much, much more.And all that time, the little blue fairy men, the Nac Mac Feegle, are watching over her. And what they find out is that an evil spirit, a Hiver, is pursuing Tiffany, waiting to take up her body the next time she steps out of it. Rob Anybody and his mates set out to help her.I really really love the Tiffany Aching books. In them, and probably because they're aimed at a younger audience, Terry Pratchett manages to philosophize in a much more accessible and discreet manner than in his lastest (adult) Discworld books (like Thief of Time). The values he teaches here, through the relationship between people, or between people and the land, are very noble ones, and they're seemlessly sewn into a storyline that is in itself very captivating, and of course very funny. I really really love the Tiffany Aching books."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"My 3 boys, ages 9 to 13, begged me not to stop when I was reading this book to them. They loved the humor in it, especially how the Mac Nac Feegle relate to Tiffany and their environment. It reads quick, like a good book should.

Although offered as a \\"young adult\\" book, this story satisfys the adult reader aswell. He is a superb observer of human nature and never fails to shine a light on the emotions, thoughts and actions of his characters.

I was sorry to finish them - Pratchett's sense of humour and bizarre imagination can be relied on for a great read.They seem to be classified as children's books, but apart from the fact that it is about a young girl, the stories are as entertaining as all of the other Terry Pratchett stories. The idea of the Wee Free Men is brilliant and their speech, a brogue, is perfect. I hope there are more in this series."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I will recommend this book (as well as Wee Free Men) to any young reader. Terry Pratchett is just as wonderful a writer for younger readers as he is for those of us that are adults."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Having just finished the first Tiffany Aching book, I eagerly jumped into this one almost immediately afterwards. (Hey, I waited a full two hours before I read it...) I wasn't quite sure if I'd like this one as much as I did the first one, and I have to admit that while I loved the heck out of this book I just didn't like it quite as much as the first.The story picks up a short while after the events of the last book. Tiffany is being sent to study under the mysterious Miss Level, a witch who was born to two bodies. If being away from home & dealing with snobby student peers wasn't bad enough, there's a strange being trailing after Tiffany that is bent on possessing her body & powers!Really & truthfully, the best scenes in the book were the ones where Tiffany interacted with Granny Weatherwax. It was interesting to see Tiffany being groomed as a \\"Granny Weatherwax in training\\", but it was also nice to see a new side of Granny. Some fans of the regular witch series may find it a bit strange, but I rather liked seeing how Granny would react to someone with similar thoughts & actions. (I just hope that Tiffany doesn't replace Granny eventually- I don't like her THAT much!) The good news for this book is that it's a fun & easy read. The bad news is that there are one or two scenes where the book seems to drag a teensy bit, mostly the scenes with Miss Level & her twin body. (I just found Miss Level a bit of an annoying character.) Still, those scenes don't last for very long & soon enough the book moved on to the real meat of the novel.Overall I think that most readers of Pratchett's work should like this entry. New readers would be better off if they started with the first Tiffany Aching book or if they started at the beginning of the Discworld saga. (Or at least read some of the Witch books.)"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Hat Full of Sky is the next book from Terry Ptatchett's Wee Free Men.

The story was not bad, the jokes were ok, and the Nac Mac Feegle are still a hoot, but there was something missing with this one. Some sense of satisfaction that was missing. Perhaps I need to read some other Pratchett books so as not to burn out on one story thread.Don't misunderstand that this was a bad book, I still liked it just not as much as I hoped I would. There are a lot of petty people in this book, which may have been part of the turn-off. I can only deal with so many petty people in a single book and there were an abundance of them."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This sequel to The Wee Free Men was good but not as good as its prequel.This is a story to tell what happens to Tiffany and the Nacmacfeegle after Tiffany throws the Queen of the fairies out of her world.As she studies to become a witch in the mountains an evil creature that cannot be killed tries to take over her mind and body making her do dreadful things, including finding out what happens to the rest of a person when you turn them into a frog. Luckily the Nacmacfeegle have a plan, or rather a PLN, to save her. Tiffany's mind and soul slowly start turning into the evil inside her. Still, Tiffany does not let the evil take her without a fight. In her mind she hides, trying not to let the evil take all of her and make her the most feared and hated being on the earth. You should read the book and find out what then happens to Tiffany and the Wee Free Men.

Like most sequels, this was fun and good, but lacked the punch of the previous story.Tiffany Aching is now 11, and has been apprenticed to another witch, Miss Level who lives off the chalk. Soon Tiffany is possessed by a \\"Hiver\\" - a parasitic magical creature that occupies the minds of its hosts before it eventually destroys them. As Tiffany struggles with the Hiver, Rob Anybody and the Nac Mac Feegle (the \\"wee free men\\") come to help her and attempt a rescue.The story was entertaining, as Prachett's writing is funny. The Feegle in particular are just plain fun to read about. However, unlike _The Wee Free Men_ there is much more \\"hocus pocus\\" in the magic that Tiffany does, and the Feegle largely play a secondary role in the story. The way in which the Hiver is eventually dealt with, and the consequences of Tiffany's actions while under the Hiver's control were also disappointing.I DID like the book, and I DO recommend it. However, read _The Wee Free Men_ first; and recognize that as enjoyable as _Hat Full of Sky_ is, it just doesn't measure up to the high bar set in the earlier book."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Ok, I admit Terry's 'Guards, Guards', and 'Pyramids' (not to mention Death fly-fishing in 'Mort') were some of the funniest things I've ever read.This book, however, is not so much funny as very introspective. What would Esmeralda Weatherwax been like on The Chalk? Would she have been as old as a child as Tiffany seems to be, who obviously has never been a little girl?Read the book. It's worth it, even if you aren't looking for a good laugh AND you can get over the idea that a child thinks like a cynical old woman.Terry has demonstated a gift over the years for the 'who done it' creepy kind of fantasy drama. (Stop hanging out with Neil Gaiman, Sir Knight!) He didn't leave me dangling over whether the heroine wins, but in what way she would conquer her issues. But he did leave me wondering if he'd ever known any little girls like Tiffany - and I know he has a daughter, who could not possibly have met the expectations of this book. If he did know someone like Tiffany, then that would worry me.The Mac Nac Feegle are so much fun. As always."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Eleven-year-old Tiffany Aching leaves the Chalk and her friends, the six-inch Nac Mac Feegle, to apprentice as a witch in training to a professional. Saying goodbye to Granny Aching was hard and departing from her Wee Free Men pals (at least her buddies when the Nac Mac Feegle are not drunk) is not easy, but service at her advanced age is expected. So though her parents are fooled as to whom she will work for, Tiffany leaves with Miss Tick to begin her training.Unlike when she was young and immature, Tiffany as she enters adolescence has become aware of her looks. This attentiveness to her outer beauty makes her prone to attack from terrible beings. The hiver, a being that seeks out the potentially powerful by stealing control of the host's mind until the victim dies, sees Tiffany as a perfect lodging locale. The parasite begins the pre-occupation and occupation with only Nac Mac Feegle to try to rescue his young pal.As he did with the way out THE WEE FREE MEN, Terry Pratchett does again with the sequel that is as sharp a satire as a reader will find. The story line makes it clear that to find one's full self, one must accept flaws, blemishes, and foibles; not an easy task in a youthful beauty is best society. Tiffany and Nac Mac are terrific characters though they be inane at times and the hiver is as vile a villain as there is. A HAT FULL OF SKY is amusing, but though nutty, the plot never loses sight of the key underlying message while entertaining the author's vast universe of fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I've read nearly every Discworld book and this rating is in comparison to other Discworld books.

I knew they were basically kid's books, but it was Pratchett writing, so how could they be bad?Well folks, I guess anything is possible, even that Pratchett could trip up once in a while. These books all tread flatly into the land of hard-to-go-with-it, a tough order when you have swallowed all the Discworld books whole. The characters are either twee or overdone to the point of yawn. The humour, watered down apparently for children, comes off as stale, there is little logic involved in the plots, and I got really, really sick of Tiffany. Thumbs down, and I hope Terry Pratchett goes back to what he is super good at -- hard rights and up-front lampoons directed at recognizable targets -- and lays off the goody-two shoes stuff.pat chapinhttp://www.ThreeMermaids.com"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Tiffany Aching, heroine of 'The Wee Free Men' leaves home and goes be apprentice to the witch Miss Level, who has a very unusual talent. Tiffany is rather bored by the mundane duties required of her by Miss Level, and meets some other, flashier witches who seem to have a different idea of what witchcraft is about, but who is right? Meanwhile a mysterious and apparently maligant force is after Tiffany, attracted by her strong magical powers. The valiant and belligerent little Nac Mac Feegle set out to rescue her, and Granny Weatherwax too has an interest in Tiffany. I enjoyed this book more than 'The Wee Free Men' I thought it was funnier and had a more intersting plot, with a number of unexpected twists. Great fun, full of humour, magic,suspense and amusing characters."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"This is the continued story of Tiffany Aching, precocious child and aspiring witch, and follows her from the Chalk of her home to the Ramtops, where she is apprenticed to Miss Level. Not that witches have apprentices, you understand. Tiffany discovers that learning to be a witch can be an awfully mundane business, long on chores and caring for those too careless or to foolish to care for themselves. And short on magic. Unhappily, something else follows her from the Chalk: a Hiver, a bodiless and evil power that takes over - and quickly destroys - minds that have strong magic. Tiffany is in mortal danger, and she doesn't even know it.The Nac Mac Feegle know of the danger, but they are far away, and the new Kelda, Jeannie, is a little jealous of Tiffany anyway. Miss Level only knows that there is danger and that something is wrong. It may take the greatest witch of them all, the formidable Mistress - not \\"Miss\\" - Esme Weatherwax - to save the day. Or it may take even more: Tiffany Aching may have to rise above even the levels in \\"Wee Free Men\\" to save the day - and herself.As in every Pratchett book, there is wonderful humor, with the Nac Mac Feegle providing most of the comic relief. The scenes in the stagecoach ride, for example, with the Wee Free Men trying to impersonate a man by filling out a scarecrow, may be the funniest sustained bit Pratchett has done in years. But the humor is the sugarcoating for some very serious messages about growing up.This is Pratchett at his very best. Yes, it's a children's book, in the sense that the language is toned down a bit, and there's a little less violence, but like the very best children's literature, this is a book an adult can read with pleasure and delight. This is a book with messages and meanings for adults, too. And Pratchett's writing, his skill in crafting a sentence, isn't one bit less sophisticated than in his other books.Read for pleasure or read for deeper meaning, this is an outstanding book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I listened to an unabridged audio version of this book and my review pertains to that version.This is the third of Terry Pratchett's young adult books I've listened to on audio (via download from Audible), and the second in the Tiffany Aching series. Fledgling witch Tiffany Aching was first seen, along with her violent, often dim but always brave accomplices, the Wee Free Men, in the book called, not surprisingly, The Wee Free Men. In this sequel, Tiffany is now 11 and leaving home to begin her life as an apprentice witch. The plot involves her battles with a \\"hiver\\", a parasitic presence that latches onto a strong person and takes them over, eventually killing the host. The hiver is attracted to Tiffany's strong magic abilities and stalks her. How Tiffany \\"beats\\" the hiver and also learns a lot of important lessons about growing up (most of them applicable to non-witches out here in the real world) is only part of the attraction of this book. The rest is the rollicking storytelling voice and the humor of the interactions of the characters, particularly whenever the MacFeegles or Wee Free Men show up. Chaos and kicking nearly always ensue, and these are the parts that will get you in trouble with your neighbors on the subway as you laugh out loud at various points in the plot.Stephen Briggs is a wonderful narrator, who has read all of the Pratchett young adult titles available through Audible. He does a great variety of voices, performing both women and children well, as well as making the MacFeegles' voices unforgettable and hilarious. The accents can occasionally be a little difficult to understand, but it's well worth the effort. Though the Tiffany Aching series and another, standalone book (The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents) are marketed as young adult titles and are certainly excellent for readers age 9-10 and above, there is much for adults to enjoy as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"A Hat Full of Sky is the thirty-second novel in the Discworld series, following Monstrous Regiment.

Along the way, Miss Tick keeps having feelings that something is watching them. When they meet Miss Level in the woods near Twoshirts, both senior witches have the same feeling. However, nothing menacing is to be found in the vicinity, so Tiffany reluctantly climbs on the broomstick behind Miss Level and off they fly to her new residence.Before they leave, Miss Level asks Tiffany if she is afraid of heights and Tiffany says that she is not; however, she should have told Miss Level that she is really afraid of depths. Since Tiffany had forgotten to wear woolen trousers to protect against the cold, Miss Level mostly flies just above ground level, except when she is flying straight up a waterfall. Tiffany tries to keep her eyes shut as much as possible, for the ground is just a blur as they fly over. Every time they come to a fence or hedge, Miss Level says \\"Here we go!\\" or \\"Ups-a-daisy!\\", which does not help Tiffany's queasy stomach. She throws up twice on the journey.After they arrive, Miss Level immediately takes Tiffany to her room and lets her prepare for bed. Of course, she brings up a tray of beef stew for supper, which Tiffany manages to eat despite the efforts of an invisible sprite to take away the dishes. Tiffany discovers the next day that the invisible creature is an ondageist, who tidies up things. She also discovers that Miss Level has two (2) bodies with only a single mind.In this story, Tiffany is attacked and possessed by the Hiver before the Feegles can reach her. The creature uses her mind and abilities to appear as a powerful witch and it scares the dickens out of Annagramma, a fellow apprentice who likes to put down her sisters. When the Feegles arrive, they cross over into her mind to fight the creature. Miss Weatherwax also comes to help with the Hiver. Together they all toss it out on its ear, but it is still around and it can't be killed. Moreover, Tiffany feels that she is missing something.Tiffany learns a lot about herself and her beloved Granny Aching while she is residing in the Ramtops. In fact, she learns that she has a lot of Granny Aching within herself. Despite Annagramma's cuts and put-downs, Tiffany rises above petty jealousy to accomplish remarkable deeds and to accept the accolades of Granny Weatherwax herself.Overall, this novel is as fully satisfying as the first tale about Tiffany. The scene where Tiffany dances with the bees is filled with vicarious joy! How can the author produce such a humorous book that also makes the reader feel so alive? Another winner in the Discworld series!Highly recommended for Pratchett fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of self-reliant young ladies who are willing to face their shortcomings, but also willing to accept their strengths.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"It's two years after the first book in the trilogy, Tiffany is now eleven, and she's looking forward to going off to \\"witch school.\\" Unlike the formal institution of Hogwart's, however, witch-training in the real world (on the Discworld, that is) really means an apprenticeship to an older witch. Tiffany's mentor is Miss Level, an ex-circus performer, whose idea of witchcraft seems to consist mostly of looking after everyone in the neighborhood who needs assistance. As Tiffany discovers (and as the author has pointed out in his other books), the main thing about learning magic is learning NOT to use it. This time, Tiffany is being stalked by an ancient, parasitic non-intelligence that can't be killed, but which is guaranteed to send its hosts insane. The Nac Mac Feegle are back, of course, and their special skills are essential to Tiffany's eventual success. Granny Weatherwax, who appeared only in a cameo in the first volume, is a much more important figure in Tiffany's gradual education, and the view we get of her is much more nuanced -- and much stronger -- than in the author's other \\"witches\\" novels. Pratchett's style has become far more mature and more subtle than his early work thirty years ago, which some of his fans don't appear to be able to accept, but I like his more recent work even more than the earlier stuff. A beautiful book."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"First published in 2004 and set on the Discworld, \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" is the sequel to \\"The Wee Free Men\\" and sees Tiffany Aching return as the book's heroine. Tiffany, now eleven years old, has been brought up on a farm in an area on the Chalk. She has six older sisters, one younger brother, wields a mean frying pan, is very good with cheese and has already impressed the Discworld's greatest witch. Granny Aching, who dies when Tiffany was seven, continues to be a big influence on her grand-daughter. Granny was a shepherdess, very fond of Jolly Sailor tobacco and - Tiffany is convinced - a witch. Remembering how Granny said it was important to stand up for those who have no voice, Tiffany has decided she wants to follow in her footsteps.The book also features an exceptionally rowdy, and thoroughly entertaining, bunch of fairies. The Wee Free Men, we also known as the Nac Mac Feegle, are a Pictsie race who were thrown out of Fairyland for being drunk, disorderly and rebellious. They are covered in tattoos, have red hair and blue skin and wear little other thank kilts and swords. An extremely fast and strong race, they are fond of fighting, stealing and drinking - Granny Aching's Special Sheep Liniment is a particular favorite. There have been a few changes since \\"The Wee Free Men\\", however. The clan now has a new gonnagle, Awf'ly Wee Billy Bigchin Mac Feegle, and a new Kelda, Jeannie of the Long Lake. Jeannie, as tradition demands, has married the Big Man o' the Clan, Rob Anybody Feegle. She is also responsible for possibly the biggest change of them all. The Nac Mac Feegle had once been afraid of reading and writing, believing it to be a dangerous type of magic. Jeannie now wants the clan, beginning with Rob Anybody, to learn how to read and write. For a while during \\"The Wee Free Men\\", however, Tiffany was the clan's temporary Kelda - as a result, they have never forgotten her and still try to protect her. It also means that Jeannie doesn't like or trust the young hag at all.As the book opens, Tiffany is leaving the Chalk for a spell (boom boom !). She's been apprenticed to Miss Level, a very peculiar research witch but clearly with some talent. (Miss Level's cottage is also home to Oswald, a kind of anti-poltergeist : instead of messing things up, he's obsessively tidy). Tiffany travels to Miss Level's with Miss Tick : unknown to either of then, however, they are being followed by a hiver. This is a type of demon without a body, brain or shape of its own. Instead, they search for and take refuge in bodies of great power - and this particular hiver has targeted Tiffany. Tiffany has inadvertently learnt how to 'borrow', a trick which leaves her own body unattended. Unfortunately, this will makes things easier for the hiver to take up residence. Luckily, the Wee Free Men want to follow and protect her - if they can convince their new Kelda it's a good idea.Like everything else I've read by Pratchett, this is an excellent book. It's easily read, features plenty of likeable characters and there are plenty of laughs. Although I would recommend reading \\"The Wee Free Men\\" before this instalment \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" is definitely recommended !"},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"Beginning after the events of \\"The Wee Free Men\\", \\"A Hat Full of Sky\\" centers on Tiffany Aching, and her efforts to properly learn witching. The event's occur within the DiscWorld. The Nac Mac Feegles' once again make their presence felt, in the purportining of various items & general odour.. and are absolutely brilliant. Tiffany herself is a more lacklustre, whilst Death briefly manifests.So the first half of the book moves along joyfully, with Tiffany leaving the Chalk and apprenticing to a witch who is about double what she seems. The antics of the Nac Mac Feegle got spurts of laughter from me, most notably the scene wherein many little men make one large... thing.They follow Tiffany in order to protect her from a creature which they know to be unbeatable, after an initical hiccup with their new Kelda who is Rob Anybody new wife.The method of travel is colourful and beguiles away a good few chapters, with usual TP wit and verve.When it comes to the battle, the NMC are shunted aside to focus further on Tiffany, which is unfortunate as I found her transformation into a narcissitic pre-teen whilst possibly true to life, not at all entertaining.The book also has too many half endings, before actually concluding, & Granny Weatherwax figuring in the preceedings at some point.It was with some disappointment that I concluded the book & realised that I had not enjoyed it as much as anticipated. It would seem this book has been more written for the pre-teens than the previous, and not at all necessarily. Here goes a family anecdote: My siblings practically started reading on TP's books, first with Carpet People & Truckers & Diggers, & then onto the more DiscWorld when they were still 10-14. I do believe he is the only reason they are semi-literate today...Summation: Naturally it was enjoyable, with the authorship of TP, but not as much as even Maurice and His Amazing Educated Rodents, which was also a book for young readers. Loved the first half, impatiently read through the last."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I have been researching novels over the summer to include in my class reading list for the fall. I read The Wee Free Men and was struck by Pratchett's ability to tell a vivid, humorous story. In A Hat Full of Sky, he continues with this style but seems to find his step a bit more fully in keeping the plot a bit more crisp while expressing the characters in a compelling way. The book contains life lessons through Tiffany's experience and the 'spirit' of the Wee Free men continues to provide rich entertainment."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"I'll leave the detailed reviews to the others, but just wanted to comment that as with Wee Free Men, this book is classified \\"Young Adult\\" but is really just Pratchett at his best. It's back to the basics of what always made me love the Discworld books to begin with: a great story with insightful commentary on human behavior snuck in and plenty of material that will make you laugh out loud as you read it.I liked Wee Free Men and Hat Full of Sky is easily even better.So don't let the Young Adult classification scare you away if you don't normally fit into that catagory, if you've been reading the Discworld series you'll greatly enjoy this."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"At a mere eleven years old, Tiffany Aching has won a war and lost a gran. She's killed the \\"Quin\\" of the Faeries - with a skillet! Her grandmother, a woman of Power, was a subtle force among the Chalk Downs shepherd community. With such a background, it's inevitable that she is destined for an interesting life. She's already been a kelda to the Nac Mac Feegles - the pictsies who scutter among the barns and bushes of the local farms. Now, she's been selected by the doyenne of the Ramtops' witches, Mistress Weatherwax, to be trained in The Craft.Tiffany's clearly inherited some of her gran's Power, but is too young to understand or cope with it. Something else wants that Power. The hiver is a formless thing constantly seeking minds to inhabit. While not truly evil, its effect is deadly. It's inhabited Tyrannosaurs, sabre-toothed tigers and wizards. Yet it's still not sated. Tiffany's young, untested and vulnerable mind seems an ideal roost for the hiver. Thus, the story, told as only Pratchett can relate it, becomes a contest of wills - Tiffany's, the hiver, her mentor, Nac Mac Feegle and all.So, is this just another simple fantasy about witchcraft and the eternal struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" - a dark versus light dichotomy? Not in Pratchett's knowledgeable hands. The Feegle, Tiffany's staunch allies, are thieves and boozers, in strife with anything that moves. Miss Level, Tiffany's assigned trainer, leads a double life - and more than one of those. The Chalk Downs aren't just white rocky paddocks - they bear a history of life reaching millions of years in the past. Part of the Power is understanding that heritage, and perhaps putting it to use. And just why was the Uffington White Horse carved on a hillside so that can't be seen clearly until you're above it? And why is the carving in parts instead of a complete rendition? Um . . . and is it really a cat? Pratchett's ability to challenge the reader instead of merely being entertaining is unexcelled. This book is a prime example.Tiffany's confrontation with the hiver reveals its hidden origins. They are as remote as Time itself. While the hiver enters but one mind at a time, it represents an aspect of all living things. Pratchett's resolution of the hiver's invasion of the young witch's mind is superbly crafted. But the story doesn't end with that denouement. Tiffany must attend on Granny Weatherwax, who initiated this situation. In this finale, Pratchett draws one of the most glorious passages of his career. Esme Weatherwax can Borrow - entering the minds of creatures more subtly than the hiver's occupation. Is it her in the swarm of bees Tiffany encounters? Or have they collectively responded to the presence of so powerful a witch? Whatever the cause, Tiffany and the swarm perform a dance - of victory? of acceptance? or just for the pleasure of it?With his superb style - a recipe of mirth, pathos, philosophy and irony, Pratchett has again shared his genius with us. All of us. As many have noted, putting a \\"readers' age\\" restriction on this book is a flawed limitaton. Pratchett, in whatever he writes, is unaged and ageless. Adults and children alike will find entertainment and value here. The best approach, in this reviewer's opinion, is for adults to buy this book and read it aloud - to anybody.

Unfortunate;y she's beeing hunted by something unpleasant and of course the Nac Mac Feegle have to try to rescue her. Unfortunately the Pictsie way of trying to stop something that cannot be seen, smelled or touched by beating it to a pulp might not be the best tactic here. But don't tell them that.I really liked this book and its rather quiet way of dealing with character issues. Since the antagonist was primarily internal (and jumped from person to person) the challenge of facing up to one's own shortcomings and failings. I thought that the landscape of Tiffany's mind made for one of the more unique battlegrounds I've read and I thought that her willingness to accept help and find support in her friends.The other thing I liked was how the novel dealt with cliques and being the oddball in some way. Tiffany's realization and internal monologue about what real and sincere respect are completely awesome. I also liked how she learned to handle it and especially who she found as inspiration to keep acting in that way at the end.As before, the Nac Mac Feegle provided a nice note of comic relief as well as a reservoir of steadfast support. I found their enthusiastic way of \\"we'll help, just show us what you need bashed\\" endearing. I also liked Miss Level and her multiple hands and philosophy that doing something good doesn't mean getting obvious appreciation for it. Death's cameo appearance was fun too.I think I might have found yet another series to get sucked into and would happily invite everyone else to join me in it."},{"Title":"A Hat Full of Sky The Continuing Adventures of Tiffany Aching and the Wee Free Men","review":"The whole series about Tiffany Aching (especially the first two books) is amazingly deep, entertaining, and educational.

Just because you're all grown up, doesn't mean you have to eat that way. This cookbook is definitely good for beginners though. It's got a great little guide in the front with all the \\"official\\" cooking terms in it so you can understand it all. Like a picture of a spaghetti strainer and next to it, it says \\"colander,\\" so you know what they mean when the instructions say you need a colander. It also tells you exactly what they mean when they ask you to stir, beat, dice julienne, etc. It also breaks down carbohydrates, protein, fats, and vitamins, and tells why you need them. This is definitely a book that you should pick up if you're just starting your vegetarian diet. Although the recipes are mostly vegetarian, there are a few vegan ones in there also. Each recipe is in metric (European) and Imperial (American) measurements. And most recipes give you little alternatives and variations that you can try. In the beginning of each chapter they have about three meal plans that you can try out like a movie night at home, southern meal or a good winter lunch.

Generally he thinks the Americans helped but were not decisive in the victory over the Germany Empire. The French helped but their Army was tired of the war.This is obviously a different picture than what is normally thought of the war. It is factual but places the perspective onto the British as the ultimate victors of World War One.Also, it disregards Haig's earlier blunders in 1916 and 1917 whenhe wasted thousands of lives on a few miles of scorched earth.Haig might have been right at the end, but not during the earlieryears of the war."},{"Title":"Cassell Military Classics: To Win A War: 1918 The Year Of Victory","review":"As an Englishman, I was extremely pleased when I first read the synopsis of this book. John Terraine is a widely respected author of British military history, whose book &quot;Douglas Haig: The Educated Soldier&quot; set the tone for a new perspective on the First World War. Terraine clearly has nothing but admiration for the soldiers who fought it out in the trenches of France and Flanders, but this account is a challenge to the commonly held view that the Generals of the time were &quot;reactionary bunglers&quot; at best, and &quot;callous, uncaring butchers&quot; at worst. Terraine's account demonstrates that this was certainly not the case.Allied strategy and tactics did evolve, and the main proponents of this were the British, the first to utilise tanks in warfare. It is clear that the key to the final Allied success was in the initial resistance to the German Spring Offensive. The Allied line may have been stretched, but it was by no means broken.Terraine's opinion on the Versailles settlement is also interesting. According to him, the peace failed not because it was too punitive, but because it was neither punitive enough, not moderate enough. It was an ineffective go-between which left too many issues unaddressed. In all, it was hardly a reward which reflected the heroic actions of the soldiers on the ground.An excellent read."},{"Title":"Cassell Military Classics: To Win A War: 1918 The Year Of Victory","review":"Like all John Terraine's books this account of the fighting during the last year of the First World War, first published in 1978, is extremely well researched and written with pace and style. It is also very controversial.The pride that men took in the winning of the war, and the admiration they displayed for Field-Marshal Haig in particular was soon dispelled. The 'War Memoirs' of David Lloyd George, and Winston Churchill's 'Great Crisis' cast doubt on the idea that Haig was a master strategist, and people began to think that another, less bloody and less destructive, way of winning the war might have been found. Specifically, that Haig's concentration on the Western Front was a tragic mistake, with incalculable consequences. More effort should have been devoted to knocking away the 'props' - the minor countries liked Bulgaria and Turkey which supported the German and Austrian 'underbelly.' Fuller and other military writers propagated the idea that the generals could have made more use of the tank. The works of the war poets and the prose of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves enjoyed considerable popularity. Haig came to be regarded as a butcher. The idea also got about, in Germany and elsewhere, that the British had not really won the war at all. The Nazis believed that the German Army had not been defeated, but 'stabbed in the back'. In the early 1930s the Oxford Union voted in favour of a pacifist motion. The idea that the Great War as a whole was simply 'pointless', the sacrifice 'futile' and 1918 one last miserable chapter in a vast incomprehensible waste of life, was widely accepted.It was Terraine's mission to revise this revisionism; and in this book he attempted to explode, in particular, the myths about 1918. To my mind he demonstrates very well that 1918 was a year of victory, and that the War did not simply wind down. During the period between July and November 1918, the British Army won a remarkable series of victories. Led by Haig, it played a major role in driving the Germans back from their line of furthest advance, in breaking the so-called Hindenberg line, in pushing the Germans almost as far as the German frontier and breaking their morale. Terraine's maps alone would be enough to prove that point; and the tank played a very minor part in this fighting. Moreover, I think his thesis that the Western Front was the only one that mattered, or could matter, is also made out.However, it is much more debatable whether the morale of the German Army would have collapsed anyway, in view of what Terraine himself tells us about events in Germany itself; and likewise whether British and French attrition in 1915, 1916 and 1917 played a major role in the victory of 1918(an important part of Terraine's defence of Haig). Likewise, it is open to doubt whether the British public have ever been brought to accept that the slaughter was all worthwhile. The scars ran too deep for that, I think."},{"Title":"Cassell Military Classics: To Win A War: 1918 The Year Of Victory","review":"Good overall history of the last 100 days on the Western Front. Terraine is a man of many prejudices. Particulary against Prime Minister David Llyod George. The author is very much a proponent of General Haig and his policies of war by attrition. Per Terraine that is the only way either side could win on the Western Front. Alot of other historians would differ. But the tecnological innovations, like the tank and airplanes, were so new and in such an infancy stage to allow a strategic victory via technology.When describing the larger arena Mr. Terraine does a fantastic job. His descent to divisional, regimental, company actions were for me impossible to follow. Maybe British readers would have an easier time.While reading this book I couln't help but comparing this book to Alan Palmer's \\"Victory 1918\\". Palmer's book takes a much broader view of the last year of the war, including all the other fronts. For me Palmer's book is a much better read and more interesting.Later generations have forgotten what a huge undertaking World War I was. John Terraine has written a number of other books about World War I. Outside of his prejudice against even talking about the other fronts I rate him quite high. His work is a must read if you want to study WWI or the Great War as it was rightly named."},{"Title":"Cassell Military Classics: To Win A War: 1918 The Year Of Victory","review":"Terraine, although firmly belonging to the unfashionable &quot;Haig was right&quot; school, produced an informative and exhaustive study of the little known last few months of the First World War. At times overly detailed with battlefield information, and laboured with the axiom that victory in the First World War was due purely to the steady attrition of the German forces, the text effectively details the evolution of tactics in the last stages of the war. Other historians and commentators, such as Basil Liddell Hart or Denis Winter, would interpret the events entirely differently but Terraine shows remarkable erudition in arguing the alternative. Read in conjunction with the works of Martin Middlebrook, especially Middlebrook's work on the German offensives of early 1918, Terraine's book illuminates how the last months of the Great War were fought in the West. Thoroughly recommended for the history buff."},{"Title":"COLOR ATLAS OF COSMETIC OCULOFACIAL SURGERY","review":"An excellent book, easy to read, important points appropriately high-lighted, pictures with clear anatomy.

So, overall, this is actually an encouraging and touching book, though still with great sadness (I won't tell you how it ends).

Not only does it give the storyteller an idea what is going on in the real word, but it also presents a large section on each &quot;monster&quot; type such that a storyteller can bring all the flavor of Vampire, or Werewolf into a Hunters game. Skeptic just have to remeber one thing. This game was written from the point of view that these humans no know thing about the Kindred, the Wolves or the Ghosts. Therefore, on the surface it will look like a &quot;different&quot; game. But all it takes is a creative storyteller to make everything link together."},{"Title":"Hunter Storytellers Companion/Screen (Hunter the Reckoning RPG)","review":"The Comendium contains introducing desciptions of Hunter's antagonists. It's not bad but definitely too little for an own book, even a compendium. It should rather be a chapter in a bigger publication. If you have knowledge about Vampire, Werewolf or Mage you don't need it."},{"Title":"Churchill's Rhetoric and Political Discourse (Exxon Education Foundation Series on Rhetoric and Political Discourse)","review":"This book is unique because, for the first time, Churchill's prose style is analyzed in detail, allowing readers to understand how Churchill's mind worked when he put pen to paper. The book's non-academic writing makes it easy to follow the author's keep insights into Churchill's technique and how he developed his special writing skills. You'll be a better writer if you pay careful attention while reading this book. What better reward can you require?"},{"Title":"Searchers: A true story","review":"Wow! What an incredible story Searchers tells. I wondered after reading it if it was Aliens that had abducted the Hesses or our own military doing desert warfare exercises in the Mojave. Could the \\"UFOs\\" be hover aircraft suited to travel above sand? The \\"red eyes\\" night vision goggles? And the \\"Aliens\\" soldiers in modern warfare, psy ops gas masks? Whatever it was that happened to Steve and Dawn Hess that night, it scared me for weeks."},{"Title":"Searchers: A true story","review":"Over the years just a handful of UFO books have been able to creep forth and poke their icy, boney fingers into the soft underbelly of the deepest subconscious fears of the public, scaring the bejeepers out of millions of readers.Whitely Strieber's COMMUNION, for example, seemed honest and authentic, and therefore exceedingly unsettling and creepy. John Mack's ABDUCTION was more scholarly and clinical, but because it was the work of a respected Harvard psychiatrist, it probably made even hardened skeptics think: \\"Gulp! I wonder if something like this could really be happening?\\"But there is one book of UFO alien abduction I have read over the years which delivered that feeling of quesy fright like none other. This is a much more obscure book -- it's SEARCHERS: A TRUE STORY OF ALIEN ABDUCTION by RON FELBER.An interesting aspects of this book is that Felber is an outsider to Ufology. Unlike Strieber, Bud Hopkins, David Jacobs and others who made careers and reputations by focusing on alien abduction topics, Felber is a mainstream writer and businessman. He has produced several books of fiction and nonfiction. But \\"Searchers\\" is his only work in the UFO genre. He appears to have written it only because a tip from an associate pointed his way to an extraordinary story that Felber found so compelling he had to write about it.The book describes a sizzling night of terror as experienced by an ordinary middle class California couple, Steve and Dawn Hess. It was 1989 when the Hesses decided to head out to the Mojave Desert for a camping trip. Upon arriving and setting up camp in the middle of nowhere, the isolated couple began to see strange globes of light in the sky. They were unnerved but tried to explain them away in all the common ways. But then, events rapidly escalated to an profoundly frightening degree.The \\"lights\\" moved toward their camp. Steve and Dawn Hess retreat to hide in their camper, only to be accosted by an array of eerie alien beings who surround them, look into their camper window, and seem intensely bent upon getting at them and probing every aspect of their beings. They perform devastating psychological invasions of their minds - at times, the couple is surrounded by dozens of bizarre alien manifestations of wide variety.Dawn Hess described it this way:\\"They (the aliens) wanted everything we had ... everything ...our minds, our bodies, even our souls, I think. It was like they drew it out of us with a syringe ... every molecule. And it was painful and I thought we were going to die, or already had died and were being tortured in hell.\\"After enduring a night of this hell, the Hesses returned to their normal lives and jobs, but all was not well with them. Nightmares, fears, anxieties, post-traumatic stress - everything that had happened to them had shattered their sense of what it means to be a normal human being.It's a remarkable story, and in the hands of an extremely skilled writer - Felber holds a Ph.D. in Art and Letters - the result is one of the most terrifying books on alien abduction ever written."},{"Title":"Searchers: A true story","review":"This book seriously blew me away and is to date one of the most complex and detailed account of human encounters with extra terrestrials that I've ever read. I've been interested in the subject since grade school, scarring myself into long sleepless nights and what not, but haven't recently read anything with the same caliber of emotion, suspense, and good, true? story telling. The things that happened to this couple will shock and amaze you and even scare the bravest readers. I heard that the couple involved was about to do media interviews and bring more press for this book, but before it was published they withdrew their story because the Mormon church had forced them to or be banished from the church. Crazy yeah. A great read whether you're into this kind of stuff or not. C'mon, expand your mind a little."},{"Title":"Reader's Digest Scenic Wonders of America","review":"If you are planning a trip in the United States, this is your book. Most areas of the country are covered. The chief attraction in a region, e.g. Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes, is covered in detail, followed by paragraph-or-so sketches of 15-20 other sites within traveling distance of the main attraction. Good color photos attend the main attraction and some, but not all, of the secondary attractions are also photographed.The book is well-organized and capably written. I have planned numerous trips using this book as a main reference. Had I not had access to the book, my girlfriend and I would have missed a great many interesting, beautiful, and educational places in this great land of ours.Even though the book is now dated a bit, most of the listed attractions are natural ones, and so the age of the book is irrelevant to a great degree.

Very happy about this purchase."},{"Title":"Census and Identity: The Politics of Race, Ethnicity, and Language in National Censuses (New Perspectives on Anthropological and Social Demography)","review":"Many social scientists recognize self identity as a precious aspect of individuality, but most social scientists are interested in generalizing, hence the stuggle to conceptualize, define and measure the group identity. There are good legal and political reasons for categorizing people, how else for example could you measure the effects of a genocide--or commit it for that matter. The Nazis and the analysts who attempted to measure the atocities of the Nazis used administrative records with information about ethnicity and religion to do their jobs.CENSUS AND IDENTITY is a nice compendium of essays about the attempts of governments around the world to collect and use information about race, language, and ethnicity in censuses. David Kertzer and Dominique Arel provide an overview of the book in which they state, &quot;identity is a constructed thing and it is constructed over time and with a shifting awareness of values and meaning attached to certain categories, some of which are more meaningful than others.&quot;Melissa Nobles' essay, &quot;Racial categorization and the censuses&quot; focuses on two large census efforts--Brazil and the United States. Both countries have attempted over the past two hundred years to define and measure race with mixed results.Calvin Goldscheider compares the efforts of Israel, Canada, and the United States to categorize ethnicity in censuses. The Israeli government stresses religion, while the U.S. government eschews it.Dominique Arel's essay, &quot;Language categories in censuses..&quot; covers the efforts of several countries to define and measure language fluency. Just when does one become fluent in a language. Professor Higgins told Eliza Doolittle that most English ladies could not speak English!Alain Blum discusses the trials of the French in his essay, &quot;Resistance to identity categorization in France.&quot; Seems the Algerian descent folks have a different idea of what it means to be French.Peter Uvin's essay, &quot;On counting, categorizing, and violence in Burundi and Rwanda&quot; is a chilling example of ethnic identification gone wrong. How did the Tutsis and Hutus know who to kill? Population exchanges between the two countries seemed to be the only way to avoid additional killing. But who just who was what and how their &quot;papers&quot; were created became a nightmare.My favorite essay was written by David Abramson, &quot; Identity counts: the Soviet legacy and the census in Uzbekistan.&quot; Just what is a Tajik anyway, and when is a Tajik really an Uzbek? Some funny things happened in the censuses taken over several decades as the size of the population of Tajiks and Uzbeks changed rather dramatically. While one side pointed at the data and said it was a sure sign of genocide, social scientists aren't so sure. Sometimes people change their &quot;official&quot; identities when the census taker comes knocking on the door.This is a wonderful set of essays for anyone who is interested in the difficulties associated with identifying and measuring &quot;ethnic&quot; groups and what happens to them."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Country Soul: Stories Served Up Country-style and Straight the Heart (Chicken Soup for the Soul)","review":"Great book, loved all of the stories.

Marina first tells the evident -- that corporations are not that benevolent now as they used to be (well, if you consider their old state as 'benevolence', which is a completely separate discussion, of course) and then tries to prove that this is how it is supposed to be. Well, let see, if somebody has an illness and it is not cured, the person dies. That's natural. But you can try to cure it, right? Not just state that dying is natural? So, where is the cure? Marina does not have it. Suggestions of portable life insurance and more tax dollars for retraining may be a pain killer at some time -- albeit not very powerful -- but hardly a cure."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book.

An absolute must!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book captured my almost 3 year old at the local library. A hundred or so readings later, he had completely memorized the text, complete with play acting and characterizations of the various opposites presented. The book is beautifully and colorfully illustrated, with a simple rhytmic text pairing opposites (such as ROAR and Squeek, clean and slimy, etc.).

The words are few, and go well together with quick rhyming and therefore good for early reading.Most of all, it is fun!

We have our own sound effects for each page of opposites, and both kids try to imitate us (with our daughter doing a rather frightening \\"roar\\"). Each page features a series of opposites, such as \\"Dinosaur roar...dinosaur squeak\\". Finally the book ends with the dinosaurs having an excellent lunch. The pictures are colorful and expressive. However, it is the one book with a picture that I find quite disturbing - the meek dinosaur is cringing on its page, with the shadow of a bigger dinosaur clearly baring its teeth, leading to the conclusion the meek dinosaur is about to become lunch, and I find that a little scary.

The illustrations and concepts are excellent, but this version that I ordered from Amazon is poorly constructed. I wouldn't call it a board book as much as a think card book.

If you want a vertually indistructable text that they will sit still and listen to, or read themselves....start clicking that mouse. I plan to buy another half dozen or more before the year is out. What better gift than that of reading to a small child!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Ah. The perpetual love youngsters have for dinosaurs. It's one of those constants on which we can all rely. No matter what goes on in the world, whether it be floods, famines, or the everyday trials of ordinary life, one thing is for certain. As long as there are children and as long as books about dinosaurs exist, the two will be perpetually and inexplicably linked. Now I've actually not read that many really interesting dinosaur books in my day. There's the obligatory, \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\", by Jane Yolen and (of course) \\"Dinotopia\\", but for all the enjoyment these scaly reptiles engender, there are relatively few well-written preschool aged books about them. Enter \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\", stage right. The books admittedly fails to do some of the basic dinosaur book duties. It does not name each and every terrible lizard with its Latin moniker. Just the same, the book is a good early introduction into the world of reading. Kids interested in it will find themselves immersed in a dinosaur laden universe that fulfills all their dino-related needs. And adults will not be bored. Nuff said.\\"Dinosaur Roar!\\" is best described as a book of dino opposites. In it, we see one dino doing one thing and a very different dino doing another. It begins with \\"Dinosaur roar, dinosaur squeak\\" and continues on another two pages with \\"dinosaur fierce, dinosaur meek\\". Different reptiles react in different ways. On some pages, sharp toothed gleeful fellows attempt to munch on their neighbors while on others, sweet faced tiny creatures flee, scurry, to do whatsoever the words on the page say. In the end, it all culminates with several pages worth of dinosaurs eating their favorite foods. The herbivores nosh on trees and leafy greens while the carnivores (for the sake of keeping the rating of this book a sweet G) gnaw on large white tendon-less bones as if they were just oversized dogs. The book shows a vast variety of different dinosaur species without skimping. It's an enjoyable thing to page through. Of course, the fact that none of these dinos are ever named really is a problem. If a child points to a picture of a feathered dinosaur and asks the parent what the name of it is, that adult may find themselves stumbling (was it aperdyterix or apordacturux or...?). \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\", solved this problem by surreptitiously placing the names of each and every animal somewhere on the page that featured them, giving both adults AND their children a good scientific lesson. \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\"? Not so much.Still, the pictures are pleasant to the eye. Paul Stickland uses a massive array of incredibly colorful watercolors to their greatest advantage here. Though the pictures do contain some elements of cartoons, they're also really lovely to look at. You have mucky greens, sly peach/purple/blues, pastels of pink and navy, and well-scaled oranges. Now the meateaters are a scary crew, true. But kids love that kind of stuff. As long as a book isn't showing a dinosaur literally tearing another one of its fellows into a bloody pulp then kids love the threat the massive t-rexes and velociraptors engender.In the end, I probably would still recommend, \\"How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?\\" over \\"Dinosaur Roar!\\", but there's no reason in the world why you shouldn't take a good long look at the both of them. For most parents, even the most sloppily written piece of trash starts to look good as long as it contains a dino or two. Here, we have a well-written book with amazing artwork and a great use of rhyming words. There's little to dislike about this book and a whole lot to love. Be sure to check it out today."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"As a mom of two boys-(ages 20 months and 32 months) this book has been a hit since the day I purchased it. The bright colored pictures and sounds of the dinosaurs really hold the interest of my children. Both of my children continue to request this book to be read to them again and again...

In the past year, he has read it a ton, but he still likes to go through it every few nights. A couple months ago, we came across a pop-up version. It has the same words (Dinosaur roar, dinosaur squeak, etc...), but the dinosaurs are pop-up and each pop-up does something when you open/close the page. For example, one dino has his tongue go in and out, another lifts a boulder with his feet. The pop-up action makes this somewhat short book last much longer, as the kids move the dinos to make them 'do stuff.'You can't go wrong with either one, but I'd search out the pop-up version for an even more enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Our baby loved this book from when she was like 5 months old. It has great contrasty illustrations, not too much text, and you can test your acting abilities as you make \\"dinosaur fat\\" and \\"dinosaur tiny\\" voices."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"I have two little boys, 3.5 and 1.5, and they both LOVE this book. I have read it so much that my older has it memorized and reads it to the younger one."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"i bought this book for my just turned 3 year old son, because of his latest fascination with dinosaurs. he had the book memorized the day after he got it. he loves all the different dinosaurs, the colors and pictures are wonderful. he loves the rhyming and the opposites. his favorite is dinosaur fierce which he says so fiercely himself!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Vivid illustrations. Short and sweet. Hard, sturdy book. Bought it for 2 year old twin boys and they have fun telling us whether the dino is a meat eater or plant eater by looking at their teeth. If your kid loves dinosaurs I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My two-year-old son likes dinosaurs, and this one is a favorite of his. The book is filled with rhyming opposites that lend themselves to a dramatic reading. (My son loves to 'roar' when the dinosaur 'roars.') I would recommend it for one- and two-year-olds.Though it has lots of pictures of dinosaurs, the pictures are not individually labelled. (I am not sure if the dinosaurs in the book are even modelled on real dinosaurs.) Therefore, the child is not going to learn any facts about dinosaurs, other than they varied greatly."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My 22 month old doesn't sit sit for long. He's just always running to the next object for exploration. So, getting him to sit still for reading is a challenge. BUT, he LOVES Dinosaur Roar. The colorful illustations, the beauty of the painted images, the catchy lyrics (emphasized when reading, of course) all hold his attention--so that we can Almost finish the book before he runs off. The juxtaposition of opposites (small and huge, for example) help us teach him concepts. GREAT book!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"We first found this book at the library, had to renew several times. Then I found it on line. My 2yr. old grandson will not take a nap unless we read him this book. He really loves the pictures especially the \\" messy dinosaur\\"."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book captivates with it's large vibrant illustrations of dinosaurs. My 17 month old loves looking at the pictures while I read it. In my opinion, it is the best illustrated board book I have ever seen."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"I bought this book for my 4yo, but my 2yo enjoys it way more! She &quot;reads&quot; every page with us! And the voices she uses are great too!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book is simply delightful. I was sitting in the doctor's office and my 16-month-old son was having trouble leaving the holiday decorations alone. I tried to distract him with the stack of books on the bottom shelf of the magazine rack. I was amazed on how interested he was in this book. Most of the time when I tried to read him a book he never had the time to sit long enough. I read it to him 3 times that day and he just loved it. He roared right along with every picture. I would highly recomend this book for any child, even as young as age 1. I plan to buy a copy for him."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Here is a great dinosaur book for the 2-4 year old. My almost 3 year old son loved this one so much that after repeated (and I mean many many many) check outs from the library, we've finally added it to our permanent collection. The illustrations are bright and well done, realistic enough for the three year old imagination, but not scary enough to frighten the parents. This is a book that you can co-read with your child as they (and you) will quickly memorize the short observational phrases on each page."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My son loves this book and asks for it to be read again and again until we beg for another book!! He loves the pictures and will say parts of the book as he is playing! Love it!!!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This is a small board book that features some nifty dinosaur illustrations accompanied by some simple rhymes.

The pictures are wonderful and the copy is fun to read together. My boys love to shout, \\"Dinosaur roar!\\" My youngest still reads it regularly.

He especially likes the dinos that look like they're smiling -- &quot;happy dinos&quot; he calls 'em. It's a good vocabulary builder too with lots of antonyms (strong, weak; fast, slow; clean, slimy; fierce, meek; etc.)"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"The dinosaurs in this book are friendly and cute. The pictures work well with the writing. The almost repetitive nature of this book make it easy for children to remember and read the book themselves.My son loves this book. Even now whenever he sees something dinosaur, he'll say &quot;Roar&quot;!There are so many books for children out there, it's hard for me to say one is a must have over the other. However, this is one that children will love. I found it well worth the money we spent on it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"We found this book at a library on vacation. After we came home, my daughter begged me to get it for her. The rhythmic text is fun to read and the illustrations are so GREAT. It has even captured the attention of my 'never still' 13 month old."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"A wonderful way to learn about opposites and enjoy dinosaurs! This has been a favorite book of ours for the past two years. We recently moved to Germany and could only take a few things with us--this was one of the books we chose to take along. For over 1 1/2 years this was the only book my youngest son would sit still for and he still loves it. (Our five year-old enjoys &quot;reading&quot; it to him.)"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This is one of my favorite read-aloud, rhyming board books. It teaches opposites, the colors are vibrant, and the characters are adorable. All 3 of my kids loved it as toddlers and now I read it to the Mommy & Me toddler classes that I teach."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My daughter is 2 and a half and she loves books. Her previous collection was embarrassing as the bindings were falling apart and the corners were all destroyed. It's not that she destroys them on purpose, but when she finds a board book that she loves, it goes with her everywhere: friends houses, restaurants, car rides, doctor visits, etc. Needless to say it was time to update her book collection and I took a few titles that were age appropriate according to Parents Magazine, and \\"Dinosaur ROAR!\\" is one of her new ones. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT! She loved it when she unwrapped it for Christmas and doesn't let it rest lol. It's become her new companion. She loves the pictures, the colors, and asks me to read it to her at least once a day. So if you're looking for a book that your toddler will like, I definitely recommend this one since my daughter carries it along now where ever she goes :)"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This was just ok. Art could have been better. The kids (3 & 5) who love dinosaurs and have a nice collection of books haven't picked up the book since the first time they read it. I prefer the books with more info.So do the kids--even the little one. Money wasted for me. Maybe it's ok for little ones who haven't been in to dinos for some time."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book was given to me when I was pregnant with my first child 10 years ago and I somehow lost it along the way. Just bought it again for my 3rd son (turning 2 in Sept 2010) and he loves it just as much as my first 2 sons. It is one of the best children's books ever. I enjoy reading it as much as my kids enjoy hearing it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My kids have all loved this book. We have 5. When our little ones choose books to read this book is always among the ones they choose. Our copy has been taped multiple times but is falling apart again. It will not last long enough for our 1 year old to fully enjoy it. I guess it is time to get a new copy."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Dinosaur Roar! is a wonderful book for children. It's perfect for children ready to memorized stories. It is bright and delightful. I love to buy it for new parents."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This is a fun children's book. My grand daughter, when a toddler, loved it as I read the book with great emphasis on the words and used hand motions. Now that she is older, she can read it herself and still enjoys it. I ordered this copy for my as yet unborn great niece's library."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This is a great book to introduce kids to simple words and concepts. Colorful dinosaurs illustrate \\"fierce\\" and \\"Meek\\" or \\"short\\" and \\"long.\\" Smaller children will love the pictures while older toddlers and preschoolers will laugh at the story and may even recognize some of the simple words."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This board book has beautiful pictures and my daughter loves the rhythmic sentences. This was the first dinosaur book I bought her and she has since become fascinated with dinosaurs! She was 2 yrs old when I bought it for her, now that she is 3 1/2 yrs old she loves to read it to her little cousin!I also highly recommend the \\"How do Dinosaurs...\\" series, especially \\"...say Goodnight, Play with Their Friends, and Clean Their Room."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"Got this as a gift for my new son. Lot's of fun to read and make the dinosaur sounds. OK, so I'm a big kid. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This was a great book for beginner readers who love dinosaurs. There are only a few words per page and my three year old already has them memorized. We really liked the pictures and it has held up well to daily readings!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book is one that is frequently chosen to be read aloud in our house. My sons both love it. It would be great for anyone that loves dinosaurs, as there are all kinds. There are no official names for these dinosaurs, as it is just a simple book. There are many adjectives, and opposite words used to describe the different characteristics of the dinosaurs. It is great fun to \\"Roar\\" and \\"squeak\\" with one's voice when reading. My son, after reading, wanted to read it back to me, which I was thrilled about, as he is a beginner reader. I would highly recommend it on many levels, but above all, for the love of reading I see it bring about in children."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"While the language in this book is a bit simplistic, the illustrations and layout are great. My son instantly fell in love with this book when he got it for his second birthday and now that he is three he still wants to bring it to school with him sometimes. In fact this is the first book that my son ever learned any new words from. He still quotes from it all the time. If you have a dinosaur lover, give his this book"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"The pictures in this book are as colorful and bright as you expect from the Sticklands, but it isn't nearly as fun to read and reread as &quot;Ten Terrible Dinosaurs&quot;. It's a book of opposites, and does have some different word choices than most opposites books but it wouldn't be my first recommendation of the Stickland's books."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This book is terrific. The rhythm gets my ten month old daughter rockin' as we read the book. She has a stuffed dinosaur that looks just like one of the great drawings and the two together amaze her. The pictures in this book are wonderful - clear, colorful and illustrate the text wonderfully. I highly recommend this book -- but be ready for the dinosaur invasion this will unleash in your home!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"I bought this book for my three year old, who loved it and because of the short, rhyming text was able to learn it off by heart. It soon became a favourite with my one year old too, who would squeal in delight at the gorgeous colourful dinosaurs, particularly his favourite, &quot;dinosaur slimy&quot;. I never get tired of reading this book with the boys. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"At first I thought this book was too simple for my 3 year old daughter, but she can't get enough of it. She loves the cute dinosaurs and she loves to read along since she's memorized it. I like it for when I'm too tired to read a longer book and I love the illustrations."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"A little on the pricey side, but my niece and nephew went through the book over and over again. I think they must have like it."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"This is one of those rhythmic, rhyming, funny books with emphasis on adjectives, this time describing the characteristics of brightly-colored, extremely funny dinosaurs. Unlike Byron Barton'sDinosaurs, Dinosaurs, this one emphasizes humor rather than scientific accuracy, it's unclear which historical beasts these animals represent. Their descriptions are simpler, presented in predictable, rhythmic text: \\"dinosaur sweet, dinosaur grumpy, dinosaur spiky, and dinosaur lumpy.\\" On the final page the carnivores are depicted gnawing on bones, and the herbivores devouring trees, while a smiling tyrannasaur munches on the letters.This is a fast read, with all the characteristics that make it perfect for toddlers who require humor, rhythm, predictability, and a short attention span. It's perfect for one-on-one reading or for a group. Available in paperback or board book format."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Roar","review":"My son is 4 and on the Autism Spectrum. He LOVES this book! We got it from his Scholastic Book Club. Amazing pictures and simple to understand! Great for learning/discussing opposites and adjectives."},{"Title":"TruCluster Server Handbook (HP Technologies)","review":"No stone left unturned!

In short- lot's and lots of goodies!"},{"Title":"TruCluster Server Handbook (HP Technologies)","review":"The book covers every aspect of TruCluster admin, from planning to running updates.

It is a MUST read if you want a life changing experience that brings you closer to God and a self-assessment to see how strong your own faith is."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Miss Kim has remarkable faith and she lightens the darkness wherever she is. I have read better constructed books of this kind, but the story is remarkable in her ability to reach people in spite of the bleakest of conditions."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Book grabs your attention from the start. Enjoyed reading it, but some parts were slow. I love biography books so this one was enjoyable"},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Highly recommended reading for Christians in this time and hour with all the unrest we have world wide. It will increase your hunger to walk in the path of righteousness and to increase your knowledge of who the Great I Am is through prayer and reading of His Word. Reading of God's sustaining power during trials , tribulations, and persecutions through the life of Ahn Ei Sook and the glory of Jesus is truly seen throughout her testimony. Very inspirational reading."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"I am Korean and I've read this book 1976 in Japan and I was new born Christian, after I finished this book made me realized God is very actively involved with those who seeks him. When I came to USA I went to see Mrs. Ann (author of this book)in her church in Los Angeles and took a picture with her! I believe this book is very difficult book to read if you are Japaneses, because most of Japanese still refuse to accept what Japanese army did to Korea, China and other Asian countries, majority of Japanese denied massacre and most of young generation never heard about it. This book is like reading -ACTS- in a Bible, dead person comes back to life, escape from jail. If you have a doubt about God read this book. I am reading again 4th time (in Japanese 609 pages) and still inspire me. I recommend this book for all Christian or who is seeking the God."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"To any Christian this story will be uplifting and powerful. As a Korean Christian at the dawn of WWII, Esther Ahn (Kim) received a powerful and direct word from God that she was to warn the Japanese that God's wrath would be poured upon them if they did not repent of their idol worship and turn to the one true God. She took that word seriously and became a zealot for Jesus Christ.Korea was under the control of the Japanese and Christianity in any form was not tolerated. This book covers about a six year period of which Esther spent in the depths of prison enduring hardship and brutality that is often not survived. But survival was of little concern for this woman. Evangelism at any cost was her only motivation.She was in the hands of God throughout her ordeal. As a person there were times when she prayed to 'just go home' to be with the Lord but that was not in His plan. Most importantly, when God sent still another task, or whenher inhumane treatment had her to the point of death, she obeyed. She obeyed!The souls that were added to the kingdom of Heaven due to her actions as a political prisoner can never be counted.She truly has encounters with God Almighty on a personal level during these times. As a believer, we long to have such a relationship with Jesus Christ. As a believer, we can!"},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"This book is very intriguing because it is based on a real life story of a woman who thought that she was weakbut found incredible strength in God.It highlights the Mercy of God even in the worst of circumstances."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Great book,It's deep, with a great true story.Though I wish it gave explanation why she named herself Esther."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Let me begin by saying that I loved this book. It is honestly one of the most amazing books I have EVER read, almost as good as \\"Evidence Not Seen!\\"Miss Ahn's faith was so strong throughout her story; she was truly loved and used by the Lord. He performed miracle after miracle for her! And her sincere, passionate love for our God brought me to tears a number of times. It was also convicting. Can you imagine not only being willing to lay down your life for God, but to actually DESIRE to? She did!And what an AWESOME ALMIGHTY GOD! Jehovah is wonderful! He protected Ahn, He provided her with the things she needed, He gave her young Christian companions, and He gave her the privilege of being His witness to hundreds of people.The style of writing was so poetic as well. Her descriptions of her quiet time with God, or the treatment of the prisoners was written in a beautiful way, giving a vivid picture to her readers.Please read this book. It is so beautiful and it will certainly inspire and touch you."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"I adore this story. It is so encouraging and such a testimony of what God can do.

Too much dwelling on her thoughts and it becomes boringpc"},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"I would just like to caution those who are interested in purchasing this book that it contains events such as people believing they have received messages from God."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Verse 4:16 in the book of Esther provides the backdrop of a modern-day Esther who went to Japan to warn the Japanese against their idol/shrine worship. She had a heart for the Japanese people to bring them to a knowledge of Jesus Christ, but was instead thrown into prison because she refused to worship idols. Like a modern-day Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, she refused to bow to the shrine worship and was fully prepared to die. She lived by faith, prayer and leaning on Jesus during her long ordeal, and even though she was starved and tortured and ill, as it was for Daniel in the lion's den, God stopped the mouths and hands of her worse enemies in miraculous ways. She became a testimony to those in the prison and won many to Christ, from crazed murderers, to cruel prison guards, to a former geisha who became a missionary in the mountains. There were many moments of despair and longing for the deliverance of death, and Esther bemoans her weakness and hunger, and this all shows that she is weak, but that God is strong, with His strength made perfect through our weaknesses. All her trials and tribulations showed her how Jesus is faithful and never left her and finally delivered her when she was freed at the end of the war and escaped the Communists to South Korea. Her mother was a remarkable person, having led Esther to the LORD and kept her faith providing Esther with encouragement and prayer. This book will strengthen your faith and encourage you also when things get tough and you learn to lean on the everlasting arms. It is also hard to put down and my daughter read it all the way through in a day."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Although it has been years since reading the book, several impressions still remain.One was the way scripture constantly came out in Esther Ahn's life. It was very real. Some readers, in their reading of fiction, may seek adventure and plot--this book has it in its recounting of imprisonment and persecution of a Christian in Korea--but seeing how the Word comes to her mind all the time, seeing how her life was built on this, is what made me love the book.And the thing that hit me the most was: when I finished reading the book, I felt strongly: I WANT TO MEET HER MOTHER! Her mother wasn't one of the main characters in the book, but it was the mother who instilled in Esther Ahn her unshakable confidence in the Word and lifestyle of constant reference to it.\\"I have never seen anything like this before,\\" the senior officer, who was a Korean, said. \\"The daughter is great. The mother is greater.\\""},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"In the face of the most brutal treatment and systematic persecution by her Japanese captors during WWII, Esther Kim puts into action the love of God that overcomes anguish, fear and incomprehensible evil. This is one of the most moving books I've ever read and was instrumental in my own personal search for a God who is real and who makes a difference."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Some may think that reading a book about persecution is depressing, showing them a side of life that they hope to avoid. This book, though it describes hardships, leaves the reader feeling inspired. Esther describes her struggle to submit to God's will, and through her humility, the love God is clearly shining through her life.This book is also a good source to learn about the history and therefore present relations between Korea and Japan."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"The book \\"If I Perish\\" by Esther Ahn Kim of Korea challenged me many ways in my spiritual life, like her courage in the face of indescribable pain and suffering, and her faith in the one true God.Japan controls Korea, and Ahn Ei Sook (her Korean name) refuses to bow down to the invader's shrines. After that, she is forced to flee for her life. Hunted by the Japanese, she takes refuge wherever she can find it. She goes to Japan in accordance with God's message and tells Imperial Japan that God will punish her for her wickedness. She is thrown in prison, and for the next years she prepares to die. She witnesses to the jailers and prisoners and tells them what God has done for her. Will this brave little women break because of the Japanese's torture? Will she give up her faith in the one true God?This book is filled with descriptive adjectives and terrific verbs. The author's writing style makes you picture the people and places that she is describing. I would highly recommend this book for people of all ages."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this biography. The story compells the reader to turn the next page. It is full of excellent spiritual lessons for the reader to apply in their own life. Her courage, determination, and commitment to the Lord are inspiring."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"What a well written an awesome testimony of God Almighty. As on e reads this biographical collection one can clearly see the Hand of God in this faithful woman's life. We,in this current age, especially in the USA, can not really imagine what it means to stand for one's faith and be persecuted for it. After reading this account one can truly see that our God is the 'God of the Impossible' and His ways are so above ours. What an encouraging book.

It is worth five stars."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Ahn Ei Sook was a living testimony of what a disciplined, prepared and faithful follower of Christ looks like. Her ongoing determination to gain control over her flesh, and also her courage in a time of extreme persecution made this book riveting to read and a true inspiration. The historical account of this time period (Japan and Korea 1939-1945) was also fascinating to read from an eyewitness account. This book was required reading for me, but how grateful I was to have the opportunity to glimpse this remarkable life. Since this book reads very much like a fiction, I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact a very true and inspiring story."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"I reviewed Francis Chan's latest book \\"Forgotten God: Reversing Our Tragic Neglect of the Holy Spirit\\" this past fall. In this book he cites a Korean Christian woman who spent five years in Japanese prisons during WWII because she refused to worship Japanese shrines (which was a law at that time.) He described how this woman, knowing she would be going to prison in the near future, memorized several books of the Bible and ate rotten food in order to prepare herself for the harsh realities of prison.Let me just restate that: She ate ROTTEN food BEFORE she was ever put in prison!!!No one made her.She did it out of her own choosing.To prepare.Wow...I was intrigued by this story of perseverance and faith, so I check out Esther Ahn Kim's autobiography \\"If I Perish.\\" Overall, I really enjoyed reading about this woman's life. I have to admit that halfway through it I shook my head and said \\"this woman can't be real.\\" She was so good. Her compassionate reactions to the persecution of her jailers and fellow prisoners is amazing. Her bravery is inspiring.It was a great book to read, albeit hard sometimes. It was awful reading about the Japanese cruelty to the Korean Christian prisoners. Yet it was a bold testimony of having undying faith for a God that will never go back on His promises."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"Wow, I couldn't put the book down. Another great testament to the grace of God and also His faithfulness. Another must for reading and also the church library."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"This book was amazing; I really felt as if I were present as Ms. Kim was giving her accounts & struggles. This is a wonderful faith builder for anyone who thinks they are going through ' hell' on earth."},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"\\"I would rather see a sermon than hear one anyday.\\" The words of this song came to mind as I read this wonderful story of Godly love in action. The study of doctrinal books often does little to create the kind of love that Jesus Himself demonstrated; that kind of love must flow through a yielded heart,outward to others. The author shares her story in a simple but profound way (similar to Corrie ten Boom's style)which makes for easy reading. There is a depth of truth in the pages though, that forces one to analyze his/her own life in terms of \\"How much am I willing to sacrifice myself so that Jesus' love can flow though me to others?\\"The stories she shares are fascinating and kept me reading chapter after chapter even though it was past my bedtime. I believe this book can be read to children to help them develop a compassionate heart and a thankful spirit. The stories of severe beatings are unpleasant but make for fruitful discussions about what Jesus went through and what many of His children endure for their faith. Inspirational stories that inspire our children to live with the faithfulness of a Daniel or a young Korean girl during WW2 persecution, are blessings we can give our children in this age of \\"me, myself and I.\\""},{"Title":"If I Perish","review":"This book is a very powerful story of one woman's journey--a simple, defiant choice which was in essence just being true to her heart and her God, to the supernatural adventures that ensued in the midst of WWII Korea and Japan.

Mother's, you might want to read it to them instead.The last chapter or maybe second to last chapter is rather graphic in what soldiers were doing at that time and so I read it to my daughters so I could skip those parts that I felt were too adult in content.

My son is now reading it and my wife is next in line. This book reminds me of the power of women and the unquenchable human spirit that is slumbering in all of us often brought to life by adversity.

His glowing review of the book seems to rate 5 stars, not one.I am a novice in this area, but still found the book to provide a sound and insightful treatment of the role of society (with its various religious beliefs) as it deals with criminal behavior. The book provides an excellent intellectual basis for Restorative Justice as well as offering numerous practical examples of how societies have dealt constructively with those who have gone astray.The book's message is elegantly presented with the readability needed by the lay person. Dr. Snyder has worked in the fields of religion and criminal justice for decades and we are fortunate that he has offered us his theological, sociological, and practical insights."},{"Title":"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Punishment","review":"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Punishment (Book Notes)T. Richard Snyder, the author of this first rate challenge to our nation's \\"spirit of punishment,\\" is a seminary professor/administrator who has also led a Master's degree education program for 18 years in Sing Sing prison. He argues persuausively that our treatment of offenders is fueled by our thirst for vengeance, and that addiction to \\"getting even\\" is \\"a cancer within the national culture that has the potential to destroy us\\" (p. 1).If the soul of a society can be measured by its prisons, as Dostoevsky claimed, then we have major work ahead to \\"convert\\" our thinking from vengeful punishment that aims to \\"get even,\\" and replace that with commitment to comprehensive healing and \\"holistic redemption.\\" Restorative justice will more readily reach our goal of a peaceable society than will the prevailing retributive justice.So what does the Protestant ethic and its theology have to do with this drive to punish rather than to rehabilitate? If one major value of this book is its challenge to our criminal justice system, the other major value is its answer to that question.Creation and redemption have been split apart. So have grace and nature. \\"Because of the strong emphasis upon the fall, original sin, and total depravity, it is difficult to find within Protestantism an affirmation of the beauty, goodness, and worth in all creation\\" (p. 12). Further, God's grace \\"is understood almost exclusively in individualistic, internalized, non-historical terms\\" (p. 12).It becomes easy, then, to split humanity apart as well, and draw a dividing line between superior and inferior persons, between those who have \\"fallen\\" and those who are \\"graced,\\" or between those who \\"broke a law\\" and deserve what they're getting and, on the other hand, those who have followed \\"the straight and narrow\\" and \\"deserve\\" to prosper. All that is to forget that the dividing line between good and evil runs through each person. The saying \\"so long as there's life, there's hope\\" is true only so long as \\"grace is present and at work within all of human experience\\" (p. 41).\\"Restorative justice alternatives\\" take up the second half of the book. Using a grant from the Association of Theological Schools that was funded by the Lilly Foundation, Snyder spent research time in both South Africa and Sweden. Restorative justice in both countries \\"emphasizes repairing all the injured parties, including victims, offenders, and the community\\" (p. 76).The \\"Ubuntu philosophy of Africa, which affirms the essential connection of all living things\\" (p. 81, and see pp. 105-08), guided the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. The commission for financial reparations, however, has too few resources to accomplish economic justice. \\"Only when economic justice is joined with political justice will healing be possible. Healing is a circular process, and all dimensions of the circle must be attended to in order for healing to occur\\" (p. 82).Sweden has discovered that the longer the imprisonment, the greater the probability of recidivism: \\"24% recidivism for those not imprisoned, 52% for those imprisoned from one to two years, and 86% for those imprisoned more than ten years\\" (p. 85). Respect and rehabilitation are the emphases in Sweden's prisons. Many prisoners there \\"regarded prison as a place of grace, forgiveness, and healing rather than punishment. One chaplain summed it up well: \`It is impossible to be a prison chaplain and not think this way theologically'\\" (p. 87).Snyder is especially persuasive in lifting up \\"Judeo-Christian roots\\" of restorative justice (pp. 109-125). Here \\"amazing grace\\" \\"looks to the future rather than to the past\\" (p. 101).Resisting punishment, and cultivating restorative healing (of offenders, victims, and society), do not mean going soft on crime. Restorative healing means being effective in holistic healing, in restoring torn relations, in working toward a hopeful future for all of us. It is a means of initiating and nourishing mutual accountability between offenders, victims and community.A society that includes structural systemic injustice and many tyrannies of the status quo is in no position to combat crime with self-righteousness and self-defeating efforts to get even. \\"We are all one and we must resist all attempts to divide us into \`us' and \`them,' upright citizens and bestial criminals\\" (p. 156).To those who object that this \\" restorative justice\\" is an idealistic approach that will not work, Snyder responds that the present \\"spirit of punishment\\" has been proven not to work. The increasing costs of our present approaches, financial and social and psychological costs combined, are themselves so impractical that we must learn from practitioners of restorative justice, and undertake the arduous work of \\"converting\\" our whole attitude from reactive punishment to proactive healing.-John G.

I was so moved and inspired by his comments that I ran right out and bought this book, which expands on many of the things he said during his talk. Being a natural rescuer type, I have always had a tendency to reach out to hurting people wherever I meet them, and this book has provided me with some invaluable tools in doing so. I've turned to it again and again as a reference during my dealings with people in crisis or just people who need someone to talk to. A good subtitle for this book could be, &quot;How to Listen,&quot; and I wish it could be required reading for caregivers of all types. It is especially useful in being of help to people who are depressed, and I have used the things I learned from the book in depression forums on the Web with very good results. The best thing I got from reading this book is an understanding of how to get out of the way and let God work through me in other peoples' lives. Now I don't feel so much like I need to &quot;fix&quot; anyone or say just the right thing or take responsibility for saving someone. The book is written from a Christian perspective, but the methods described in this book would work for anyone.

R.L. Stine was one of my fabourate authors, and I was crazy about his books. Then came a time when I moved on and started reading adult novels, that was a time when Stephen King became my favourate auther. Since I stoped reading kids books, I was happy to hear that R.L. Stine was publishing a novel for adults. I bought it, read it, and was not impressed. This book is a waste of time, and the story is just stupid. Maybe if it was well writen, it would be more enjoyable, but its not. The story is about a girl named Sara Morgan, who falls in love with a professor named Lian O'Conner. Liam seems like an every-day guy, exept he believes in every superstition. Then there are the murders on campus, and no one knows who the killer is. (spoiler) After a lot of guessing, you final find out that Liam is superstitious because he has demons inside of him, and each time he lets a superstition slip, a demon gets lose and kills someone. The author is good at keeping you guessing, but while reading this, you don't feel like guessing, you just want to finish the book and be done with it. I recomand that you stay away from this book and stick to better authors, like Stephen King."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I read this book a long time ago, but still remember it very well.

So if you haven't read this book yet I strongly recommend that you do read it."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I found Superstitious while wandering around the local(only good library) in town and found this in the fiction section. 'R.L.Stine. Doesn't he write kids books? What's he doing here in the good book section?' Out of curiosity, I picked it up and begain reading the jacket. It sounded intresting and not jouvinal, so i got it.I read the book back when I was a freashman in highschool (I'm a Senior now) and it was the fastest book I had read. I really couldn't put it down. Something in the book grabbed my attention and would not let it go, even long after I finished the book.The beginning goes rather fast so it can get into the story line. A young girl, Sarah Morgen, meets a handsome professor, begins dating, then marries him in around a years time. They are happy and Liam's, the professor, sister lives in the same house as them but is just kinda there for the first part. After a while, Sarah begins to relizes that Liam is EXTREAMLY supertitious. At first, she thinks it's cute, but then cute turns into bothersome that spawns into down right annoyance.While Sarah is dealing with her marriage problems, people around the town are dieing in rather not nice ways. One man I believe losses his head. Enter the Detective! He is here to solve what in bloody hell is going on with these people.As the plot thinkens, Sarah enters a world of demons and begins to learn the truth about the man she married and the man she almost married before he tried to kill her a few years ago.I honestly believe this is one of the best books I've ever read and I wish R. L. Stine wrote more Adult books. I also wish our library hadn't lost it's only copy and that I had money to get it.Unless you look online, it's a rather hard book to find in some places."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"As a former fan of his YA books, I felt compelled to try this book when it first came out.This book is a huge dissapointment.SUPERSTITIOUS follows several people all in a small college town who are connected to each other through the college and through the brutal murders that have just started. There's Sara Morgan, a grad student who marries prestigious prof. Liam O'Connor, and Garrett Montgomery, the detective investigating the murders, for the main characters. Along with them is a handful of other characters, most of whom are unimportant--they are introduced briefly the sole purpose of being killed off later in the book.First, the plot. The main ideas around which the book was constructed were generally a good ones, but the plot wasn't expanded very well or explored to the fullest--it was lousy. Along with several unimportant characters, Stine killed the plot's potential. Stine seemed to be taking the easy road out on this one.The charachters were not very well developed. Most people in this book seem to be in their twenties, and no character is very realistic. Stine tried too hard to get into the mind frame of this age group--it's somewhat obvious when reading the charachter's thoughts and dialogue; he doesn't do a very good job. The characters also do not reach their full potential--when given an option of doing two things, they'll pick the less interesting one--sort of an easy way out. The dialogue was not too bad, but not without its flaws. Stine also tried to incorporate adult themes into the novel (sex), and while these scenes could have also been much better, they were extremely bad. I don't mean this in the raunchy sense, either--Stine is neither Marquis de Sade nor Brett Easton Ellis. The sex scenes are very badly written, and essentially all the same. And occasionally an 'event' during one of these scenes will be in the wrong place entirely (this only happens once or twice). Stine should really stick to YA--really.The grammar/style of writing is a whole other story. I can see how this sort of choppiness (lots of fragmented sentences) can be used in the right places for effect, but Stine does it all the time. Some writers can pull this off and do it amazingly (try Janet Fitch's WHITE OLEANDER for a perfect example or just a great read), but Stine fails miserably. For example: \\"'[Dialouge here],' Garret insisted. Too defensive. He scolded himself.\\" The book doesn't flow, making it very frustrating for the reader. That was my major problem with this book--good writing can make a reader forget character or plot flaws, but bad writing makes those things more prominent and more irritating.Also, I have a (very) short list of other problems not mentioned above, just in case you aren't convinced yet: 1)characters do unrealistic things in certain situations/come up with unrealistic answers to simple problems (whereas, like I mentioned above, they'll opt for the easy road in a more complex situation);2) a vocabulary worthy of Stine's YA books--much repitition of the same words, no really good use of description;3) characters will repeat actions several times throughout the book, and instead of developing the character, it stops the character from advancing, ie, learing through its mistakes and growing; 4) Stine doesn't stay with one verb tense--he'll go from gerund to present tense to preterit and over again. And when charachters are remembering or talking about a situation in retrospect, it is always in the present tense instead of past tense.The short version of the above: save yourself the time and money: DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. If you really feel compelled to read it, get it from the library or a friend and brace yourself for dissapointment. If you're really looking for good horror, try a master, like King, who knows what they're doing."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Stine really needs to put some excitement in his booka, because he's really boring! I gave it three stars because of all the description, but other than that it's really boring!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"The writing in this book was so poor, I felt as if I was reading a parody of some sort. Like a 'How Not To Write Horror' manual. I'm not entirely sure why I finished the book. I had some hope that it would improve, and it was also so ludicrous that I had to find out how bad it could get.The characters were cheesy and two dimensional, the plot was predictable and often silly.I also got the impression that Mr. Stine was desperate to drive into readers' heads that this is NOT a young adult novel. I think he went overboard with descriptions of sex scenes and foul language. I'm not a prude, but I think his attempt to make this story adult was overkill.I'm disappointed but not terribly surprised because it's so difficult to find really good horror writing."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Stine's gift is merely his presence and the familiarity of his name. At the time of &lt;i>Superstitious&lt;/i>' inception, he was all but omnipresent, what with his cash-cow Goosebumps series and his B-level legacy in the annals of YA suspense. I've no problem with a Youth/Young Adult horror author testing the King/Koontz driven waters of adult fiction in the same genre. Stine's sometime rival and (I feel) literary superior, Christopher Pike, has made several successful trips to the same place, most notably with the haunting, meaningful &lt;i>The Season of Passage&lt;/i>. However, Stine's writing lacks the depth and humanity that keeps me stalking the YA shelves for Pike's work over a decade after abandoning the Fear Street saga.There are alternating moments of viseral strength and creative prowess in this tepid and try-hard adult debut. He demonstrates at least a pretense of nerve in the death scenes--of which there are many, and bordering on gratuitous--and his stories have always been at least conceptually alluring. Superstitons throughout history and their relevance in modern society is solid subject matter, and--with the right imagination and structure acting as vessels holding and guiding the blood--could have added up to a blistering supernatural tour de force, with harrowing undertones of classic psychological terror. Unfortunately, Stine is not up to the challenge, and it shows. He bumbles through what should be complex scenes and seemingly mad-libbed plot developments like a poor man's John Saul, and with all the strength and vibrancy of a loaf of bread submerged in salt water (Thank you, Scott!).The cast of \\"characters\\" are so bland and garden-variety uniform you could conduct a roll call based on their stereotypes (even their names are predictable and flavorless as a day-old wad of Bazooka...I've forgotten most of them). Liam is devastatingly handsome, smart and fit as a whipcord, with a swanky accent and a measured handful of quirks/intrigue to distract us from his potential dark side. Sara is disarmingly beautiful, disgustingly virtuous, and overplays the damsel in distress like a lobotomized Lois Lane. His colleague is a leering hulk of a skirt-chaser with a penchant for lethal weapons. Her best friend is a selfless wisecracker, visibly overcompensating for being the runner-up in beauty's sad scheme. His sister is an overbearing, sugarcoating busybody. Her former lover is an overindulged, sociopathic creep. One might theorize that Mr. Stine plucks his characters from fortune cookies, but I'm more inclined to think he scrapes them from the insides of his nostrils. Whatever you find there is virtually guaranteed to be monotonous, unpleasant, and often downright disgusting.His writing style could tactfully be called an acquired taste, but I'll just come right out and say it's a hard one to acquire. There's no texture or flow to it, only a half-assed stream-of-semiconsciousness framework of words, fragments and paragraphs leading us clumsily from point A to point B. There are no insights or poignance or anything approaching an overall theme, just cause and effect, action and reaction. Instead of following up an intense event with an equally intense description of the charcter's emotional distress, we get simply. \\"No.\\" A strong narrative and taut, stylish prose often creates the backbone that supports the whole show, but in this brittle networking of juvenile dialogue and superficial observations, a weak plot and weaker characters only suffer further. Everything cringes desperately under the thumb of the original idea, and there it all falters and dies with barely a whimper, much less a bang.I can forgive a work of fiction for being all style and no substance when I'm in a generous mood, but Stine's entry into the arena of adult horror has neither...no style, no substance, no soul, no point. He's too scared of his own potential and those pesky necessities like originality to effectively scare the likes of us. Mr. Stine can still feel free to take a tentative place beside JK Rowling and act as an effective literary springboard for the youth of the world.But for my buck and its bang, Stephen King is still horror's annointed one."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Don't be tempted to try reading this horrible excuse for an &quot;adult novel&quot;. Stine should stick to writing his horror for children. This book was simply terrible. Why I finished it is beyond me, maybe I wanted to see just how bad it could get. And believe me, that's pretty bad. I found myself laughing aloud at the silly story and juvenile characters. I don't think I've ever read a book this surprisingly stupid.It's easy to see why this was published; Stine writes the incredibly popular 'Goosebumps' and 'Fear Street' series. But 'Superstitious' is so embarassingly terrible. The writing is very simple, only the sex scenes can rise this above the young adult genre. Every scene seems contrived and unbelievable. The characters are so poorly drawn we never really care much what happens to them. Kill them off? That would be a blessing.I gave this one a try, having read a few 'Fear Street' books as a young teen; having also been into Christopher Pike books as well, I expected this effort to be more like one of his adult novels. Not even close. Don't read this book unless you want to experience a really, really badly written one. Nothing else I've ever read can compare to the dismal disappointment of 'Superstitious'. You have been warned."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This book is typical R. L. Stine but with a little more gore and sex because it was written for an adult audience. The plot was too predictable, and you would have to be pretty dense to not pick up who the murderer was. The reason said murdered was committing these crimes is pretty ridiculous, but I will give Stine credit for the last chapter's cliffhanger. That scene was well done.Stine has written a few more recent adult books that were great (\\"The Babysitter\\" and \\"Eye Candy\\"), but this book was really a mess. I think for hardcore Stine fans, this book will probably be alright, but anyone else will see this book as a cheap knockoff of Dean Koontz or Stephen King. My best advice: Go in with low expectations."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This is an outstanding book. This is a horror/slasher/mystery type book.

There isn't that much talk of sex in the other books. It's more like a book written for male teenagers, talking about looking at women's breasts constantly. Not sure if I'll even finish it at this point. This book stinks!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I was an avid reader of Stine when I was a kid and collected all of his books, so I was excited when I found this book and thought to myself maybe I could have some sort of reminiscence of the old days reading it, but still enjoy it since it was supposed to be an adult novel. I laughed harder at this book then any book I've ever read. This book has \\"Goosebumps\\" written all over it-the same bad, for kids writing, the same crazy not thought out plots-all of it. It works well for kids, but certainly not in an \\"adult\\" novel. The only difference between this book and the old Goosebumps book is that this book is longer, and has sex, drugs, and cussing in it. Take that out and you've got crappy kid's novel that only someone under the age of 10 would enjoy.The writing itself is just bad, and the characters and plot are awful. The characters are just downright stupid, I hated all of them, and found none of them believable. At the supposed to be exciting climax of the story, the main character just resorts to totally unbelievable idiocy so that Stine can play out the supposed twist of the story, which made me laugh it was so ridiculous. Where you were supposed to feel for the main character's relationship and connect to the romance part of the story, I just laughed at the awkwardly written \\"connection\\" sequences and hated both of the characters so much I just wanted them to go away. The characters couldn't even connect to each other at all and they certainly didn't connect to me.With all due credit, towards the end, it was a page turner and I did find I wanted to finish it and find out the end. I started out hating the book in the beginning, but towards the end it got a bit interesting(hence the two star review-I almost gave it one, but for that 10 pages where I actually got interested, I'll add another star). Then it all fell apart again when it was supposed to reach the climactic best part, and it left me hating the book again. As I stated before-stupid characters, stupid plot, unbelievable.Honestly, this was one of the worst books I've probably read in the last few recent years. I got it for 35 cents at a book sale and I still wish I hadn't bought it. I could go on about it, but it's so bad I feel no need to explain anymore because I urge you to stay away from this book. I don't know what people were on when it got so many 5 star reviews, but believe me, this book is baaaaddd. Maybe kids would like it(granted if there wasn't the stupid sex scenes just to pass it off as an adult novel), but as far as anyone else...well then again, I would like to point out, technically, I'm still a kid-I'm 16, and I still hated this book and thought it was garbage.

I've read almost everyone of Stine's books and I think that he's a very talented writer, but I think that he needs to work on his adult novels."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"When I started reading Stine many years ago I fell in love with the way he wrote, he could always keep your attention, but his Young Adult books were to easy to read...finished in an hour. Then one day, while walking throughthe storet I see an adult fiction book by Stine. Without hesitation I purchased the book and from there it all went uphill. I couldn't read it fast enough. The way he actually makes you visualize what's going on is incredible. Easy to understand and interpret unlike other offers who lose you in the dialogue. I thought that this was Stine's best book ever and I hope he keeps the adult fiction coming my way!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This story was brilliant! Every time you began to think you know what is going to happen there is another horrific murder that eliminates your main suspect. The characters personalities and traits were all spectacular but, my favorite character was Professor Liam O1Connor.// Having this Irish born Professor be so deeply superstitious was a noticeable trait from the beginning. Every time he forgot a superstition he would react as if someone had got him. You began to notice this behavior after, and just before, he marries his new love Sarah; Liam has an incident. A long purple tongue stretches from his mouth and his normally brown eyes turn blue.// This is the first sign that leads you in the correct direction. A direct path to the Professor that is also a monster. He must kill every so often to maintain being human most of the time. If he is not happy or if he does not observe every superstition he will remain the monster permanently.// The idealism, originality, and unique characteristics of this plot were astonishing. I loved and pizzazz of the fire inside each character ( Sarah1s unique ability to always pick the wrong guy). The plot was exciting and horrifying all at the same time. I wish I could have jumped into the story and been one of the police officers investigating the murders!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This book kept me on the edg of my seet every page.I simply could not bear to put it down!R.L.Stine puts an obscure piece of information in the middle just to throw you off the trail.Then when you think you finaly solved the mystorie of who done the murders,you find that you were totaly wrong!Stine is one of the few authers that can sincearly chill a persons sole,and this book is a perfect example of his austonishing tallent!!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"All in all this is a pretty good book. I mean you don't become one of the most bestselling children's authors if you have no talent. And there is no doubt Stine can write, especially young adult fiction. But stepping into the world of adult fiction is a little different. Stine added lots of profanity, gore, and sex. That seems to be all that separates this from his earlier work. That and a few hundred extra pages. I got the impression that Stine deliberately extended this story to almost 400 pages because he felt that would make it more adult like. Unfortunately the story wasn't a 400 page story. Stine would have done better to cut out the uneeded parts and tell the story the way it needed to be told. I think he would have done better to write this the way he normally does, for young adults. But it was pretty decent (not comparable to King, Koontz, or Barker, but who is) and it was his first shot at an adult novel. I would recommend this, and I would pick up the next adult novel he writes because with experience, i think he'll learn the craft of writing for adults."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This book was awesome! Every chapter something new happens that makes you wonder what will happen next. This book is very descriptive giving every possible detail imagined. I highly recomend this book to anyone who is in love with horror books or just enjoys a good scare every now and then. This is a must."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you wondering what to think of it. The story hooks the reader from the beginning, propelling them through the remainder of the book despite how unsatisfying the book may get.You get your taste of blood, gore, and profanity, and that is exactly where the problem with it lies. The book follows the same formula of Stine's young adult novels, an edited version could even pass as a Fear Street book. However, one gets the feeling that Stine's foray into the world of adult fiction is simply so he can indulge in his desires to add a little spice to his works.If you've read all the best-sellers and want something to tide you over until Stephen King's next novel, you may want to give this one a try."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"The book was alright, but I think R.L.Stine is still in that Goosebumps mode. Like most Goosebumps and Fear street books, I have found that Stine has the tendencey to have a pretty good plot to the story but he doesn't seem to know how to form anything out of it. The ending had an interesting twist to it but he's done it so many times that I felt like I had been ripped off and he was too lazy to finish it and just...quit. He's always ready for a sequel so he can make another buck. I hafta admit that there was plenty of gore in it, more than some horror novels (or get a job in horror movie writing which have the tendency to repeat themselves, too). I guess I've read too many horror books to be satisfied"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"The book had a great twist in the ending,It keeps you on the edge of your seat!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I happened across this book by chance. I had no idea that Stine had done an adult book. I had been a huge fan of his book since I was 12 and had read most of them. I of course had to read this one. It was pretty good although the plot was predictable. There were some suprises though. I highly reccomend this book to any Stine fan."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Maybe I opened this book with too high of expectations. I love the Fear Street series, have since I was a kid. I may have a BA in English, bu I still love to read these during TV comerials and smoke breaks. Anyways, to make a too long story short, I HATED this book. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and the plot left too many gaping holes. Also, while trying to please \\"adults\\" Stine left all of his charm on the cutting room floor. I only spent .50 on this at a garage sale, yet I still feel I was ripped off. The only reason I gave this terrible book 2 stars is beacause the idea was original, and I still love the Fear St. books."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This is popular author R.L. Stine's debut in the adult fiction world as he is most famous for his \\"Goosebumps\\" and \\"Fear Street\\" series, which are both aimed at kids and teenagers. As with Stine's previous works, he is not a master of the craft with intricate plots, great characters, and development. Stine writes novels that are mostly plot driven, leaving out a lot of character development and details. This is great for a reader that is not looking for the latter but readers that do enjoy this stuff should seek entertainment with a different book.Sara Morgan is a woman that lives in a college town and is seeking work, so she takes a job with the dean of students at the university. She then starts seeing a professor at the school, Liam, an Irish born guy that believes in superstitions. Meanwhile, there are many gruesome, terrible murders taking place in the town and an investigation is started. This novel takes you into the affair of Sara and Liam and parts of the investigation.If you are looking for a thriller that is very involved with the police investagations then this book is not for you. As far as Stine gets with the police stuff is taking you to the scene of the crime and describing lots of gore. Stine's writing is very easy to read though it does come off as very childish at times. This is an easy book to zip right through because of this, but for readers looking for entwined and detailed writing should look somewhere else.One of the problems I had with the book was the lack of depth. Everything in the book was presented very quickly and Stine never dug deep enough to make the reader feel involved with the story on an emotional level. Instead of getting in touch with major plot events in the book the reader will be pulled into graphic sex scenes, which may be a bit much for certain readers. In fact, much of this book reads like an erotic novel do to the amount of sex and how Stine describes it. I wasn't bothered by this but I am certain that more sensitive and younger readers may.Furthermore, the characters in \\"Superstitious\\" are not developed much, leaving the reader with a feeling that gives off a type of incompleteness. I like to read about characters that are well developed and make you care about them, but that was just lacking here. Sara is a likeable character but she just comes off as being too good. There is not much to identify with Sara.Overall, \\"Superstitious\\" lacks the depth to make it great. This is an enjoyable novel that can be read very quickly as it has short chapters and is easy to read. If you're looking for a quick little beach read, this will be good for that.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I grew up reading fear street books, and no one quite catches horror like Stine. Finally, when Fear street is no longer enough, and I yearn for an adult novel with the same grasp and detail, he writes an adult book! I wish he would write ten more!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Not having read Stine's teen books, I was looking forward to this book as a good read for Halloween. It wasn't. The plotting and writing were like a first draft. A lot of it didn't make sense. I gave it one star only because the sex scenes were (unintentionally) very funny."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I thought, &quot;Hey, I'll give R.L.Stine a chance... Millions of kids reading his stuff couldn't be wrong, could they?&quot;They aren't wrong. Just young.I am an avid reader, and have never skipped ahead to read the ending. It's against my moral code. When I read this book, my wife would ask me why I had such an unpleasant look on my face. I responded that the book was terrible. She asked why I didn't put it down. I told her that I needed to know how it ended. She said skip to the back and look. Against my reading ethics, I did. The end was so predictable I (thankfully) had no need to read the rest.If you are one of the unfortunate souls who is currently reading this book, do what I did. Then find a book that won't waste your time."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Stine has written another Goosebumps book, increased the length, added some dirty words, and tries to pass it off as adult fiction. This was one of the worst books I've read and ended as lamely as it began"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I've always liked R.L Stine books when I was a lot younger, but now, I've read his debut adult novel. It's not a bad book, definately not, but I'd go for something else, like Stephen King, or something... even a bit of mystery wouldn't hurt... this book lacks the &quot;mystery&quot; part... the first half of the book was great, but it was all pretty predictable, and the female lead was kinda well... stupid. I expected more from R.L. Stine, I mean, heck, he has his own T.V show in the afternoons for Goosebumps... you don't put fowl language and sexual descriptions in a book to make it an &quot;adult&quot; novel. There can be an adult novel with very little sexual activity, and it can still hold the mystery and excitement you'd expect from such a popular writer... I feel kind of disappointed, especially with the ending. Besides... at the end (spoiler coming up!), the female lead should've stayed in the taxi, and went to her friend's house, instead of going to that other guy's house. Plain stupid female lead. I KNOW that if *I* were in that position, I wouldn't do something stupid like that. I can't really recommend this book, therefore I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Mr. Stine's story is tolerable if you can get past the writing. I can't believe so many people gave it 4 or 5 stars. Does he really believe that people say &quot;huh&quot; as many times as he uses it? His style put me off totally from the story."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Superstitious is one scary, nail biting, on-the-edge-of-your-seat, book!When searching through the local library, I came across this book, I signed it out, and whent straight home to read it. I finished it within one night, but what a scary night it was! I read this book, eagerly awaiting what was coming up next. It was so fast paced, and so horrifically scary, that I just couldn't put it down!If you haven't read this book, than do so, it's a good read!!!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I have always been a fan of Stine's books. I was only 14 when I read this book(when it first went onto the shelves)I went on vacation right after I got it. I couldn't even enjoy the sights,I finished it in a day. It doesn't equal anything by Stephen King or Dean Koontz, but a great book never the less.I was mostly intrigued with the character Liam O'Conner,his mystery and charm, and all his little superstitions. Very graphic and (amusingly)sexual. You pretty much guess the plot in the middle of the book, but keep wanting to know what happens anyway. I recommend this books to anyone who's a fan of horror/Stine. Defiantly a page-turner."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I find it insanely funny that Sara thinks to herself (about the rejected manuscripts) 'Don't these people know how bad their writing is?' I could ask the same of Stine regarding this book. It's not completely bad, seeing how I enjoy the character of Liam, but I see him as Naveen Andrews who is definitely not Irish....Why all the cursing and sex? Is there really a reason for it, other than wanting the book to sound adult? Was this thing edited at all?Anyway, I hope R.L. Stine sticks to his yound adult/pre-teen stories, they are a LOT better, IMO."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I think that this is the worst book that I have ever read. I started disliking it early on, but I finished it because once I start a book I always finish it.A quiet college campus suddenly becomes a killing ground.

Read the book... if you dare!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"R.L. Stine has always been a favorite of mine. I was lucky to find the brand new hard back edition of this book for $1.00! Can you believe it? Anyway, I totally recommend this book for any horror fans."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"My favorite book, indeed. R.L. Stine sure did it.

Stine to write such a magnificent book."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I first found out about R.L Stine's book Superstitious, when my brother told me that R.L Stine was coming out with an adult novel for the first time. So I was immediately curious to what R.L Stine would come up with next. Eventually, I got the book on the first day it came out and I read it. It was the the bomb!!! I couldn't believe it!!!! I thought, at first, it was going to be a waste of my time and money. However, I realized as soon as I got through with it, I was recommending it to my teachers and friends. 9 out of 10 of my friends really enjoyed it. I also found out that my teachers had copies and also where fanatic about it. I was sooooo shock. So now I have it placed in my school's library so that others can read. It's definately recommended!!!!!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC WAY TO GO R.L.

I found out that it was quite old, but that didn't matter to me I loved this book! I have been an R.L. Stine fan since I could first read I actually think I read all of this books but the newer ones. So I was thrilled that I found an adult one. It was just like his YA books it sucked me in with the plot and when I would put it down I would think of a twist I had read and pick it right back up again. It was an excellent, well written book. I personally enjoyed this book a lot and actually put off my college work just to read it. I recommend this book for anyone who likes great suspense, horror, and an awesome plot. This would be a great movie if they made it-long as they stay true to the book. I also recommend this to anyone who loved R.L.'s children's books as you will not be disappointed by this one."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Superstitious is one of R.L. Stein's few adult books and its not that great. The book follows all the cliches that are in any of his Fear Street novels. (Mysterious boyfriend, supporting best friend, annoying side characters) and it even follows the same plot as most of his other books. Superstitious isn't really a bad book, but its predictable most of the time. However the book did keep my interest and it was a page turner."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This is Stine's first attempt to write an adult (non Goosebumps) book. Over all, he did a pretty good job. It's obvious that Stine took the time to research the many superstitions and what they mean, and how to fight them off. The problem is that there's almost to many supersitions that are covererd. I found myself annoyed at times reading about them. I wanted the story to move along.Sara is involved with a professor that takes superstitions very seriously. Sara is then swept up with the prof and his sister and all of superstitoins and rituals that they go throught. As if this isn't enough for Sara to deal with...there's savage, brutal killer on the college campus that targets women. And what this killer is savage and violent. Sara is soon trapped in the world of superstitions, in which she can't excape.Over all this is a pretty good book. This is also a very violent and a gore filled book. Over all if you like horror and like Stine, then I suggest this book. Is this a fantastic book? No. Is this a decent book? Yup. If you like gore, then you may like this book."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Let me begin by saying that I am an R.L. Stine fan from way back. I can remember going through four or five books a weekend as a youth. That's why, when seeing that Stine had written a book for adults, I was both intrigued and anxious. I started reading a book that was, and I quote, supposed to be &quot;a fast moving tale filled with lust and gore enough to satisfy the most jaded thrill-seeker.&quot;The book starts off at a trip-hammer speed, but then you are kinda left with &quot;when is it gonna speed up again.&quot; It took a little time to get into, but eventually it happened. I found myself drawn into this world of campus life. Of Sara Morgan and her pseudo-stalking personality she adopted after meeting the illustrious Liam O'Connor. Needless to say that the Irish born immigrant and the all-american sweetheart DO fall in love and marry...only to open a Pandora's box of secrets and lies.There were particular sections within the book that were just plain NASTY and of things that I didn't even want to hear about, but they did what they were meant to do. And then there is the book famous scene of Sara coming home early to catch her husband in bed, with a most surprising partner.The ending felt kind of bittersweet. It pretty much left you dumbfounded, while at the same time it made since because it stuck to the premise of the novel. It either works with you or doesn't.I think R.L. Stine venture into adult writing is a very good move, but at the same time there are a lot of holes that he has to learn to fill. Stine has to remember one rule, and one rule only. You can scare and excite, titillate and horrify children a lot faster and easier than you can adults.It's, surely, not the best book ever written, but in the same token, it isn't the worst either. In my opinion, Superstitious is a good start to a possible lucritive adult writing career."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"The plot of the story is great actually, it is well written, just the style of his writing leads you to turn page after page.I was extremely unsatisfied with the ending however. The resolution was horribly thought up of. It built up so many questions and tensions through my head. But when the questions are finally resolved, the first thought that runs through my mind was, &quot;I've read 400 pages just so it could lead me to this??&quot;Another thing, this book has too many sexual contents, but that's not the bad thing, the thing is, why is it there? What's the point? He could have reduce the uselessness of it to make the book shorter."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I had a long flight and decided to read this book. It did keep you on the edge of your seat halfway through the book but then Stein came back to his the Fear Street roots and the last ten chapters were so predictable! And all the women always wear leggings in this book! I think I saw the word jeans once. The ending just made the book weird I still don't know what to think of it....."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This book is about a small Pennsylvania college where love is developed. Liam O'Connor is an Irish-born professor who has good looks, a sweet charm and believes in Old World superstitions. Sara Morgan who is a young, beautiful graduate student is dazzled by his old superstitions and his charm. As they begin an intimate relationship, Sara doesn't notice all the drama going on around the campus. There have been four murders committed and each are more horrifying than the one before. The murders are being committed by someone or something with a lot of fur and strength. Suddenly Sara is receiving prank calls warning her to stay away from Liam. She is bothered by so many things, that when Liam purposes to her, she accepts. Making love by the light of sixteen candles, was one of Liam's old superstitions. As the days go by Sara begins to see more of Liam's superstitons, and is somewhat beginning to be bothered by them. Especially on their wedding day, Sara recalls as they walked out one of the side doors, Liam started freaking out and saying, &quot;The door. We went out the side door. Don't you understand? You have to leave by the same door you came in. You can't leave by a different door. We came in through the front door!&quot; Before their marriage, Sara adored his silly superstitions, but he began to scare her with them. After they are married, the drama begins to unfold and make sense, and the police begin to close in on a killer. Sara is caught right in the middle of everything. At the center, behind all the silly superstitions, waits the most terrifying secret of all..... read the book to find out what happens. This book kept me on the edge till the end, and the outcomes always suprised me. I believe, &quot;Superstitious&quot; by R.L. Stine is basically marketed to teens and women. I hope everyone enjoys the book as much as i did!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I found this book in my garage. The minute I started reading it I couldn't put it down. THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING.

This being an adult novel I thought it would be a little more mature than his others. Nope.

I'll keep on reading his books when I get bored, I just think he needs to stick with writing the kiddie books..."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. When I first started reading fear street, I thought it was really predictable. This one was a little, but I didn't care. Others may not like it, but they obviously haven't read a lot of his books. Once you start reading his books and keep reading them, they become a lot alike. This book, I think, was his best book!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I did not feel any sympathy for these jacked-up characters and when someone finally got their scalp ripped off and their spine crushed, I merely felt relief that this was one less pathetic personality I had to keep track of. The dialog was as vapid as the intelligence of the lead character, Sara Morgan, who has an IQ of about room temperature and performs the expected Dumb-Damsel moves that makes for typical schlock suspense. (Oh gosh, can Liam really, really be so bad? Golly, Gee!) The story concept promises something terrifying along the lines of Saul, King or Koontz, but the terror it delivers is tame enough for Mr. Rodgers Superstitious Neighborhood."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"First of all, I must say that I loved R.L.Stines young adult novels (Fear Street series). So, I was hyped when I discovered he was trying his writing hand at an adult novel. The day it came out, I had it. I was disappointed, to say the least. The plot was far too predictable. His Fear Street books had more plot twists. Plus he used a recycled plot formula. What do I mean by recycled plot formula? Well, if you must, read the novel and you'll discover what I mean. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a horrible book, I've read much worse, but I have read much much better.

I struggle with a mental disability called Attention Deficit Disorder. This disability makes it extremely difficult more me to concentrate, which makes reading a chore. When I got this book as a gift, I was a little discouraged. I had read R.L. Stine's Young Adult books while in high school, but I doubted that he could write something that would keep my attention as an adult, and if he could I doubted that I would be able to sit still and read it. To my surprise, I read the book in two weeks, a record for me. It was great. The book's suspenseful plot held me captive, which is a great feat. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure, mystery, and horror."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"It's kind of fun, but very predictable. He points you in a couple of directions but you can see the spin from a mile away. He uses some false thrills to simulate suspense in a couple of places. It only annoys because it's too cute, and reminds you of Goosebumps. Nice touch at the end. He does some cool telegraphic tension stuff with his prose: Little short bursts. The shadows ahead. Etc. The protagonist is too stupid to live, however. Uh, maybe she should have thought things over, or maybe called the cops right away, or maybe something else resembling common sense. Nice trashy read."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I read this for a book report in my freshman year of high school, and to be perfectly honest, I expected more from the author I have grown to love.

I never really liked the author because of his childlike writing, no complicated characters. But once I saw an adult book of his on the adult section, I had to see if he could really improve his writing techniches.

I would rush home form school just to read it and it put me in some kind-of trance which I was in a alternate world and was living Sara's life.

I really liked the book and reccommend it to all."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"From 1993 until about 1996, the Fear Street series were my books of choice since I was a preteen to teenager into horror. Around 1995, R.L. Stine first released Superstitious, his first book for adults and it was mentioned in a few of the Fear Street novels. Fast-forward to the summer of 2007, I found a copy of Superstitious at work and started to read it. Reading it made me remember the Fear Street series very quickly. The style was like an adult Fear Street book and it was quite interesting for most of the book. The latter half of the book is where it got extremely twisted. As my subject says, many times during the last few chapters, I was thinking, \\"What was that\\" or \\"What the hell?\\" It was memorable for sure and I am glad Stine has made an adult novel (and I heard there are at least two more now), but this was one of the most disturbing novels I have read and not because of the scare factor."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Even though my children are not at the age to be reading the ever popular Fear Street series, and I amcertainly a bit old to be reading them (or so I thought!) R.L. Stine's reputation as a teen/youth writer drew me instantlyto pick up his adult novel, Superstitious.Immediately, after reading the first chapter, I was hooked. I dropped the book and ran to tell my husband about the grotesqueimages and wild stories. Any book that has eyeballs plopping out onto the pavement within the first few pages has got my attention!It has been many years since I have read such a graphicly profuse book! But I loved every minute of it. I am in my late 20's and still loveloud obnoxious music and obnoxiously horrid horror movies, as well. Why not sit down with a gruesome book, as well! I am looking forward to anymore adult books that R.L. Stine would like to unleash! I do mean unleash!The story line of this book is plausible, easy to follow and a very good read. There is never a boring moment. The characters all have theiroddities, you never know who &quot;done it&quot;. A beast has been unleashed, and it's closer than you think. They all are suspicious though......Terror is very much alive in R.L. Stine's Superstitious. Take it for a ride"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"Superstitious was billed as R.L. Stine's triumphant leap from his teenage &quot;Goosebumps&quot; series into intense adult horror fiction. Far from being terrified by this book, I found myself laughing at the ridiculous actions and insipid dialogue of Mr. Stine's stereotypical cast of characters. The author's lack of research concerning real police procedures is also quite evident. The only true horror I experienced was that such poor quality writing was ever published in the first place."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I was a fan of RL Stine when I was a kid. I was big into the Goosebumps series. I don't even remember how I learned about this book. But, when I heard about it, I was determined to get my paws on it. It was a fantastic book!Granted, it's an ADULT novel in contrast to a mostly juvenile genre that Stine is known for. But, this is an amazing story and the ending was just like \\" Whoa! THAT was unexpected!\\"I actually learned about superstitions I hadn't heard about before. I spent 3 months researching them after this book. Definetly a great read."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"When I started reading this, I couldnt put the book down. The way Stine paints conversations between people and integrating their thoughts from both viewpoints is fantastic. It moved the story along. The dialogue was great. I knew this might have a strange ending, but not what it wound up being. I liked the character of Milton, but it seemed as if his only purpose in the book was to serve as a distraction from Liam, to make the reader think that he was possibly the murderer, and also to sexually harass those that worked under him as Dean of Students. Some of that backstory just didnt flow along very well.The whole sister thing with Liam was just weird too. And I was not expecting Sara to marry this guy! I thought it would be a climax at the end where she finds out what is truly underneath him and knows it has to be over between them, and there is no marriage. She just came from a bad relationship right into this one with Liam, how am I, as a reader supposed to feel that she has grown in the story and learned from her mistakes? I dont know any more about Sara now than I did in the beginning. And what about the release of demons at the end. Isn't that just a bit selfish and self-serving on Liam's part, to make Sara have his baby so he could be free? Free to do what, exactly?Page 376 - \\"We loved you, Sara, because you were going to free us. You were going to have my child. The child would inherit the demons and free me from my grasp. Your child would take the demons away.\\" And Sara wakes up in a hospital and finds out she's the new carrier of evil. I still can't quite grasp the premise of this book."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"As a fan of Stine's Goosebumps book series as a kid I decided to give Superstitious a chance and found I actually kind of liked it, there are problems of course, but Stine pens what I'd compare to a good slasher flick. I would advise that you reed this novel around Halloween time, it seems to fit into that time frame quite nicely. Overall I would say that Superstitious is a pretty good read and could be used especially to capitalize on the atmosphere of one of those cold and dark fall afternoons."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"All of Stine's other books are left behind after reading Superstitious. It holds your attention and awes you. A story about a girl escaping her ex, and finding the right one. A mix of romance and of horror. You won't want to put down the book! Read the book."},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"When this book came out, I received it as a Christmas gift. I tried to read it, and boy, did I stop trying after 70 pages. I would be lying if I said this is the worst book I've ever read, but only because I technically didn't &quot;read&quot; this. I read the beginning, skipped to the last 25 or 30 pages, and never messed with it again. I read one review where someone called this the best book they have ever read, and I thought, you poor soul. Unbelievably bad!!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"I found this in my local library while actually looking for Stephen King. When I saw the thick hard cover with his name on it I snatched it. When I saw it was his first adult novel I immediately walked to the check out. I was stoked!I read the 400 page book in 3 days, every chance I could get. For me it was a page turner. I loved every bit of it. Stine did a wonderful job, just as I remembered as a young teen. It flowed easily like his childrens books. I was a bit disappointed to see it wasn't available for my kindle bc I would have read it again. When the price drops I will add it to my library. I just can't see myself spending $30 on ANY book.Please write more adult novels!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I could not put this book down, all I did was eat and read. There is no way anyone can come close to making a book as good as this one. Everytime you turn the page there is always a new twist. I will always remeber this book, it is diffently #1 on my list!!!!!"},{"Title":"Superstitious","review":"When I first read this book I thought it was awesome.

Stine books. I haven't read this one yet I just wanted to get in on the action. Anyway I read one of his books called, Well I forgot the name of it. Anyway it was about A girl who was rich and she was an only child, and she had a cousin who wasn't rich and the girl and her friend had made some scrafs in one of the girl's classes and so the girl decided to visit her cousin about selling her scrafs that she had made. I know the book had to do with plastic dolls, and the girl that was rich had a best friend who she had invited to her house from college to stay with her because she couldn't go home. She said her boyfriend was going to kill her. But the thing is she killed her boyfriend. So the girl is suspose to be going crazy and the rich girl dosen't know. Why don't R.L.Stine write books about other people other than white people. I mean Black people also read his books were the one who probably reads them the most anyway. But this book was really good. My little sister has so many book by r.l.stine that I don't which one to read first.

The kids books are just as good. The kids interact with the characters from the adult series, experience the same events, etc. However, since the main characters are teens, these books can appeal to younger readers. So far, the stories haven't had the ups and downs that the adult series has had. The adult series has books that are a lot more boring than others. The kids series seems to be good in every book. These are not for really young kids, but would be appropriate for young teens. I enjoy them and I am an adult."},{"Title":"Rescued (Young Trib Force:Kids Left Behind, 4 / Left Behind: The Kids, Books 13-16)","review":"The series is wonderful. It captures the child's imagination and reflects Scripture at the same time. It is a take off on the book of Revelation believed to be written by the apostle, John. For the uninformed \\"Christian\\" and the unbeliever, they will resent that belief is required and good deeds alone are not enough to go to heaven. A Christian who is a believer isn't likely to commit repeated \\"evil deeds\\" because of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit so the idea of a Christian serially committing \\"evil deeds\\" doesn't fit with being a Christian.If the Bible is offensive to you and specifically:John 3:15-18[15] That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.[16] For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.[17] For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.[18] He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.then perhaps this is not the book for you or your children.When the \\"Restrainer\\" leaves, the Holy Spirit, then it will be a holiday for evil for the Holy Spirit is what restrians some of the evil in this world before the rapture. Again, an unbeliever will mock this and may not wish to be frustrated with this book because of not agreeing with the theology behind the drama as stated in the Bible."},{"Title":"Rescued (Young Trib Force:Kids Left Behind, 4 / Left Behind: The Kids, Books 13-16)","review":"Keeps you interested the whole way!

The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy \\"experts\\" or \\"scholars\\" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, \\"The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,\\" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: \\"The REAL Rapture\\". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's \\"The REAL Rapture\\" (based on a volume in his forthcoming \\"Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period\\" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon)."},{"Title":"The real world of democracy, (The Massey lectures, 4th ser)","review":"As part of my Political Science class, we were instructed to read C.B. Macpherson's &quot;Real World of Democracy&quot;. This book was well written and fairly easy to understand. It gave insight into all aspects of Democracy and how it exists in Liberal states, Communist states and underdeveloped states. He describes how Democracy exists in each society and what the main drives of the particular societies are. The book describes about the profit-driven societies of the Western Capitalist states and how Democracy is applied to Capitalism and how it was brought into the Liberal state. Macpherson writes, &quot;the Liberal state was democratized and Democracy was Liberalized.&quot; Machpherson then describes the Communist and underdeveloped societies and how democracy can and does survive.I found this book very interesting and it gave me great insight into Democracy and how societies across the world respond to it. Macpherson describes that Democracy can be possible in Communist countries, were one party generally dominates, by allowing easy access to join the party, fair representation of the people and critics within the party.The final chapters of the book greatly interested me, as Macpherson began to raise questions about Democracy, Society and Mankind. Macpherson tell us that Capitalism was responsible for creating the Unlimited wants of mankind which was not a natural attribute of mankind. He tells us that,&quot;An overmastering consciousness of scarcity had to be created in order to justify the capitalist society and to give it its driving force&quot;.He then describes how the liberal capitalist societies have placed emphasis on individual freedom and how they have denied full-humanity. He discuss that becasue of this decision liberal capitalist states are in danger and something must be done. He makes an interesting point when stating,&quot;I shall suggest that the communist revolutions and the revolutions in the underdeveloped countries, which together seem to threaten our way of life, may be the saving of it&quot;.Does this mean that a revolution of somekind is approaching to save society and save liberalism?? He also argues that communist countries who have rejected the market, have not lost power but gained strength. He states, &quot;Market power is no longer the sole source of power.&quot;Macpherson's main point in this book is to illustrate how Democracy survives and raise questions about the future of democracy. This can be summerized in my favorite line in this book which states, &quot;If men were angels, government would not be neccessary.&quot;"},{"Title":"The real world of democracy, (The Massey lectures, 4th ser)","review":"MacPherson was once an internationally-acclaimed thinker. He won much praise in Canada and abroad for his books. &quot;The Real World of Democracy&quot; is a short, dated book, full of irrelevancies and preposterous logic. Here McPherson argues that work in a society where free markets exist, even work in the public sector, involves dehumanizing &quot;transfer of power&quot; to those who own capital. He further assumes that such &quot;transfer of power&quot; does not occur in communist countries. This book contains almost no facts. It is one trecherous web of anti-market and anti-private property propaganda, delivered intelligently and rather carefully. The book illustrates much that is wrong with this type of political theorizing: untestable generalizations, one-sided arguments, selective avoidance of facts, etc. At the end of the book, he goes so far as to implicitly equate the power of the Soviet state with the power of individuals living in the Soviet Union. Absurd.MacPherson's ideology differs very little from that of Marx. He considers private property evil, even if he does not use the word. The conclusion of his book degenerates into utopian and absurd musings about what he calls &quot;abolition of scarcity,&quot; and about the &quot;moral advantage&quot; that communist countries were supposedly enjoying in the 1970s. In the penultimate paragraph he finally loses his cool and his starched pretense to objective rationality and raves about how the world has reached the era when &quot;morality and power will coincide.&quot; He then says that he knows he gave no practical (only theoretical) solutions, and, as a last gasp, offers a nutty advice to write &quot;your politicians,&quot; urging them to give &quot;nothing less than massive aid&quot; to poor nations. And mercifully, it is all over."},{"Title":"\\"Emperor Dead\\" and Other Historic American Diplomatic Dispatches (Adst-Dacor Diplomats and Diplomacy Series)","review":"Eicher's book is a collection of dispatches (of a few pages each) written by U.S. diplomats stationed abroad covering nearly two hundred years of American diplomacy, from the earliest days of the American republic to the mid-1960s, ending with the early days of the Vietnam war. In addition to the actual text of the document, an introductory overview highlights for the reader the dispatch's important elements and provides historical and personal context. Eicher has adroitly selected a wide-range of dispatches that capture the breadth of American diplomatic history and the span of time, and he has included reports that range from deadly serious to mildly humorous. The book tracks long-term trends and issues, including, for example, U.S. concern for human rights (such as anti-slavery efforts in North Africa in the early 1800's), citizen protection, and commercial promotion, in addition to the usual stuff of diplomacy -- wars prevented and fought, treaties negotiated and signed, etc. Eicher describes the technological evolution of U.S. diplomatic writing from the early days of hand-written dispatches to the electronically transmitted &quot;cable&quot; still used today by America's diplomats, the &quot;first line of defense,&quot; to report major trends and fast-breaking events. Historians, students, and researchers will find this well-written and carefully researched volume particularly useful, while the average reader, after accepting the arcane,esoteric nature of the subject, will find an interesting if unusual read. For the curious, the book gets its two-word short title, &quot;Emperor Dead,&quot; from the shortest dispatch ever written, advising 18th century Washington readers of the death of the Czar of Russia."},{"Title":"\\"Emperor Dead\\" and Other Historic American Diplomatic Dispatches (Adst-Dacor Diplomats and Diplomacy Series)","review":"It is such an interesting look at the history of the American Diplomatic events over the years.

It has profound implications even today. It is a very interesting, enlightening, and literate book. One of Shaw's best works."},{"Title":"The quintessence of Ibsenism,","review":"This is one of the close to 10,000 books that readers can unload on their computers for free from w[...] or buy from Amazon for, in this case $8.14, plus shipping of $3.99. The web site has very good books.The great playwright Bernard Shaw's Fabian Society were at a loss for lectures in 1890 and its members decided to speak on various subjects. Shaw chose the great playwright Ibsen, whose plays caused a furor among England's older reviewers. Some of newspaper younger reviewers liked the plays, while the majority felt strongly that they are immoral. The latter used vociferous language to demean the plays and their author. The emotional tones of their language showed that Ibsen was threatening their views of morality and society. What was Ibsen saying that threatened them so? Shaw's analysis not only clarifies the then contemporary situation and the methodology of Ibsen's plays, but he offers us a way to analyze our own lives.Shaw begins by telling us about idealisms, the terrible destructive way of thinking and living, the way life that stifles what is human in people and dislocates them from reality. Idealism is an illusion that people and society create for themselves to camouflage and hide reality which they cannot accept because of their lack of sophistication or over-involvement in and fear of superstitions.The notion of the Ideal Woman is an example. The true Woman according to the ideal is she who stays at home, takes care of children, coddles her husband, complies with his wishes, and does not work. This ideal is not real. Many women do not want or are unable to comply; many men prefer to perform this work. Imagine how threatened a man or woman would feel if they believe the ideal and are told that it is wrong, that they wasted their lives devoting themselves to a mistake.Ibsen points out wrong ideals - both societal and religious notions - that are simply not right and which are harmful. Reviewers who bought into these wrong notions, who devoted their lives to them, were insulted by Ibsen's portrayals in his plays of how people who maintain these ideals suffer. They called his plays immoral.Shaw writes that these people define immorality as conduct \\"which does not conform to current ideals.\\" Ibsen, he says, \\"devoted himself almost entirely to showing that the spirit or will of Man is constantly outgrowing his ideal. And that therefore conformity to them is constantly producing results\\" that are tragic.Thus Shaw shows that Ibsen's plays are great because they provoke such emotions from misguided, fearful, passive critics, people who are still attached to and unable to grow and change outdated ideals, and Shaw shows us that we need to heed Ibsen's advice and dare to question the accepted illusionary ideals."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Tempest","review":"This story is truly one-of-a-kind; a labor of love (being dedicated to the author's wife) as well as a tour de force. It can be savored on four levels: first as &quot;simply&quot; a fine and original fantasy novel; second as a clever and &quot;natural&quot; (that is, unforced) interweaving of characters and locales from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest, with a light seasoning of Arthurian themes; thirdly as a masterful adaptation of the language rhythms of a Shakespeare play (with the chapters/acts divided into &quot;scenes&quot;); and finally as an extraordinary, subtle (that is, unobtrusive) integration of poetry (again a la Shakespeare) into prose narative. For example, chapters or &quot;scenes&quot; occasionally end with a rhymed couplet, but that is only the most obvious of the many Excellencies. All four levels are seamlessly incorporated in a most extraordinary manner. The first time I read this book - in 1974 - I was halfway through before I began to realize what the author had achieved. Thus lovers of fantasy can thoroughly enjoy the story, while connoisseurs of the English language will find additional reasons to rejoice. This book is a gem - a masterpiece. I have treasured my paperback copy for 27 years. I assume it is reprinted regularly, but I have never seen it again in bookstores. It deserves a fine hardcover &quot;limited&quot; edition with illuminated script highlights and four-color illustrations by a top artist sympathetic to the genre. I plan to commission one as soon as I win the power ball."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Tempest","review":"This is one of those books you want to keep and read again over the years. It's a historical what if? story. What if there was a world where Shakespeare's stories were history rather than fiction and in this world railroads were built 200 years early? It's a wonderful story with all the elements of fantasy of Shakespeare's &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; combined with the battle between Royalists and Roundheads in a world of premature steam industry.

The heroic scale and width of concept, and I say this with all seriousness, can be called Shakespearean. Splendid descriptive writing, action and characters, with resonances at the very centre of great mytho-poetry. I knew Poul Anderson was a great writer, but this took my breath away! The best novel I have discovered in years!"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Tempest","review":"This is one of my two or three favorite Poul Anderson books and one of my top 20 favorite novels, period. It's a combination alternate history-swashbuckler-magical fantasy set in the era of the war between Cavaliers and Roundheads, but with a difference: they have railroads already. Well plotted, well paced, inventive, suspenseful, great descriptions. Not too deep, though--just great fun. Characters: Traditional but not stereotypical hero, heroine, sidekick, villain, a few historical figures, some familiar literary non-humans and a guest cameo appearance by a character from one of my other favorite stories of his. This story makes one really appreciate how well grounded in history and literature Anderson is. He also displays that all-too-rare ability to use the English language of the past with complete accuracy, a skill the lack of which can easily break the spell of an effort which might have otherwise succeeded. Attention English majors: There's one other feature I won't completely give away so as not to spoil your fun of discovery, but I will say--pay close attention to the dialog"},{"Title":"A Midsummer Tempest","review":"Imagine a world where Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, Falstaff, Othello, Romeo and Juliet actually lived. Where cannon existed in Hamlet's time and striking clocks in Julius Caesar's. Where Richard III was a hunchbacked monster, Bohemia once had a seacoast, and witchcraft works. Where fairies and elves exist. Where \\"English folk...in character and speech...[existed] before the walls of Troy, in Theseus' Athens, in Rome and later Italy, in Denmark...[having] spread out north from some old southern land...\\" And where the chronicle of that spread is told by a man called The Historian--William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon. Such is the world imagined by Poul Anderson in this splendid, magical, swashbuckling tale. The scene is England, and the Cromwellian revolt against King Charles I (or, as the Puritans claim, his bad councillors) is raging. Among the best cavalry commanders in the Royalist force is Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the King's nephew--until he's captured at the Battle of Marston Moor and taken to the home of a Puritan knight, Sir Malachi Shelgrave. There he meets his captor's niece, Jennifer Alayne, and there he is delivered from captivity by her and his loyal Somersetshire sergeant, Will Fairweather. For in a world where locomotives and smoking factories already blight the face of England, King Oberon and Queen Titania of the Faerie realm have a job for him to do, a task that will not only determine which cause triumphs but may mean the continued existence of all that is supernatural.Anderson is best known as a writer of sf, often set on distant planets inhabited by splendidly imaged alien races (read hisFire Timefor a prime example); his fantasies are few (this one,HROLF KRAKI'S SAGA - Ballantine Adult Fantasy Series, andThe Broken Sword (Fantasy Masterworks)are the chief ones), but coming as he did from the bardic tradition of Scandinavia, his gift was natural and is plainly marked here. The basic premise is intriguing and well worked out, the characters are distinctive and delightful (from gangly Will Fairweather to the \\"airy sprite\\" Ariel to the \\"maundering\\" Puritans and the loyal, loving Jennifer), and if you try reading some of the dialogue out loud to yourself, you'll realize that a good deal of it is written in blank verse! (And after all, if you think about it, if Shakespeare was reporting both events and speech exactly as they occurred, how else *would* people speak in his world?) There's even a brief appearance by that famous Gascon, D'Artagnan, of Dumas'sThe Three Musketeers (Signet Classics), very possibly with Queen Anne's diamond studs in his pocket. I've loved Anderson's work since I first discovered it in the early '70's, and this is among my favorites of his novels. If you're looking for a very different kind of alternate-world fantasy filled with intrigue, action, singing language, and unforgettable characters, this is a book you mustn't neglect to read."},{"Title":"A Midsummer Tempest","review":"Poul Anderson (1926-2001) wrote primary \\"hard\\" science-fiction stories featuring aliens; interstellar travel and planetary adventures.

During a brutal skirmish Rupert and his lackey escaped into an charmed forest where he meets up with the \\"little people: Rupert and his companion are then engaged upon a \\"mission\\" for a \\"ring of power\\". This is the classic fantasy-adventure formula: the journey, pursuit by the adversary, a love interest, a sea voyage, narrow escape and a satisfactory ending.Nothing very original here, but Anderson's crisps dialog, descriptive and believable action sequences propels the plot in an agreeable manner and to a satisfactory conclusion.

Though the old English is sometimes hard to follow, the information is penetrating. He gets to the core of the matter - healing. I haven't quite finished this yet (about 75% of the way through) but I will certainly be reading more of his fine work. It's almost as if he had actually tapped into the God side that resides within us all and articulates it like no one else I've read (except Gregg Braden).

Here's the premise: By the middle of the century, the US is running out of energy sources. A human mutation from carbon to a silicon-based life form leads to the discovery of a virtually unlimited source of energy, touching off a competition for control by several groups of scientists. This revolutionary source of energy seems to be the solution to all our power needs, but there are unexpected consequences.This premise is fascinating, and author Eugene Goheen takes us on a speculative tour of scientific possibilities intermingled with greed, sex and political power. The science was complex and I had to reread several sections. As I progressed through the pages, I was reminded of \\"Beggars in Spain\\", Nancy Kress's wonderful story and Greg Bear's \\"Darwin's Radio\\". All three novels explore the rapid evolution of humanity into another species, but Goheen mixes a bit of humor into his brew.If you enjoy hard science fiction with lots of twists and turns, you'll have a great time with \\"Inside the Rainbow.\\""},{"Title":"Inside the Rainbow","review":"Good believable characters, good pacing.

But ultimately I suppose the author deemed these issues were not critical to the story, about a number of different men and two women caught up in the power & mystery of a technological force destined to change the world forever. Recommended."},{"Title":"Inside the Rainbow","review":"Avrum Bengel is the potential savior of humanity. But it doesn't look that way in the beginning. He's just been summarily dismissed from his job of selling tires just before turning 65. He turns his severance pay into a purchase of several tires to put into his living room and heads home. While there, a strange appetite overtakes him. That appetite is the secret to our energy future!How can running out of energy be funny? Eugene Goheen knows the secret. If you read Inside the Rainbow, you are bound to be fascinated by the scientific speculations about the potential of quantum physics to yield unlimited inexpensive energy. At the same time, you'll roar with laughter at the twists and turns that power-hungry (pun intended) politicians pursue.The speculative side blurs the distinctions among biology, evolution, chemistry, physics and biotechnology in a thought-provoking way.The story has lots of sexual spice so those who like a little titillation with their science fiction will feel rewarded, too.The book's main weakness is that Mr. Goheen's talents as a novelist aren't as strong as his scientific and satirical visions. He uses multiple narrators to gradually reveal more pieces of the story which requires a tremendous amount of duplication in the material. As a result, the story develops very slowly. I also found it a little boring to read so much duplication and found myself having trouble keeping going near page 90. If that happens to you, keep going. It gets better again."},{"Title":"Inside the Rainbow","review":"As any schoolkid (or fan of sci-fi knows) we are carbon-based life forms. But what if there were, in this universe, other forms of life, say, based on silicon? Remember the Horta on Star Trek? Wait, what if there were life forms based on carbon, but not organic carbon. What about mineral carbon, diamond, as a basis of life?Taking this concept, author Eugene Goheen writes a very amusing sci-fi tale about Avrum Bengel, who loves selling rubber tires and failed to complete law school years ago, burning out when he lost a debating contest &quot;Evolution will never erase the image of Man.&quot;Now he's 65 years old (just, it's his birthday) and as a present, he's let go from his job selling his beloved tires. When he sits down at home and polishes off a snack of Fire-Master's best charcoal briquets, you know that this novel is heading straight into not only the funny, but the weird.If you like science fiction with a good dash of humor and speculation, you will not be disappointed by &quot;Inside the Rainbow.&quot; I was absolutely captivated by page three.

From 'if this goes on' dystopian speculation to nanotechnology to politics to artificial intelligence to carbocrystalline morphing deep-impact quantum implications to the origins and nature of consciousness itself-holy cow, Goheen's novel packs in more ideas than most sci-fi potboilers on the racdks nowadays. I read it in one sitting and had a great time doing it.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"The problem with most introductory books is that they are written in an overly simplistic and long-winded style. The Process of Network Security is different in that respect, and it is indeed an effective introduction to the world of network security.What differentiates this book from other introductory texts is that author Thomas Wadlow treats information systems security not as a set of different technologies, but rather as an integrated process. By viewing security as an evolving process, a network manager can create a security methodology that can develop into a strong foundation for the company's information security program.The book is written for network managers and systems administrators who have been give different security responsibilities within their organizations and provides them with a comprehensive overview of the critical aspects involved with information systems security. While it is, of course, impossible to build security systems that are absolutely secure, the book demonstrates that a thorough process incorporating good designs can isolate security so that problems in one specific area aren't catastrophic to the entire system.Wadlow is an industry veteran, and his experience shines throughout the book. The work covers all the major aspects of information security, including security team building, network monitoring, intrusion detection, and damage control. For those wanting a taste of what information security is all about, in a book written in a real-world format for an intelligent reader, this book is an excellent choice.This review of mine originally appears at http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/000905.html"},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"I teach computer systems management to students here at Harvard University. Every day someone asks me a question that is answered in Mr. Wadlow's book. Here he explains the way to *_think_* about computer security - before you implement any solution. For anyone who has to design a secure computing infrastructure, Mr. Wadlow's book is the book for you! The art of Computing Security has been made clear by Mr. Wadlow's thoughtful discussions of the trade offs. Every manager of computing professionals should read this book. Mr. Wadlow's writing style is entertaining and informative. Spend a morning with this book and your afternoon will be very productive."},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"Mr. Wadlow has written a truly useful book that sorts out the many facets of security and recasts them into a complete and straightforward approach to implementing an effective security organization. The only thing I found wrong with this book is the title because the approach is not confined to network security. This book serves as a model for all IT security, and can be applied to data centers, servers and the other components of a large, complex IT suite.He starts out with the foundation, writing a security policy, and offers excellent advice on how to go about this important task. Policy writing is an art and a science, and it is apparent that Mr. Wadlow knows his stuff here. An ambiguously worded or unenforceable policy is next to worthless and he shows how to avoid both of those pitfalls.I liked the chapter titled &quot;Who is Attacking You?&quot; because it forces you to carefully consider threats and exposures, which is the first step towards crafting a plan for dealing with them. I also liked the chapter on the security design process because it is methodical and repeatable. One of the difficulties in developing an encompassing security approach is driving the stake into the ground, and the process given shows just where to drive it and how to proceed from there. This is a good prelude to the chapter on building a security team, which proposes a sensible structure and completely addresses requirements.The chapters on the technical aspects, such as fortifying network components, physical security, and network monitoring and auditing are true best practices and can be modified to fit other areas of IT (as mentioned at the beginning of this review).As a consultant I particularly liked the chapter that addresses quantifying the value of security. However, this is not only for consultants - security is expensive and requires both dedication and resources, both of which are costly. This material goes a long way towards building a compelling business case for an effective security posture and for proving its ongoing value to management who might think of it as a necessary evil that sucks up more budget share than it is worth. When faced with the wild world of attackers and the internal bean counters it is sometimes difficult to determine who the real enemy is :-)The book ends with excellent chapters on preparing for an attack, handling it and analyzing the aftermath for lessons learned and future preventive measures to incorporate. Overall, this section is the life cycle of an incident and should be carefully read.I obviously like this book a lot. I think it provides a structure and method for designing and implementing a sound and effective security strategy. Moreover, the approach can easily be expanded to encompass off of IT, making this book all the more valuable. I strongly recommend and would give it more than 5 stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"Full disclosure: I was one of the technical reviewers for this book. It was a pleasure to review Wadlow's book because it was the first one I've seen that covers security at the process level (thus its title). While there are several good books on security technology, there are few that effectively discuss how to integrate security into your business processes.Reading this book will help you understand that information security is an on-going process and should be included from the very beginning of any product development cycle. After all, the Internet -- as much as we may feel discomforted by the notion -- no longer operates in its old environment of trust; indeed, it has become a hostile place to do business (sort of like the real world, I guess). Whether you're simply connecting your corporate network to the Internet or are developing the next killer e-commerce app (who isn't?), this book contains valuable information for anyone developing a security architecture and policy.If your organization hasn't yet considered the importance of a formalized security policy or team of specialists, this book will help you create a policy, get management buy-in, and create appropriate teams for handling security incidents."},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"Wadlow's _The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network_ may set a new standard for presenting information about the policies, procedures and designs required to build and operate secure networks.This book contains a plethora top-notch information about secure computer network design and it thoroughly details the policies, standard operating procedures and day-to-day operations and maintenance of a secure network.But also it comes as a pleasant surprise that this book's content does not operate in a void: it includes well thought out information about how to be a network security manager and how his/her staff can peacefully exist within a business organization.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, this book presents boiler plate information and illustrations which allow the reader to begin securing his/her computer network quickly."},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"Wadlow's new book is full of sage and useful guidance for medium to large organizations that are completely dependent upon the Internet. Intended mainly for the chief security officer, or the administrator responsible for information protection, this book is not so much about technology as it is about how to apply technology. It clearly describes how to effectively configure and administer your information systems and your staff in order to prevent security incidents and, when the inevitable does happen, to recover as quickly and completely as possible.With 20 years of relevant experience, the author has done some deep thinking on this subject. As an example, he lists 27 different job functions performed by the security team. Will any organization actually have 27 different security specialists? No, but any security manager would be well-advised to review that list to ensure that all necessary functions are covered by somebody.Wadlow provides helpful ideas on creating an effective security policy-even when management hasn't bought into the idea yet, and has sound advice on both hiring and firing staff. Read the chapters &quot;Preparing for an Attack&quot; and &quot;Handling an Attack&quot; before its too late. Chapters on auditing, log file analysis, and forensics all provide concrete guidance on these difficult processes.The book is filled with helpful analogies that are useful in developing an understanding of the nature of network security. One of the biggest difficulties in training people to become effective in the security arena is in developing the mindset-an innate understanding of information security dynamics. You need a grasp of the big picture to have that intuitive realization that without a constant proactive security effort, you are actually moving backwards. It is a process and Wadlow presents it in a clear and compelling fashion.If you want to think securely-if information security is part of your current or future responsibilities and you'd like a more mature concept of what that entails, then you will find this book invaluable."},{"Title":"The Process of Network Security: Designing and Managing a Safe Network","review":"I got this book and I am happy that I bought it.

Yes, the 4th edition needs to be updated to a 5th edition, but that's the nature of reference books. Also, the thing that made me chuckle the most was this: having used this book (and earlier editions) both personally and professionally for nearly a decade now, I note with regularity that those who don't like this book are one of two types of people: (1) competitors who have written similar (but often less substantial) books or (2) people who have &quot;degrees&quot; from one or more of the schools that Dr. Walston exposes as &quot;less-than-wonderful.&quot; Schools upon which he has justifiably placed the judgment, &quot;Shame.&quot; Hmmm.

Unfortunately, however, there are all too many diploma mills, so-called institutions that are willing to sell a degree to unwary students. When this occurs, the results can be devastating. Schools claiming to be Christian violate the very principles upon which Christianity is founded. Unsuspecting students are robbed, both financially and morally. And somehow the whole purpose of theological education--to equip students with the intellectual and spiritual tools that foster Christian service--is neglected.Where, then, can interested persons turn to determine the legitimacy of non-traditional religious institutions? The answer is simple: *Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Non-Traditionally, 4th Edition* The author, Dr. Rick Walston, does a masterful job sifting through and evaluating the claims of a large number of schools. Thorough, insightful, and sometimes shocking--*Walston's Guide* is an invaluable resource for understanding and appraising non-traditional education options.Maybe you are searching for an alternative to traditional Christian studies. Perhaps you need some criteria for evaluating someone's educational background. Or you might simply desire a handy reference to separate the good educational claimants from those that are bad (and, sometimes, ugly).

The demands of a job, volunteer work, and fixed-schedule classroom hours are often difficult to fit together in a busy life. This is where distance learning schools really meet a vital need in the lives of busy people. However, there are many schools with distance learning programs which simply do not measure up to their traditional counterparts. For the student, as well as for the prospective employer, it is vital to have a resource by which one can begin to identify quality learning options. As a working professional who has been adding to his education, I have taken advantage of Dr. Walston's expertise in this area.

This 5th edition has, sadly, grown in thickness due to the continual misrepresentations of colleges and seminaries out there lead by crooks. However sad it is, Christians are often taken advantage of because of thier naive trust in so-called Christian educators. Regardless of whether or not you want/need an accredited degree, you should read this book first. This book directs students and parents towards quality schools (accredited and non-accredited) where students can be proud of their efforts, degrees, and education.To the shame of many of the colleges within this edition, when informed of their false claims of accreditation, refused to listen or admit to having been duped into false accreditation through a bogus accreditor. Too many colleges would rather have \\"some\\" form of accreditation regardless of the real status of the accreditor; therefore, they are lying to students and presenting a degree of \\"lies\\" to potential students. This is sad because many students have paid for and are presenting their degrees to employers not realizing that their degrees and claims of accreditation are simply unfounded. If the student and the college know that they are misrepresenting thier degrees as such, then shame on them!In summary, get the book; get a quality degree through non-traditional methods, and be proud of your degree without the shame of fraud."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"As the movie reviewers would say, \\"Two thumbs up!\\"This book is a must read for all those considering distant learning.

After becoming somewhat overwhelmed with the the hard work of the required writting course, I picked up this book, which I received with my initial enrollment at CES nearly three years ago, to take a break. When I finished it, in one sense I actually felt more overwhelmed than before starting it because of the amount of \\"colleges\\" led by so-called \\"Christians.\\" In another sense, I felt even more motivated to continue on in my education pursuits, and take advantage of CES high academic values.When I originally applied to CES, I largely did so because of one man's ministry and review of the school: Dr. James White. Though Dr. White is a very reliable source as you can see the result of the legitimacy of his education in various ways throughout his Alpha and Omega ministry, and through his published books, I now see the necessity to dive much deeper in approaching the legitimacy of a particular school. Most things written about in this book I had no idea about beforehand.

If you are looking to study for ministry via distance learning, BUY Walston's new edition, read it carefully, pray hard and THEN make a decision. There are good, sincere distance learning schools out there and Walston will help you separate the wheat from the chaff so that you can graduate with a degree worthy of respect."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"WALSTON'S GUIDE is the best book out there on this topic, i.e., Christian distance learning. He not only gives very clear guidelines about how to judge a school--because there are a lot of diploma mills out there--but he also lists more than 200 schools and explains what they offer through distance learning. Not only that but his good humor throughout the book was a pleasant surprise. I found myself laughing at many of his humorous comments. His delightful humor alone could have kept me turning the pages of this book, but the information about distance learning was the real meat of the book, and the combination of the two is a gold mine."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"I found this book very helpful. The author explains the value of education and the various types of education that is availible. He navigates well through the weeds of schools that are out there.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"Let me say that I joined the ranks of those on amazon who wrote a good review about the book. The book was a blessing and a eye opener. I would recommend that any person looking to go to seminary, traditional or non- traditional get this book before making a decision. This book well help.... the only thing that was sad was the fact that I couldn't give more than 5 stars on amazon. Dr Walston keep this book up to date.... God Bless"},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have read the Walston's Guide 4th editions at least three different times and also looked back at it for information on a number of times in the past. I had a chance to read the 4th edtion again (4th time) before I got this new one. So I will try to give you a objective review based on my memory of what's what between the two.The new Walston guide 5th edtion is a welcome edtion to your library. The new cover looks great. The type setting is much bigger than the old one, which I find much better.The 4th edtion was like 170 pages while this new one is over 300. This tells us that some new things have been put in this edtion. Rick Walston PHD has a introduction written by a former FBI agent who job was to deal with degree mills. This introduction was great. Chapters were rewritten, new schools were added, stories of people using fake degrees were also added. Rick Walston also explained and expanded on other topics as well from his former book. This is still (in my own subjective opinion) the best book on Distances Learning out there wither it's Christian school or not. This book will give you the tools you're need to figure out if the school your going to or think about going to is the right school for you. This will also give you what you need to determine if your pastor, doctor, or whoever you see for whatever reason if thier degree is real. Thank you again, Dr. Walston for your hard work and research."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"As a mother of four teenagers, I read Dr. Walston's Guide with great interest.There was so much I didn't know. The amount of information on the subject of schools, credits and credentials is astronomical. I felt like I was walking through a field of landmines, not knowing whether my next step would be safe, and in the right direction.Fortunately, Dr. Rick Walston provides assistance.Walston has listed hundreds of schools, evaluating each one according to their merits.He tackles arcane jargon and puts it into plain language. He clears away smokescreens, used deliberately by unscrupulous schools to attract the naive.Probably the biggest revelation to me was the accreditation conundrum. It never occurred to me to doubt that a school that says it is accredited, is accredited by a recognized organization. A new question arises, what are recognized organizations? Recognized by whom?Now, having read Walston's Guide, I have some answers. And I am tuned in to the &quot;fine print&quot;, or the &quot;secret code&quot; used by dishonest schools.Walston outlines pros and cons of accredited and unaccredited schools. He describes situations where an unaccredited school (admitting it is unaccredited) can be the better option.Walston provides information on degrees offered non-traditionally. This opens new vistas for students (and parents!) trying to make sense and make choices of the options available.Distance learning is no longer considered &quot;alternative&quot;, second-rate education. This type of study can be done at home for greatly reduced cost.Walston speaks from years of experience. He founded and directs Columbia Evangelical Seminary. He has a long list of educational credentials from the last two decades. He has written numerous articles on education and Christian living which have been published in magazines, newspapers and websites. He has authored and published three books.Dr. Walston has spent over 12 years researching and writing this book. His extensive background brings depth and detail to his Guide, and makes it a valuable and multi-faceted body of work."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"If you're considering going back to school and working on either an undergrad or postgrad degree, Rick Walston's Guide should be considered \\"essential reading.\\" Even if distance learning is not at the top of your list, you should still read this book. It is very well researched and written; there is not another book like it on the market (and I've read several \\"guides to distance learning\\"). In my opinion, this is \\"the\\" book for on the subject.I have a BSBA in Accounting from Central Missouri State University (resident degree) and a Master of the Arts in Biblical Studies from Luther Rice Seminary (now Luther Rice University; distance degree). Recently I started the painful and frustrating search for a good school that offers a solid distance learning program for a guy like me to continue working on his education. I am a Christian missionary in Latin America, a husband, and a father of three grade-school aged children. I can't just up-root my family, leave the ministry, and relocate to a university for a few years to sit in a classroom all day. I need a good, recognized distance learning program. In my search for schools, I ran into Rick Walston and Columbia Evangelical Seminary. And that is how I found out about his book (we have traded several e-mails; Dr. Walston is very personable and friendly, and he answered every one of my e-mails within 24 hours - most before the end of the same work day). Walston's Guide has answered a lot of my questions; it's filled in a lot of the gaps in my understanding of distance learning; and it's given me several more good options to consider in my continuing education.Get the book. Read the book. It'll clear a lot of the \\"fog\\" surrounding distance learning and \\"on-line degrees.\\" Dr. Walston has already done a lot (!) of the footwork for you already in your search for a good school. He also has some very insightful things to say about distance learning, good and bad schools, and the future of academics in the USA. I cannot recommend the book enough for anyone wanting to learn a little more about distance learning."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"Outstanding.

Dr. Walston reveals misleading statements used by colleges in regards to their accreditation.I personally e-mailed Dr. Walston with some questions about an individual college and he responded the same day answering my questuions and giving excellent advice.I highly recommend this book to all those seeking an alternative to the average college education."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"In our fast paced postmodern world, numerous educational options are available. For some, today's rapid changes have helped foster new and creative means to educate. For others, however, recent technologies have been used to mask questionable and sometimes unethical practices.With such a potpourri of educational alternatives, it is imperative to be able to distinguish the valid educational choices from those that are bogus. To this end, there is no better place to turn than Walton's Guide to Christian Distance Learning. Now in its fifth edition, Walston's Guide is the standard for separating the real deals from the pretenders. Thank you, Dr. Walston, once again, for sharing your wise and helpful counsel."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"This book is very very helpful in that it talks about accredited and non-accredited schools in separate listings. It is honest and straightforward about seminaries and Bible study programs, always telling it like it is without mincing words or trying to find a more delicate way to say things. It is very direct and we need more books like this, because educational institutions are a veritible maze, trying to figure out where one should study, what programs there are etc. This book is your guide through all the uncertainties. I give it five stars without hesitation."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"I reviewed the prior edition, and this 5th edition continues the tradition of the best guide for Christian distance learning. I highly recommend it for insight to this sometimes confusing area. I attended traditional schools, Biola University, Talbot School of Theology and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, and they are all excellent institutions. However, I was looking for an alternative and cost-efficient approach to continuing my education when I came upon Dr. Walston's book. It is filled with a wealth of knowledge. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an education, especially if nontraditional approaches to education might be considered. As a result of Dr. Walston's guide, I avoided a number of fatal choices and enrolled in a very rigorous program at Columbia Evangelical Seminary and completed my MDiv. Whether you are looking to continue your education or are simply curious about alternative education, buy this book. It is still a must read."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"This is a great book filled with very useful information.

It could save a student thousands of dollars and a myriad of problems."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm interested in distance education in general, not necessarily Christian distance education.Having said that, I have very mixed feelings about this book. If you read the book from start to finish, you can't help but to like Rick Walston. He strikes me as a good, decent, family man who has devoted his life to Christianity. I commend him for that.However, there are things I don't like in the book. First and foremost, Rick is the founder and current President of Columbia Evangelical Seminary, which he profiles (with a good review) in his book. Conflict of interest?Another thing that worries me is that Rick classifies Greenwich University (an unaccredited school) as a &quot;good school&quot;. Why does this worry me? Because Rick was awarded his Ph.D. in Religious Studies from Greenwich in 1991. Honestly...how else would he describe it? Conflict of interest?One more thing that worries me is that Rick lists certain schools (such as Bethany, Trinity) as &quot;good&quot;, yet they violate his own published guidelines of legitimacy in regards to faculty credentials (accredited v. unaccredited, &quot;homegrown&quot;, etc.). If they violate your own standards, how on earth could they be &quot;good&quot;?Bottom line: This is a good starting point for Christian distance education, but look at the recommendations with a grain of salt. Some programs recommended by Rick are unaccredited (and therefore *much* less useful), so buyer beware."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"My local bookseller told me that Walston's Guide was out of print and the publisher was out of business. Neither of which is true. It is easily available on the intenet. Initally I was very enthused about obtaining this book because I was searching for a source of Distance Christian Education schools. Due to all the positive reviews I read on Amazon's site I felt sure this was the answer to my many questions regarding this topic. I was sorely disappointed, however, I urge everyone who reads this reivew to purchase the book do their own research and come to their own conclusions.About half of the book has varying amounts of value andrelevancy. Most of this part of the book was contributed byJohn Bear, an icon of a author on non-traditional education directories. Walston's and Bear's Guide, a joint effort was published in 1993. Bear left after that edition. This original (Bear's) section of the book remains basically unchanged as in the 1993 edition. It is a little oudated but the general infomation is still good.The section listing &quot;Acccredited&quot; and so called&quot;Unaccredited&quot; schools of the 1999 edition is patheticallyoutdated. I attempted to contact many of the schools only to find many out of business and two that were for over 10 years.That was very disappointing and annoying to find in a 1999 edition. Obviously this section had not been revised since first published in 1993.In addition, Walston, who owns an unaccreditd school choses to discount, disparage and denigrate 95% of all other unaccredited schools listed that might be comptition for his.This attitude was based on the individual actions of one man in a accrediting agency who chose greed over integrity, thus casting a negative shadow over good school members attempting to offer ligit Christian distance education. Walston would have you believe that all schools having this credential were bad and not worth consideration. Guilt by association, I found this to be conviently self serving for Mr. Walston.(See Chapter 7)One thing that really turned me off on this book was Walston's use of prejudical caustic sarcasm using works like&quot;Shame&quot; and &quot;Three Stooges&quot; along with others to denigrate other schools. Walston arrogantly serves himself up as the great secular authority over non-traditional Christian distanceeducation.After reading and researching the Guide throughly, my opinion is that his Guide is a severly outdated and a biasedself serving book benefiting Mr. Walston and indirectly his own school."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"I stand by my rating, and would be glad to discuss each point you've raised.

I did so because I needed help in sorting out facts from fiction. I had previously studied via distance through a ministry that purported to be a legitimate and scholarly institution. I received my Associates degree in Ministry after reading one book, and completing an open book exam (designed to ensure I read the book). Needless to say, as a person who has been called by the Lord to serve Him full time, it was obvious that this was not a true education.To Rick Walston's book: I read this book, including the school reviews, at LEAST 5 times cover to cover. My copy has dog-earred and worn pages. It has had water on it. It has notes and markings inside it. It has taught me about accreditation and why it is and why it isn't important. I have been to every one of the school's web sites (most addresses are listed in the book, some you must find through google or another search engine) at LEAST 5 times.At last, on July 1, 2002 I was accepted by the school I believe was THE BEST due to the faculty, the type of education (mentoring), the un-biased reccomendations, and the cost (compared to Traditional schools it was a bargain). I have seen first hand that I will gain an actual education (complete with extensive reading, very strict writing requirements, and routine contact with my mentor). I am starting at ground zero (ignoring my earlier mentioned \\"degree\\") and look forward to the journey. I would not have been able to make this prayerful decision with Rick Walston's book.Even though I am already signed up with a school, I still look through this book at least every couple of weeks to review the information.This book is a \\"MUST READ\\" before you invest the money the Lord has given you for your Biblical or Seminary training. We are required to be good stewards of the Lord's money. Spend the [money] (I had mine sent second day air so I could begin research quickly) to purchase this book, then read it and study it. Challenge the statements by visiting the web sites yourself. Call Rick Walston if you disagree with him. But don't spend $8,000 plus on distance education without this small investment first."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"There are many good resources for evaluating distance learning programs and schools. However, one thing that makes Dr. Walston's work stand out is that it is specifically targeted at Christian distance learning, a discipline that has it's own set of special circumstances. Dr. Walston is a retired pastor and founder/director of Columbia Evangelical Seminary ..., which is included in his book. Some may suggest that there is conflict of interest for Dr. Walston to critique a school that he directs or other schools that he has himself attended. But that concern becomes moot in chapter 10 (\\"How to Evaluate a School\\") because the reader is given the tools to evaluate a school for themselves. This gives the prospective student the ability and confidence to affirm Dr. Walston's or any other distance learning guide's assessment of a school or program. And one of the most important assessment tools is the work of the graduates of a particular school. That is after all, the \\"proof in the pudding.\\" I have read several excellent guides on distance learning, but it wasn't until I read Dr. Walston's work that I gained the confidence to actually venture out into the world of distance learning. I am now a distance learning student near the completion of my B.A. Degree with plans to continue into graduate work. If you are interested in Christian education but you cannot pick up and move; if you have questions about accreditation; if wonder if the cost of higher education is worth the investment, this book is for you!

My research led me to WALSTON'S GUIDE and it was though this book that I began to understand the complexity of Distance Learning, and the complexity of accreditation. I have read a other &quot;guides&quot; out there, but this is by far the best, hands down. This book not only lists a couple of hundred schools, but it deals extesively in what I call the &quot;classroom of instruction.&quot; What I mean is that Dr. Walston does not just list facts (though he does that as well), but he teaches the reader what to look for in the convoluted world of DL and accreditation. As I reviewed the other comments about this book, I noted only one negative person, and even he was still somewhat positive.

It is disingenuous, not to mention self-contradictory, to feign disinterest and then offer \\"interested\\" remarks. Some of his opinions, in my opinion, as one who is interested in Christian distance education, are correct but most are illogical.Opinion 1. Rick Walston is a decent guy. Agreed.Opinion 2. Just because Rick Walston is the founder of a school that is profiled in his book-which may legitimately be considered a conflict of interest-does not imply that his assessment is wrong. &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; says that Walston &quot;profiles (with a good review)&quot; his own school. Actually, if one looks carefully at the listing of Columbia Evangelical Seminary (CES), one will notice that the positive superlatives that he has used for other good schools is loudly absent. In other words, all Walston does in the listing of CES is state facts. It would be different if Walston had said, &quot;Columbia Evangelical Seminary is the best one!&quot; A man can say of his son, &quot;He has a 4.0 GPA,&quot; and as long as it is a fact then conflict of interest notwithstanding, the fact is still true.Opinion 3. Concerning Greenwich University . . . there is obviously a lot about that situation that &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; doesn't know. In fact, it was strongly suggested to Dr. Walston that he place Greenwich University in the accredited chapter due to the fact that they are a self-accredited University in Australia, yet he refused to do so based upon the fact that GU is not recognized by the official education department of that country. Next, Walston doesn't believe that G.U. is a good school because he has a degree from it; he has a degree from GU because he believed it was a good school. It appears that &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; has put the cart before the horse.Opinion 4. Concerning certain schools such as Bethany, Trinity as &quot;good,&quot; yet they violate his own published guidelines of legitimacy in regard to faculty credentials (accredited v. unaccredited, &quot;homegrown&quot;, etc.): I've looked at Walston's &quot;legitimacy in regards to faculty credentials,&quot; and I don't find the blatant contradiction that &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; implies. In fact, Rick identifies the top-heavy unaccredited faculty of B.T.S. but goes on to say that they do have people with accredited doctoral degrees as chairpersons over each discipline. To &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; I would say, some things are black and white and some things are gray. It seems to me that Dr. Walston has given enough facts for any interested person to make an informed decision. And that's really the point of such a book. Of Trinity, Walston says that they are a good school but offers two caveats about the school concerning their claims of accreditation and their faculty . . . again, one must weigh these issues and not simply make blanket statements. This seems to me to be what Rick has done.Opinion 5. I'm rather dumbfounded how &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; can identify what he considers to be three or four &quot;things he doesn't like in the book&quot; covering only four schools out of a listing of over 200 schools, and then conclude that all of Walston's reviews should be taken &quot;with a grain of salt.&quot;Let's think for a moment of who has endorsed Walston's Guide: (1) Dr. John Bear, the undisputed expert in distance learning education, the man who has been hired as an educational consultant for various television programs, the latest of which was Good Morning America (March, 2001) in exposing diploma mills and fake degrees. Dr. Bear has also consulted for the FBI in matters related to distance learning, and he authored the best-selling book on the subject (BEAR'S GUIDE) having sold well over 300,000 books! Another reviewer is Jack Kragt. Gee, as the academic sales manager for Zondervan Publishing House, I'd guess that he'd know a thing or two about good books and their validity. Next is Dr. Brinley Jones. Dr. Jones has his Ph.D. from Oxford and is presently the President of the National Library of Wales. Another is Dr. James White, a professional Christian apologist no less, and as such he is an expert in weighing the good and the bad, the true and the false. This says nothing of the other reviewers and their positive comments.Yet, with one sweep of his pen, &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot;-who disingenuously confesses that he is not interested in this topic (but interested enough to make erroneous claims)-calls into question all of the qualifications and expertise of the other reviewers! Some of these other reviewers are able academicians, well-regarded, and internationally known experts in the field. But, never mind them and all of their expertise in the field, let's rather swallow the unchallenged review of &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; (who is he anyway?).However, &quot;Reviewer: btait136&quot; got one thing solidly correct: &quot;If you read the book from start to finish, you can't help but to like Rick Walston.&quot; And, I intend to buy the next edition of Walston's Guide as soon as it becomes available."},{"Title":"Walston's Guide to Christian Distance Learning: Earning Degrees Nontraditionally, 4th edition","review":"I've read a lot of DL guides.

MS. SANTIAGO REALLY OUTDID HERSELF WITH THIS ONE, IT WAS RAW AND DEFINITELY HARD.

JUST GET THE BOOK AND YOU WILL SEE EXACTLY WHO SHE IS."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"Honestly, I would think real hard before I buy this book if I were you. Really it's just my opinion but the book was not all that great I really don't understand the 40 some odd people who gave this book 5 stars! First of all it starts out slow and her writing style and dialogue just didn't work for me I couldn't get into it. It was a struggle it did start to grab my attention in the middle though. There was definitely way too much focus on name brand clothing, which took away from much of the story line. Also timing was off, I was confused because the book started off with Kisa's 21st b-day party but later on in the book she was turning 21 again?? I honestly don't know how old the chick was when the book ended or how much time went by during the whole story. It was a mess! If you are in your teens you may really love this book, I'm 26 so it just didn't do it for me. Sorry!! You should form your own opinion but in my advice...think real hard!"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"This book had me glued to the pages I stayed up til wee hours of the morning reading this book. Kisa was off the hook. Im not gone lie that chick had made, sexy rich man, good friends, and a caring family. What more could any woman ask for. Danielle Santiago did her thing I can't wait to finish Grindin cuase this book is off the hook too."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"Kisa was my kind of girl, she was an independent woman at a young age with her head in the game and knew what she was doing. I loved the romance, and the special things Sincere did for Kisa. I read this book in a day and half. GREAT BOOK, I LOVED IT!!!

Kisa Kane is just like that. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"After reading years of depressing Black books I stopped reading them. But Danielle S. has changed my perspective. Little Ghetto Girl...now this is what's up...the good side and bad side of the hustle are portrayed, scheming friends and family are revealed and the characters are true to the game. The sex scenes are great and seperates the men from the boys. But you still get the message...hustling comes with a price- are you willing to pay it?"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"Ms. Santiago did the damn thang with this book.

This book was actually a pain to read."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"I got this book because of all the rave reviews....people you really need to broaden your reading selections. I read all types of books..african american literature is my favorite. This book was OK it had a plot..but it was poorly put together. The timetable was all over the place...in a matter of 10 pages 7 months had went by in one chapter. The final straw was the used of the major brands..the author would named every brand she was wearing from head to toe every time she changed her clothes....It was a bit tooooo much. Beyonce couldnt afford to dress the way Kisa Kane was dressing...it was to much. So many authors are trying to copycat the writing style of \\"the coldest winter ever\\" and that book was great..but to many authors have wrote bad versions of the book to the point they have killed the horse. This same book could have been written better by better character development....I read the whole book and cant really tell you one thing I know about each character other than they loved to shop and spend money and sold drugs....Danielle you have great ideas...you need to expand on your ideas and tell the story in a more better fashion"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"I mistakenly bought this novel based off the reviews on this page. Next time I will be sure to take into account who the reviewers are because I'm trying very hard to try and understand how so many people have given this book 5 stars! While it is not a terrible read, it can be somewhat painful to read at times. The writing style IMO is very poor. There is a huge lack of correct punctuation which happens to be a pet peeve of mine and also causes me to become easily disgusted. I read alot of urban novels and believe me, I understand the lingo, but there is way too much \\"Ma\\" and \\"Pa's\\" throughout this novel. I also understand that this may be the way that some NYers address one another, but for me, it was simply unbearable. I feel like the writer needs to practice her craft a little more because her writing style feels so elementary. She spends way too much time trying to impress the readers by celebrity namedropping as well as by displaying her vast knowledge of top tier designers.All those of you who gave this book 5 stars and who compared it to THE COLDEST WINTER EVER (Are you freaking kidding me?!?!?) must be young teenage girls under the age of 17 because anyone in their right mind could see that the two novels are by no means even in the same category!"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"I bought this book based soley on these reviews.I was extremely disappointed.From now on i will pay more attention to the negative reviews as I agree with all of them.You all should be more honest when writing your reviews because some people actually pay attention to them.thanks"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"i enjoy that book alot read it a while back now getting ready to read the next one."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK NEVER READ ANY OF HER BOOKS BEFORE SHE IS A GREAT AUTHOR"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"For a first time author Ms. Santiago definately shines.

IF YOU LIKE GANGSTA BOOKS THEN YOU MUST HAVE LITTLE GHETTO GIRL."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"Alright, first of the book was slow, I kept getting a feeling of deja vu, but it's because the book was repeating itself. Kisa started out so \\"hard\\" and such an independent hustler. But she turned into a whiny ok. The grammar and lingo was ridiculous I understand \\"hood\\" but it was serious overload. Typos galore. And nothing but a bunch of shopping and designer name dropping. I know everything the characters wore, but nothing much about them at all. And if they were so successful and worth over 20 mil, running 5 legal businesses between the two of them (kisa and Sincere) why in the he** were they still hustling dope? And after getting busted why would opt to go back to doing it for two more years? And mind you I only read the first 4 chapters. I can't read this. I don't recommend it at all. Save your money please."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"I really had no intentions on buying this books but it seemed to eb one of the better reviewed items online and everyone had such wonderful things to say about so I thought hmm why not. I hate for an author to be so illiterate I took a star of for that. And I hated her writing style I look a star off for that. I would actually rate this book with 2 stars. The story line was pretty good but it had alot to be desired. The plot was not well thought out. I figured out everything before it even happen so there were no surprises in there for me. She made everything so blunt and odvious. The book showed some type potential so i just gave it 3. Another thing i could not understand is how one girl could be spoiled by everybody. Everybody looked at Kisa like she was God or something and the only one that wasn't kissing her behind was her sister. I hated the main character and had to force myself to finish reading it. The more I read the more disgusted I became please don't waste your money"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"This book was like a breath of fresh air! It was so real, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Kisa and Sincere had that Bobby Brown/Whitney Houston love thang going on! Never a dull moment. Kisa could play the game any which way Sincere wanted. She was a strong woman that for better or worse, she loved her man! But, she kept it real. The main thing I like about the books on this level, is that you never have trouble visualizing that the characters are African-American. Back in the day, it was rare for 'us' to actually have a love story! This is a great read that in essence shows that 'love will conquer all.'"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"I brought this book months ago after people at the hair dressers kept raving about it.

She takes no shortcuts when it comes to the game, the streets, her man, and her child.Sincere, Kisa's husband, is the \\"Dapper Don\\" of the hustling world. He tries to master his wife in the same manner that he has mastered the streets, but it doesn't work; Kisa is her own woman . . . although she will ride or die for her man, she refuses to roll over and be trampled on. Sincere means well, but there are times when he becomes intimidated by the strength and forcefulness of his wife; and he takes their world and turns it upside down.Nevertheless Kisa continues to do her thing but enough becomes enough when she tires of Sincere's infidelity. A dose of his own medicine knocks him off his feet and takes him for an action packed ride of sex, money, murder, and lies.Together, Kisa and Sincere, take us on a journey that we will never forget! In this love story there are times when love conquers all and then there are times when love is not enough. The reader has to be prepared for this page-turner because this is one storythat you will never forget."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"Santiago arrived to get down in &quot;Little Ghetto Girl&quot;. Whew! Kisa and Sincere are good people, but their bodies are infected with the H.I.-&quot;Street&quot; virus. Hustla's, rollers, and ballers, oh my! Santiago did an excellent job taking us to the street, hospital, bedroom, club, and prison. Oh, least I forget, the shopping mall. &quot;Little Ghetto Girl&quot; epitomizes how wanting to do right is not all you need to get off the streets. It literally breaks down how simple loving and genuine folk can use that ugly street beast to handle business. If you are looking for drama, Santiago can give you a seven course meal with &quot;Little Ghetto Girl&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"this book is a very good read it keeps you turning the page you will not want to put it down so you can find out whats going to happen next. If you like True To The Game or The Coldest Winter you will love this book"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"At a young age, Kisa Kane made a life for herself in the game, but has discontinued her street life, planning to build a legitimate business from the ground up. Unexpectedly, Sincere Montego, a local hustler, decides he wants a serious relationship. Kisa hesitates as she's unsure if she wants to be connected to the game again. Following her heart and focusing somewhat on the lifestyle he could provide, she becomes involved with him and they later marry. Shortly afterwards, she is faced with some major drama and has to decide how she will react, and just how embedded she will become in Sincere's operation. Armed with good friends, street smarts, and a strong business acumen, she does what she has to do to support her family.LITTLE GHETTO GIRL by Danielle Santiago is hard-core and gritty, with the relationship drama and thirst for love most readers will be able to relate to. I especially applaud Santiago for her realistic and suspenseful ending, in which she clearly shows that love can heal most wounds, but sometimes you just have to keep it \\"gangsta.\\" The characterizations of both main characters and their crew appealed to me because they were believable and their growth was evident. Santiago never glorified the street life or the lifestyle; she provided a well-rounded view of situations, the good and the bad. I also liked how Santiago allowed the character's flaws to complement their strong points and issues.Reviewed by Tee C.

HEr man's name was Sin and he was the Biggest dopeboy in Brooklyn. Just his name striked fear into the heart of every man.The day came when Kisa thought everything would change. Sin wanted her to be wifey. But instead of getting out of the game she ended up having to take over his operation ater he went to jail after a set-up. She was a ride or die chick for her man.This book was alright but the plot was nto well thought out. The characters were not well developed, and there were many many typos.

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK DANIELLE"},{"Title":"Little Ghetto Girl","review":"This was the first novel by Danielle Santiago that I have read and I am not impressed with her writing. The story plot was pretty interesting which kept me still interested in this novel. However the style of writing in this particular book was not attractive. Each chapter was prolonged in an \\"annoying way\\" and could have easily been ended nonchalantly. In addition, the way the author bragged about the Chanel dress or Prada shoes the characters were wearing was extremely not necessary. In addition, the editing mistakes in this novel could have been avoided. It was also sad to say, but the story line seemed to be \\"all over the place\\" while reading this story. But I am here to explain the actual novel, lol so here goes.The Novel \\"Little Ghetto Girl\\" was based upon the character Kisa or better yet known on the streets as Kane. Kisa is a hardcore 21 year old woman who knows the ends and outs about the streets of New York. Selling drugs as a \\"youngin\\" and now the kingpin of a cocaine business, others seemed to be underestimating her nature.On the opposing side of that hardcore exterior she puts out on the streets, she had a soft spot for a man (also a dealer) by the name of Sincere. Their relationship was something that any young girl in love went through.

GOOD READ!"},{"Title":"Superman and Batman: World's Funnest by Evan Dorkin and Friends","review":"As a longtime reader of the Superman and Batman comics, two of the characters that I disliked the most are Bat-Mite and Mr. Mxyzptlk. The introduction of magic into the stories meant that anything could happen, all that was necessary to create or get out of any situation was, \\"then a spell was cast.\\" In this story, the two magical imps get together and have a battle between themselves that goes across dimensions, universes and comic book stories.The dialog and storyline is over-the-top corny, as decades of comic booklore are the victim of satire. I found it obnoxiously funny as the two imps destroy superhero after superhero and universe after universe as they battle each other. It appealed to my sense of the absurdity of introducing magic into the Superman and Batman stories, for such creatures could never really be defeated. The two creatures using planets as projectile weapons against each other was fitting. After all, where does the power of their magic end?"},{"Title":"Superman and Batman: World's Funnest by Evan Dorkin and Friends","review":"Evan Dorkin'sSuperman and Batman: World's Funnest by Evan Dorkin and Friendsis, without a doubt, a fantastic piece of comic deconstruction; featuring fun, satirical writing, great art, and a serious sense of gloriously twisted nihilism.In a nutshell, Superman and Batman's extra-dimensional nuisances, Mr. Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite, get into a squabble that takes them across many of the various dimensions of the DC Universe, largely drawn by their original artists. Earth One and Two are here, as are Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight' Universe, Alex Ross and Mark Waid'sKingdom Come, and a plethora of others.To say more would be to give away the plot. Suffice to say that Dorkin's allowed free reign, and uses it to spectacular effect.The only caveat I'd make is that it's best to be well aware of the history of the DC Universe before reading this. It's a graphic-novel-length in-joke, really. But such a joke it is! I couldn't recommend it more. Loved it."},{"Title":"Erica (Springflower Books #2)","review":"this was a excellent book.

In other words, the book has few learning aids that the best textbooks use on every page to emphasized, prioritized etc. Some pages go on with just black and white text.They have tons of support information and examples incorporated with the text. This blurs the line between support material and key learning objectives. Chapter 4, for example is about 40 pages total.

The book is a laborious read, more so than any other textbook I can remember. At times, I'm positive Lamb is merely dawdling and filling up pages to reach some sort of 30 page chapter quota.The pro is that there are many things covered in the book, and very extensively. The con is that it is much too extensive, my classmates and I found ourselves skimming through things that were just not necessary. Things that can be explained in a small paragraph at most, take up one and half pages. The authors tend to go on, piling up with multiple facts and situations to the point that the reader no longer remembers what was the purpose of the chapter. And definitions and concepts explained can be easily rewritten to communicate better to students.Another problem is the lack of a chapter summary. In a book this tedious and wordy, it would be extremely helpful to quickly review and refresh everything in the chapters. The authors should have taken their own advice and researched their market, asking what students want, and how to speak to them, because this book is filled with terms and explanations that need clarification."},{"Title":"Marketing With Infotrac","review":"I ordered this book on line for class and received it within the expected timeframe.

He proposes that most of life's difficulties may be reduced to separation anxiety. Life transitions cause distress (i.e., graduation, relocation, loss of a loved one). People can best learn to cope with separation anxiety by making it the central issue in therapy. This is accomplished by limiting the number of therapy sessions to 12. In other words, the client will experience a new separation (life transition)in a therapeutic setting. On a specified day, a final session will occur. The quality relationship that has been developed with the therapist will end. During the intervening sessions, the therapist teaches the client how to address their own needs for meaningful interaction. The final sessions deal with the client's reaction to termination. Accoding to Mann, he most satisfying state is one in which &quot;the person needs others, enjoys others, and prefers others but if deprived of others, can still give them up and find others.&quot; Fixing the time limit also brings treatment within a practical period for research by allowing for quantification and better control of treatment variables."},{"Title":"Time-Limited Psychotherapy (Commonwealth Fund Book)","review":"I liked the other single review of Mann's book, but 9 years later I find additional reasons to cherish Mann's contribution. Not only was James Mann a pioneer in time-limited psychotherapy, he was a pioneer in the field of short-term therapy - period. His concept of the \\"chronically endured pain\\" is brilliant and is the focus of each therapy, which is verbalized to the patient by the end of the very first session or at the beginning of the second session. I also found his explanation compelling as to why other therapies that go on and on indefinitely are inefficient.I found this book over 25 years ago as a graduate student and used the model at an internship with an out-patient hospital population (family medicine) in an impoverished neighborhood. I still remember my own best verbalization of the chronically endured pain. A resident came to me for help after a woman, commonly known as a hypochondriac because of her weekly visits that produced no other diagnosis, complained of heart pain but ran out of his office after he pulled out his stethoscope and said he would check her out for a possible heart attack. I checked her chart and noticed that her son had committed suicide or had been murdered almost a year before. I called her and asked if she would mind talking with me, found her grateful to do so, and before long suggested that perhaps she was not having a \\"heart attack\\", but a \\"broken heart\\". She became my first successful patient of Mann's method. The organization of the treatment plan is so easy to understand and apply, that at the time of my internship I had a successful case load that was larger than that of the three other interns combined, because of referrals from satisfied patients.Of course such a focused therapy does not \\"cure\\" all of life's problems and one should expect that people who have experienced the therapy might return in time for another round, for some different problem. This book, first published in 1973, is still timely. Although I have expanded my practice to include other methods of short-term psychotherapies, I recommend this book to students and interns who are dissatisfied with their clinical education and supervised experience as they work with much more difficult patient populations than their education has prepared them for. I have not heard that their supervisors are anything but pleased with the results."},{"Title":"Same Jesus...Same Church?","review":"This book is not about the differences between denominations, but about the flawed thinking that drives the conflict creating denominational differences.

(At least it wasn't as bad as the Disney-fication of the black academic comic novel, Krippendorf's Tribe.)"},{"Title":"The Shipping News: A Screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs","review":"DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE until you have read the book. While &quot;The Shipping News&quot; film is enjoyable it does not accurately portray the characters of Annie Proulx. In the book, the characters are not simply meshed into your memory as they are in the film. For example, the relationship Quoyle develops with Wavey happens over the course of many trials that both must endure before gaining the other's trust. However, the film version portrays their relationship as nearly instantaneous in that they see one another, have a couple conversations, and have one fight towards the end. Is that a fair representation of the careful and elequent caracterizations Proulx enmeshes our psyches in? No. In other ways, too, the film does a great injustice; but it would be a great disservice to whomever reads this to divulge too much and ruin the plot.My point is very simple. The film version of &quot;The Shipping News&quot; takes out so much of the original substance by deleting the life stories of some very important characters (and some characters themselves) as well as moving the plot around at an inconsistent level that the viewer is left with more of a blueprint of Annie Proulx's aesthetic and charming brilliance than a final draft.If you are one of those people who hopes to get by with a minimum knowledge of the characters in books, then this film is just for you. On the other hand, if you are a person who craves to understand what is important about the story and all the elements within it, I implore you to read the book before seeing the movie. You will be able to see the pitfalls of the movie that the book explains in a very well-defined manner.Take your pick::0) Book first: Strong comprehension of the material:0( Movie first: Poor comprehension of what is taking place before your eyes"},{"Title":"The Shipping News: A Screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs","review":"The Shipping News is an enjoyable fictional novel written by Anne Proulx, which follows the life of Quoyle, a man whose entire life has been littered with misadventures. It is a story that tracks Quoyle's barely tolerable life as he travels from one dead-end job to the next. Eventually Quoyle finds a job as a reporter for a small newspaper. He had originally applied to be an ink setter. However, the Editor of the paper told Quoyle that he needed reporters, not ink setters.After losing his parents to suicide, an utterly destroyed Quoyle looks to his dead-beat wife for guidance. Her response: Taking their two daughters and leaving with one of her many &quot;friends&quot;, as Quoyle calls them.Shortly after a crucial area of the novel, Quoyle is reunited with his daughters, as well as a long lost Aunt. The small group decides to move back to Quoyle's ancestral land in an attempt to repair their lives.As the novel progresses we see Quoyle grow from a timid, depressed man, who migrates from job to job, into a man full of love for both his family and his work.Overall I believe the story is well written. Both the vocabulary and the sentence structure are easy to understand, and the readability helps the story to fluidly flow from beginning to end. Make no mistake, there are some graphic scenes depicted in the book, which aren't suitable for the younger audience.Proulx writes in a manner that makes the plot quite believable. Proulx' writing also helps to create a realistic reality, one where the characters to interact amongst themselves and one another in. The characters themselves are quite remarkable as well, and we can see them mature as their lives unfold before our eyes. All in all, The Shipping News is a thoroughly enjoyable, though sometimes shocking read from beginning to end.Coming from a fairly knowledgeable reader, this book is a decent read if you have some free time. But this isn't one of those novels that shouts exceptional quality or style. It will tide you over until one of those groundbreaking novels does come out."},{"Title":"Marine Air","review":"As a former Marine and combat vet, I owe my life to a couple of Marine pilots out there.

Based in large part on interviews with over 70 pilots and aircrew, Dorr's book covers the whole sweep of Marine aviation from Grumman Wildcats to McDonnell F/A-18 Hornets.In the fifty years of air combat covered by Dorr, the Marines flew a variety of aircraft in harm's way - Wildcats, Corsairs, Skyraiders, helos, Skyknights, A-4s, F-4s, Intruders, you name it. Whatever your interest in Marine aviation, there's something for everyone in this book -dogfights, air-to-mud, rescue missions in early helos, etc. A few familiar names and tales crop up - John Bolt, John Cummings, etc. - but, by and large, the first-hand accounts are new and very interesting.

Hess was not the intended target of the operation, but so wholeheartedly believed this swindle that he flew to Britain with Hitler's blessing to meet with various British politicians and a representative of King George VI.The author also goes on to argue that this deception was pivotal in convincing Hitler to attack Russia, mistakenly believing that peace with Britain could be achieved. This is perhaps even more sensational than the first half of the thesis.Before considering the claims made by Allen, there are some important criticisms to be made of the work. The first is that, although the book seems well researched, there were some notable omissions from the bibliography. The first was Roy Jenkins' magnificent biography of Churchill, which complements Martin Gilbert's biography in a number of significant areas. This is critical to Allen's work because it contains somewhat contrary views of Churchill's relations with some of the actors in this plot.Also missing was Denniston's work on the negotiations by which Churchill unsuccessfully attempted to bring Turkey into the war on Britain's side in 1940-41 and later. This is useful to understand to properly consider Allen's second claim about invasion of Russia.It may be that these omissions from the source material are justifiable, but the book also has shortcomings in the course of its arguments themselves. Having read the book, I am entirely disposed to believe that there was a secret plot by SO1 to engage the German hierarchy in fake peace negotiations, and that this was the reason for Hess parachuting into Britain in May 1941. This should be enough to make the book an important contribution to the history of the second world war. This also makes it a important work on the black arts of the intelligence world.Sadly, I am not convinced that this coup was critical in persuading Hitler to invade Russia. Hess landed in Britain over five weeks before the invasion of Russia. In the intervening period, it should have been patently obvious to Hitler that Britain would not sue for peace. How then could it be the basis for Hitler's fatal mistake in invading Russia? The best that Allen can come up with is that Hitler became deprived of his closest confidant, and needed to go ahead with the invasion lest he become vulnerable to a coup in 1941. To prove this the author needs to do much, much more, and he can't.Incidentally, I think the book's most significant contirbution is in augmenting the growing body of work on how Britain carried out a psyops campaign to secure America's entry into the war. Churchill was living on a knife edge waiting for Rooseveldt, and the suggestion that Germany might have agreed a peace treaty in 1940-41 would have put paid to that conclusively. In spite of its shortcomings, this is a good book, and will advance our understanding of the events before America's entry into the war at the end of 1941."},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","review":"The Man who knew too muchMartin Allen\`s book The Hitler/Hess Deception\\" deals with the fate of Rudolf Hess who had been, at one time, Hitler\`s deputy and who, in his day, carried the epithet the conscience of the party\\". He was condemned to life imprisonment and served time for half a century until he was found hanged in the prison at Spandau whose only remaining prisoner he then was.He had left Germany in May, 1941, under mysterious circumstances, and was held essentially incommunicado ever since. At that time, the Nazis had instituted a number of antisemitic laws, they had instigated or at least tolerated a pogrom, and were following an expansionist and aggressive policy, but with some hindsight, one wonders why this man had to be shut up for the rest of his life, whereas other figures among Hitler\`s close associates who had played a more active role for a much longer time, were released from jail after a number of years that appear reasonable under normal legal aspects.The author has gathered together the shreds of evidence that remained after the British in 1945 had collected and destroyed whatever pertinent files they were able to put their hands on and neutralized\\" undesirable witnesses. He shows that the Hess incident\\" - Hess\` solo flight to Scotland in May, 1941, a month before Germany attacked the Soviet Union - was not at all the feat of a madman decided on at the spur of the moment that it was later made to appear by both the British and the German side. Even (nay, particularly!) Hitler\`s deputy could not just get into his personal Messerschmitt 110 and take off for the 1000 mile flight to Prestwick without major technical and logistic preparations in Germany, along the way, and at the other end.The book explains that the flight as such was the result of a sting operation devised by Britain\`s Strategic Operations staff, aimed at making Hitler believe that the British government could be toppled, peace could be made in the West, and the Germans would be able to affront the Soviets without having to worry about their western flank.According to Allen, in the year prior to Hess\` flight, there had been numerous contacts, mainly in (neutral) Spain and Switzerland, between British representatives and German politicians and intellectuals. The talks in Scotland were to be, as it were, the touchstone of the matter. As time was getting short for the Germans, Hess convinced Hitler that the German delegate should not be a mere emissary acting under orders but a political figure able to take decisions on the spot - Rudolf Hess.In the end, it makes little difference whether the British were thrown into complete disarray, as Allen asserts, when unexpectedly Hess turned up or whether a lower-grade delegate would have been able to fly safely back to Germany and report. The British sting operation was effective enough in getting Hitler to continue with his preparations for the war against the Soviet Union and thus remove pressure from Britain. To what extent the British actively encouraged the Germans in their plans or whether or not they went so far as to promise support cannot be ascertained at the present time - whatever files still exist seem to be under lock and key for another dozen years or so.What is frightening about the events Allen describes is the apparent lack of scruple with which the British government went about setting the two dictatorships up against each other. The outcome of this duel was not at all certain, for if weather conditions in late 1941 had been just a little more favorable for the German side, the Soviet empire might well have toppled and Britain would then have had to face a Germany extending from the Channel coast to the Urals. This unpleasant but entirely possible risk for Britain is begging the question to what extent Churchill, in order to forestall such a potentially horrifying scenario, did not somehow play a double game by keeping the Soviets informed, and assured of future Allied aid.In this connection, some US and a few Russian historians have recently argued that Stalin, in 1941, was himself preparing to attack Germany. Considering the recent revelations by Christopher Andrew and Vasili Motrokhin on the activities of the Cambridge Five\\", it is entirely conceivable that, officially or unofficially, British sources kept Stalin informed of the negotiations. For a man like Stalin, whose distrust was legendary, the obvious reaction would have been to prepare against a German attack, possibly by a pre-emptive strike.Regardless of who, Stalin or Hitler, would eventually win that confrontation, the only thing that was certain, even in 1941, is that such a war would spell the end of freedom for most of the still independent states in Central and Eastern Europe. The only foreseeable difference would have been that, under Soviet rule, the Slavic states might fare slightly better, whereas countries like Hungary or Romania would have found Hitler somewhat more accomodating. In any case, the fate of the lands in question should have been clear to the Western world when the Germans discovered, in 1943, the graves of thousands of Polish officers murdered by the Soviets two years earlier. However, by then it was too late, the Western powers preferred not to take too close a look at the implications, and chose to abandon those countries to the Soviets for the next half century."},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","review":"Seeing as this book has just 3 stars at the moment, which I feel is not truly representative, I thought I should throw in my 5 stars, maybe helping boost the book to its more deserved 4 stars. The first part of the theory, on why Hess flew to Scotland, is convincing. Perhaps linking the Duke's later plane crash with the whole episode is a bit of a stretch, but even so, it is not outlandish and presented the way it is, with plenty of convincing circumstantial evidence, quite believable. Highly recommended as both historically interesting as well as an absorbing read I got through in a few days."},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","review":"Overall, I thought this was a well-written story about the flight of Hess to Scotland and the policy and bureaucratic machinations through which the British put themselves to fool Hitler into thinking an alternative, anti-Churchill peace faction existed that would do a deal with him. Mr. Albert can get a bit melodramatic at times, but I found his writing nonetheless to be quite solid in that it moved the story along quite well. Be forewarned - Mr. Albert engages in a good deal of speculation; for example, a recording of a key conversation may not exist, but Mr. Albert would have you believe that such and such \\"had\\" to be the topic of discussion. That doesn't necessarily make his theories or main thesis wrong, it's just something to keep in mind as more evidence becomes available over the next several years.Having read many histories of the Third Reich and World War II, I'm convinced that Hitler was going to invade the Soviet Union in 1941 no matter what Britian or anyone else did. He had definite military and strategic reasons for attacking when he did, whether or not you think such reasons were strategically sound. (I do not believe they were.)"},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","review":"If readers carry out a web search for: Martin Allen forgeries - they will find that the book may well be a work of fiction.Alternatively, a search for an article in The Guardian newspaper in the UK titled \\"The 29 fakes behind a rewriting of history\\" dated 5 May 2008 might also be useful."},{"Title":"The Hitler/Hess Deception","review":"So good it could have been written by MI5. A very untidy but neatly packaged ending. The whole raison d'etre of Allen's otherwise well-written book totally falls down after Hess 'flies' because there isn't a shred of proof offered that the the man that 'landed' was actually Rudolf Hess. In fact the converse is true - the book assumes, as so many others have done, that he was the real Deputy Fuhrer.The real Hess lies under the N. Sea, where Goering, Himmler and Adolf Galland put him, and the man that flew in was a Himmler plant, a 'double', which is why everyone wrote him off as a complete ignoramus. So you see, the Nazis had a sense of humour.It would have been politcally quite impossible to imprison - or kill - the real Deputy Fuhrer - if he had come on a peace mission with genuine intentions (however misguided), and such acts would have run the risk of the terrible retribution from Hitler. However, after the event, in Germany, it was business as usual. Hess gone mad? Why were the Nazis so relaxed about it all?How the man who was retained in Spandau prison was kept quiet for so long is an interesting question which has never been answered, neither in this book nor any other yet published.Was this the man that flew in - or a double's double this time put in place by the British, an inmate from a prison camp in the Isle of Man? Why were Hess's relatives so determined to prevent exhumation or DNA testing of the body of the prisoner? Were they afraid to suffer the same fate as the Haushofers? Was this German 'sippenhaft' or British 'sippenhaft' work or a bit of both?"},{"Title":"Quit Your Day Job!: How to Sleep Late, Do What You Enjoy, and Make a Ton of Money as a Writer","review":"This books earns the four stars by being interesting and helpful.

In order to achieve the first goal, Hofstadter uses a trick familiar to every gadfly and pickle barrel orator; he simply argues the opposite of the accepted wisdom. Thus, his chapter headings include: I. The Founding Fathers: an Age of Realism; II. Thomas Jefferson: the Aristocrat as Democrat; III. Andrew Jackson and the Rise of Liberal Capitalism; IX. Theodore Roosevelt: the Conservative as Progressive; and X. Woodrow Wilson: the Conservative as Liberal. Get it? The Founders weren't idealists but realists. The liberal icons of the Left--Jefferson, Jackson, TR and Wilson--were actually all conservatives. This continues right up to FDR, who despite a brief and half-hearted break from this past, refuses to go along with the most farsighted and sweeping aspects of the New Deal. As this version of American history unfolds, we're treated to a kind of grand conspiracy theory whereby the leaders of the Left turn out to be wolves in sheep's clothing, secretly supporting the system and channeling discontent back into heterodoxy.Then comes the hammer blow, because do you know what all of these schemers and dupes, either naively or maliciously, preached and believed in? As Hofstadter scornfully informs us, all of them believed in individualism, free markets, competition, equality of opportunity and all of those hoary old shibboleths that had been totally discredited by 1948 and would surely never again see the light of day:The things Hoover believed in--efficiency, enterprise, opportunity, individualism, substantial laissez-faire, personal success, material welfare--were all in the dominant American tradition. The ideas he represented--ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after 1929--were precisely the same ideas that in the remoter past of the nineteenth century and the more immediate past of the New Era had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of Americans. In the language of Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln these ideas had been fresh and invigorating; in the language of Herbert Hoover they seemed stale and oppressive. It is a significant fact that in the crisis of the thirties the man who represented these conceptions found himself unable even to communicate himself and what he stood for. Almost overnight his essential beliefs had become outlandish and unintelligible. The victim of his faith in the power of capitalism to survive and prosper without gigantic government props, Hoover was the last presidential spokesman of the hallowed doctrines of laissez-faire liberalism, and his departure from Washington marked the decline of a great tradition.Hofstadter later asks of Hoover: &quot;Could he have seriously believed that free enterprise might be restored to the postwar world?&quot; This is what we mean when we speak of hubris in Greek tragedy. It would be amusing if Hofstadter and his ilk had not proceeded to do so much harm with their abandonment of American values and traditions and their eager embrace of a centralized planned economy. It's really too bad that he died so young. I'd have liked to have seen him explain away the rise of Ronald Reagan and the Opportunity Society.This book is profoundly awful. It is wrong in its major theses, informed by a really snide tone of self congratulation and, in celebrating the worst moment in the history of American governance (the rise of the Social Welfare State), fails to reckon with the fundamental tension in American history (indeed in all of human history), the ongoing struggle between the forces of freedom and the advocates of security. I don't doubt that this book was influential, and in that sense great, but to call it one of the best nonfiction books of the century is to abuse truth, defile common sense and elevate partisan political loyalties over clear eyed analysis.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"This book was very biased and did not tell the reader the whole concerning the actualities of the time...so I believe that this book does not deserve to ever be printed again...it just tells the autrocities that the people performed, so i dont think that this book was very good!"},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"\\"American Political Tradition\\" became an immediate milestone in the field of American political study, propelling author Richard Hofstadter to the frontal ranks of historians at the age of 32 upon its publication in 1948. The history professor at Columbia University would ultimately win 2 Pulitzer Prizes before dying at the age of 54 in 1970.The point Hofstadter consistently made is how important pragmatic considerations were in the evolution of the great political shakers and movers of American political annals. He rejects the view of historian Charles Beard and others about the impact of economic determinism in the foundation and shaping of early America. Hofstadter does not discount its impact, but cites the pragmatic necessity of studious compromise involving the interests of important American sociological groups which were often disparate, such as the manufacturing interests of the north and the rural farming interests of the south, as well as slavery and anti-slavery interests. The need for compromise influenced Thomas Jefferson in constructing a U.S. Constitution, which relied on the separation powers doctrine of English philosopher John Locke and that of separation of powers advanced by French social scientist Montesquieu.The chapter on Franklin Delano Roosevelt is fascinating as a study in political pragmatism. Roosevelt ran on a Democratic Party platform for 1932 which rivals one of the most conservative doctrines ever put on paper by an American political party. He initially criticized incumbent President Herbert Hoover for spending too much money in dealing with the Depression and its related effects. Once in office he changed his mind and forged a government activist agenda embraced by progressive reformers.Abraham Lincoln is studied in detail as well within the framework of a very astute political figure with his eye squarely on success in that arena from the beginning, where the \\"railsplitter\\" image played well with voters. He purposely straddled the fence on the slavery issue since there was much controversy surrounding the issue even within the fledgling Republican Party which he joined after the Whig Party folded, despite its reputation for being an essentially anti-slavery party.Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson are evaluated as two important political figures who perpetually juggled conservative basic instincts against the need they believed existed for certain progressive systemic reforms. For Roosevelt this meant anti-trust legislation and conservation, while Wilson, whose traditional Virginia conservative roots left him unwilling to budge in the field of race relations, nonetheless undertook mighty electoral reforms embraced by William Jennings Bryan and the populist movement. Bryan is another figure covered in the book.The chapter of Herbert Hoover is also fascinating. Hofstadter envisioned him as the last of the laissez-faire American presidents. In the wake of the great upheavals occurring in America, particularly related to the Great Depression, a political pragmatism later advanced by Roosevelt to stem the tide of unrest was eschewed by Hoover."},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"The classic story of American History, as told by Richard Hofstadter, has rightly come to be thought of as a masterpiece of American history since its original publication in 1948. This well deserved reputation comes from the rich storytelling, attention to detail, and thoughtful and complete narrative Hofstadter puts forward in this book.Hofstadter takes as his guide one figure from each generation starting from the beginning of the Republic, and through biographical sketch describes both the historical figure and the time period he is depicting. Beginning with Jefferson and including people such as Jackson, Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt, Hofstadter demonstrates how a combination of the great men and the times they lived in shaped what have come down to us as the leading tradition in American politics: the belief in American greatness, individualism, and compassion.The most significant contribution of this book is to show how these men, who have come down to us as legendary and nearly mythological figures were very much political animals. Just like Bill Clinton and George Bush make decisions today based on political calculation, so to do Lincoln and Jefferson. That these men were not demigods but in fact mere humans makes their achievements that much more incredible."},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"This wonderful book fills a hole in American history that's been open too long. Instead of treating great figures as saints or unapproachable geniuses Hofstadter gives a realistic picture of what they believed and what they stood for. More than that he points to the philosophic and cultural continuity that these figures embodied, struggled with, and sometimes redefined. It's as much about how the greater American view on work and indivdualism evolved from the founding as about the men who made it. Also, kind of inadvertantly, the author weaves in a history of the American liberal idea and how Jeffersonian liberalism stressing free markets, small business, and individualism, was transformed into New Deal liberalism. He argues that the transformation wasn't a betrayal but was instead a development based on necessary responses to an economically and socially changing world.

It tends to sacrifice historical accuracy for political proselytizing. Howard Zinn's &quot;Peoples' History of the United States&quot; is a case in point: almost everything Zinn says seems dedicated to supporting the author's left-wing agenda.Hofstadter's book neatly transcends this problem. It is most definitely revisionist. Each chapter examines a different American political leader, with a great deal of in-depth detail and criticism. However, Hofstadter escapes the political trap of mentioning only the negative or only the positive points about his subjects. Both sides are always examined in detail.This evenhandedness results in a very interesting and useful text. Rather than heroes and villains, our past politicians come across as human beings, and very interesting ones at that.A choice history text, both detailed and objective."},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"Richard Hofstadter, late professor at Columbia University, launched the Consensus school of history with his book, The American Political Tradition, and the Men Who Made It.

This book is really what history is all about, events shaping men and men shaping events. It is historical analysis; and it shows why reading and studying history is an exercise worth doing."},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"This marvelous series of essays on American leaders made Richard Hofstadter's reputation as one of the most important young historians in the country during the late-1940's. Professor Hofstadter took on this assignment at a very early age. He was only 28 years old when he started this book, now a bit of a cult classic in American history, and finished it when he was 32. In spite of his youth, he clearly had fully formed opinions on what drives American politics. Hofstadter throws new lights on American history in a series of twelve finely-drawn portraits, mostly of Presidents but one of a stern moralist, Wendell Phillips, and one of a constantly disappointed Presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan.In each of these sketches, all masterful in their unique viewpoints and careful analytical approach, Hofstadter sees similarities that quickly bubble to the surface. In all of them, the consistent struggle is that of the conflict between differing views of economic organization. That is the prism through which Hofstadter constructs his view of American political development. In all of this, we are treated to a great ride through our nation's history from an historian who refuses to tell the familiar story but reaches for an understanding of how opinions change over time.Jefferson, the great Virginia aristocrat, is as clear and eloquent as any of the founders in his defense of the common man, both his rights and his liberties. But of course Jefferson's love of liberty had its clear limits: he was a lifelong slaveowner and almost assuredly the father of one of his slave's children. Andrew Jackson struggles for the common man, dismantling the Bank of the United States, but Hofstadter reminds us that Jackson's early days were spent defending the rights of the propertied class.John C. Calhoun is presented as the most artful defender of slavery, an institution that had, apart from its heinous and inexcusable human consequences, the effect of sharply reducing the cost of labor in cotton farming, a highly labor-intensive industry. We see the emerging clash between the North and the South as an economic argument. Curiously, Calhoun is also presented as a Unionist but he wanted a special kind of Union, one dominated by the South not the North. Here again, Hofstadter's take on Calhoun presents him in a quite different light than the most portraits of the Great Nullifier.It is Hofstadter's analysis of Lincoln that most arrests the attention of any student of American history. Hofstadter calls the Emancipation Proclamation not much more than a \\"bill of lading\\". It called for emancipation not because slavery was wrong but only that the emancipation of the slaves was required for \\"military necessity\\". Only those slaves in the disloyal Southern states were to be freed. Slaves in the loyal Border States were not touched by the Proclamation. His hesitation to fully address the moral wrongness of slavery is based on electoral politics, according to Hofstadter. The most important source of Lincoln's electoral strength was centered in the Midwestern (then referred to as \\"Northwestern\\") parts of the country, where voters feared that the institution of slavery, if it spread to other parts of the country, would depress wages and result in more intense competition for jobs. It was not the moral wrongness of slavery that Lincoln initially appealed to but to a more convincing economic argument. Nevertheless, Hofstadter eventually focuses on Lincoln's slow turn to the abolition of slavery in all parts of the country. But we are left with a portrait of Lincoln, probably our greatest president, that is at times frustratingly nuanced.Hofstadter's discussion of the emerging strand of progressivism in American politics develops slowly. The post-Civil War period was perhaps the most dynamic period of industrial development in the nation's history. Only by the end of the nineteenth century did the voice of the common man find its full volume. William Jennings Bryan was this voice but his career never achieved its full potential. Bryan, three times the nominee of the Democratic party, failed in his most important quest: to change the monetary system of the country from one based on gold to a more accomodating system. Hofstadter's discussion of Bryan is a sad interlude between the magnificence of Lincoln and the emergence of Theodore Roosevelt.This is perhaps the most puzzling of Hofstadter's portraits. Roosevelt is here presented as a conservative. He opposes bills to raise the salaries of police and civil employees. He guards against the potential violence of labor strikes and urges firing live bullets at striking workers, if necessary. He enters the Presidency with no strong position on the problems caused by corporate power. In fact, as Hofstadter relates, he admits \\"I have let up in every case where I have had any possible excuse for doing so.\\" One is left with the impression, very much encouraged by Hofstadter, that Teddy was far more noise than substance. This is in stark contrast to recent biographies of Teddy; wanted to read a fuller exposition of Hofstadter's take on Roosevelt, particularly in view of the now widely-celebrated Part Three of Edmund Morgan on Roosevelt, an expansive but ultimately hagiographic study.The final two portraits (excepting a brief piece on the immensely talented but woefully inept Herbert Hoover) are perhaps the most interesting, since they touch on issues that have emerged in the present decade.Both Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt had clear conceptions of the use of governmental power to influence events. Wilson turned from a highly successful career as a college president to politics, almost as an afterthought. He came from an intensely conservative background, as did Roosevelt, and brought with him highly conventional views. Hofstadter traces the gradual movement of Wilson, first as a governor and then as President, towards more progressive positions, ones that infuriated business interests. He instituted the income tax, created the Federal Reserve, reduced the tariff (the first significant reduction since the Civil War), and extended control over big business with the Clayton Anti-Trust Act. Resentment against Wilson became white-hot as a result of this. This loss of trust enabled the Republican party to defeat the League of Nations treaty, a world structure that Wilson felt would be his most signal achievement. It ended badly for Wilson and Hofstadter sums it up acutely: \\"He said that American entrance to the war would be a world calamity, and led the nation in...He said the future... of the world depended on removing the economic causes of war, and did not attempt even to discuss these causes at the Peace Conference.\\" Here it is again: economics rules, according to Hofstadter.Finally, it is Franklin Roosevelt's turn for the Hofstadter lens. Here, he is at his most critical. Not only does Roosevelt seem to be nave and practically disinterested in economic policy but he fails miserably in restoring the American economy, lurching from one unsuccessful program to another. Only with the run-up to World War does the American economy respond to governmental intervention. By now, after eleven portraits, each of which offers a different slant on the most prominent American political figures, Hofstadter's reservations about Roosevelt seem predictable and a bit forced. Nevertheless, Hofstadter's overall point is well-served: the American Political Tradition is one of compromise, constant tacking to catch the wind, shifting to capture the mood of the electorate, and growth as broader perspectives become more visible.In all of this, Hofstadter seems to be saying that important questions are ultimately decided by society's attempt to move towards a middle ground, one where the scales of opinion reach equilibrium. He does this with a series of portraits, each of which illustrate the process of political movement. Not surprisingly, economics has determined most of the important issues of our history. Hofstadter's book is deeply satisfying and constantly interesting. It may not be the easiest read in American history but it is one of the most important."},{"Title":"The American Political Tradition","review":"The cover is in bad condition, and some pages are as if they had water on it.

It jumps from one illogical extreme to another, and, all told, not much happens. So what's to recommend? Simply put, it's a great example of the historical trash fiction genre of the sixties and seventies, a genre which gave us such gems as Jack Oleck's \\"Messalina\\" and Lance Horner's \\"Rogue Roman.\\"It's 79 CE and Marcius Longinus is a tribune in Pompeii. Vesuvius, of course, is about to erupt, but Marcius and his fellow townsfolk are blissfully unaware. Marcius fought in Jerusalem with Emperor Vespasian's son Titus - Titus, who himself is soon to become Emperor, as Vespasian is near death. While in Jerusalem Marcius and Titus rescued a young girl from the carnage outside the great Temple; Marcius went on to raise her, thinking of her as a younger sister. This is Selene, and she is neither Jewish nor Roman - indeed, no one is certain who or what she is, as when rescued she had no memory of where she was from or even who her parents were. Selene is now a beautiful young woman, one of Marcius's many slaves, though he's sure to point out she's only a slave by way of warfare. And Selene has become fixated on Marcius, in love with him; Marcius gradually realizes he too is in love with her. Yet problems loom: turns out Titus's Jewish lover Berenice has prophesized that Selene, if she fulfills her love with Marcius, will cause much devastation. (Read: If Marcius and Selene get it on, Vesuvius will erupt.) Intrigue ensues as Berenice attempts to foil Marcius and Selene's blossoming love.The above could easily fill a much longer book, but as mentioned Last Nights of Pompeii is only 125 pages long. The novel comes off more like a synopsis, Saul rushing through his story. Beyond that, he has difficulty lending credibility to the Marcius/Selene romance; Selene doesn't even appear until 60 pages in, and we're supposed to believe that she's suddenly fallen in love with this older man who took her captive after butchering countless Jews. (Even more disturbing: the whole \\"I raised her but now I love her like a woman\\" deal reminds me of the whole Woody Allen/Soon Yi situation.) So this isn't a love story written by the stars, and Saul doesn't help himself by rushing through it: in just a few chapters Marcius has convinced himself that he does in fact love Selene and plans to marry her.In addition to the main plot you have the usual requirements for fiction set in Rome: a graphically-detailed arena scene complete with battling gladiators and helpless victims being mauled by lions, chariot races, priests of forgotten religions muttering mumbo-jumbo as they wave their wands, walk-ons from historical personages (Titus, Berenice, even Jewish historian Josephus), and, of course, a mention or two of \\"the Nazarenes.\\" Thankfully these Christians aren't the main focus of the novel; they only appear in a few places, yet Saul gives them loathsome dialog, baiting Marcius and his fellow \\"sinners\\" and promising that Pompeii will soon suffer for its \\"sinfulness.\\" Makes me want to go back in time and HELP the Romans shove them into a lion-packed arena. But luckily neither Marcius nor any of the other characters are swayed by their preaching, which makes me wonder if perhaps Saul is taking a swing at the Christians. (Though I couldn't help but notice more than a little anti-Semitism in the vitriol Titus spews about his former adversaries in the Jewish war.)The novel is very much of its time: the women are either virginal innocents (like Selene) or manipulative schemers (like Berenice). There's a huge dose of misogyny in a too-long subplot in which Marcius's pal Claudius gains a new slave: a beautiful patrician woman who's been cast into slavery for having an affair with her husband's slave. Claudius gains control of her and, despite his lust for her beauty, proceeds to treat her like garbage, threatening her with whippings, assigning her humiliating chores, and refusing to so much as even look at her. And guess what? She eventually falls in love with him. Take THAT, Women's Lib!And yes, Vesuvius's eruption is the climax of the book. We all knew it was heading there, anyway. Saul rushes through the disaster, getting some details wrong - he has the city covered in lava moments after the eruption, but archeologists now know that the townspeople had a long time to escape the city between the first blast and the eventual destruction. In fact, it now seems that the majority of the citizens safely escaped; those who did die in the catastrophe only did so because they stayed behind, thinking it was safe. (Saul makes another mistake when he has Marcius mention stirrups, something which wasn't invented for another 500 years.)So, at times poorly written, with a plot based on a ridiculous prophecy, and with characters who are a bit too wooden, Last Nights of Pompeii isn't a great novel, but it's at least some good and trashy fun. Saul followed up the novel in 1967 with \\"Gladiators,\\" another Signet mass market paperback, but I've yet to read that one."},{"Title":"Architecture For Dummies (For Dummies (Career/Education))","review":"&quot;Architecture for Dummies&quot; provides a solid overview of the development of buildings and structural philosophies from ancient times to the present. It doesn't really break any new ground; the examples presented are the same you'd get in any similar sort of publication or course (Gothic = Chartres, Art Deco = Chrysler Bldg, Wright = Fallingwater, Modern = Utrecht, etc.). The sense of humor is occasionally dorky, and feels like it's been forced into the text to meet the conventions of the Dummies series, but the information is still good and, for the most part, well organized.Where the book seriously falls down, though, is in the editing. The text is riddled with typographical errors and irritating redundancies, the paragraph-label icons in the margin frequently seem randomly dispersed (especially the ones purporting to highlight &quot;technical info,&quot; whose paragraphs often don't seem materially different from neighboring text), and there's at least one &quot;take a look!&quot; icon that falsely indicates the building being discussed is featured in the handful of color plates in the middle of the book.Worst of all are the limited and oddly chosen illustrations, a very distressing problem for a subject that by its very nature demands visual representation for understanding. The vast majority of the photos are credited to &quot;GreatBuildings.com,&quot; and show the structures at obscure angles or from a distance, appearing to be little better than tourist snapshots. This suggests to this reader a desire on the part of the Dummies editors to pinch pennies on the pictures, and sadly mars the book's effectiveness to a considerable degree.Ms. Dietsch is an authority in the field, and if I were her, I'd be highly displeased with this barely professional treatment of my material.

One cannot but stand in awe of Finley's perspicuity in deciphering the historical importance of even the minutest details.This is a superb reference guide to assist one's journey thru the archaic but wonderous historical niche of the ancient Greeks. For those who have already read the works of Homer, the present work is a very useful tool to examine more closely the subtle information provided in even the most remote passages of the epics.This book is highly recommended to anyone who has ever read Homer, as well as anyone who would ever like to. For students of Greek history and literature, this one is a can't miss!"},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Reading Finley immediately after you finish Homer allows you to revisit the epics' individual passages and tie them into coherent themes. Finley's discussion of the Greek household, or oikos, is especially good, as are his insights on giftgiving. The world that Homer sang of is a stark contrast to the more familiar, Classical Greece, and yet the seeds of that Greece (and hence our world) are already recognizably there. Perhaps they are there in a truer, less alloyed form.The only regrettable part of this book is the second appendix, a speech that Finley later gave on Schliemann. It is full of such professional bitterness that one begins to doubt Finley's decency. The publisher produced a gem of a book, but it should seriously consider removing these few pages in future editions."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Finley only briefly ventures into archaeology in the beginning of _The World of Odysseus_, and only to demonstrate that Mycenean Greece is not the world of the Homeric heroes. From this conclusion he guesses that Homer is likely describing a world that existed between the Mycenean era and the poet's own time.Finley then goes literary, eschewing anthropology and archaeology and instead analyzing the texts of the Iliad and the Odyssey. From the stories of Homer, he reconstructs the sort of society in the Homeric heroes lived, in terms of its economy, its social structure, and its morals and values.The picture he draws is interesting and compelling, above all because it is consistent. Its consistency is, of course, an argument in favor of the view that the Homeric world really did exist (i.e., that gods and magic and specific names aside, the cultural world described by Homer is authentic, and not an artistic creation). Moreover, because the culture is consistent, an understanding of it helps a reader to interpret sometimes puzzling actions on the part of Homer's heroes. This is therefore important secondary reading to accompany any reading of Homer."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Moses Finley's WORLD OF ODYSSEUS is that rarest of rarities: it is a work of historical-literary scholarship that so far hasn't dated hardly at all. As such, it makes the perfect edition to the NYRB Classics series: this nifty little study gives the reader a very informative (and mostly very accurate) overview of life during Homer's age, the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\" of ancient Greece. The iconoclasm of Finley's approach--his daring refusal to believe the Homeric epics gave accurate portraits of the Mycenaean Age they purported to describe, and his insistence that they rather spoke to Homer's own time--still seems brave and innovative fifty years later, and Bernard Knox does a superb job contextualizing the impact of Finley's study."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"M.I. (Sir Moses) Finley belonged to a generation of scholars who wrote gracefully, intelligibly and critically for a broad intelligent, curious audience instead of wasting knowledge and ideas squabbling with colleagues behind the closed door of impenetrable academicspeak. That's one reason to enjoy THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS. Just as compelling is watching him tackle the slippery slope of locating the poet Homer and the events he sang of in \\"The Illiad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\" in time, place and culture. He stood in line a couple of millennia behind the first to probe Homer, and others continue to study and argue the issues, but his remains a classic in the effort.Finley addresses the sociological, economic and religious systems of the Heroic Age, and gives a close reading of the Homeric texts in doing so. He finds considerable evidence of the preliterate culture he is seeking in the poetry and provides a convincing argument as to why they can be trusted to offer verisimilitude if not fact. The world he opens up is fascinating. My copy is the second edition, to which Finley added appendices in which he sorted through archeological activity and other scholarship in the field, nodding to the difficulty but also the irresistible adventure in pushing back to a time before recorded history to find out what mattered."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Like most liberal arts graduates of the &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; generation, I know a little about Homer's poems &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Iliad&quot; from reading excerpts in high school, and possibly college, and of course the movies &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, and &quot;Ulysses&quot; starring Kirk Douglas. Those means merely scratched the surface of the magnificant works upon which they were based, and this book, beautifully and insightfully written, is a wonderful aide to understanding the poems in their actual context. This work shows how the poems related to &quot;real life&quot; at the time of their composition, and how &quot;reality-based&quot; they may have been. There is the agrument for whether or not there actually was a &quot;Trojan War&quot;, and if so, where was it fought. The ancient Greek era is examined in detail, and the customs and mores of various ages are discussed insofar as they relate to portions of the poems. I learned significantly more about these works than I imagined when I began the book, and now I have a heightened admiration for the person or persons known as Homer, and of course for the erudite author of this interesting work of scholarship."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"This relatively short work by the famed ancient historian M. I. Finely remains as influential and important today as it was when it was published over 30 years ago, no small feat in field that has seen major shifts in opinion over the same time period. Finley is one of those unique authors that can combine solid historical scholarship within an engaging framework that makes his works accessible to all, from the lay reader to a student of the field. I found the book to be both an interesting companion to The Odyssey as well as an interesting read in its own right, although I have been know to be a bit partial to Greek history. Regardless of ones interests, Finley is a very accessible author who consistently leaves me craving more.The main goal of the book is too illuminate the obscure world of Greek prehistory using the later of the two major epic poems attributed to Homer, The Odyssey. Finley set himself no small task, for both the Iliad and The Odyssey have been regarded as representing a picture of the Greek Bronze Age to varying degrees since the founding of modern historical scholarship and indeed even before. What Finley proposes is a departure from this line of thought, namely that the epics of Homer recall the memory of the \`Heroic Age of the Greeks' that is traditionally associated with the Mycenaean civilization of the later Bronze Age. Instead he suggests that the poems represent a time closer to Homers own, thought to be c. 800-750 B. C. The time period in question is known by various names but is most often called the Greek Dark Age, the period of time between the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization c. 1200 B.C. and the onset of the Archaic Age c. 750. Through an examination of the texts in combination with modern archeological findings, Finley paints a very convincing picture of what life was like in the Mycenaean and Dark Age and how The Odyssey much more closely reflects the latter. Outlining his thesis and the marked resistance it has met from a good portion of the scholarly community, Finley methodically addresses criticisms and in a good many cases turns the table on those that would rather reject his work.Being that the poem is concerned mainly with the exploits, travels, and trials of Odysseus, mythical King of Ithaca, the social, economic, and cultural conditions exposed are necessarily not representative of the vast majority of the people living in the society. This is something we must be content with in a comparison of text and archeology of this sort, as a rule of thumb epic poems, our only written record of the time, can have nothing to do with the lives of most people, only those at the very apex of society. Although this certainly has its limitations, any light provided for this period no matter how narrow the focus shines a bit more on all the other parts. Particularly interesting are the sections dealing with ancient economy of the ruling class, primarily characterized in a reciprocal gift giving system that conferred the most respect and power to those ruler who could give wealth away to others as \`presents' thereby ensuring that they owed him something when need arose. In this means wealth was accumulated in order to be dispersed in exchange for service and the acknowledgement of ones social position. An essential book for anyone trying to find the very real world that lays just beyond on the pages of western literature's greatest epics, a world that Finely brings to life again almost as much as Homer does, if not in a different sphere."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"This book deduces pre-homeric mores from references to domestic and social arrangements in Homer's works. It covers Homer and his relation to classical Greece; bards and heroes as a social class; wealth and labor; households, kiniships and community; and morals and values. Heavy reference is made to the text of the Iliad and particularly the Odyssey, and there are many close observations. For example, common folk attend assemblies and may react, but do not make proposals or even speak. But there are lapses. The author seems to miss the point that the Ancients thought every departure from reason was inspired by a god. Also, he fails to note that Nestor prays for fame for himself and his wife, a point that vitiates his argument that queens who attend banquets or participate in affairs of state are overstepping their bounds. Otherwise, the book presents plausible customs and morals flowing from the texts. The nobility in every kingdom was separate from commoners, slaves, and indentured freemen. The degree of input that a king wanted from nobles was up to the king. Nobles looked down on those who traded for profit, as ever, but the author overlooks the reason--because concentration of capital threatened the nobility. He omits the most plausible reason for Laertes' self-exile after Odysseus's departure, a directive from Athena. Otherwise, this book explains Homeric customs at a high order of scholarship. Any reader will achieve a deeper understanding of the texts."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"All of Finley's books, are the best analysis of the ancient world.

Thomas and Thomas Conant (Indiana University Press: Bloomington)The World of Odysseus (1954, [1974]) Moses I. Finley (New York Review of Books: New York)Classicists are an odd bunch. They took a specific geography and a specific time period handed them by Renaissance Italians and created an academic discipline divorced from other segments of archeology, architecture, history and literature. This discipline is \\"Classics.\\" Classicists are often territorial. Mary Lefkowitz's Black Athena Revisited pays lip service to the idea that a non-classicist could study the period but then blasts anybody who does (especially Martin Bernal) as \\"amateurish.\\" The non-classicist historian, Michael Parenti, questions even the motives of classicists. In the appendix on sources to his 2003 The Assassination of Julius Caesar, Parenti states: \\"Most present-day historians of antiquity seem determined to make [classic sources] inaccessible, a fact that itself might be indicative of the pedantic and elitist nature of their training\\" (223).This elitism and inaccessibility creates a false image of the classical world. Everything from the Fall of Troy (c. 1200 BC) to the Sack of Rome (476 AD) exists at one time. Homer, Socrates and Caesar would hangout together and grab a beer! M.I. Finley comments \\"The human mind plays strange tricks with time perspective when the distant past is under consideration: centuries become as years and millennia as decades\\" (7).Fortunately, I have just read two works that seek to break down ivory walls of classicists and try to build a real image of the timeframe from The Fall of Troy to the rise of Archaic Greece. M.I. Finley delves into the social construction of Homer in his 1954 (1974) The World of Odysseus. In their 1999 From Citadel to City State, Carol Thomas and Greg Conant, meanwhile follow the archeological evidence to see how Classical Greece arose from the ashes that ended Mycenaean Greece.Homer was once thought to have been a Bronze Age Greek. His Iliad was nothing more than a poetic version of Ernie Pyle's war correspondence. Yet we now know that the Iliad and the Odyssey were written down in their current form in the mid- to late- Eighth Century BC. This means that the epics exist in two periods what modern historians would refer as the Late Bronze Age and the Archaic Age.The first age, the Late Bronze Age, is home to the fall of Mycenae, the Fall of Troy and the arrival of the mysterious \\"Sea-Peoples.\\" It is unknown from the archeology if these three events are in anyway connected. Yet we do know, according to Thomas and Conant, the power of the Mycenaean wanax (or \\"king\\") was abruptly curtailed in at the end of the thirteenth century. While final destruction of Mycenae in 1175 brought down the end of the entire society that any historical Odysseus would have been a part of.The descendants of Mycenaean Greece eked out a survival in a pastoral and hunting existence. In the Early Dark Age (eleventh century), residents of Messenian Nichoria, survived to build a small simple society on the site of the former Pylian outpost. Thomas and Conant suggest that the evidence at Nichoria may point to a social structure similar to the Melanesian \\"Big Man\\" society. The Big Man was a community leader not by law or formal structure; instead it was by the personal qualities of the leader. When the Big Man died or lost statue, there was no electing of a new Big Man.What we think of as the World of Odysseus, the Late Bronze Age, is left only in snippets of memories. Literacy had vanished. In order to pass down the knowledge needed by current societies, Thomas and Conant believe they created oral transmission in the form of poetry. With theological, cultural and moral values woven into the surviving stories the oral poets created what Eric Havelock, in his 1963 Preface to Plato, called \\"The Encyclopedia of the Dark Age.\\" Thomas and Conant argue: \\"Nonliteracy and the epic encyclopedia open a number of windows looking in upon Dark Age life\\" (p. 48).While what we know as the Iliad and the Odyssey are products of the late Eighth Century and they refer to events at the end of the Bronze Age; could the foundations of society represented by actually Dark Age society? Thomas and Conant, as well as Havelock believe this to be true. Finley, in the World of Odysseus, echoes this belief. Finley sees Homer not standing in two time periods, the Late Bronze Age and the early Archaic Age, but in three. Finley places the beliefs and societal structures of Homer in the Ninth and Tenth Century.Yet the complex society found in Homer is not that of poor pastoral eleventh-century Nichoria. Odysseus' society is one of certain leadership, not the Nichorian Big Man. Agamemnon, Odysseus and Nestor are defined kings. Yet, the Linear B title \\"wannax\\" is not used by Homer; instead, it is the later Greek, \\"basileus.\\" A basileus was not the great king who centralized power around his citadel in Mycenaean times. Instead he is at best, \\"nobleman\\" in chargeThese noblemen were the head of a household or estate called the oikos. Each head of oikos would have been a representative in a territory's government. The basileus was the \\"first among equals\\" in a council of oikos. Finley points to the decision making in the chariot race dedicated to Patroclus. Each basileus had equal right to speak. While each can speak it is not the duty of the leader to mete justice. Finley points to the arbitration of the chariot race in the Iliad and the council called by Telamachus in Odyssey. In neither instance is there a strong central authority who has what Weber termed the \\"monopoly of violence.\\" Finley points not to a united state, but a confederacy of oikoses. In both the Iliad and the Odyssey, \\"The defense of right was purely a private matter\\" (Finley, 111).With a flatter social pyramid then that of the Mycenaean Age, Dark Age Greece was defined by this oikos. The master, his family, extended family and slaves and servants along with the buildings and fields of this household were the oikos. The archaeology Thomas and Conant find at Tenth Century Athens and Ninth Century Lefkandi supports Finley's belief. (Note that Finley's work based on sociology and cultural anthropology predates much of the archaeology.) And, anyone from outside of an oikos is of subservient status. Lower than even the slave in an oikos is the thes and the trader.A thes is a landless peasant who must work for pay on an oikos. He is therefore outside of the structure of Dark Age Greece. When Odysseus meets Achilles in Hades (Book XI of the Odyssey), Achilles describes the thes as the lowest form of life. Achilles would rather be dead than one of these landless peasants.The second outcast in Homer's world is the trader. According to Finley the trader seeking exchange for profit is anathema to Dark Age society. In his 1973 \\"Ancient Economy\\" he rejects any proto-capitalism found in Greece. Finley finds trading beneath the oikos in the \\"World of Odysseus\\" pointing to disguised Athena in the Odyssey excusing what can only be seen as trade.Here the archaeology turns from Finley. Thomas and Conant look to Ninth Century Lefkandi and Eighth Century Corinth. Trading from Euboea and later Corinth brought wealth to both centers. In Eighth Century Corinth we find the expansion of pottery production for what could only be trade purposes. As wealth came to both of these regions, the various oikoses began to form more permanent connections.The city-states - polies - of Plato, Herodotus and Leonidas are born from this increase of wealth. Thomas and Conant use Hesiod's own Askra to represent this point. Once Homer was written down and Hesiod was writing his own advice to farmers, Greece was stepping from the Dark Age into the Archaic one. Yet the accidental \\"nation building\\" from the destruction of Mycenae to the Seventh Century with its oikos, Olympian pantheon and trade and colonization were the foundations of Classical society.Both Finley and Thomas & Conant use their distinctive expertise to open a window on the lost \\"Dark Age\\" of Greece."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"This book deduces pre-homeric mores from references to domestic and social arrangements in Homer's works. It covers Homer and his relation to classical Greece; bards and heroes as a social class; wealth and labor; households, kiniships and community; and morals and values. Heavy reference is made to the text of the Iliad and particularly the Odyssey, and there are many close observations. For example, common folk attend assemblies and may react, but do not make proposals or even speak. But there are lapses. The author seems to miss the point that the Ancients thought every departure from reason was inspired by a god. Also, he fails to note that Nestor prays for fame for himself and his wife, a point that vitiates his argument that queens who attend banquets or participate in affairs of state are overstepping their bounds. Otherwise, the book presents plausible customs and morals flowing from the texts. The nobility in every kingdom was separate from commoners, slaves, and indentured freemen. The degree of input that a king wanted from nobles was up to the king. Nobles looked down on those who traded for profit, as ever, but the author overlooks the reason--because concentration of capital threatened the nobility. He omits the most plausible reason for Laertes' self-exile after Odysseus's departure, a directive from Athena. Otherwise, this book explains Homeric customs at a high order of scholarship. Any reader will achieve a deeper understanding of the texts."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"This book deduces pre-homeric mores from references to domestic and social arrangements in Homer's works.

Finley is considered a classic about Bronze Age Greece, and it is. And with an introduction by Bernard Knox is always interesting. Prof. Finley is very such of his evaluations about the Greek Bronze Age and definately so about Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and who might have written it. I am sure that camp about the Greeks and Homer are divided between those who agree and those who don't. I find much in his argument to agree with."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Well, here's Finley's conclusion: Homer's stories about the Trojan War are fiction, and Schliemann's &quot;discoveries&quot; of Troy do not support his wild claims (despite Schliemann's other services to archaeology). Finley quotes the sceptical judgment of Charles Newton, the British Museum curator, who in 1878 wrote that we don't know the size of that kernel of truth in Homer's epics. Finley went further: there is no historical truth at all in The Iliad, and as little in The Odyssey also.My impression is that Finley was, and remains, a minority. Most Greek scholars (historical, archaeological, or philological) feel that there IS some real facts in Homer. For instance, J. B. Bury, writing in early last century in his History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great, stated that the traditional date of the Fall of Troy - i.e., the date indicated by Homer - 1183 BC, is correct, and that Homer's Troy corresponds to archaeological facts!Bury was the Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge (strange title for a scholar of ANCIENT Greece and Rome), writing his book at a time when Finley was an infant. It is possible that archaeological finds by 1954 have cast more doubts on Schliemann's labors, which were made in the 19th century. But then Finley quotes Newton with approval, and Newton wrote in 1878. It is equally possible (though I don't know) that modern archaeological discoveries have further supported Schliemann and not Finley.In a sense, the whole debate is moot. Many great works of literature are a mix of facts and fiction: Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, China's Three Kingdoms and The Journey to the West, Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. These are great books. To be sure, that kernel of truth may be very small in Homer, but we don't read Hamlet, let alone see it acted on stage, because we think the story is &quot;real&quot;. That Homer's stories were believed by the ancients to be true (Alexander for one) is a major reason why we still have them today.And who can say for sure one finds nothing but true facts in history books? Can't true history contain a kernel of fiction also? Alexander, who believed in Homer without question and was inspired by The Iliad, is the subject of countless biographies, but whether we know whole truth and nothing but concerning Alexander is still a mystery. The difference between him and Achilles is a matter of degrees."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"&quot;The World of Odysseus&quot; is a book with a unique intent: use archaeology and what historians have pieced together about pre-Classical Greece to describe the society that Odysseus (and the other characters of the Odyssey/Iliad) would have known at the time of the Trojan War. From theorizing about Homer's identity, to speculating on the relationship between Penelope and Odysseus, the author succeeds in a sotry nearly as interesting as the Odyssey itself.In any discussion about Homer and the epics, invariably questions arise about their historicity. Whole forests have been felled, and TV programs of varying (to say the least) accuracy have been broadcast about this point. The autor contends that such discussion is tangential to the real issue: the myth itself is important in what the content tells us about Greek society of the time-roughly 1200 BC. Thus, considering that Homer is relating actual locations and personages, but assuming the tales about the Gods were satire totally misses the point of the poems. All aspects of society are covered: customs, religion and class all get well written chapters. A pretty solid social history of Bronze-Age Greece. What tells against the book though is its age. Naturally the latest archaeology and theories don't appear here. Recommended as excellent background to the study of these two epic poems."},{"Title":"THE WORLD OF ODYSSEUS","review":"Hi i bought this book and since i am a prime customer i was supposed to get this book by last friday but it still didn't come.

Prior to this, the WWE was a crossover phenomenon creating mainstream stars such as \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin and The Rock. However, their descent was brutal and swift and Scott Keith does a great job of profiling their downfall. In actuality, you don't realize the magnitude of the company's failures until you read this book as Keith touches on everything, whether it's career ending injuries, the company's failure to push their most talented performers, or failed storylines. Like his previous book Tonight...In This Very Ring, Keith inserts his internet rants detailing important matches from the era throughout the text. The rants are still very good although they could be long winded, hence the term \\"rants.\\" To his credit, he has revised his match ratings upon further review. As a long time wrestling fan and reporter, Keith displays his unbiased opinions about the failure of the WWE product and while many of his views come across as bitter, most of the time he has a valid point (ex....not giving a bigger push to popular performers Booker T and Rob Van Dam, the continued push of bigger and less talented athletes). In particular, Scott does a great job of the WWE's biggest failures such as the WCW Invasion angle, the gay wedding between Billy and Chuck, and the formerly wildly popular NWO. He also gives credit where it's due to the great performers from this era such as Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, and Brock Lesnar. However, he knocks Triple H and Shawn Michaels frequently throughout the book, to the point where it makes you wonder if it's more of a personal vendetta, particularly with Michaels since he was in on the Montreal screw job which took the World title off of Bret \\"Hitman\\" Hart, who like Keith is Canadian. Nevertheless, this is a very good read and a thorough review of the WWE's decline."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"...the material is nothing that hasn't already been rehashed and re-rehashed by the author on 411mania.com and insidepulse.com.

As good as the writing is, the material's already available for free online. Save your money."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"Of the three books by Mr. Keith, this one is the most disappointing, even as a \\"smart\\" wrestling fan. I was drawn to Mr. Keith's work originally because of the humor and the keen observations he brought to the wrestling community, as well as his rich knowledge of wrestling lore. While the knowledge remains, the humor is hard to find, and the keen observations have been replaced by tiatribes and biased reviews (which he admits to in the book!). Most of all, he just needs to get over the Montreal screwjob of Bret Hart (much like Hart himself), and admit that Shawn Michaels maybe--just maybe--is a better person these days. He crows in the book that Michaels has only put over Ric Flair and Triple H (when he had the information on hand that Michaels put over Randy Orton at Unforgiven, someone who COULD use that win, and chose to omit it from his book).Add to this sloppy spelling and continuity errors, and the fact that he ends the book at WrestleMania XIX, which was a year and a half ago, and I was thoroughly underwhelmed. Perhaps Mr. Keith is running on the same fumes he accuses WWE of running on."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"I thougtht the book was pretty good. I actually read it at a Barnes and Noble, as I had gone there for the Death of WCW but it wasn't in. I didn't read the match reviews, as I had read the originals in his rants, and skipped a few minor parts. I thought it was a detailed look at a bad period for the WWE. Though things have picked up (at least on the Raw side), the company is still making the same mistakes, such as keeping the belt on Triple H. How they could screw up having Goldberg and the invasion is beyond me. Even if you've read all his rants, you can still learn a few backstage things."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"This book is interesting to read once because it is the only book yet to exclusively document the 2001-2003 WWE era, which saw a change in name, change in stars, and a downfall in success that the WWE has arguably never recovered from.When it sticks to strictly facts, it's fascinating, particularly the behind the scenes material involving Steve Austin, Vince McMahon, and others.However, the author is mean-spirited and, worst of all, completely unwilling to adjust his clearly pre-set opinions. A few points:- In this author's mind if a wrestler is older, they're bad; if they're new, they're good, and nothing at all changes that. While points can be made for guys hogging the spotlight, the author is unwilling to give credit even when the guys on top do have excellent matches. (HIAC with Taker-Lesnar, Michaels-HHH).- His attitude during the entire book can be summed up by his ridiculous analysis of the HHH-Michaels Summerslam match, where he manages to accuse HHH of sponging off Michaels (as if anyone could have a great match with someone who hadn't wrestled in 4 years), insult Michaels for not jobbing to a younger man (as if the fans wanted to see Michaels come back simply to lose), and then criticize both men for putting on too good a match (??).- This book has aged very badly. Considering the years following its publication have produced the botched Goldberg WWE run, JBL's title run, and the endless John Cena era, in hindsight Hogan VS. Rock and a couple of bad Undertaker-Austin matches don't come off so terribly. Also, the author's endless praise of Brock Lesnar now seems stupid considering Lesnar's (deserved) reputation now as a wrestling flash-in-the-pan.An interesting read, it would be nice to have an updated book written by an author less rigid and hateful."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"I am already a fan of Scott Keith's weekly columns on the Inside Pulse website, and I consider him to be one of the most honest and insightful wrestling writers out there. This book is an in-depth look at a year or so of recent WWF/WWE history. Keith is certainly biased and opinionated, but that is what makes his books and his columns so fun to read. Even if you don't agree with him, Keith can make you laugh and make you think about North American corporate wrestling in new ways. If you are at all interested in Vince McMahon's wrestling shows, then this book should be near the top of your reading list."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"Summer of 2005, I remember it like it was yesterday. I was about to enter 9th grade and my mom decided to get my brother and I two books from Barnes and Noble as little 'end-of-summer' gifts (my parents really got us both hooked on reading). I was a big wrestling fan at the time and I had just discovered the \\"Internet Wrestling Community\\", aka where the smart fans (or smarks as they are so lovingly called) who were very much aware of how professional wrestling is scripted and supposedly knew all the ins and outs of what goes on behind the curtain backstage at wrestling events. They thrived on discussing the dirt on wrestlers, the politics that went on between the storyline writers, etc.So naturally, I wanted this book being the ignorant teen I was and I was sucked into Scott Keith's angry rants against World Wrestling Entertainment, especially his disdain for WWE head honcho Vince McMahon and some of their most famous wrestlers like Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Hulk Hogan and many others. Like other reviewers have mentioned however, most of the information Keith has compiled is available online on the many wrestling forums on the internet. At the time, I did not have internet so most of this information and dirt was simply fascinating. While most of the book is Keith's hatred for these wrestlers (or any older wrestler whose name isn't Ric Flair for that matter), he also mindlessly praises newer wrestlers at the time like Brock Lesnar, John Cena and even Matt Hardy, who at the time was a lower mid card singles wrestler and really wasn't (and still isn't ) doing anything revolutionary (Keith even manages to compare Hardy to the great Macho Man Randy Savage, blasphemy I say).Keith also dishes out some rare praise for many of the mid carders at the time though he does not expect any of them to have much of a future, whereas some wrestlers like Brock Lesnar are touted as future legends, only problem was that Lesnar's run in WWE didn't last long. He left the WWE after only two years to pursue other endeavors. Many of the mid card wrestlers that Scott Keith described as \\"underused\\" or \\"held down by Triple H's backstage politics\\" like Chris Benoit, Kane, Rob Van Dam or Eddie Guerrero all won world titles and received main event runs in later years.Keith's bitterness is very evident in the final chapter where he compares Vince McMahon to famous circus promoter PT Barnum. One point really stood out to be when he mentions how Bret Hart was \\"humiliated\\" by McMahon and Shawn Michaels in the infamous \\"Montreal Screw job\\" back in 1997. This seems to be the root of Keith's hatred for McMahon and Michaels. His hatred even gets personal where in one chapter he questions Michaels faith as a born again Christian and claims that he worships Triple H, not God to get all of his wins during his comeback in 2002. I found this unnecessary criticism of Michaels to be insulting on many levels and going a bit too far when it comes to hating someone Keith doesn't even know personally. Also, why would Michaels lose when he has to come back and prove himself to many new fans who may not even know who he is? Yet this too seems dated after 2010, when Hart made his return to WWE and even embraced Michaels in the ring, ending their long, real-life feud. Another reason the book will not age well at all. If Hart can forgive McMahon and Michaels, then maybe there's still hope for a jaded, bitter fan like Scott Keith to enjoy professional wrestling once again.As for me, I stopped going to all the wrestling forums and reading the dirt sheets and stopped caring about what backstage politics are going on in WWE as I got older. I realized I just needed to enjoy wrestling without thinking about what happens off camera and just enjoy the product. Like many things in life, you can't always get everything you want, and this is especially true in wrestling and you can't hate a company just because of what went on backstage with one's favorite wrestlers and how they were booked.The book isn't all terrible however, Keith is generally funny at times and there are a few parts in the book that will give most fans a good chuckle. And WWE was certainly not perfect, especially from 2001 to 2003. Some storylines that Scott Keith criticized definitely deserve the criticism, like a lot of the silly angles from fall 2002, like the HLA angle, the Billy and Chuck gay wedding and the Al Wilson storyline. But for the most part, Wrestling's One Ring Circus reeks of bitterness, so some jaded internet wrestling fans who hate everything WWE has done since the \\"Attitude\\" era may enjoy this, but a general fan of wrestling should stay away from all the negativity presented in the book."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"The book suffers because it is written for a \\"smart\\" wrestling audience familiar with the internet.

Mr. Keith *still* seems to have a different style when in the publishing world as compared to his online escapades because much of the humor and wits that he shows in his rants are almost non-existant in this book. As a previous review stated, most of what is in this book he has already stated numerous times online at various websites (but this time without wit). And while it is always enjoyable to hear some HHH-bashing, Mr. Scott Keith makes it the theme of the whole book and it really runs tired and ragged after awhile. HHH hasn't gotten this much face time since this week's episode of Raw! Definitely not worth the $19 price tag, but if you can find it once discounted, it's worth a casual read as it is more focused and a step above his first two books.

Covering late 2001 through midway through the spring of 2003, the book documents how the company lost the rights to it's name due to Vince McMahon's arrogance (forcing the renaming of the company \\"World Wrestling Entertainment\\"), the fall of Stone Cold Steve Austin from grace as injuries and egomania caught up to him, and the rise of Triple H: the one man at the center of the collapse of the WWE, from which just about every failure of the company seemed to spring from, due to his desire to be the Alpha Male of the company following Austin's fall from grace.Biting and at times disjointed, the book gives a window into the world of professional wrestling, as the the WWE found itself the only game in town and systematically alienated it's fanbase. While short in content as far as the time period it covers (2001-2003), it does offer a nice time capsule of the period."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"I bought and read this book a few years ago while I was on jury duty and needed some reading material. I am a fan of the writing style of Scott Keith and think he is a decent person from having corresponded with him a bit via electronic mail. However, it is best reading Keith in small doses, such as his individual rants that are located all over the internet instead of in book form. In book form, such as in this book, Keith gets real tedious real quick and is not enjoyable.The main problem with the bulk of this book is that 3 / 4 of it is just stuff he reprinted from his online writings. The remaining 1 /4 of the book is Keith's extremely biased and unsubstantiated views on professional wrestling. Keith is just a fan and has no sources in the industry or facts to back up his ludicrous opinions in the book. To sum up this whole book in 1 sentence - Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and the McMahon family (with help from Kevin Nash and Hulk Hogan) destroyed professional wrestling on purpose while cry baby Bret Hart, Chris Benoit (yes, the same creep who killed his family), and all other wrestlers from Keith's home nation of Canada are gods who tried and failed to save the greatness of professional wrestling.Please read Keith's online rants on wrestling events because they are witty and funny. Please do not read this book because it is filled with factual errors and biased opinions that make the book tedious and unreadable. Also, please do not read the upcoming Scott Keith book he is writing to make a buck off of the Chris Benoit double murder / suicide. Keith has no information on Benoit's crimes that is not already available to the public and as a worshipper of Benoit he is just going to wrongly blame all of Benoit's crimes on his usual culprits (Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and the McMahon family) as he does in this woeful book."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"If you've been watching WWE the last few years, and you're wondering why they've made the decisions they have, you need to check out Keith's book. He sorts through all the crap and tells you straight up what was going on. And that's not a common thing in wrestling literature.I found \\"One Ring Circus\\" to be a much better read than Keith's previous offering, \\"Tonight, In This Very Ring\\". It's better structured, better written, and more original. That's not to say the previous book is bad - but the new one is his best work. \\"One Ring\\" doesn't cover nearly the ground as its prequel, but in a way that's good because it's more focused. And most wrestling fans have only been watching for the last few years anyway.All in all, the book is great for the wrestling fan who doesn't want to visit wrestling websites everyday and wade through all the b.s."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"First of all Davy Goldberg, if you're who I think you are, did'nt you and Keith collaberate with Bill Goldberg on the biography of your worthless brothers' life, \\"I'm Next?\\", if so, your opinion cannot be taken into an unbiased account of it's own, that book as far as I can tell, was a critical bomb.On another note, \\"Wrestlings' One Ring Circus\\" is indeed, nothing that you hav'nt seen on 411mania, but it offers plenty of insight to anyone else who has'nt visited that site into what a professional wrestling fan thinks regarding the product, think of the diversity it brings to the table.Aside from the better written structure, Keith also changes his ratings on some of them atches he reviews, giving us reasons as to why he changed his mind in small caption boxes which also house little annicdotes regarding any other subject he touches in passing.His rant on the hatchet job that was the RAW tenth anniversary special was quite funny as a matter of fact, as it was only a showcase for the WWE's present product and in hardly any way a testiment to it's past.His opinions on Shawn Michales are also semi-valid, despite Michales allegedly \\"putting over\\" talents like Jericho and Orton, when you look at it ONJECTIVLY, you realise it took interferences and cheating to put him down, not overall clean wins (and don't give me that \\"they were heels, they had to win that way\\" rubbish, Snitzky beat Kane in a chain match, by all rights that match was as clean as it was given the rules), Michales has only \\"cleanly\\" laid down for Triple HAlthough, to be fair on his critics, this book only going up to Wrestlemania 19 is a dissapointment, suprisingly he lists Guerrero as WWE Champion in Febuary 2004 but does'nt tell us Benoit won the belt in Match 2004 at Wrestlemania 20."},{"Title":"Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation","review":"I'd heard so many good things about Scott Keith and his writings that I was willing to give him a try. I really hope this was the worst thing he's ever written and that his other 2 books were better, because this one totally blows. Although I did agree with him about: why Triple H is not as good as he used to be; Owen Hart's senseless death; and that Chris Benoit and Kurt Angle (among others) are awesome wrestlers--I strongly disagree with his assessments of Shawn Michaels (who is my favorite wrestler EVER) and other wrestlers too numerous to list here. I agree with another reviewer who said he really needs to get over the Montreal screwjob and realize that Michaels has really changed for the better. You may be seeing this book up for sale from me fairly soon; even my roomie hated it and she's not too fond of Vince McMahon either but said it was a pure hatchet job on some of her favorite wrestlers too.

People like Keith help their anti-wrestling. This is the third of a series of books that make wrestling look bad.It is written by not an expert, not a even a decent writer, but some bitter person who complains about bad matches and angles. You actually expect people to pay for that when they can read that online for free. The man provides nothing for the fan. Most of the books even the worst in autobiographies provided some kind of insite that would help fans build on a wrestling library.I am proud to say I never bought any Scott Keith's book. I sat read and them at Barnes and Noble and yes that is wasted time I will never get back. To charge fans money to read an uneducated fans rantings in blasphemy and urinates on everything Dave Meltzer has worked for and only supports bad stereotypes of the fans. Thank you so much Mr. Keith for your continued attempts to make wrestling fans look bad and releases of bad literature.One star is generous. If Amazon allowed me, I would have started going into the extreme negative numbers. I only hope this is the last of the awful Keith books.

The unique twist of the songbird angel set it apart from other books. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Rafe (Outlaws)","review":"Rafe Gentry is accused of murder and he is going to be hanged. At the last minute, Angela Abbot saves him by declaring he is her fiance and they are about the get married. Instead of being grateful to Angela for saving his life, Rafe actually dislikes her and thinks less of her for this (Odd guy.)First of all i would like to say that i've read most of Ms Mason's books and i liked most of them. A couple of which i love and i consider keepers. Seeing all the favorable reviews on this book i was quite sure i would have another excellent read from Ms Mason but i was rather disapointed.Its true that this book is packed with action and romance and some sensual scenes but what irritates me is the way Ms Mason is writing lately. She uses very simple dialogue, hurries over much of the scenes and I suspect she wanted to finish this book quickly.What good is all the action if it is over in just a few sentences? There's no suspense at all...no real sense of danger. There are no vivid and intresting descriptions of the scenes. For example - at one moment Angela is hit by bullet - and almost immeditaely recovers with no more mention of the wound! I strongly believe this book is nowhere near as good as some of her earlier books ,&quot;My lady Vixen&quot; for example. PleaseDont'hate me for this."},{"Title":"Rafe (Outlaws)","review":"I have read close to all Connie Mason's books and &quot;The Outlaw Rafe&quot; is by far one of the best. The books touches on emotions and feelings from the main characters and makes you feel like it happened in front of you. Rafe learns that he needs to be able to trust others. Angela learns that not everyone is as though they seem. This book was great. I read it in one weekend."},{"Title":"Rafe (Outlaws)","review":"As with every one of Ms. Mason's books, they are a treat from a long day and I enjoy them. This too was one treat and I am excited to read the other two books in the trilogy. The complaint I had with this one, about the outlaw brother Rafe Gentry, was the fact that he got into too many situations that had me saying to myself, 'alright, enough, this is a little too much, even for me to believe'. I mean, 3 different raps and all of them easily explained? And they don't happen by a chain of events, but by accident? Nope, too much. Rafe was a typical Mason 'hero', by that I mean he was sexy and strong and the kind of guy you wish you knew, but don't, lol. He is selfless and honorable and the kind of guy you can always depend on. The heroine Angela, I wasn't too impressed with. She was a little too trusting and kept getting herself into dangerous messes that Rafe had to keep getting her out of, simply, in my opinion, because she was kinda...dare I say, dense? Yeah, dense. Rafe deserved someone smarter and more apt to trust him when he risked his neck for her numerous times. She trusted everyone else...except Rafe..the ONLY person helping her and saving her from herself. Other than that little petpeive, I thought the plot was great and had a lot of heart-stopping action (which I always look forward to in a Mason book) with plenty of romance thrown in to keep you smiling. Mason always weaves a tale of greed, treachery and impossible odds that the characters must overcome. This, the first in the 'OUTLAW' trilogy, did not disappoint.~Rafe Gentry was about to hang from a tree in some small town for a crime he didn't commit. A lynch mob has taken him from the cell and condemed him before he was to sit trial. When suddenly an angel with golden hair and a voice and face to match appeared trying to save him. Who was she? And why was she telling them she was his fiancee?Angela Abbot was no angel, despite what her name and voice claimed. She was known as Sister Angela and couldn't abide to see a man hanged, especially one like this one. He had the eyes of an innocent man about to die. So she did something she couldn't believe, she claimed he was her fiance who was supposed to wait her in Colorado. Why? She wasn't so sure herself. When things couldn't possibly get any worse, they did. They were being forced into a hasty wedding in the same town! Now what?Angela didn't need this extra problem on her hands when she needed to get to her father's mine in the mountains and find out if he was murdered. Hopefully, this added 'problem' would just go on his way, but he didn't. Not at first. Then Angela had a hard time wondering why she wanted him to leave in the first place.Rafe didn't want to drag Angela into his mess of a life. He was wanted and was on the run. The sooner he got away from her the better, but his heart was calling her and he couldn't seem to leave her. The fire was too strong for them to deny and before they knew it, they couldn't survive without each other...but first he would have to clear his name and find out who was trying to kill Angela..."},{"Title":"Rafe (Outlaws)","review":"I JUST LOVED THIS BOOK.

He does focus on the great men who led the Church or contributed to those achievements and conflicts; I wish Norman could reissue the book with greater representation of the ordinary Catholic, lay or clerical, during the era.

What I got, however, was a sketch of that world. Sayantani DasGupta has a lot of ground to cover and I realize that-- but she skims over way too much. We get brief glimpses of her feelings/thoughts at different stages of her schooling, glimpses of various patients, but we get nothing in depth and this is frustrating. She kept telling us how difficult it is to be a woman, to be in med school, but I wanted to see more examples of this rather than simply be told this over and over again. She clearly has strong feelings about what's wrong with medical schools and the medical community, but that is another book entirely.

Very easy to read."},{"Title":"Her Own Medicine: A Woman's Journey from Student to Doctor","review":"I am considering a career in medicine and bought this book as I hoped it would give me a different perspective on medicine - that of a woman and a member of an ethnic minority. The book is actually a collection of essays on Dr DasGupta's view of the medical community. Note it is not a book about her experiences - you will not find too much detail of patients or training. Instead Dr DasGupta puts forth at great length how she views the medical community as similar to the military, how sexist it is, and how she doesn't really want to be a part of it. Patient stories are dealt with superficially and only when they provide passing support for her arguments. The essays that make the chapters were all written at different times and so do not form a logically progressive argument even. The book is dry, political and not very insightful. The main argument (medicine=military institution) is repeated over and over. If you want a feminist treatise then buy this book(I count myself as a feminist - but that was NOT what I was looking for with this book). If you want any insight into medicine, don't buy it - instead buy Perri Klass, Melvin Konner, Robert Marion or Lisa Belkin...all MUCH better books for those interested in medicine (and Konners also deals more maturely with the problems of medicine)"},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"As a kid, I disliked this book because it bore little resemblance to the Disney movie that was inspired by it. Now, however, I have much deeper appreciation of the story.In the novel, Tony and Tia Malone are two teenagers, adopted by an elderly woman, and they live in a rough neighborhood. Because of their psychic abilities, they are targets of bullies and gangs. When their adoptive grandmother dies, they are placed in a detention home, Hackett House, run by a cold, granite-like matron, Mrs. Grindley, a former policewoman. They do not fare well at the home because of their 'strangeness' (Tia is unable to speak normally, although she can speak telepathically with Tony), and as this is the time of youth rebellion and the Vietnam war, suspicious behavior. When a mysterious, well-dressed stranger, Lucas Deranian, shows up claiming to be their uncle, the siblings realize that he is after something else. They succeed in escaping from Hackett House and enlist the help of a priest, Father O'Day, to discover their true origins.Very different from the film, it is nonetheless a darn good read.It also speaks volumes of what many adolescents face during these crucial years of developement - finding your identity and being accepted for it."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"Since most of the reviewers of this book are adults now who read this book as children and are remembering it as a childhood favorite, I would like to say that as a modern 14-year-old, I liked this book too.

Tony and Tia are teens and most teens will relate to them and will get caught up in the mystery and the adventure. I haven't reread it in years and years but I remain certain that for young readers this would be a book they would treasure.

I just reread the book for the first time as an adult, and it still works its magic. Anyone who knows or strongly recalls the pain, rage, and suffocating frustration of being a child surrounded by unsympathetic, uncaring, irrational adults will identify powerfully with all the trials T&amp;T go through. I used to long for a &quot;people&quot; of my own to reunite with, and envy T&amp;T for their finding this at last, despite all the harrowing disasters they undergo on the way. The story is haunting and moving.I've only given 4 stars because the story does seem a tad dated now in several aspects: the writing style at times (but I like old-fashioned writing), the fact that they are rescued from their crisis by adults rather than pulling themselves out of it (violating today's usual doctrine for good children's lit), and the politics, sort of. About the politics, one of the &quot;good guys&quot; makes disparaging remarks about communists in a way that really sounds pretty old and simplistic (not that I'm a huge fan of communists), plus, he conveys a clear message about God and Christianity that I find mildly offensive. However, this is balanced by the fact that he also makes disparaging remarks about the rampant commercialism of American society; so his criticism is at least even-handed.I want to close by reiterating that to me, these minor negative points are vastly outweighed by the magic and the power of the story, and of Tony and Tia. They are marvelous people that I wish I knew personally; they face genuine danger and difficulties with aplomb; their love for one another is well developed and not gooey; they are courageous and resourceful; their magical abilities are well thought up by Key, and complement each other; and all in all, they impart a wistful sense that the world would be a better place if people like this really existed."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"I loved this book when I was a girl and I still love it.

Though this story was second to 'The Forgotten Door' in my estimation, it is a lovely, mystical adventure that takes the reader along a gentle path of discovery. It is probably the best introduction a young reader could have to science fiction, and also introduces the concept of living in balance with nature. I can recommend both this book and 'The Forgotten Door' very highly."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"Alexander Key, who has since become more of a cult author of young adult scifi, penned this book which became his best known work thanks to its Disney adaptations to film. However, many Key fans do not consider Escape to Witch Mountain (and much less its sequel) to be among Key's best works. I agree with one reviewer who said that too much time is given to the mechanics of the chase that occurs in the story than to personal matters of characters learning how to responsibly use their power or influence others in an enduring way, and in turn, once the chase is over and the mystery is settled, I felt that Witch Mountain should be regarded as a highly disposable read, something like what you'd expect from a modern pop-paperback thriller. My current favorite work of Key is \\"The Golden Enemy\\", which in my opinion has much more enduring themes than this, which, while enjoyable the first time, is not something I'll be reading again anytime soon."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"I understand one's reluctance to pick up paperbacks that look like novelizations of so-so Disney movies. (Can you say \\"The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes\\" or \\"The Shaggy D.A.\\"?) Well, this was written first, it is not Disneyfied, and it is a lot better than you might expect. It is certainly dated, but not to the extent that it is hard to follow or filled with careless inappropriate characterizations. The characters are well conceived and their circumstances are revealed slowly and with a satisfying sense of mystery. The escapes and chases are taut and plausible. As a consequence this book really does work as an adventure/mystery, without any of the magic angles that inform so much current youth fiction. So, this certainly qualifies as an overlooked semi-classic, and as such is well recommended"},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"I discovered the 1968 paperback in a used bookstore and couldn't resist peeking inside, where, to my surprise, it was illustrated on many pages.

It reads like a movie sequel; the characters are less personally rendered and the plot is more grandiose. As an eleven-year-old, I was excited to meet Tia and Tony now that they have refined their skills at Witch Mountain, but even at that young age I recognized that Return lacked the intimate character and plot that made Escape (and The Forgotten Door) so magical.

They have interesting powers. They can even make their dolls dance."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"All the children wanted was to fit in, but fate had another plan for them. They knew they were not like other earthlings, and they even looked different with their ash blonde hair, deeply tanned skin, and bright cat's eyes. Plus, they could talk to each other with their minds alone, and when Tony played his harmonica, wild animals came out of the woods to watch and tingle. Tia, his younger sister, had a pair of dolls she could make dance with each other; that amused them when things got tough in the New York City orphanage in which they were now lodged, wretched wards of the state whose grandmother has died without making better provisions for them. It's a horrible, hard knocks life they lead, but they have each other, and they share a persistent memory of something from the distant past that seems to grow closer every day.One of my angelic students gave me a copy of Alexander Key's book for a Halloween present, and it has something genuinely spooky to it. As in THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, an evil man tracks down an innocent, blond brother and sister through the backwoods and mountainous regions of the American south--but the twist here is that little Tia and Tony have \\"Firestarter\\"-type tricks to confound their enemies, and it might have been John Irving himself who gave them a pack of bears to use as familiars.Finally, they have a true friend, a Catholic priest, Father O'Day, modeled on Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement. Nowadays this book wouldn't be so vehemently anticommunist, I don't think, nor would it be able to paint the entire population of the state (North Carolina I guess) in which Witch Mountain lies as prehensile, mindless, mobthinking lynchers with guns continually cocked ready to kill strange children. But that does add to the suspense! I guess also if this book was written today, Tony and Tia would be more on guard for so-called child molesters, and Father O'Day would probably be one."},{"Title":"Escape to Witch Mountain","review":"This book was okay and interesting but I actually preferred the movie that starred Kim Richards as Tia.

Coming back to it after all this time, my overwhelming impression was how much Conrad had compressed into so few pages. TYPHOON can easily be read in a single sitting; but don't plan on going to bed right after. Not without a good stiff drink.The Nan-Shan, a steamer of Siamese registry but with English officers, and with a cargo of Chinese coolie laborers returning from a stint overseas, encounters a deadly typhoon and somehow survives it. We see the story unfold through the eyes of Jukes, the first mate, who is awed by his stoic Captain MacWhirr's quiet resolve in the face of a storm of the century.Reading it, I felt transported to the Northridge Earthquake of 1994. A sound as of all the demons of hell -- shaking and rolling in six directions at once -- flashes of light from exploding transformers -- barefooted stumbling for my boots in a world of broken glass and crockery -- found by the police hours later walking down the street, stunned, with blood pouring from my ankle and a gallon jug of water in my hand.Or, replace it with an equivalent experience of your own. Conrad had looked death in the face and learned how to face it. His Captain MacWhirr stands fast in the fury and doesn't let his imagination of untold horrors interfere with guiding the ship through the storm. At one point, he tells Jukes in the wheelhouse, &quot;We must trust her [the ship] to go through it and come out the other side, That's plain and straight.&quot;Conrad is a wise teacher and a great writer. TYPHOON did more than survive a second reading: It awed me a second time. If I may quote once more from the book: &quot;MacWhirr had sailed over the surface of the oceans as some men go skimming over the years of existence to sink gently into a placid grave, ignorant of life to the last, without ever having been made to see all that it may contain of perfidy, of violence, and of terror.&quot;MacWhirr's initiation into this perfidy, violence, and terror shows us how we might likewise survive the storms and shipwrecks of our own lives. What an incredible book!"},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This is a gem of a sea story by a master.

I had to go back to the excerpts on Amazon and replay parts of the tape to catch the true impact of Conrad's words.Captain Mac Whirr, a short, fat, dull but dependable seaman, commands the Nan-Shan for a Siamese merchant firm. He writes twelve letter a year to his uncaring wife and has two children who barely know him. During typhoon season in the China Sea Jukes the first mate tells the Captain to change course to avoid the looming storm, but Mac Whirr will think of nothing but forging straight ahead. The Captain and Jukes as well as Solomon Rout the chief engineer (Long Sol, Old Sol or father Rout to his shipmates and Solomon Sez to his wife who quotes pearls of wisdom from his letters to anyone who'll listen) and the Bosun are at the center of the crisis that follows.During a storm like no other the actions of everyman are almost predetermined by their biases, intrenched beliefs and in some cases ability to react. In six short chapters Conrad develops a great story of how different men behave in a fight for survival.The tale of the last leg is told in pieces from letters home. The Captain's letter is barely read by his wife who has no idea what happened. Solomon's is sentimental and cherished by his beloved. Jukes reveals the most.

Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Taking maximum advantage from his long years at sea, and from his innate insight into the human soul, Conrad tells an outright and direct story about a huge typhoon in the midst of the Yellow Sea. But the book is not so much about the storm in itself, but about the human character and how it reacts to disaster.Captain MacWhirr is famous for being an efficient, calm, dull and silent man, someone you would trust but not like. He seems to be rather unbrilliant, though, never understanding why people talk so much. The other characters are also interesting, especially Jukes, the &quot;young Turk&quot;, vivid and dynamic; Solomon the head engineer, another wise man from the sea, and the disgusting and repugnant &quot;second officer&quot;, the type of coward you don't want to be with in this kind of drama.Human character, then, is revealed by limit-situations much more than at any other time, as war literature fans know, and this tale will leave you wondering how YOU would react if you had to make decisions in the midst of a horrible, and wonderfully depicted, typhoon."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"One would not know it from other reviews, but this incredible collection has seven Joseph Conrad stories other than Typhoon: The...Narcissus (Amazon won't allow the full title), \\"Karain,\\" \\"An Outpost of Progress,\\" \\"The Lagoon,\\" \\"Youth,\\" \\"Amy Foster,\\" and The Shadow-Line. Those not in quotation marks are of novella or short novel length, as is Typhoon, and some of the others are lengthy short stories. There are just under 450 pages including Conrad's two Narcissus Prefaces (though sadly and inexplicably missing The Shadow-Line's) plus a short Introduction and Bibliography. All the stories are worthy, and most are great; a few are even masterpieces. Simply put, anyone who has not read them - or has only read some - would be well served by this convenient and inexpensive volume, which is well worth tracking down.Though not in Conrad's top tier, The...Narcissus is an excellent novel that would be most writers' best. Conrad turned to writing when nearly forty after more than twenty years at sea, and his early work is dominated by what he experienced on his many voyages. This is no different but significant in coming after his last trip, thus serving as both a goodbye to the sea and a formal introduction to writing. It is not his first novel but is in many ways his most representative - the culmination of his early sea adventure slant and the real beginning of the dense psychological penetration characterizing his masterpieces. Conrad wrote that it was the book by which he would stand or fall as an artist, and so it is; nearly everything great about his later work is here, and there are bits of excellence to which he rarely or never returned. He stands tall indeed.Like nearly all Conrad, the book works on two levels. The most obvious is a rollicking sea adventure. Those who love the picaresque voyages so common in nineteenth century literature will hardly find a better one; this has all the excitement, suspense, and drama one could want. The voyage has many trials: grueling challenges, hairs-breadth escapes, great tests of strength and stamina, and more. Nearly everything bad that could happen does, pushing weathered sailors to the max in a way that is both entertaining and a tribute to human will and endurance. Even many who find classic literature boring will be engrossed.This aspect is also of great historical value as a fascinating peek into a bygone era. Life on a ship was practically its own world, often with little connection or similarity to life on land. Conrad vividly shows what a merchant ship voyage was like, painstakingly detailing every aspect from departure to arrival. We see ship life's ups and downs, its bright and dark sides, and also learn much about sailors; everything from daily routines to customs and speech are memorably and believably dramatized.Here we come to the more important part - the book's dark symbolism. Oscar Wilde said that all art is at once surface and symbol and that those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril; this proves it. Few writers - nay, few people - have been as pessimistic as Conrad, and this lays bare much of his dark vision. While he clearly shows that people are capable of bravery, remarkable feats, and other conventional virtues, he also unflinchingly displays human nature's dark side. As he was always ready to reveal, this lurks always beneath even an ostensibly calm or formidable surface and can jump out without warning - often destructively. Moral ambiguity was his favorite subject, and this explores it profoundly. Specifically, it shows how a single dying black sailor unnerves a white crew - not because of the xenophobia one might expect but ironically because he elicits sympathy. This is in one sense moving, a tribute to human empathy that in many ways shows what is best in people - that, indeed, even the most outwardly selfish and shallow have latent humanity that can come out in extremity. However, the seemingly paradoxical fact that the same stimulus leads to arguments, fights, and near mutiny hints at the other pole of existence that Conrad never lets us forget. One of his great strengths is that, while he dramatizes a wealth of weighty issues, he never stoops to the heavy-handedness so common in writers handling such material and nearly always fatal. He raises the difficult question of empathy vs. unmoved strength and the consequent one of whether the former, however otherwise sublime, has any place in situations like ship life, where truly only the strong survive and even a tinge of weakness may prove disastrous.This hints at some of the more notable ship life aspects that are still largely unknown - namely that, as in military life, a rare camaraderie is achieved among people who are often very different and would perhaps hardly get along otherwise or even have anything to do with each other. Also noteworthy is just how cosmopolitan ships were, making general concord all the more incredible. However primitive ship life was beside land life in many ways, it was certainly well ahead here.Inevitably, this brings up the issue of the title, which seems not only politically incorrect but thoroughly perverse. Much has been written on Conrad's race views, and the issue is of great interest and relevance not merely to scholars but to anyone interested in his work. There are of course many who understandably will take the ostensible high road and refuse to read anything with such a title, and probably at least as many apologists are ready to defend Conrad against claims of racism or anything else. However, it is important to avoid knee-jerk reactions and recall a few essential facts. First, it is important to realize that the term as then used in England referred not to Africans or African Americans but West Indians; the character in question is from St. Kitts. Second, though it clearly had racist overtones, it was often used without conscious racism - perhaps even a majority of the time - as a way of designating race or nationality, much as one might say \\"Irishman\\" or \\"Yankee.\\" That said, later sensitivity to the word and all it stands for is a positive development, and we must not excuse Conrad or the book as the product of an era, since there were after all even then some aware of the harm that could come from the word and its significations.With this in mind, we can proceed to how things work in context. It is certainly true that James Wait, the titular personage, is presented in a way that is often clearly racist; such a characterization would now be near-unpublishable. However, there is far more going on than it first appears. Wait enters the story as an enigma, and the various whites view him with unsurprising distrust and suspicion. Yet it soon becomes clear that he is the subtlest character; though often described as variously primitive, he may well be the most intelligent and well-spoken and is certainly the most resourceful. This is reflected in how the narrator refers to him. The title slur is first used near-ubiquitously, and he is described in overtly racist ways. However, his real name or neutral references are used once his individuality becomes known; the pejorative and racist descriptions are almost gone by the middle of the book, never to return. This suggests that racism and xenophobia generally stem mainly from ignorance and gradually recede with familiarity, the outsiders in question becoming individuals rather than racial cutouts. Regardless of how far Conrad meant this to extend, Wait is anything but a Victorian stereotype and has many traditionally admirable qualities. Even so, like the other characters, we are never quite sure what to make of him. Is he sincere or a fraud? Loathsome and despicable or sympathetic and misunderstood? Conrad has no easy answers, but his nuanced portrait of a true Victorian outsider earns both our sympathy and our fascination and is remarkably subtle for its time despite the title.Perhaps the foremost thing to remember is that the titular epithet refers specifically to Wait; the book makes no sweeping claims about race or anything else. Indeed, for what it is worth, many ethnic groups and nationalities are disparaged with pejoratives and other condemnations, all others being white. This may be a sign of Conrad's misanthropic streak but is above all simply realistic; he was devoted to realism however harsh the subject and would not have shrunken from showing how sailors really thought, acted, and spoke, however unwholesome to Mrs. Grundy. We can easily and legitimately debate his motives in using the title as well as insisting on it despite controversy. Perhaps he wanted attention or was being provocative, but it was again most likely a realist instinct. Even knowing all this, some may find it hard to buy or read a book with such a title, especially to keep it on their bookshelf - perhaps even only because of what the uninitiated may say. Those who like the book or want to read it but just cannot make the plunge can, if they choose, take the easy way out by getting one of many collections containing the work without including it in the title.Wait is in any event not the only interesting character. This has one of Conrad's largest and most diverse casts, and all are drawn with memorable vigor. As anyone at all familiar with him would expect, he puts none on a pedestal. Most are indeed at least partly vile, again showing human nature's dark side, but there is something courageous or otherwise admirable - even noble - about most of them as well, giving further nuance. The penetrating psychological characterization of a single character so characteristic of Conrad is not here, but he distributes his artistry more evenly, which is about equally compelling.Conrad certainly wrote many more seagoing tales, and themes dealt with for the rest of his career are largely anticipated here, but this also differs from other work in important ways. For instance, he is infamous for lacking humor, but this has many light-hearted elements, especially in regard to characters - some of whom are comical in a near-Dickensian manner - and their actions; Chapter One in particular is almost a burlesque. This gives some relief from the alternating high adventure and high seriousness that some miss in more representative work. Also, in great contrast to most later works, the narrative is straight-forward - linear and simply told without nested dialogue or other ambiguous subjectivity. The feeling of being lost and/or confused that makes Conrad hard going for so many is absent. This will be a great relief to some but also holds the book back. Those who value Conrad's ground-breaking and influential narrative techniques will be disappointed, but more importantly, the narrator himself is uncertainly drawn. He first seems to be a third-person omniscient narrator but eventually reveals himself as first-person. However, he never really seems to be present, often describing things he could not have seen without saying how he knows, and he is not addressed until the last few pages. Conrad at times even seems to forget that the narration is supposed to be first-person, seemingly slipping into third-person without warning only to return as quickly. This may have been deliberate, either to introduce ambiguity or perhaps even influenced by Moby-Dick, of which much the same can be said. In the end, though, it seems simply sloppy - an early instance of indecision in an area he later mastered.One strength that was fully in place even at this early date is mesmerizing prose. Conrad is one of the great English stylists, which is almost incredible in that he was not a native speaker. His descriptions are lush and memorable, eminently quotable and often unforgettable, whether about the sea, the ship, or human thoughts and feelings. The prose is indeed so strong that one could read for it alone, though there is of course far more.Though not Conrad's most ambitious tales, \\"Karain\\" and \\"The Lagoon\\" are excellent stories featuring many of his strengths and exploring many of his themes on a smaller scale. Again, they can be enjoyed on a very simple level as exciting adventures in an exotic locale. Once they get going, it is fast-paced and suspenseful enough to satisfy even pulp fans. However, they also raise several important questions, as Conrad nearly always did even at his most entertaining. Conflicts like personal vs. familial responsibility, Eastern vs. Western culture, rationalism vs. spiritualism, and truth vs. illusion swirl around issues of loyalty, love, and ethics. Conrad explores such subjects more deeply, but the amount of thought-provoking material he manages to include in these short, action-packed stories is truly remarkable. Perhaps most subtly, like many of his works, they gaze unflinchingly at love's disadvantages. Their view of love is very dark, seeming to say that true love is mere illusion and that, even if it were not, it saps strength and willpower, making one practically useless in any conventional sense. However great love may be to individuals, it is detrimental to society and has no place in situations requiring toughness and perseverance. We may or may not agree, and the way Conrad has the unnamed listener in \\"The Lagoon\\" react apathetically to the extent he reacts at all suggests he himself leaves the proverbial door open.\\"An Outpost of Progress\\" is one of Conrad's best stories, especially notable in that it is one of his shortest works but still very powerful and meaningful. It is unusual for him in being entirely satirical, anticipating his novel The Secret Agent in mocking the characters near-malevolently. However, these characters are truly hapless without being pitiable and deserve the narrator's scorn, which Conrad certainly pours on. The Belgian Congo setting and anti-colonialism stance also prefigure \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" but the latter aspect is far more overt. Conrad condemns colonialism's inhuman greed and callousness, but the story also works in a larger sense by wagging a well-deserved finger at human stupidity, ignorance, narrow-mindedness, and sheer ineptitude. The adventure element present in nearly all his stories is absent; this is a stark account of a dark era with even darker significance. This masterpiece belongs with his best work despite the length.\\"Youth\\" is one of Conrad's most famous and acclaimed stories but in my view not one of his best. Like the better-known \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" it is told by the character Marlow through another first-person narrator, but the plot is more akin to the symbolic, adventure-esque seafaring stories of prior Conrad. There is more traditional excitement and suspense than in most Conrad, especially later work, which may attract those who usually dislike his fiction. However, as nearly always with him, symbolism is the real point. As the title suggests, this is a tale about youth and all it stands for and arguably one of its best literary representations. Marlow recalls the excitement and elation he felt when he first captained a ship, fondly recalling exuberance and navet&eacute; long since lost. However, as so often in such situations, nearly everything goes wrong, and youthful ideals are put to experience's harshly dramatic test. \\"Youth\\" is thus a sort of mini-bildungsroman, though Marlow's mad rush for the symbolic finish at the end of his story proper shows he learned very little at the time. However, he is now wiser and older, and retelling the old story brings several ambivalent feelings. He sees how much he has conventionally grown and learned but cannot help lamenting the loss of idealism that is possible only in youth and that steadily dissipates with age to the extent that it becomes hardly recognizable. Many will unfortunately relate strongly to this, and there is a good dose of Conrad's always beautiful prose and, very unusually for him, even a little humor. \\"Youth\\" would easily be most writers' masterpiece but lacks the scope, ambition, and style of Conrad's best works.Typhoon is a strong short novel that fans will enjoy, though again not Conrad's best.As the title suggests, the majority of the action describes a typhoon's monumental effects, specifically how it impacts a ship. The extended scene portraying it is one of the best of its kind, recalling a similarly strong depiction in The...Narcissus. We get a powerful impression of nature's astounding force and just how insignificant humanity and its creations can be in the face of it.Engrossing as this is, it is of course really just fodder for Conrad's larger themes, the most immediate being the vast amount of things beyond humanity's control; for all our arrogance, there are many situations where we can do little or no more than sit back - or, in this case, hold on - and hope for the best. Typhoon is also in part a bildungsroman, though a somewhat unconventional one. The middle-aged Captain Macwhirr is ostensibly the protagonist, but the young Chief Mate Jukes takes center stage here. He enters the voyage with a considerable ego and pokes much fun at the literal-minded Macwhirr but comes to see that, for all his eccentricities, the latter's simple practicality, level-headedness, and strict determination are not without worth. Hapless as Macwhirr may be in numerous ways, he succeeds where many - perhaps most - ostensibly more intelligent people would fail. Jukes comes to see his value even if he cannot bring himself to give all deserved credit. The same is true of other characters to a lesser degree. Macwhirr himself also learns something in the course of the tale; though experienced and in many ways competent, he had never sailed through harsh weather and is tested in a way he never thought he would be. His near-surreal stubbornness means he perhaps did not learn nearly as much as he should have, but he made it through after all. Conrad leaves it open whether this is due to subtle strength or pure luck; it is certainly debatable whether Macwhirr is capable and even heroic in his own way or simply a fool. In any case, he and other characters find that, as he repeatedly says, you can't learn everything from books; Conrad leaves no doubt that there is often no substitute for experience.The setting and some of the action are very similar to several other Conrad works, but Typhoon also has its own strengths and is in some ways unusual. For example, characterization is very strong - not in the sense of being rounded, Macwhirr in particular being almost a Dickensian caricature, but in being simply memorable. The characters may be archetypes but are very entertaining - and many readers will see people they know in them. Typhoon is also quite humorous, which is surprising in an author whose humor is nearly always black in the rare cases where it exists at all. Macwhirr is of course the butt of much comic fodder, but there is a light-heartedness to many descriptions outside the central scene. Some, such as those in the sailors' households, have satirical bite, which will please those who miss Conrad's cynicism, but those who normally find him too dark may well be pleasantly surprised overall.This is certainly not Conrad's strongest story; the frustratingly abrupt way in which the storm's second half is passed over even seems to suggest he grew bored with the work and rushed toward the end. I personally think further storm descriptions would have simply been too much, and he perhaps thought so too, but there certainly should have been a less jerky transition. Some will also dislike the indirect narration toward the end, but I found it a successful, if not overly ambitious, experiment from an author renowned for constantly pushing narrative's proverbial envelope. More fundamentally, Typhoon lacks the astonishing psychological depth and dense philosophical dramatization that were always Conrad's top strengths. The latter is here to a certain extent but far less so than elsewhere, automatically putting the book below his best, though some of the other elements partly atone.Conrad's most underrated story, \\"Amy Foster\\" shows the sufferings and uncertainties of outsiders in Western culture. Inspired by Conrad's life, though considerably more dramatized than \\"Heart,\\" it shows that he was keenly aware of just how alone even an ostensibly well-adjusted foreigner could be in nineteenth century Western Europe. Drenched in pathos, this is one of Conrad's most moving works and very thought-provoking. It is also of historical interest for those curious about the era's treatment of foreigners and other outsiders and abounds with anthropological significance.Often called Conrad's last notable work, The Shadow-Line is below his masterpieces but well worth reading. Though it has many of his more famous and better works' obvious trappings, not least the Far East/ship setting, it is far more accessible; shorter, more tightly written, and less symbolic, it has a linear narrative and (for Conrad) very straight-forward prose. This may disappoint those who value his profound philosophical dramatization and narrative experimentation, but those who like him mainly for stirring adventure and basic human nature insight - especially if they think other elements hold him back - will like this especially.Even more than other Conrad works, the adventure aspect is particularly notable. The Shadow-Line lacks other novels' high pitch storm scenes, but its stark depiction of a ship in extreme condition is in many ways more affecting and certainly more relatable to most. We get a vivid idea of what it was like to be at sea in a true crisis. Like many Conrad stories, it is highly autobiographical, as one might have surmised from the wealth of realistic detail. Written in first-person from the captain's perspective, it vibrantly shows the great stress of overseeing a dire situation. Conrad is known for piercing psychological penetration, and though The Shadow-Line does not take the concept as abstractly far as other works, it is highly noteworthy in showing a representative mind - young, capable, and ambitious but inexperienced - under stress. Not least importantly, we get an unrelenting expression of self-doubt, hence the \\"A Confession\\" subtitle.As this suggests, the book is to a large degree a bildungsroman and may easily be seen as a companion to Conrad's \\"Youth,\\" another entry in the genre with further similar elements. Many will identify with the narrator's malaise, doubts, and lack of direction, not least because they come from an unknown source. At least as many will understand his elation at getting his first command. He quickly becomes a sympathetic character; we truly feel with and for him, at least as much because he is in so many ways an Everyman as because of his first-person narration. Fortunately, far fewer will be able to directly relate to his severely trying experiences, but the youth-to-adulthood passage that it symbolizes has universal significance. Like \\"Youth,\\" this laments the loss of illusions and ideals that are sadly inherent to aging, but in contrast to it, the advantages - such as they are - are also shown. The narrator loses much but gains a strong self understanding, not least just how far he can be pushed and how he can perform in such conditions. More importantly, he learns hard and bitter truths that only experience can teach and that he will later need to call on often.The narrator is not the only memorable character; this indeed has some of Conrad's most colorful and memorable, much to its advantage: the eccentric, deranged Mr. Burns; the calm, faithful Ransome; the deceptively intelligent Captain Giles; the quirky and lordly Captain Ellis; the comically hapless hotel steward; the contemptibly incompetent Hamilton; and not least, the startlingly malicious first captain who mercifully appears only in short flashbacks. If Conrad holds back in other areas - or if perhaps his talent had diminished -, he is at least as good as ever here.Despite the obvious lack of prior works' deep symbolism, some have seen the novel as a World War I allegory. There is significant biographical justification; the book was written during WWI, Conrad saying it was the only subject he could turn to, and his son, whom he says he thought of when writing, fought in the war. One can also make a good textual case; the story after all champions camaraderie as well as perseverance amid great danger including the machinations of a malevolent enemy springing from unknown malice. Perhaps above all, it holds out for a (relatively) satisfying end despite all, which would seem uncharacteristically optimistic but may well make sense in the context of Conrad's son. There is likely something in all this, but it has probably been pushed too far by those understandably if somewhat perversely determined to find strong symbolism because prior works had it. Some have also seen supernatural elements, but it seems obvious that they were meant to be taken as insanity portents; Conrad lacked belief in such things, and his Preface denounced the interpretation. None of this really matters in the end, because The Shadow-Line is strong regardless of whether it exists and would not be among his best work if it did; anyone interested in Conrad should read it in any case.In summary, few collections are so consistently strong, making it essential for anyone lacking the stories."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Re-visiting Conrad, I find that he enchants me more and more. My old impressions and hence my expectations now were totally off. He is so much better and funnier and more interesting.Typhoon is a funny adventure story. Don't fear you will get cheated on either side of the contradictory promise. The funny side is the social one: the novella or long story is told partly by quoting and summarizing letters that the protagonists write to their families at home or to friends. The writing protagonists: Captain MacWhirr, the man without imagination. First mate Jukes, a bigot with presumptions. First engineer Rout, the man with a Solomonic reputation, at least with wife and mother at home.The adventure: MacWhirr is not exactly a greenhorn, he has been skipper for a while, and he knows the South China Sea, where he works now, captaining a steamer under Siamese flag. The ship is 'Nan Shan', 'Southern Mountain', recently built in Scotland ; she carries 200 coolies back home to Fuzhou on the Fujian coast of the mainland in the Formosa Channel. They have been working in plantations or similar enterprises and are returning home with their savings in wooden boxes.The captain has two shortcomings. One is that he never experienced a taifoon. The other is purely subjective on the part of Jukes: the captain has no imagination. He takes everything literally. He runs his ship and his job and doesn't even come near to understanding why Jukes is bothered by the fact that the ship owners changed it to Siamese registration.Jukes is fully aware of his superiority over the 'passengers'. Or are they freight? They are packaged as such, nearly.The captain is too much down to earth to bother about such things.Unfortunately he does not know what a taifoon is. When it comes, he despises advice to steer around it. He goes the straight line, after all he has to justify his coal bill.The ship barely makes it. The coolies' boxes are smashed about in the storm. Their money is spilled out and fights erupt. The captain re-establishes control and solves the potential big isssue in a wise and shrewd way. Maybe no imagination, but lots of common sense.Conrad wrote this story after Lord Jim, and the subject has similarities. It was initially published in a magazine, then together with 3 other stories in a collection. It has some similarities with his 'Nigger of the Narcissus', insofar as ships have to survive big storms. But there is a big difference: the Narcissus is a sailing ship of high quality, managed by a top class professional crew. The Nan Shan is a modern steamer, and the crew has no idea what is coming for them, and has no influence on the ship's survival. A part of the plot here is Conrad's revenge against steam ships. They are just chunks of steel and they require little seamanship."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This was a powerful story that brought you right on that ship in the midst of the typhoon. My only criticism is that it was so short. I would have enjoyed more of a story line and for it to go on."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Great book and a great sea story. Anyone interested in sailing or survival at sea would be interested. Even for modern boats, a typhoon is an epic storm."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Though not Joseph Conrad's most ambitious or important work, Typhoon is a strong short novel that fans will enjoy. Conciseness and straight-forwardness make it a good place for neophytes to start, as one will not get the most out of Conrad's most complex works by jumping right into them, but those who want to read the best first should get at least six of his other pieces before this.Like nearly all Conrad, Typhoon can be enjoyed on a very basic level as an exciting adventure. As the title suggests, the majority of the action describes a typhoon's monumental effects, specifically how it impacts a ship. The extended scene portraying it is one of the best of its kind. We get a powerful impression of nature's astounding force and just how insignificant humanity and its creations can be in the face of it.Engrossing as this is, it is of course really just fodder for Conrad's larger themes, the most immediate being the vast amount of things beyond humanity's control; for all our arrogance, there are many situations where we can do little or no more than sit back - or, in this case, hold on - and hope for the best. Typhoon is also in part a bildungsroman, though a somewhat unconventional one. The middle-aged Captain Macwhirr is ostensibly the protagonist, but the young Chief Mate Jukes takes center stage here. He enters the voyage with a considerable ego and pokes much fun at the literal-minded Macwhirr but comes to see that, for all his eccentricities, the latter's simple practicality, level-headedness, and strict determination are not without worth. Hapless as Macwhirr may be in numerous ways, he succeeds where many - perhaps most - ostensibly more intelligent people would fail. Jukes comes to see his value even if he cannot bring himself to give all deserved credit. The same is true of other characters to a lesser degree. Macwhirr himself also learns something in the course of the tale; though experienced and in many ways competent, he had never sailed through harsh weather and is tested in a way he never thought he would be. His near-surreal stubbornness means he perhaps did not learn nearly as much as he should have, but he made it through after all. Conrad leaves it open whether this is due to subtle strength or pure luck; it is certainly debatable whether Macwhirr is capable and even heroic in his own way or simply a fool. In any case, he and other characters find that, as he repeatedly says, you can't learn everything from books; Conrad leaves no doubt that there is often no substitute for experience.The setting and some of the action are very similar to several other Conrad works, but Typhoon also has its own strengths and is in some ways unusual. For example, characterization is very strong - not in the sense of being rounded, Macwhirr in particular being almost a Dickensian caricature, but in being simply memorable. The characters may be archetypes but are very entertaining - and many readers will see people they know in them. Typhoon is also quite humorous, which is surprising in an author whose humor is nearly always black in the rare cases where it exists at all. Macwhirr is of course the butt of much comic fodder, but there is a light-heartedness to many descriptions outside the central scene. Some, such as those in the sailors' households, have satirical bite, which will please those who miss Conrad's cynicism, but those who normally find him too dark may well be pleasantly surprised overall.This is certainly not Conrad's strongest story; the frustratingly abrupt way in which the storm's second half is passed over even seems to suggest he grew bored with the work and rushed toward the end. I personally think further storm descriptions would have simply been too much, and he perhaps thought so too, but there certainly should have been a less jerky transition. Some will also dislike the indirect narration toward the end, but I found it a successful, if not overly ambitious, experiment from an author renowned for constantly pushing narrative's proverbial envelope. More fundamentally, Typhoon lacks the astonishing psychological depth and dense philosophical dramatization that were always Conrad's top strengths. The latter is here to a certain extent but far less so than elsewhere, automatically putting the book below his best, though some of the other elements partly atone.All told, anyone interested in Conrad should read this, but those coming to it early should be aware that it is not representative of his best work."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Captain Macwhirr has a lack of imagination that both imperils the crew and may provide their salvation. He sails his ship the Nan-Shan directly into a typhoon because he is unable to envision weather worse than he has seen in the past. Macwhirr must find a way to hold his ship and crew together to weather the storm.This book is so compelling because of the actions of the colorful and intelligent characters who swirl around Macwhirr. While critical of the captain when becalmed, they hold firmly to his unchanging, stolid figure when things look hopeless. In an uncertain situation, people will follow certainty -- even if its source is dubious. I think this nugget of truth and the reflections of it we see in real-life lend this novel its power. Macwhirr is certainty itself, more from mindlessness than steadfastness, and others follow.Beyond the fascinating story and character-study is Conrad's stunning writing. He says so much with so little without the hard edges of Hemingway's prose. Conrad uses adjectives, but with a diamond cutter's precision."},{"Title":"Typhoon (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I first read this story in high school, 1973, and read it all the time since. Its a quick intense read. I did spend 10 years at sea in Alaska commercial fishing and of all the books on storms, this is still my favorite. Some people don't like Conrad's Lord Jim, but I like all his works. Farley Mowat also has some great sea stories that I feel are pretty realistic. The Serpents Coil, and Grey Seas Under are the two I liked best, and The Boat that Wouldn't Float is one of the funnyest I have read."},{"Title":"Fun on Foot in America's Cities","review":"Fun on Foot makes a fantastic addition to any book collection.

Where am I in the anti-war status? I haven't decided, but I am sure that it has given me something to think about. It must be taken with more of an intelectual status. To be able to be in that position is mind boggling. Can I ever be able to comprehind this struggle for communication? To be a piece of man not, as some views not a human but a thing, 100% man. Can I believe this happening? Yes, I could. Can I believe that he would be hidden and sheltered from society? Yes. The end of your life and all you have is hope, to be able to communicate and then once you do.........you're shot down, your are to be shut up and never to be heard again.

I agree with Joe, the main character, that war is pointless. Those that die never get to see freedom or liberty, so what are they fighting for it? I think every High School student should read this book and discuss it for a class. It is a good experience, especially when you make a study of war using books, movies, and plays. We have been studying war for the last month, and in that month we read Bury the Dead, Johnny Got His Gun, and watched Saving Private Ryan. All of these fell together so well. It was an excellent experience. The one thing I didn't like about the book is the end. This is probably because I didn't like the fact that when he was finally able to do what he had been trying to do for so long, they made him stop, and I wanted to know more.

As such, it succeeds - the book does a great job of showing how terrible war can be for one person fighting in it, rather than the entire country. In that sense, it kinda reminds me of Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms, albeit a lot more darker and pessimistic. The author does a great job of shifting back and forth between the present and flashbacks, and it shows how drastically this person's life was affected by deciding to go to war. The book tries to show that soldiers are also people, with pasts and futures - and it's successful at that. And while I don't agree with a lot of Mr. Trumbo's antiwar sentiments (which seem to be thrown haphazardly into the text a few times, making the book seem like an editorial), it's still a book that should be read, if only to prove that war can affect a person a lot, and while the country is celebrating victory and honoring dead, there also are injured people forgotten in military wards, not celebrated or being honored."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo's \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" is a tale of war, and an overly gruesome depiction of how terrible a thing like war is. While the book's literature is certainly for those at least 16 years of age, there is more to this book that will test the mind of its readers.Meet Joe Bonham, the 20-something year old WWI veteran who encountered a shell as it screamed its way into the trench he was in, tearing off his legs, arms, face, tongue, and stripping him of four of his five senses. Lucky for him, he can still touch and feel vibrations of those who walk around in his hospital room. After coming to terms with spending his life like a slab of meat, Joe begins to do his share of thinking. His thoughts will drift from his past experiences, to his current motionless state.The lack of \\"correct\\" punctuation and grammar (disregarding commas and leaving in run-ons) are what give the novel its mood, its feel. Trumbo forces you to read fast without a pause in thought, so you yourself can experience Joe's panic-ridden thoughts, and are forced to feel sorry for him. There is a disturbing amount of detail in Trumbo's writing, describing the scenes of war as if it were being shown to a blind man. Trumbo's twisted sense of humor, coupled with his powerful language will surely test his reader's stomach and will certainly give them a new outlook on war."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Written before World War II, Johnyy Got His Gun is a very powerful anti-war novel written by Dalton Trumbo. It tells the story of Joe Bonham, an average young man who enlists in the army to serve in France during the first world war. Horribly mutilated by a shell, Joe loses his arms, legs, mouth, nose, hearing, and sight. He is forced to lie on a hospital bed as the world goes on around him. Trapped by his body, his mind must try and survive. There are countless powerful passages in Trumbo's novel. After years of being able to do nothing but think, Joe attempts to communicate with his nurses through morse code by beating his head against his pillow. Reading this passage, you can feel his desperation as he tries to contact the world.Johnny Got His Gun is not an easy book to read, but it is worth it once you are done. Trumbo writes much of his story as a train of thought of Joe Bonham, so much of the novel is a run-on sentence. Because of this, the reader feels like you are there with Joe. This novel will make you question everything you ever thought about war, most notably patriotism and the overall stupidity of the violence of war. The ending alone with Joe's condemnation of the governments and higher-ups is worth a read. This book ranks up there with Slaughterhouse Five and All Quiet on the Western Front as classic anti-war novels. For a very powerful and moving book about the atrocities of war, check out Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun!"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said before? There is a reason why this book has survived for more than seventy years and reads like it was written yesterday. It's raw and unflinching, fast-paced and angry. Most of the prose is stream of consciousness and I've never seen it used more effectively. However it does get a bit grating toward the end. What makes this book survive the times is that Trumbo never waivers in his humanity. You are constantly reminded of it, which makes Johny that much more horrific. We actually have rock and roll to blame for expanding our minds, because if it was not for Metallica, some may never have heard of this book.

I thought that like all other summer reading, this would be hell, but from the first page of the book I was sucked in! I became attached to the character Joe, and realized how truely destructive war is. This is deffinitly the best book I have read in a long time. I would highly recomend it to anyone! If you are looking for a good book deffinitly pick this one up!"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Thought to be one of the greatest antiwar novels written to date, Johnny got his gun is a terribly horrifying story about a young farm boy, Joe, who enters the great war. It packs a lot of power in the mere 243 pages.Dalton Trumbo, wrote this book about five years after WWI. When it first was sent to publishers no one wanted to print it thinking that people would be angered by the book or find it to ruthless. Thus the book never was published until 1959, fifteen years after WWII . When it first started selling many people felt the writing was anti government and went against democracy.The book stays with Joe the whole time there, just there in his mind. Both you and him slowly realize he is missing nearly every part of his body, even his face. Most men would go crazy, Joe is like most men he is emotionally ripped apart by the fact he can still live with so little still a part of him.Through the pages you are opened up to a new perspective of war through Joe's thoughts, Its not glorious, death isn't great. This is all taught by realization of what Joe has lost, his life. He thinks back on his whole life. He realizes he has lost track of time so he devises a calendar which includes his own holidays and months.This book is tremendously powerful. Although the writing is nothing of a bestsellers the point comes across very well. I found it hard to read this book due to its graphic depiction's of Joe and battle. It really makes you wonder \\"War, What is it good for...?\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In a furious mad rush of energy without pause or punctuation, Dalton Trumbo explains the cruel and unforgiving aftermath of war, in the form of a WWI verteran named Joe Bonham. Losing his senses after a bomb blast, Joe must learn to work with his mind in a hospital hellhole without the limbs that we would all take for granted.The grim and gripping reality of war and its effects are presented with such precision and anger, with Trumbo using every man who lost his life, every child that would be born if that man was alive today, and every man who fought for false liberty and justice as his influence.The book weaves in and out between Joe's present life and his past memories. His whirling emotions are played in his mind like a movie production would. Boredom and pitch black darkness create an emotional playground, with memories of Kareen, his friends and family twirling and teasing him with the bitter reality that he will never be able to know his closest kin, but only visualize them.With Joe's present life, he is able to make a perceptive brain schedule of his nurses and time of day. He can feel the temperature change, the vibration of the hospital staff's footsteps, and the touch of the nurses attending to him. By using his knowledge of Morse code, he is at a constant danger of not being understood, or by being put to sleep to shut his manic rapidfire tapping motions.Trumbo is victorious in the ideas of pacifism and idiocies of war. It is a confusing ead, however, with its continious sentences, but it a rewarding story when it ends. This book is a great example of how war is a contradictory statement: Why must we have war in order to have peace?"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got his Gun is a unique terrifying masterpiece. It's usually heralded as an antiwar novel which it is, but not in the usually sense. A man in WWI is blown to bits by a bomb but by &quot;luck&quot; survives, his mind intact. Dalton Trumbo was a communist and opposed WWI, but believed in fighting WWII when the book came out, so therefore recommended the suppression of his own book for the sake of the war effort. What's usually overlooked about this book is the philosophical questions this predicament raises about human existence in general. In the great film version Donald Sutherland plays Christ who says he himself can't help Joe. Joe is helpless in the ultimate horror of existence. Also overlooked is the antimedical establishment message, which keeps Joe alive against his will (Where's Dr. Kevorkian when you need him?)Finally the antiwar message is blatant and the strongest argument against war in all of history. At the end Trumbo makes the point that millions of men are mamed in similar ways in war. And the film came out during Vietnam when many guys were coming to their senses and draft-dodging. There should never again be a draft in this or any country."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I read this book once a year and have since I was a little rocker boy who wanted to know more behind the Metallica song, \\"One.\\" I have grown quite a bit since then and each time I read the simple book, it has a bit more meaning.Overall the common idea I get from the book is \\"as a soldier, who's war am I fighting?\\" The book points towards politicans and policy makers as the reason Joe is over there. Consequently, the book would point this as the reason behind every war since WWI. It's an idea, and should be seen as that. It's not doctrine, but it's an interesting idea.

We will use the guns you force upon us we will use them to defend our very lives and the menace to our lives does not lie on the other side of a nomansland that was set apart without our consent it lies within or own boundaries here and now we have seen it and we know it.Put the gun into our hands and we will use them.Give us the slogans and we will turn them into realities. Sing the battle hymns and we will take them up where you left off. Not one not ten not ten thousand not a million not ten million not ten millions not a hundred millions but a billion two billions of us all the people of the world we will have the slogans and we will have the hymns and we will have the guns and we will use them and we will live. Make no mistake of it we will live. We will be alive and we will walk and talk and eat and sing and laugh and feel and love and bear our children in tranquility in security in decency in peace. You plan the wars and point us the way and we will point the gun.\\"Dalton Trumbo --- Johnny Got His Gun"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun was published on the eve of WW2, Poland had just been invaded by Germany and the world powers were gearing up for war. As the US entered the conflict, many pacifists of the American Left used this novel as their &quot;poster-book&quot; for a movement of pacifism. Trumbo, however, decided to end publishing of the book until the end of WW2.I learned all of this from reading the introduction, and truly, I wish I had not read the introduction. Trumbo seems to be confused on the question of war, it seemed to me after reading this book that Dalton was a pacifist, but the introduction makes it seem that Trumbo disapproved of WW1 but enjoyed the conflict of WW2. This is very strange to read after reading one of the best pacifist novels ever. However, I should point out that a second part of the intro was added in 1970 by Trumbo which denounced the Vietnam War. All of this leads me to believe that Trumbo may in fact approve of some wars, which lessens the impact of the book.As for the actual book, it is done BEAUTIFULLY. You are taken through the mind of a former soldier, from his current ailment to his past to the war in between. One entire chapter in the book is the man rambling to himself about the ludicrious reasons men go to war. It is life-changing, really.In short, it is an excellent novel that Gandhi, King, and the later Malcom X probably all loved or would've loved if they had read it, it is a manifesto of pacifism, probably the best one ever done by a white American. There are too many people in this world who cannot learn to forgive, understand, and love eachother, and are consumed with the need to hurt eachother. This book will take those conservatives down a notch."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This story should be a reminder of some of the sacrifices that our soldiers make for war.

It Had The Potential To Be A Truly Moving Story, But It Just Wasn't Carried Out Well. I Think I Would've Been Much More Affective If Trumbo Hadn't Felt The Need To Repeatedly Tell Me Exactly How I Was Supposed To Be Affected. A Conversation I Had With Friends Sums This Up Perfectly. When He Saw What I Was Reading He Asked About It. I Told Him It Was About The Horrors Of War And Had Gained A Reputation Since Its Publishing Of Being Synonymous With Varios Anti-War Movements. I Then Explained That The Main Character Had Essentially Been Reduced To A Thinking, Feeling, Human Slab Of Meat And The Book Was Written From His Point Of Veiw. My Friend Had Responded That It Certainly Sounded Like A Strong Argument Against War. And All I Could Think Was \\"EXACTLY!\\" The Story Itself Tells You Why War Is Horrible And Especially So For People Who Don't Really Have Involvement In The Condlict To Begin With. This Point Does NOT Need To Be Restates Over And Over Again Until It Is Pounded Into The Reader's Brain. Tell Me The Story, Let Me Get The Message Myself.

I found this book fairly hard to follow at the start but, as it went on it got a little easier to understand. I, as an American citizen, was offended by the anti-war views that he had expressed in this book. Dalton Trumbo is a very good writer, but I didn't agree with some of his views that he expressed in this book. I think that a good American citizen should be willing to put his or her life on the line for our countries saftey if it is needed."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This novel is VERY hit and miss. The flashback scenes were actually my favorite, in which we get a glimpse of this man, Joe, before he was a slab of meat with a brain. His descriptions of being a faceless, armless, legless, earless, lipless, noseless, etc. man are quite gory and disturbing, which is good. But he gets a bit redundant here and there, making the impact not as powerful as it could be. When he goes off on tangents about Christ I think I get the symbolism, but it doesn't quite jive with me. I believe Trumbo was trying to make a statement, and that is fine, but I think (especially at the end)his statement gets in the way of the story, which in turn gets in the way of the impact. As a reader you feel you were manipulated just to get to the part where he is raling against war, in a context that doesn't seem to gel with the story. Plus the style of writing is pretty sloppy, and what's with the no comas? Kind of got on my nerves.Overall, glad I read it, certianly wasn't a waste of time, but as far as being the \\"fiercest anti-war novel ever written\\" I'd hope not, because in it's shining moments it seems to be about survival most of all, and not necessarily about the evil's of war, at least it wasn't for me."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Beware of buying used books. This one was in definitely not good condition. Within a day, the back cover fail off. Buyer beware."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I have read many favorable reviews, including those claiming this is one of, if not the best anti-war book ever written. Those people must never have read Eric Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, writen in 1928 by a German who actually fought in the trenches of WWI. This novel gets to the corps of what is evil about war. It is not a political statement, as Trumbo's book was, and has been further defined by alledgedly anti-war persons who don't seem to realize that when they make statements about turning guns against their eneimies. (Those words are in the introduction of the version I read), they are not against war per se, but a \\"justified\\" war based on political considerations.Trumbo's political viewpoints, amplified by anti-war persons who have followed, can not hold a candle to former communist, who actually fought during the Spanish civil war, by the man who wrote 1984 or Animal Farm. This are indictments against totalitarism, and big government. The problem with Trumbo, and Hollywood, and all that have come afterwards, they selectively pick and choose. Yes, Joeseph Mc Carthy was a creep, but what does that make Joeseph Kennedy, father of Jack Kennedy? As someone who was sent to the Viet-Nam war by LBJ, why does Nixon, who got us out, get the blame for the war? Why do those in Hollywood continue to idolize people who may have been great writers, as Trumbo was, or actors, or Directors, who in my opinion, which I think History has borne out, were incredibly naive about Joeseph Stalin and Communism. Just ask anyone who actually lived in the Soviet Union. Did they have a better idea about t he subject, than someone who was the highest paid writer in Hollywood? How many great writers were exterminated by Stalin. Why do they ignore that in addition to Hitler banning All Quiet, Stalin banned and killed his share of writers who disokeased him. Just before WWII began, Communist card holders, and sympathizers were treated to a series of actions by Stalin, that should have caused anyone with an once of intellectual honesty to question how one day, Stalin is great, then evil, then great, all within a short period of time.As a veteran of Viet-Nam, I was one of the lucky ones who came home without a physical scratch. But I lost some of my generation there. I don't believe any of us, in that war, or any other war does not have some psychological scars. The first being, why was I save, and my friend killed? In the face of what we should all know, that war is a horrible terrible thing, no matter what the cause, or who profits, or who is on the right side. Writing a book about war, and how bad it is, for political reasons, is beneath my contempt.Despite how evil war is, in the long run, its inevitable. There is not a single country, town, or neighborhood that has not changed hands because of war, whether fought with fist, knive or any technologically advanced weapons."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is an 'oh, Kay.' book. Not great, but trying so hard to be great that I place it in the \\"Striving-for-Mediocrity\\" category. A far more poignant ant-war novel - \`Johnny' is a novella at best - would be Ron Kovak's \\"Born on the Fourth of July.\\"The story of Johnny is, nonetheless, one well worth experiencing; the printed word is not, however, the best medium for sharing his experience. The film adaptation is little better, but clips from the film and dialogue from the book are artfully blended in the 1989 music video \\"Two of One\\" by Metallica.While I usually pooh-pooh film adaptations of literature and am not particularly a fan of heavy metal, this recommendation flies in the face of most, if not all, of my previous reviews; I stand by it!Skip the book, skip the film, buy the music video and share Johnny's nightmare with the audio cranked up as high as you can stand it!"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I heard about this book in another book, and ever since I did, I've been pining to read it. Oddly enough, my local library did not have a copy, but my school library (a tiny little thing) happened to have one. I saw it while I was walking along the isles and immediately checked it out.It was one of the best choices I've ever made.This is a fantastic book, one that should be read all over the country. This is a modern classic. A real modern classic, too.We find Joe in a hospital bed gradually realizing that he is an armless, legless, earless, eyeless, noseless, mouthless slab of meat after being shredded by a shell in WWI.What follows is a gruesome and horrific story that protests war and proclaims that life is the most important thing. Even more important than liberty or freedom or \\"any other words there are always words.\\"Sure, there are no commas and most of the sentences are either two words or an entire page, but it makes for an interesting read. The lack of said commas only makes the book go faster, a quick pace that drives us into the heart of our worst fears emobodied in Joe.This is a wonderful book, breathtaking and imaginative. A daring journey into death with a mind.I can understand why so many people don't want to read it, though. It is a book that explores ideas that no one wants to hear in times of war when plastic flags wave from SUVs. But still, enjoy it for the literary genius that it is.If only I could give it another star..."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book is the reason why I'm so anti-war.I cannot add to what others have said so much more eloquently, but I can help people realize why things were done.1. The run-on style: Do you think in true English sentences? Can you type as well as you write as well as you speak as well as you think? This was done to show the insanity of Joe Bonham and that it was all in his head.2. The ending: This was done to give the reader some leeway in the story. You choose the pessimism as the end.3. The lack of plot: Plot was not a main goal in this book; shock value was. Before a time of Steven King, Tom Clancy, and all the thrill writers, there was this book. It is meant to scare you, not with cheap thrills, but with true and utter primal feelings.4. The gore: This is a book about war. War is disgusting, war is intolerable, war is gory. Get that knights in white armour fighing the evil dragon vision out of your head and think walking bombs made of six-year-old girls. It was a part of the book put in to placate the masses.However, the reason why it does not receive five stars is the fact that it will not satisfy everyone. There are always the people who will not get it, refuse to get it, will get it and disagree so strongly that they ignore the book, and the people like me, who have been changed by it to agree wholeheartedly.It is neither a book for everyone, nor is it something that should be missed is given the chance."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is not something I would suggest to someone to read. Who wants to hear about a guy's memories from his life who is pretty much dead. He also shows no pride in fighting for his country, he should have taken his medal with honor.

In my personal opinion, the book was not very interesting to read. When the book started out, there wasn't a whole lot going on and that turned me away from liking the rest of the book. The author had an interesting idea to write a book from the views of a wounded soldier who lost his whole body except for his chest and half of his head, but there just weren't too many interesting events going on. Joe really irritated me, too, because it seemed like he was not proud at all to have fought for his country in the war and that he was the only soldier who had to suffer after being wounded. This is not a book that I would recommend to many people who like books with action in them."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book was very hard to follow at the beginning. It got much easier to follow at the end. It was one of the most anti-war books that I've ever read. This book had to many things brought back from Joe's life.

It is amazing."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book was released at a most unfortunate time: Two weeks after the Nazis invaded Poland. Trumbo's message was powerful and poignant yet drowned out by the beat of war drums.Though written in 1939, you can see some things just don't change (especially with the current atrocity in Iraq).\\"You can always hear the people who are willing to sacrifice somebody else's life. They're plenty loud and they talk all the time. You can find them in churches and schools and newspapers and legislatures and congress. That's their business. They sound wonderful. Death before dishonor. This ground sanctified by blood. These men who died so gloriously. They shall not have died in vain. Our noble dead.\\"Hmmmm.\\"What do the dead say?\\"Trumbo very clearly gets his anti-war message across in the form of Joe Bonham, a 20 year-old who joined the Army to fight in \\"The Great War.\\" He was left a piece of meat after being hit by a shell in France (after waking from his coma, he struggles to determine if he's in England or France, neither location giving him comfort). He's left without legs, arms, deaf, blind, a mask covering the spot where his face used to be. Yet Joe lives, and the only thing he's got left is his mind.Instead of having legs to run away from it all, arms to kill himself with, a voice to keep himself company, eyes to look around with, he goes through everything he's ever learned in his mind to keep himself occupied. Sometimes, going over so much and asking so many questions about everything for so long makes Joe second-guess his sanity.\\"He thought here you are Joe Bonham lying like a side of beef all the rest of your life and for what? Somebody tapped you on the shoulder and said come along son we're going to war. So you went. But why? In any other deal like buying a car or running an errand you had the right to say what's there in it for me?\\"\\"And what's more mister are you as much interested in this liberty as you want me to be?\\" (Translation: You're so gung ho about this war, YOU go out and fight it!)With the current atrocity happening in Iraq, I couldn't help but think how some things never change when reading Chapter X. It's the same old tired lines. You would think that, with time, the pro-war folks would have thought of something new.This book is heavy reading and is definitely worth it. It WILL stay with you for a while after you've read it and much of what Dalton Trumbo wrote all those years ago still rings true.\\"And now I lay me down to sleep my bomb-proof cellar's good and deep but if I'm killed before I wake remember god it's for your sake. Amen.\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This novel by Dalton Trumbo has left me speechless. All the positive aspects of this book you have read are true, and most (if not, all) of the negative aspects are false.For example, one reviewer writes that &quot;we do not know if Johnny would be outraged by his condition.&quot; Now I find this terribly ignorant. Johnny is upset because that is what the author dictated. He is angry because Trumbo said so, and lets face it, you would not be a happy camper if you arms, legs, and face were blown apart.That same reviewer also states that sever accidents that induce disabilities do not create a desire for suicide. Think again. When someone suffers a trauma like amputation, blindness, etc. horrible fits of depression sink in, ESPICALLY when you experience in one accident total removal of arms, legs, and senses. An old friend of my teacher's commited suicide about 6 monthes after he lost his legs in a motorcycle accident. Please, don't be foolish and say that you wouldn't want to commit suicide after such a terrible atrocity.Alright, the main focus that Trumbo tried to convey is obviously that war is hell. Now, who makes war? Man. Who fights war? Man. What, if anything, has been gained by war? Nothing, really. Don't give me this WWII saved jews BS, because remember the idea is to abolish ALL war, not just American involvment in war. This means that Trumbo is also against the war to exterminate Jews. The idea, in the mind of Trumbo, is that the war to preserve democracy/freedom/whatever isn't any better than a war to end democracy/freedom/whatever. It also seems to me that this particular reviewer thinks that Stalin's russia and communism are the same when in fact they are quite different.I personally find that a point/counterpoint argument helps us to lear and understand. Maybe the same is true for yourself, maybe it isn't. Final words: excellent novel. The book is short (about 250 pages) so I recommend picking it up even if you are a bit strapped on time."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This story is timeless, and will be told and retold for generations to come. Since its creation over 60 years ago, it has inspired a movie, a hit song by Metallica, and a one-man theatrical adaptation. I discovered the book through the play, and I have never cried as much just reading text. Mr. Trumbo's words are what gives the novel and the play life, and the story is so human and well told that it can't help but be moving. It is one soldier's story, a soldier who has lost everything, and though painful, it is shockingly beautiful, as is most of the work inspired by it. I only wish Amazon carried the text of the play!

This book is a must read for any and all of those few sane people left in this country that realize that other solutions must be sought out. George W. probably hasn't read this book, but if he has, I'm certain that he wouldn't want you to read it. This book did not score any points for Dalton Trumbo with the warmongering US government. On the contrary, it earned him a place on the Hollywood Blacklist.It is also great that this book goes very well with the movie. That is, it doesn't matter whether you read the book first or see the movie, you'll enjoy both and being familiar with one will help you to get more out of the other.Also, I am quite positive, although I have never read about it anywhere or heard this band ever give credit to Dalton Trumbo, that the song &quot;One&quot; by Metallica is drawn from this book."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In his introduction to his own book the author implies that the book might have been valid for World War I but not for World War II. \\"If the book had been banned {in World War II) I doubt that I should have protested very loudly,\\" he says.

Is he saying that it's all right to be a pacifist during a \\"romantic\\" war but not in a non-romantic war? In any case, I found his introduction dismaying.

On page 114-115: \\"You can always hear the people who are willing to sacrifice somebody else' life.\\"). In Chapter 10 Trumbo especially makes cogent arguments for the \\"little guy\\" to be wary of wars. Instead of argued about as \\"principles,\\" the case for a war ought to be made \\"in facts like houses and tables. Make it in words we can understand.\\" (113) Yes, Trumbo says, there are principles worth fighting for, but that the case for war needs to be made honestly, with frank and hard admissions of what the outcome will be for those who fight them. When soldiers die in war, they are not \\"thinking of democracy and freedom and liberty and honor and the safety of the home and the stars and stripes forever?\\" (117) The losses of life, family, etc. are probably bearing most on their thoughts. And they might just trade \\"democracy for life,\\" when facing death. (118) This may not be correct or true, but certainly the discussion of wars ought to include these questions, and without any name-calling and impugning of people's patriotism that so often occurs. While Chapter 10 is not as beautiful and piercing as Falstaff's dissection of honor in Henry IV, Part I, it is not a bad corollary on the same theme.The rest of the book has been well-covered by other reviewers.A word about the style.

Its message is important, but the one thing that makes this so great: it has no punctuation. The speed and pace with which you read this novel aids in the action and the message of the story. This was the inspiration for the Metallica song and video &quot;One,&quot; to aid in the visual placement. It's about a hunk of meat in a hospital bed, no senses, not ability tp speak. It is the best depiction of the horrors of war that can ever be captured in the written word or on screen, as this novel was in a movie of the same name. You learn the torment and suffering and pain of losing all hope, knowing that you went to war and had your life ended, even though your still alive. You're inside this mans head, thinking what he thinks just as if you were thinking it all for yourself. The message is clear and it has a lot of supporting evidence. Trumbo is relentless in voicing his opinion of anti-war sentments. You know very soon that he against the thought of war.

He ended up being a torso with a mind to think with. All he had were his memories and a life to live made of his own creation. All he did was contimplate life's wonders and theries, analyzing them and picking them apart. He had no one to talk to except the people in his head. Joe was an example for all of us. Not only showing us what war is really like and the consequences of it, but also what it takes to go through life and live life in the form of something that many would consider to be not human.Yes, Joe was bitter about his situation, but who wouldn't be?

Whether you consider it an anti-war treatise or just a voyeuristic look inside the mind of a man damaged beyond repair, it's a book that can't be put aside easily. It's haunting and morbidly fascinating to be adrift in the thoughts of a person whose entire existence is thoughts. It's bleak and often uncomfortable, but it's a tale written so uniquely and so vividly, the reader really feels he is sneaking away the thoughts of this ruined soldier. It will stick with you long after you've read the page and that's what separates the great novels from the merely good ones.-- Mark LaFlamme, author of \\"The Pink Room.\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Excellent book; it deserves as much attention and praise as All Quiet On the Western Front for its startling, realistic depiction of the effects of war. Trumbo clearly illustrates how war not only damages the young soldiers who fight it, but also the civilians who must deal with the consequences of it. Trumbo gives Joe, a wounded American soldier, a voice, one that could belong to any soldier of any nation, one which Joe would otherwise not have because he has been rendered incapable of communication by the war. What we as readers observe are Joe's thoughts and memories, his remarkable efforts not only to measure time but also to communicate with the nurses and doctors in the hospital. While he does succeed to some degree in both areas, the reaction of the doctors and officials to his only request proves heartbreaking but typical."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I read this book on spring vacation at the beach. It had been assigned by a World History teacher at my university so I was desperately hoping it would be an easy read, I'd get the jest of it and be able to test well on it the following week. I ended up so enthralled by the book and the way Dalton Trumbo portrayed the atrocities of World War I that I finished the book in one sitting. It stuck with me. The book puts you in the shoes of an American boy who ends up in WWI on the battlefields of Europe. The war was an especially gruesome war that introduced the idea of machinery in battle to completely mow down the enemy. The senselessness of the killings is brought to you through this one boy's injuries, so severe they're almost unimaginable. Coupled with his in and outs of the past and his will to communicate with the outside world, Trumbo takes you on a journey that begs a deeper understanding of the reasons behind wars and the human spirit's unbreakable need to survive. I will never look at WWI with the same carefree nature that you have with a cold read of American history through a textbook and I will always remember the emotion that ran through me that day on the beach.Note for Gen-Xers: The Metallica song &quot;One&quot; is about this book."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book was very moving for me. I first heard about it from the song Metallica made about it and from there, I got interested in knowing how this man lived and thought while he was just laying there. I couldn't put it down, I just wanted to keep reading, finding out what happens next. Now that I'm finished with this book, I can't stop thinking about it. It was very touching for me. As you read about this man, you really sympathize with him and you wonder if his family will ever know what became of him or what happens in the future. This book really makes you think about how bad war is and also how thankful you are for what you have--including your own arms, legs, face, etc. I didn't care for the ending--he ended it too shortly and keeps you hanging, wondering what might happen. But all in all, I liked the book, it was moving."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The book is an amazing plunge into the human mind. The more you read, the more engrossed you become...Some of it is stomach churning, some heart wrenching...However, it feels too real for you to take comfort in saying: &quot;It's only a book&quot;. Although a complete work of fiction, it is as real as any autobiography I've read. It is thought provoking, inspirational and has a depth that varies depending on the reader. A friend of mine read it and took a completly different meaning from it...He couldn't see what I saw so it's definately a disscusion book, one to share with your friends...My copy has been passes around and around and around and we still talk about it. I definately recommend this book, especially for teenage boys and philosophers."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is the most invigorating piece of writing I've ever read. It's a fiction novel about a young American survivor name Joe Bonham who was injured during World War I. Being a survivor of the war, Joe desperately wanted to die. He survived through a bomb blast with no arms, legs, nose, eyes, ears, and mouth including all of his teeth. Using captivating yet simple words, Dalton Trumbo descriptively guided the reader through an intensifying, unimaginable, and unforgettable nightmare of Joe Bonham.Losing his five senses and his ability to walk and talk, Joe lay on his hospital's bed thinking about the past. Slipping in and out of sleep unknowingly, Joe didn't know what time of day it was, whether he was awake or asleep dreaming. One time, he saw a rat crawling toward him and then feed itself on the unhealable wound on the side of his stomach. Imagine losing all your senses, your ability to move, and think of a fat rat feeding on your own flesh and blood everyday but you just couldn't do anything about it. Wouldn't that be a horrible life to live? Nevertheless, Trumbo brought Joe back to the real world through the most powerful tool of the human body, the mind. Using his mind, Joe was able to page time, his surroundings, how many people were in his room, and eventually communicates with the outside world. By creating Joe, who sacrificed his life for war and for his country and all he wanted in return was to die because what's left of him is lifeless, Trumbo also created an extraordinary, emotionally, intense and unforgettable book. Johnny Got His Gun immediately became the bestseller of its time. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who likes reading about the horrors of war and the emotions of a &quot;living-dead&quot; soldier."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"&quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; is the most powerful piece of writing I've read. It is a story of a young American terribly maimed in WWI. He survives armless, legless, and faceless, but with his mind intact, it is an immediate bestseller. By using powerful words, Trumbo leads the readers through a flood of intense emotions that are unforgettable. Imagine that you are without your five senses and no longer mobile. That means no walking or talking, no touch, sight or smell, no face to show expression, only the loneliness of your own thoughts. How can you survive or survive or struggle through that horrible time? With very strong and powerful words, Trumbo brought the main character, Joe, to the time of living again. After waking up from a long sleep, Joe starts to realize that he is still alive and still has his mind that can be used for something more meaningful, instead of lying there like a death body. He learns how to keep track of the time by counting the nurse'visits. He also learns how to tell whether it is night or daytime by feeling the heat absorbed by his body. He uses vibrations from the nurse's footsteps to measure the dimension of his room, and the number of people come in. He also begins to communicate with people outside the world by using the Morse Code.He taps his head against the pillow many times, trying to say the word S.O.S-Help- even though he knows that it would be a very small chance for people to recognize his message. However, his life changes when he receives a new nurse. Being patient, the nurse tries to talk to him by drawing letters on his chest.The first word he gets from her is &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; This nurse also brings more people to come see him. There is no word to describe or imagine how happy he is. &quot;He thought of himself with a kind of hysterical happiness four years maybe five years maybe six years he didn't know how many years but he has been through all of them.&quot; But when they ask him &quot;What do you want?&quot;, for a moment he is in the shock of disappointed at discovering it is not the person he has been waiting for. Trumbo uses very emotional words to describe how disappointed he is. &quot;They should know what he wanted and they should know they couldn't give it to him. He wanted the things they took for granted the things nobody could ever give him. He wanted eyes to see with.....He wanted a nose so that he could smell rain.....He wanted a mouth so that he could eat and talk and laugh and taste and kiss.....He wanted arms and legs so he could work and walk.....but that was it, and he had done it. He had broken through, and they had refused him by saying &quot;What you want is against regulation.&quot;&quot; He sacrificed all his life for war and now that was all he got, living lonely in a dark silent world with a maimed body, having no feeling of life. &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; remains the most revolutionary, searing document against war and justice. With the most beautiful words, Trumbo creates a terrifying book, an extraordinary emotional intensity that can never be forgotten by anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is one of the most incredible and most difficult books that I have ever read. The style is not complex; but if you let yourself fall into the plight, into the mind, the life of the protagonist... it can become a very hard read. It makes you think about the world surrounding you, all of it, in an unimaginable way."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"After reading this book, I gave it to my nephew, a Sophmore in college and then he gave it to his younger brother, a Junior in high school. We were all very impressed with this painful and insightful book. The basic story of Joe Bonham enlisting in WWI, going to France, and having his eyes, mouth, ears, nose, arms, and legs blown off will make you shiver with dread and horror.As he comes out of his morphine coma he gradually realizes step by step that he has lost senses, mouth, and limbs and is being fed with a feeding tube in his throat. His heroic efforts to make sense of his black, soundless world and communicate with the outside world attests to the abilities of the human spirit and reminded me of the story of Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker. Yet people knew there was a person inside blind and deaf Helen Keller. Poor Joe is just seen as a mindless tragic piece of convulsing meat.Yet he makes sense of his world gradually by paying attention to footsteps, staffing patterns, and sunlight's warmth on his body.He gradually understands the night shifts and day shifts and the staff that work on them. He can now count days. He eventually communicates with the outside world through Morse code tapping of his head on his pillow. He then dictates an amazing anti-war outburst to the outside world.The final section on war is fine writing. Yet this final chapter does not stand in isolation but must be considered as part of a whole parable about the horror of war. In the end, unjust wars can not be fought if young men are thoughtful and practice reasoned judgement. I think Trumbo is aware that young male idealism, lack of vista, lack of experience, mind fogged by testosterone, and unwillingness to think outside the locker room pack is the raw material of war. Men who are 17-24 fall for it every time. When they reach 30, at least for the thouhtful male, the justification for war must go beyond propaganda, slogans, and leadership spewing patriotic slogans while filling their pockets with war profit. I would give this book to any young man 17-24 to read to open their eyes to the critical judgement they must practice in the world of informed public discourse.The book is written in the context of WWI, a senseless war brought about by paranoia, misplaced nationalism and non-reflective patriotism. The leaders of WWI lead their nations into war with false pretense and erroneous information. Once involved, the war dragged on and on, destroying an entire generation of young men in the quicksand of foreign aggression based on propaganda and poorly documented facts. I think you see my point."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"As the drum incessantly beats, accompanied by the \\"word\\" (\\"there is always a word\\"), which at the moment alternates between Iraq and terrorism, I thought it might be a good idea to try and balance TV news, the newspaper, Newsweek and the rest, to get a little broader idea of what we're talking about than the ever-present buzzwords, \\"mass destruction,\\" \\"regime,\\" and the rest. Could I have picked up a better book than Johnny Got His Gun?Johnny Got His Gun is the gut-wrenching, anger-inducing story of Joe Bonham, average American citizen, \\"tapped on the shoulder and told we're going off to war.\\" The book begins with an introduction and a look at the everyday life of Joe, who lives a life like most of us do, dreaming big dreams, camping and fishing with dad, falling in love. As the book goes on one reads about the horrors of war, thereafter spending the rest of the time primarily inside Joe's brain, which in various chapters, my personal favorites, becomes Trumbo's pessimistic and unapologetic soapbox. The reader lies there with Joe, obsessed with accomplishing the most mundane of tasks, such as figuring out the time/year, what country he is in, and finally, triumphantly, communicating with the outside world through the only possible means -- tapping his forehead on the bench in morse code. Of course, the quintessential rat that is always present in any really shocking book, stops by to nibble on armless, legless and nearly motionless Joe. The reader weeps at the realization that Joe, like so many others, is not going home, will never kiss his girl and will never fish with his dad.As already mentioned, my favorite chapters were ten and twenty, where Trumbo shares his philosophy on war. I'll share what I thought were a couple of the most insightful thoughts:They were always fighting for something, the bastards...if they weren't fighting for liberty they were fighting for independence or democracy or freedom or decency or honor or their native land or something else that didn't mean anything...the most important thing is your life little guys. You're worth nothing dead except for speeches. Don't let them kid you anymore. Pay no attention when they tap you on the shoulder and say come along we've got to fight for liberty or whatever their word is there's always a word.The reader will either appreciate the refreshing, and unrelenting, stream of consciousness in which Trumbo wrote the book, or find it annoying. Not a comma to be found in the entire book. Contrary to what some may think, Trumbo seems to be the ultimate soldier's man, for the draftee, turning his wrath more upon those who so easily declare war and then send the nation's sons off to fight. He's obviously completely against the idea of war and goes to great lengths to try to dissuade participation by anybody, but ultimately does not place the blame with the soldier, but the establishment. Little wonder Johnny was banned for as long as it was, especially with WWII occurring soon after its writing.I actually tried to simulate Joe's condition. I closed my eyes, plugged my ears, reached my pinkies around to cover my nostrils, laid down on my stomach and hiked my legs up into the air. Not a position I'd want to spend the rest of my life in, nor any part of it.A figment of Trumbo's imagination? Not reality?I'll close with Trumbo himself:If there are no concrete figures, at least we are beginning to get comparative ones. Proportionately, Vietnam has given us eight times as many paralytics as WWII, three times as many TOTALLY disabled, 35% more amputees. Senator Cranston of California concludes that out of every hundred army veterans receiving compensation for wounds received in Vietnam, 12.4% are totally disabled.

A great story of a man suffering from the wars.Chris ~"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In any novel there is a story and on anothe level there is a meaning the author wants us to dervive form the work. On the first level this novel is a brilliant example of an anti war novel . But in saying that just because the protagonaist-the victim suffers greatly does that automatically make all war or even the war he fought in wrong or immoral?Dalton Trumbo writes an interesting powerful novel from the protagonist point of view but in the third person . Occasionally he seems to slip into the first person when Joe Bonham the victim gives a speech and a powerful one on the evils of war. I am not sure why Trumbo doesn't write the whole novel in the first person and so the novel has the feel of an outline for a screen play.Also the novel is written without any commas in the text! I am not sure why this was done -maybe some future reviewer can enlighten us on this.And it has to be pointed out this novel was published three days after WW2 started. This was a war that initially Stalin made a deal with Hitler to split Poland . The Soviet Union instructed the Communist Party to present an anti war face in America against intervention. I hate to say it but Trumbo a known Communist (yes he was ) parried the party line. If this book was written in 1929 ,it would be unfair to point that out but the timing has to be commented on.If you are a pacifist or hate our currrent war then this novel will speak to your soul. If you are a conservative you can admire this as great exposition of the pacifist point of view."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo's, Johnny Got His Gun, is an unforgettable, appalling, brutal story of war and it's horrible effects on human dreams and life.Johnny Got His Gun is the most influential book that I have ever read. Trumbo writes with an original unprecedented style. He combines many different sentences together with very little punctuation. While the text may appear to be a run-on sentence, it is actually a smooth blend of thoughts. This style of writing is a little more difficult to read than most other books, but it makes you think more about what is being said. One must read the book to appreciate this fresh writing style.This book captures your interest from beginning to end. It is hard to put down; the reader feels they must read on to discover the outcomes. Throughout the book there is an ongoing struggle, which the reader feels directly involved with. It seizes the emotions and thrusts you into the story. To anyone that has a good opinion on war, this book will change your thoughts.Johnny Got His Gun is a thrilling novel about a young man and his fight to communicate once again with the outside world after he received a severe wound while in battle. The book lays down a background of the young man's life before going to war, which makes the ordeal more dramatic. I would encourage anyone in high school, or older, to read this book. It is very rewarding, and educates on many different aspects of life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I decided to pick this book up after reading of it in Newman and Jones' excellent overview volume, \\"Horror: 100 Best Books.\\" While the overwhelming majority of the books discussed therein deal with ghosts, the supernatural, werewolves, vampires and the like, Dalton Trumbo's \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" (1939) deals with horror of a different sort: the horror of war, or, more specifically, war's aftermath. In this unforgettable novel, we meet a young man named Joe Bonham, a normal guy from Colorado who has been severely injured toward the end of World War I. And I do mean severely. Joe is now a literal basket case. Both of his legs and arms have been amputated and his face has been blown off. He cannot see, hear, taste or talk, and he lies in a hospital bed in an unknown country. His plight makes Helen Keller's seem enviable; indeed, his condition might well be the worst of any character's in any book ever written! Pretty gruesome horror fare, indeed. As Joe lies in his own world, he flashes back to happier days, and we learn of his family experiences, his love conquests and disappointments, his jobs and his friends. We sense that Joe is a sweet, likeable, um, average Joe, which makes us feel for him all the more. We also see, through his stream of consciousness, some hellish glimpses of the battlefield, but for the most part, those fighting scenes are kept to a minimum. Trumbo is more concerned with what war does to men, and unlike Erich Maria Remarque's \\"All Quiet on the Western Front,\\" the scenes in the trenches are downplayed. In one intense section, Joe realizes that, deaf and blind as he is, he can no longer tell the difference between his waking moments and his horror-filled dreams, and Trumbo really makes us feel his plight. And toward the end of the book, Joe, after many attempts to communicate with his nurses, does succeed in breaking through, and delivers one of the most scathing indictments against warmongers that one could ever hope to read. Trumbo writes in a hot fury, fully aware that the world was gearing up for another global duke-out as he penned his words. And the result is perhaps the best antiwar novel ever written. H.G. Wells, in his 1908 masterpiece \\"The War in the Air,\\" treated us to some brilliant passages in which he decried the savage waste that is war, but Trumbo's book is far more passionate, more savage, and the excoriating, blasting denunciations much more prolonged. There IS one thing that Trumbo's book lacks, however, in all its 243 pages, and that is...commas. Imagine that: a 243-page book without a single comma to be found! Such is the breakneck pace with which Trumbo writes; such is Joe's uninterrupted stream of thought. The book is simply written--a junior high school student would have no trouble zipping through it--and yet devastating at the same time. Joe's communication breakthrough, after many years of trying, may very well have your eyes misting up with tears; if not, what happens as a result surely will. This is a book that should prove pretty hard to forget, and that is a good thing. Its message is one that we would all do well to incorporate. Truly, this book should be mandatory reading for all politicians, heads of state, dictators and other public officials, the whole world over...not to mention all thinking adults. It's just that important."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Trumbo gives a truly horrid account of one mans experience in World War I. This novel flashes between the happy, careless prewar life of an American boy and the grim life he leads afterwards. Trumbo exposes war as the raw, inhumane act that it is. Moreover, &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; convinces the reader that very little, if anything, is worth the price of sacrificing countless bodies to win a war.&quot;Nothing is bigger than life. There's nothing noble in death. What's noble about never seeing the sunshine again? What's noble about having your legs and arms blown off? What's noble about being an idiot? What's noble about being blind and deaf and dumb? What's noble about being dead?&quot;Trumbo questions the basic assumptions for which patriotic Americans send their boys off to die and makes the reader question whether any war can be fully justified for the societal costs it requires. Though it was published in 1939, the ideas and feelings it conveys are universal. After reading this, I, as an American, questioned the military involvement of most conflicts our nation has been a part of in the last hundred years. It is an eye-opener and it will really make you reconsider the next time you think this country should go to war. . ."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book is undoubtedly one of the most touching, unsparing novels ever written. It blows &quot;All Quiet On the Western Front&quot; out of the water with ease, and that old hat needs to be replaced on high school book lists with this one. After reading Trumbo's horrifying tale of a young man mutilated to the point of being better off dead, those 'strapping young bucks' might think twice about stepping onto the battlefield for any cause whatsoever, even democracy. This book is a hopeless nightmare of sadness and unendurable suffering and I found it gripping to the point of basically reading it cover to cover. If you're a very sensitive person (as am I), you should probably avoid it altogether or at least take it in small doses. There really isn't a glimmer of hope in this book. In the end, although I have to admit that at times I wish I had never touched it, you have to respect Trumbo for having the courage and the talent to write something so courageous and deeply moving. Trumbo forces us to realize that this young man's life is completely and irreparably destroyed, and that we are indeed to blame for it. He makes sure we don't come away from this book psychologically unscathed: we ourselves were complacent enough to allow a senseless, horrific event like the first world war to take place, and the living hell this kid was unwittingly plunged into as a result of his naive trust in the values of country and so called 'honor' is of our own making. He wants to rid of us our illusions about the invulnerability of the young to injury, and attack the ludicrous belief that war is somehow 'honorable' or glorious. It is a senseless massacre that ruins and takes live remorselessly. Maybe after reading this book (or seeing the movie, which in my opinion is equally as gut wrenching, perhaps even more so than the book because we have to watch the suffering rather than just read about it), will give you second thoughts about preaching to your kid the virtues of 'patriotism' or their so called 'duty' to get shipped to another country to be killed or even worse, to be reduced to the level of poor Joe Bonham, an innocent and trusting young man who never knew what him until it was too late."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In 1970, I was 16 and a Young Republican. \\"Dad,\\" I used to say, \\"we can win this Vietnam thing, if only we had the guts.\\" And my father, an Old Republican and World War II vet who had long before grown weary of death counts, would answer, \\"Son, no war is worth its cost.\\"Then I read Trumbo's novel.

This book is really good, although not the most climatic, it is good on the level that it brings to light the tragedy of war and is very thought provoking in its attempt to speak of death from the point of view of someone who is basically dead.

The book started off slow and I couldn't tell if this was going to be a book I was going to enjoy or not. As I got to know the character, Joe, I developed sort of a hate for him. I didn't care for his attitude and I don't feel that most soldiers think the way he did. Or at least they shouldn't, they should be proud of what they do. Joe made it seem like he was the only soldier who ever suffered in war. I understand his circumstances are beyond belief, but he should still consider the others. The book had its good points too, it was interesting to read about someone elses thoughts. As a reader you know first hand what Joe is thinking and how he feels.

The emotions that surge through the pages of this novel are so raw and so true that I found myself crying out of frustration and sadness and throwing the book across the room out of anger and feeling everything. It is crazy. Trumbo's writing is exceptional and original and makes the book read quickly and smoothly. There is no punctuation in this novel except for periods and question marks. This, combined with other interesting techniques, makes this book the perfect writings of someone's thoughts. . .and not just anyone's thoughts. These are the thoughts of a man who physically can't do anything but think. That's why it is so intense all of the time. Another reason why I like this book so much is because it illustrates the horrors of war, what war does to human beings. This normal, functioning man turns into a piece of helpless flesh who has no physical way of communicating with anyone or anything. Trumbo's novel has been black-listed during every major war since WWII because it delivers such a strong and touching message.

The U.S. government has a certain way it wants to lead it's people. They want to control the American people to do what they want. They know people have a choice and if they let them know what there getting into they are afraid that they wont do what they want them to. Wars are fought for the government not the people. When ever the government wants to prove it's power it to another country by saying &quot;Hey we got a nation of people ready to die for my cause&quot; and the truth is if the people knew what the consequences are to prove this power. They probably wouldn't do it. Basically the U.S. government wants you to do what they want whether you consider it wrong or not (also there are thing they don't want you to do even if you consider It right or not). This book try's to show you the down side to war. Any body who thinks this book shouldn't be told because it is too gruesome is wrong. If you're a mom or dad and don't want your kids to read this book because you think it is bad. Maybe you should read it for your selves and decide if you want to ... this book took place in Colorado. There was nobody form Canada that this book was based on. It is anti-war if you get something other than the down side to war from this book you need to read it again. Nothing in this book was based on a true life story.SincerelyChris Bender"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book is probably one of the most controversial books I have ever read. If it was not assigned for a class, I probably would not have ever read it. This book brought about a lot of discussion and a lot of arguments. It is difficult to understand how a man in this condition could be able to still live, let alone think rationally. I feel &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; brought about a one-sided opinion of war and coming from a man such as Dalton Trumbo, I understand why the book has this view. I thought the stories about his life before the war were interesting but I don't think they were too relevant to the story. It was not written in an organized fashion, therefore a lot of people had trouble following it. I would not have picked this book out for myself to read and I did not really care to read it."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I thought Dalton Trumbo did a fine job of writing, it took a lot of talent to write that book. I also feel that the message that he was trying to portray was horrible. I don't like the way he is so anti-war. I am in no way for war at all, but I also do feel that there are some things that we have to fight for. WW1 was one of those instances. When you are selected to fight you must do it with honor cause you are fighting for your country. Joe was not put into that horrible state for nothing, he was put that way while he was fighting for his country. Dalton Trumbo needs to realize that even though war is such a horrible thing, it is the reason we live the lives that we do. We live lives of freedom. It is to bad that men had to lose their lives doing it, but that is why I honor them every year. On a final note, this is not a book that I would have my students read, I definently would not promote Trumbo's message."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun was a book written to open the eyes of the flag-waving, goodbye-kissing masses who sent their boys off to foreign shores. If this novel had been written by someone other than radical communist Dalton Trumbo, it may have had this effect. However, with his fanatical views and lunatic ravings, Trumbo has dishonored America and the millions of citizens who have fought for freedom throughout the centuries. This novel is anti-war, no more, no less. And there is a difference between being anti-war and thinking war is a horrible thing. War has been a historial necessity and freedom has always had a price. Little does the main character know, but his freedom of speech was denied at the end of the book. What a fitting end to someone whose attitude totally discounted the efforts of every man, woman, and child who sacrificed for his freedoms. War without a purpose is terrible, but more terrible is the human being who refuses to acknowledge pain and suffering of anyone but himself. I do not wish for my children to ever be exposed to this horrific, blatantly disrespectful account of an ungrateful and unfortunate man who thinks himself to be Christ."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN is a tremendous literary achievement. Since it was written, this novel has turned the rationale of war hawks into Swiss cheese, and it will continue to do so in the future. In this book, Trumbo is essentially asking: What is the true payoff in having a young man's arms and legs blown off, his jaw obliterated, his hearing and sight destroyed, and his mind ravaged? As his protagonist Joe concludes, no bureacratic rhetoric is worth this hell.Even though this book is almost 3/4 of a century old, its message is still very germane to contemporary life. Little guys are never the winners in a war, and this is as true about the current quagmire in Iraq as it was about WWI.

Joe Bonham is literally in a living personal hell where he cannot communicate with anyone, thanks to the mine that blew up literally on him, and took his arms, legs, and face, but left his mind intact at the end of WW1. This book is not for a person who can't handle emotional novels, as this one left me gasping after some chapters in pain for what Joe was feeling and agonizing over. But even as I read this novel, I still maintain my views of a pro-war interferance in Iraq, as I believe it is our duty as a poweful nation to do so, and help others, such as Israel.But this novel is nonetheless life changing, and If you are able, I encourage you to read it, and read it well."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book chronicles the intermittent dreams and growing consciousness of a young man who wakes up in an army hospital and gradually becomes conscious enough to realize that he's been ripped apart by a bomb: a quadripelegic who has also lost his sight and hearing. The weight of the story is his recollections of his very idyllic life before he went to war.A popular review of this book remarks that it was kept obscure for several years because it was introduced just as the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. Obviously, in an era when the Poles had to fight to protect themselves from the open pillaging of their country (which the Nazis carried out in short order), this book's flaws would become too apparent.Like any argument that rests upon a rare extremity of evidence, JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN fails in its logic. In Poland 1939, men and women who did not go to war were reduced to smoking hulks of flesh simply because they were Jewish or epileptic or dissidents. So Trumbo's argument falls flat. Men who take up the gun may suffer catastrophically, but men who do not take up the gun may also suffer catastrophically.Another flaw is that a lot of Trumbo's argument is not really against WAR, but is against WARTIME PROPAGANDA. He swaps the two concepts and really batters the straw man of propaganda without ever discussing war itself. At the end of the book, the reader still has a question unanswered: Is it ever right for a person to pick up a gun and fire at an advancing aggressor? Because that's what war is. And that question is never answered. In the end, I think the story is tedious, predictable, skewed, and too overtly propagandistic."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Mr. Dalton Trumbo takes (at the time) typical anti-war view and expresses it in his book here. Basic plot is of a severly injured man that proceeds to remember the various points of his life and how he arrived at his current situtation. It later transgress into how this same man tried to communcatie with the world around him even though he can't write, speak, or even blink his eyes. In the later half of the book he also attacks the sense of duty and courage that all young men feel when they hear the call to arms.Mr. Dalton Trumbo's words draw vivid pictures in your mind, however the arrangement of this book is very sloppy in my opinion it jumps around too much. Could of done better by sticking to a timeline of some sort to achieve the same affect.To understand this book you need to view it in the time frame that is was written. The previous war (WW1) was still fresh in many peoples minds and with the rise spector of another war in Europe all sorts of people were trying to prevent that spark that would ignite it. They really didn't succed all that well.Overall it only rates 2 star and if you really want to read some better Anti-war books read the &quot;Red Badge of Courage&quot; or &quot; All quiet on the Western Front&quot; or even &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; they have a better grasp on why old men make young men go to war over idoitic things and address the sense of duty."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The misfortune suffered by authors of novels with social, cultural or political ramifications is a disproportionate response to the novel's message, while attention to the quality of the writing is lost in the book's affect. This novel's power resides not only in its message, but in the way in which that message is conveyed. Trumbo's masterpiece is not just a resonant statement against war, but a unique and indispensable contribution to American literature. His Joyce-like stream-of-consciousness fuses the text with a magnificent flavor. The language sprawls gloriously across each page. &quot;I do not read; I eat,&quot; Simone Weil writes in &quot;Waiting For God.&quot; Trumbo's language invites readers to eat rather than read, to flip the pages as though they would light one's fingers on fire if held too long.His brutally honest style is quotidian yet magical. It is the kind of simplicity embraced by such mythical literary voices as Ernest Hemmingway or Czeslaw Milosz. In fact, &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; shares the plight of 20th century polish poets, who forcibly eliminated all romantic, inflated, grandiose or flowery imagery from their literature in response to a world so ugly that romanticism seemed a dishonest veil over the reality of a bloody century. Trumbo's reaction to that reality is similar, as his sparklingly mundane voice demonstrates.It is not only in his language, however, that Trumbo rises to the occasional of the best literature in American history. This is also a work of extraordinary imagination. Touchingly human flashbacks to times in the life of Joe, the main character, evoke moving meditations on love, family, and friendship, as well as a rather disturbing portrayal of working life in the depression era. &quot;To talk with Lucy to be with Lucy to lie with Lucy was like finding peace in a heathen country it was like breathing the air of a place you love when you're sick and dying for a breath of it,&quot; Joe thinks to himself while in his hospital bed, deaf, blind and limbless, &quot;To see her smile to hear her bright chatter to watch her bony little fingers fly as they worked the crochet needle with the night noises of Paris a foreign city just outside the window was enough to make anybody feel better and less lonely.&quot; Trumbo captures the devastating sorrow of a man who will never know the sensations of life again, from love to yellow puddles of leaves in the gutters of October. Finally, Trumbo's patient and vivid account of Joe's circumstance, that of a severely incapacitated victim of war, is so thoroughly haunting that, despite the improbability of such a catastrophic injury, Joe's situation becomes frighteningly real and believable. By now we all know that &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; stands as perhaps the most heartfelt and effective indictment of war, but it is to the benefit of American literature that it be recognized as the work of a monumentally talented writer."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"First of all, this book is a must read, for everyone who can bear it. The situation described is horrific, but this novel is also deeply touching and it motivates you to think, and think hard. Johnny is a soldier, catastrophically mutilated by an explosion, during wordlwar I. I won't spoil your enjoyment of reading this novel, by telling that the explosion has basically removed most of his senses (eyes, ears..) and ways of communicating with the outside world. He is placed in a hospital and treated, more or less, as a vegetable. Until one day, he finds a way to speak out. That's when he &quot;got his gun&quot;, a weapon more feared than cannons and rocketlaunchers.It is, as you might know by now, an anti-war testament, but not just any war. Please take a moment to read Trumbo's introduction where he explains that the WW II was different than the one in which context this novel was written. Trumbo considers WW II as fought over a just cause, and explains how he wasn't happy that &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; was used as a propaganda material against war, in US.The story is fascinating, moving and honest, and even if the plot is sometimes just a little bit weak, I rate it with 5 stars. It's a classic of the American narrative of the 20th century.(note: in 1971 Trumbo directed a movie with the same title, written after the book. It might be interesting to watch it, as the director and the novel writer are the same person.)"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got his Gun by Dalton Trumbo is a hard hitting, riveting, emotional and powerful anti-war novel, and it makes your goose bump pop through your skin. The story focuses on Joe Bonham, who was a W.W.I infantry soldier who lost his legs, arms, hearing, smell, and sight. The only thing left of him was his mind. Joe had no sense of time or reality, so we find in the story Joe jumps from dreams to dream, which he can't tell if they are real or imaginary. Eventually Joe reaches consciousness, only to discover the horrifying fact that he is just a stump. Cut off from the world and entraped in his own mind, Joe learns to use his mind to communicate in new ways . He used Morse-codes to interact with the people around him. All Joe's misfortune lead him to the conclusion that war comes too high of a price. Joe said &quot;I would trade independence and honor and freedom and decency for life.&quot; I would recommend this book to anyone who like to see an alternative side to war. So for all you couch potatoes out there who have nothing to do, get off your butts and check this book out! You might thank me one day."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Trumbo makes some powerful points in this book, and raises some great questions; are those who are killed in war proud to have died for their country? Since the dead don't talk, there is no way of knowing. Through the character of Joe Bonham, he allows us to more closely consider this question. Bonham has lost his capacity to &quot;live&quot; in any real sense of the word, because he has lost his arms, legs, and all of his senses. For all practical purposes, he is a dead man who still has the ability to reflect upon the meaning of war and its futility.His basic point is that he'd rather alive in an &quot;un-free&quot; society than dead. It's an understandable point to make; most people would chose to forfeit some freedoms in order to live. But some of the more complex issues about war are avoided by Trumbo.Throughout history, there are countless of examples of countries believing that laying down their arms would stop the bloodshed, only to find that it was the precursor to mass death. Cambodia in 1975 is but one example of such logic, when the Lon Knol government surrendered to the Khmer Rouge and were massacred. There is also the case of the Japanese invasion of Nanking, when the Japanes Imperial Army promised fair treatment in return for surrender; what they got was a six week reign of terror full of burning, raping, and pillaging.Mr. Trumbo's book is a potent reminder to not wage war recklessly. But it's naive to think you can preserve life through sheer pacifism. A very moving book, although one-sided."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The brutal, terrifying, and uncompromising occurrence of war has destroyed millions of lives in past centuries. In Johnny Got His Gun the horrible realities of war are illustrated through the mind of a helpless victim of war named Joe Bonham. In the book Joe loses his eyes, ears, nose all the way to his throat, arms, and legs due to a bomb blast. He goes through life lying on a hospital bed thinking to himself and trying to reach out and communicate with his nurses by tapping his head on his pillow in Morse code. When he finally communicates he is not given any help. The author, Dalton Trumbo, uses details, appropriate syntax, and diction for Joe's thoughts to indicate that the gruesome idea of war must be avoided at all costs.Trumbo uses an abundance of very simple details in Joe's description of the events of his life, many of which are appealing to the senses. These sensory details not only help the reader picture the situations and relate to the characters but they also provide a contrast with Joe's condition. While at war, a bomb explosion left him without a sense of sight, hearing, and taste. At the hospital Joe thinks about his life before he went to war. In one instance Joe thinks about when he worked at a bakery and remembers blueberry pies, hot crossed buns, and roses given to his boss by a fellow worker. Later in the book Joe thinks about the many fruits and vegetables that his father grew and his mother canned. Every item of food Joe mentions is a reminder to the reader that he will never taste food again. Such small details can evoke so much sympathy for Joe.Trumbo also uses a very intelligent and accurate syntax for the streaming, desperate, or sometimes quick thoughts of Joe. Trumbo does not use punctuation in this novel which may suggest he wanted Joe to sound as though he had a stream of thoughts. When Joe thinks about things he likes in his past life, the sentence structure is narrative, flowing, and said with a calm and peaceful tone. In telling about his job at the bread factory Joe says \\"Walking all night long and working hard and getting eighteen dollars at the end of the week for your trouble. Not bad.\\"(65) However when Joe is worried about something or becomes panicky, the syntax changes to panic with the tone. As Joe is coming to the realization of being totally disabled, he becomes frantic and says \\"Oh please no. No no. It isn't me. Help me. It can't be me. Not me. No no no....\\".(64)Trumbo uses diction to reveal the truth about war. In the very beginning of the book Joe loses a close family member. The discovery of the death for the reader is very blunt when Joe says \\"Jody I got to go home. My father just died.\\"(4) This event sets the tone of the book as lonely and depressing. Joe has not been in the hospital very long but he thinks to himself \\"there was a thick silence and yearning to listen and lonesomeness.\\"(14) Joe becoming totally disabled continues the book with a sympathetic and sorrowful tone. Although the book is swarming with depressing horrific depictions of war the accomplishments Joe makes while on the hospital bed are very inspiring and prove to outweigh the bad. Perhaps the most moving part of the book was when Joe, after trying so long, actually communicated with someone. The nurse has brought a man to send Morse code by tapping Joe on the forehead. Joe says \\"A finger came out of the darkness a finger so enormous that it shattered against his forehead like the crash of a pile driver. It echoed inside his brain like thunder in a cave.\\"(217) Joe seems as though he will be rescued but the man who he had made first contact with just dismisses Joe's persistent head tapping and sticks a needle in him to put him to sleep. The book ends with a mocking tone in the sentence \\"You plan the wars you masters of men plan the wars and point the way and we will point the gun.\\"(243)Through use of diction, syntax, and detail Trumbo was able to reasonably expose the controversial issue of the harsh realities of war and how people should not be sent to die against their will. Even though Trumbo wrote this book in fiction it is very believable because it is so realistic and everything in it probably has happened. If every member of every military in the world could read this book then they might think twice before having a war."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Possibly the best anti-war novel ever written. Follow Johnny from wide-eyed optimist to mangled anti-warrior. Moving like few other novels. A must read, though shocking and disturbing. No wonder it was surpressed again and again in times of war; it can make a difference."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"At its core, this is an anti-war novel - if not the anti-war novel. And personally, as a soldier in the US Army, some might be surprised for me to say that this is one of my favorite books of all time. It is powerful and poignant that reveals one of the true and unavoidable essences of war, death. It shows it in a \\"in your face\\" perspective not typically achieved by many anti-war works.I disagree that war or force should never be used, as I do believe that in a world of tyrants, dictators, and evil that is an unfortunately necessary tool in American foreign policy. However, war should always be a last resort and never should the decision be an easy one. The true consequences of war should always be kept in mind so that we truly are going to war for the right purposes. It is a sad fact today that there are a declining number of politicians who are war veterans who understand the true pains of going to war. For this reason, Johnny Got His Gun should be a must read for all so that on some level we all can connect to the pain of war.One thought, however, Dalton Trumbo tries to say through the book that no one has a right to say that some cause is worth dying for--because no one can speak for the dead. However, isn't that exactly what Trumbo is doing? He is trying to speak for the dead through his character Joe Bonham and saying that the dead believe that no cause is worth dying for. It's hypocritical to say that it applies for one side but not the other.Nevertheless, this book is an important read for all and a major literary foundation of the anti-war movement that all should understand."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"\\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" is fantastic, but it is very ugly. This is the story of one WWWI soldier with a devastating injury that has basically left him a living slab of meat. The soldier is unable to hear move or communicate with the outside world. This is his story of how he lives within his mind. The reader is given both the realities of war injuries as well as the author's point of view on war. Understand that Dalton Trumbo is very anti-war and makes no bones about this. If you are pro-war-on-terror and cannot stand the other point of view, do not read this book because it will only infuriate you. However, if you are either anti-war or pro-war that can discuss rationally the other side views, then of course read this book. Trumbo has humanized the realities of war through this soldier. No matter what your politics are, there are realities that must be faced and he does with medical aloofness. Trumbo puts you into the mind of this soldier as he tries to cope with his situation. There are flashbacks to his earlier life as well as dealing with an itch that he cannot scratch.This book is both hard to read and should not be missed. It is a true classic and has relevancy 60 years after it was written. Regardless or your politics, \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" shows what happens to the injured after the injury and it is not pretty and that is the point of this book. Extremely Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is one of the few books I've ever read that made me cry, and cry for a long time. The horror, as expressed by trumbo through his character of a disabled World War One veteran who has been reduced to a hunk of flesh but is still capable of thought, is something which will never leave me as long as I live.It isn't just the horror of what happened that makes this book so touching. It's the fact that we as readers can go inside this man's thoughts, and we see his remembrances of a life gone by, that he only wishes he can have again. Dalton Trumbo's novel puts a face on the horror of warfare, one that I wish the world never had to see again.The leaders of the world should forced to read this novel."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"...this book had me in tears and enthralled! I let it envelop me as i read the whole book in one day. ~The way it is written is disliked by some, but one must realize that the lack of punctuation is needed to produce the in-mind feeling, or flow of concinseness that, with out, this story would be nowhere. This IS the tail of a young soldier whose life is TAKEN from him in World WarII... and though he still lives, he &quot;lives&quot; as a deaf-and-dumb quad-amputee with a crator for a face and less than stumps for limbs. ~This story is a &quot;collection&quot; of delusional thoughts/memories/dreams of a drugged stump. Unable to communicate or even really know what is going on, he is left with nothing but his mind- That which he explores extensively. ~It opened my eyes to things other than just the brutalities of war, but to the brutalities of life in general, things that are all to easilly ignored and forgotten by all that live confortably. ~This novel is well written as it switches back and forth from &quot;the present time&quot; to the boy's colourful past life as &quot;told/remembered&quot; by him. ~Though this writting may sometimes give the feeling of detatchment from the &quot;real story&quot; to some, one must realize that it all really does tie in with the overall meaning (which is... well, i'll let you derive that on your own). Though all of it is &quot;seen&quot; throught the &quot;eyes&quot; of a heavily sedated hunk of thinking flesh- one does not have to be drugged out of mind to comprehend it for ones' self. ~The things that take place during the &quot;present time&quot; allows one to know what it is that the boy is going through, as the flashbacks give insight into the charachter of this boy and the situations he had been in to make him as such in character. You, as the reader, are at his bed side through out it all -the whole duration- with no desire to leave him. ~The author expertly employs everyday emotion and thought to draw/let the reader into this soldier's incredably small, yet bitterly lonely world. The blunt reality is shocking yet presented in such graceless tact it amazes. ~I read this book during the summer following my Freshman year in highschool. Still, as i suspect it always will be, it is welcomed in to haunt my thoughts occasionally. ~I liked it."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Everybody should read this book and the startling introductions from people who have experienced the horrors and waste of war first hand. Written in a breathless beat style many years before the beats even existed, this book is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1939 at the start of WW2. Even today, our leaders have not learned from the lessons of WW1 (which this book is about) and continue to send the little guys to slaughter for causes they do not understand and do not believe in. To paraphrase Trumbo, when they die, they do not die with the idea of liberty and freedom on their minds or of fighting for country, they die crying for a friend, a mother, the sight of home... This book is heart-breaking and not for the faint hearted but it is real and it is the truth. It makes you angry and sad and will stay with you forever. It is the bible of anti-war books and Joe Bonham is the new Christ of the common man and woman."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I consider this to be the greatest war or anti-war novel ever. As old men continue to send young men (and women) off to war, often thousands of miles from the homeland, it behoves the rest of us to expose the painful truth. Trumbo did that."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"At the end of Johnny Got His Gun there is a fantastic line uttered by the protagonist that sums up the entire experience of reading the novel:\\"That would be a great thing to concentrate war in one stump of a body and to show it to people so they could see the difference between a war that's in newspaper headlines and liberty loan drives and a war that is fought lonesomely in the mud somewhere a war between a man and a high explosive shell.\\"Dalton Trumbo's greatest triumph with Johnny Got His Gun was boiling the entire anti-war argument of the novel into that single horror: an armless, legless, faceless, eyeless, voiceless casualty screaming at you for mercy. If you favor military action in any form, can you justify the victories in the loss of life and limbs?Needless to say, Johnny Got His Gun still resonates so effectively today as it did when it was first published in 1939. Look at any photographs of Iraq war veterans with severed limbs and the same question still confronts you: is the war worth the cost? It is that focus that keeps the novel from drifting into long-winded speeches or diatribes. Because we never see the world outside of Joe's mind, we are trapped in the argument of \\"Why? Was it all worth this?\\" Therefore, the novel never feels preachy. Nor does the anti-war argument grow dated -- because it is not rooted in World War I (where the action takes place), or World War II (which the novel was released just prior to), but in the moral argument against war itself.Trumbo also does a superb job of making Johnny Got His Gun a \\"small novel.\\" It is not trying to encompass all the horrors of war, but just this one soul-wrenching example. You cannot help but cringe along with Joe when he feels a rat gnawing at the side of his body as he lies helpless on the hospital bed, unable to swat it away. As the reader, you share Joe's isolation and helplessness.And yet, from this horror, Trumbo is even able to bring forth great humor. Take the scene of Christ playing cards with the soon-to-be-dead soldiers. He performs a minor miracle by making full whiskey glasses appear beneath each player (a sort of mock of the water-into-wine trick), but then winds up losing a hand of blackjack (\\"I never could hit a twelve he said in a complaining voice\\").Throughout it all, Trumbo never lets you off the hook. You must look at Joe and see his fate. To look away (or stop reading in this case) is to deny the realities of war and its ultimate cost.Without giving away the ending, the book outdoes the movie (which Trumbo himself directed) in that it doesn't over-argue the point. The sad resolution is not discussed as a great moral quandary, but rather a matter of regulations. Ultimately, the army's regulations turn a blind eye to the truth that lies before them."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"A book has never instilled such a hopeless atmosphere in me. This is a book that is full of raw emotion that I couldn't get enough of. A book that has so much feeling runs the risk of being a melodrama work as it falls into hackneyed plot-holes. This book is able to circumnavigate this problem by creating original narrative by using the conditions present in the book. The book invites the reader to try and figure out what is happening, and when the truth is discovered, horror will be ringing in their mind.This isn't a book that caused the traditional feelings of sadness or depression; it was deeper than that. It was as if I had been able to absorb a continuous, subliminal feeling of frustration and hopelessness. Every page there after carried that tone until I became consistently angrier.These feelings permeate this book as it shows the scope of Johnny's life. This fuels the anti-war messages of the book. Johnny Got His Gun uses these emotions and translates it almost directly to his theme. Not to mention that this book has a good story with gripping narrative. Add this to his empowered emotions and this becomes one of the most engrossing, thought-provoking reads of my life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Whether you are for or against wars, this book has it's place in the way we should view them. It's as relevant now with the war going on as it was when it was written. I wonder if any member of Congress has ever read it, Democrat or Republican? If not they should, matter of fact it should be required reading for any individual or group with the power to send our soldiers to war. This may be just one guys opinion but he presents some powerful arguments. Just read it and form you're own opinion, even if you hate it, there is no way you could honestly deny some of it's brutal honesty."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Like most people, the Metallica video for &quot;One&quot; exposed me to the movie Johnny Got His Gun, which I heard was mediocre, and I found out that it was originally a novel, written by Dalton Trumbo (who also directed the film). The Metallica video was horrifying, seeing a quadruple amputee with no face, and his macabre and desperate interior monologues, but the novel made Joe Bonham's own private hell a lot more clearer.Joe Bonham, or &quot;Johnny,&quot; is an all-American young male who grew up in Colorado, and he would be considered normal as apple pie. Then he was shipped off to Germany in World War I, and got ambushed by a bombing attack, which left him armless, legless, faceless, and senseless (sans the sense of touch). While he is lying in his vegativie state, all he can do is think and reminisce about his life before he went off to war, and reflect on those things he would never experience again. The book grabs you and drags you into Bonham's agonizing, solitary world and parts of it were very heartbreaking and very emotional, one of the few books that required the use of a tissue. You feel his desperation, you feel his isolation, and Dalton Trumbo's personal philosophy on his opposition to warfare is sneaked into the narrative but he did it so that it went along w/ the story. His haunting introduction to the book, written around the time of the Vietnam War, makes you question the necessity of war and creates an unabashedly pacifist stance on war in general and how it ruins lives and families, and even nations. The book is undoubtedly liberal, especially in the introduction, but the book itself is told from a confused and rather blank or questioning perspective, hiding its message every time the nurse changes Joe Bonham's bedsheets, and every time Joe reflects on what life was and what life will be until he physically dies."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnnny Got His Gun is an amazing if terrifying book. I have never been more provoked by any novel more so than this one. I must agree with another reviewer though, the plot is a little weak, but the overall affect makes up for it. This novel is a must read for any high school student, it brings all those history lectures home. This war DID happen people WERE killed, but the WORST fate of all was to be injured. Johnny Got His Gun is an amazing novel that I'm glad to have read and hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is a different type of war story. It doesn't focus around the war itself, but the thoughts of a man who lost all of his limbs and the senses of smell, taste (his mouth was lost), touch (he has almost no undamaged,sensing skin), and hearing. He couldn't speak, either. His losses isolated him from the outside world. He sees that he is a hopeless situation, but he can't even kill himself. Instead, his thoughts show us how he struggles to interact with the world. This book really changes your perspective on war and makes you think. I reccommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"i find it hard to believe i went so long without ever reading this book--it is one of the most important novels i've read, and sadly i had to read this book on my own as it was never offered in any of my classes. some may find the book too disturbing to read, but that is the point, and it's important for people to try to get through the horror--it's too easy to dismiss our own thoughts of war, but to dismiss this book would be cheating ourselves in a way. it should be read cover to cover, to get the full affect and know the book for what it is, a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In a situation that is horrible, we have a man who wants to be used as a symbol of the horrors of war. We read about his life, about his father dying, about his girlfriend and her father, both understanding that he may not come back from the war, and she gives herself to him. There is a beauty in the cold reality of the what this book is about. And finally in the end we see a true man who wants humanity to understand how precious life is."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This has to be one of the greatest novels ever written.

I read this book at the advice of one of my teachers at the close of my high school years and it is as thoroughly potent now as it was then. No mistake about that. It is indellible.Neither is it I believe a pacifist's book. It is simply too pristine in its integrity to be presented as nothing other that as an indictment of war and its protagonists. No mere slogan or quaint remark will do to bind its experience.This story begs to be told wherever a young man glosses over volumes of Kipling and Tennyson."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book is, without a shadow of a doubt the most touching book I have EVER read.

Oh My God is all I can say."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book should be required reading for the human race.

This story of the humanity involved in war not only rung true in 1939, but did in '45, '65, '70, and today.

I think an anti war novel should be complusory reading for all students, and some grown ups in office, and in respectable positions should take more notice of such books. Dalton Trumboe is a most marvelisue writer, and I read the book in a few days, although if it weren't for school work it would have been a few hours, not because it is a thin book, but because once you start it you can't put it down!

Although the lack of commas made the book difficult to understand, I quickly grew used to it, and even had trouble adjusting to normal punctuation. I am very disapointed by some of the other people who reviewed this book however, because the name of the character is not Johnny, it is Joe.

By this war and fighting for his country he ends up with no legs, arms, his face is in shambles; he is without a nose, mouth, eyes and ears. The main character in the book Joe Boeham has no form of communication with the outside world therefore; he is left fighting with his own thoughts. Until a nurse shows him that she undertands him by the use of morse Code. Towards the end of the book when the doctors realize that this man can communicate it gets a little frustrating.

This soldier was injured in the war and is lying in the hospital when he realizes he has no arms, legs, ears, eyes, nose, or mouth. We then go through his struggle to communicate to the outside world with him. This is a book that creates many intense emotions that I definitely recommend to you! It is well worth your time!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This Masterpiece really went inside the mind of a man who has lost touch with human contact. Joe is a man without any senses that overcomes his situation by using all his survival skills, he is able to keep track of time, and communicate with is head, while the rest of his body remains a stump. This book shows us the political aspects of war, and how people are forced in as slaves, and then kept quiet so the world would be safe for democracy."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In reading this novel about a severely disabled war veteran, I began to ask myself how plausible it would have been for Joe Bonham to actually survive his injuries in that time before helicopters and much modern medicine. Granted, Trumbo claimed that he based his story on an actual case - but I still wonder. Given the horrific amount of blood loss, the shock, perhaps even the fact that he would have looked less like an injured soldier and more like a loose collection of dead parts - I have my doubts. Could it happen in today's world? I really think there's a better chance of war creating a Joe Bonham in our technologically advanced era. We could not only make him, we could sustain him indefinitely. Whether or not a blast that could basically rip off the front half of your skull could leave your brain perfectly intact is another question entirely.The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the novel works best, as Trumbo takes us through Joe's clouded mind as he gradually realises the extent of his injuries. After that, memory gets lost in delirium, and then the story begins to pick up again. As goofy as it sounds, the scene in which the nurse finally communicates with Joe is like a scene out of \\"The Miracle Worker.\\" However, the joy of the moment is short-lived. Trumbo has an agenda, after all.Having been around my share of horrifically sick people, I don't buy the response that Trumbo wrote for Joe. After fighting to the surface, fighting to communicate, all Joe has are a series of bizarre demands and anti-war tirades. When asked who he is, he tells them nothing. None of this rang true, unless we're meant to understand that Joe is completely off his rocker at this point. No, more common questions would have been, \\"Where am I? What year is it? How is my family?\\" Questions that would help a person like Joe orient himself after being lost for so long. None of that happens, of course. After being told his demands can't be met, Joe instantly gives up and sinks inside of himself, continuing to rage. Even if the end was inevitable (chances were slim that we'd get a \\"happy\\" ending), I can't believe that such a tremendous survivor would just give up so quickly after finally achieving some success."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"When I was a boy, like most boys my age, we were exposed to movies about the glory of war. Our toys were army men or guns from all different eras.Poems like The Charge Of The Light Brigade, and stories like King Aurthur and the Knights of the Round Table were the types of literature on our summer reading lists and our movies glorified war heroes.Like many young boys at that age, I was enthralled with the idea that war was indeed glorious. Why wouldn't I? The society and times I lived in told me so. Sure, I knew I could die, but that was also portrayed as glorious. I was ready to do battle at the first chance that came my way.When I entered into a independent reading class, I saw a book on the list titled Johnny Got His Gun. The title of course drew me as did the shortness of the book in comparison to many others on the list. So I grabbed it.Well, Johnny Got His Gun, opened my eyes to a part of war I hadn't really thought through. Sure, I knew people got wounded, but in the movies, they got a purple heart, got better or died.I had never imagined the kind of experiences the subject of this book did. That certainly did not sound like a glorious ending that I'd wish upon myself. Additionally, I couldn't imagine being the cause of someone else experiencing this either.If you haven't read the book, I'll not be a spoiler, for it's not just the ending but the entire experience that makes the book so valuable.If someone you love or cares about, or even just know well, wants to join the military, for the \\"Glory\\", please have them read this book.I'm not anti military, or military personnel. It's not my intent to undermine someone's desire to serve their country, including my country.

I recently re-read it and it had the same powerful impact. In fact, its message - that war, regardless of its genesis, is phsycially, mentally and emotionally brutal - is as important today as it has ever been, especially as the realities of the Iraq war remain obscured from us.I'd highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially to teen agers and their parents who need to think seriously about what going to war really means."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is without doubt the most startling and powerful anti-war book I've ever read.

It was correct. The entire review is vague on purpose in order to keep the text's original impact.The book focuses on the damage war does to individuals. Soldiers may die valantly on the battlefield for their country, but there are many people who get severely injured as well. The reader learns to care about the main character through flashbacks and his thoughts.His description fits a wide percentage of people in our military and its this universality that makes it so effective. We genuinely care about him. And war ruined his entire life.My favorite parts: a few multi-page rants about how useless war is and how he learned to live with his new cicumstances.

After sustaining massive injuries in battle, a WWI soldier's life is changed forever.I can see why the book was all but blacklisted decades ago and why it became popular again during Korea and Vietnam. Be aware of several 5-10 rantings about just how wrong and pointless war is. Even if you don't agree with his (and the author's) findings, your opinion on the subject should change forever.It makes you think, brings out emotions, and it challenges well-entrenched beliefs--and that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This ranks up there with \\"All Quite On The Western Front\\" as a book that portrays the horrors of war. Yet unlike the 'A.Q.O.T.W.F' which portrays the life of a living, physically healthy but emotionally injured soldier caught up in the hell of a war, 'Johnny Got His Gun' is a book that shows cases the hell that is war in a new and twisted light. This twisted example of war's effect on a young man is done in the fashion of portraying a horribly injured casualty of war. If war is hell then being Johnny is at the center of hell's fury itself while still residing the physical grasp of the real world he inhabits yet being completely detached and isolated from those around him. This book is truly a classic which every young man or women in high-school should read, hell even if you're in college or out of college this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo captivates the essence of the aftermath of war in \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\". In morbid detail one understands what it is to \\"fight for your country\\". Not only that but this book explores human ideas, and what it's like to actually come to the realization of how fatal human ideas can become. Like the idea of fighting for democracy; when the privelages of your life, are literally taken from you, one can understand how fighting for an abstract idea has the same fulfillment as eating imaginary food. Or pretending to be asleep.Aside from that Trumbo does an excellent job of showing what it is to know who you are and what you want. This simply states that if you don't know what you want, you're doing things for unknown reasons and finding a reward, or consequence, or result that makes little sense because one doesn't know what they want. If you don't know what you want it's even harder to understand who you are, because if you're doing things for no real apparent sensible reason, that blurs the definition of who one can be. Like the character Joe, he went and fought a war, for no real apparent reason that he found, and paid for it dearly. This brought about a lot of thought, while Joe faded between dream and reality. This thought provoked the questions of who he is, and what were the reasons for doing what he did. 'Til finally Joe figured out who he was by answering the questions of why he did what he did."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is true masterpiece of literature. unforunetly i do not have the talent with words that mr.trumbo does, so i can not do this book justice, but i will tell you that you should definetly read this book. First of all, this is not a book about war, meaning there will not be lots of action and such. insted it deals with the mental effects of war, with brillance. the book tends to be a little hard to read due to the fact that there may not be one comma in the entire novel, but if you take your time it can be a very powerful and rewarding read. its is a anti-war novel, but it is so much more than that. Please due yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book was the most anti-war book I've ever read. I didn't really love it and I didn't really hate it. It's hard to follow as he flashes back and forth from the present to the past. There are some parts that could have been left out, that just seemed to drag the book along. However, if the book didn't flash back and forth, you would not know Joe before he went to war. I think Joes attitude towards war changed after his meeting with the shell. I was most disappointed with the ending. It was the stupidest ending to a book. It was like the author ran out of thoughts and just ended the book like a 2nd grader. This is a good book for people who really want to know the tragedies of war. Other than that, I would not reccomend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I feel that I would have liked this book if the style of writing would have been different.

I think that the author was unable to think of things that interested people so instead he decided to bash American patorism.

All I have to say is that he should live in Bosnia where you have no choice and you get no credit."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book gave me the impression that the author thought that war shouldn't be fought. His true feelings come out in his main character Johnny who feels that his life was taken away from him by war. I really didn't care for this book. I don't agree with the authors point of view.

After reading the first hundred pages or so the first day I put off finishing it. Why you ask? Nothing ever happens. He lays in the bed and thinks about his life. It is an interesting concept, but I would prefer to take out about two hundred pages of the author's ranting about war. A good short story at best."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This summary contains many spoilers.Joe Bonham is so severely injured in the war that when he wakes up in a hospital bed, he quickly realizes that he has no eyes, ears, nose, mouth, arms, or legs. After figuring out a way to keep track of time and creating his own years and holidays in his mind, and after being awarded a medal of honor for being injured in the war, he tries desperately to communicate to the doctors or nurses in the hospital. This takes until the last sixty or so pages. The bulk of the book is made of author Dalton Trumbo's anti-war rantings and flashbacks to Joe's adolescent years before he was called to fight in the war.After Joe begins tapping his head against the pillow of his hospital bed in Morse code (and being sedated by doctors who think he is crazy), he hears the footsteps of a new nurse one day. She traces the words &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on his chest and, thirty pages from the end of the book, a doctor figures out what he is trying to say and taps on his forehead &quot;What do you want.&quot; Joe taps out a three-paged message about how he could be the rich and famous man with no arms, legs, ears, eyes, nose, or mouth who could communicate to the world about war. The doctor taps that Joe's wishes are against hospital policy and then gives Joe another sedative. The book ends with more of Trumbo's ravings about how you can kill men but you can't destroy their spirit and you can fight a war but the real people who are fighting the war are the ones who are not fighting at all.Although parts of this book were good it would have been better written as an essay. It was clearly written because the author wanted to send the message that war was bad, and the reader understands this message by the third page of the book or so. Also, the style that Dalton Trumbo chose to write this book in is confusing to me. The pages are filled with run-on sentences with lack of punctuation, making the writer look unintelligible. I'm not sure why the author chose to write the book in this style...possibly to show the weakness of Joe's body.This book is not really worth reading if you want to learn something about the war or if you want to read a good fiction book. A better idea of the war would probably be portrayed in a book such as All Quiet on the Western Front."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This novel definitely has quite a message to deliver. The author does a great job of getting his anti-war feelings through. I loved the book and the emotion it evokes but I tend to disagree with the message. It seems that, according to Trumbo, nothing is worth dying for, no theory, idea, or principal. In the book, we learn that no one is able to claim that democracy is worth life unless they have died for it. Our hero Joe is living-dead so he is the only living soul qualified to say that he would rather live in slavery than die for freedom. I find this hard to swallow as our author would be accusing our brave war dead as being mindless bots that just do as their told without conviction. Does he really believe that WWII vets died for nothing? Did the fathers of our country organize militias just to feed their egos as their sons went into battle against the king? What about the slaves? If it is better to be a slave than dead, why did some slaves risk their lives to escape to the north? I believe they have the right to educate us about just what is worth dying for, not Mr. Trumbo. The book is great and the message will find a home in many anti-war circles but I support democracy and the necessity to defend it at all costs. Call me a follower but I am also one of those spokes in the wheel talked about in the book, I am a citizen of this country and that's what we're all about, the people. You anti-Bush people will change your tune quickly when Saddam's chemical brew ends up on your doorstep."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"A popular review of this book remarks that it was kept obscure for several years because it was introduced just as the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939.Obviously, in an era when the Poles had to fight to protect themselves from the open pillaging of their country (which the Nazis carried out in short order), this book's flaws would become too apparent.Like any argument that rests upon a rare extremity of evidence, JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN fails in its logic. It is merely propaganda, because the argument rests entirely on one person who has been turned into a quadrapelegic during the bomb raids of trench warfare.As tragic as the main character is, the book starts out flawed because it shows only one perspective. In 1939, when the Nazis actually were burning down synagogues, raping women, and deporting Polish Jews to Buchenwald and Treblinka, this book could not sell well because the opposite side of the question of the necessity of war had become too urgent.I think Trumbo's book is tedious, predictable, skewed, and too overtly propagandistic. If you want a great anti-war novel, I would urge you to read the classic, RED BADGE OF COURAGE. It's shorter, more terse, has more impact, takes a wider scope, and has better literary quality.Another flaw is that a lot of Trumbo's argument is not really against WAR, but is against WARTIME PROPAGANDA. He swaps the two concepts and really batters the straw man of propaganda without ever discussing war itself. At the end of the book, when even the main character seems to be threatening war to get what he wants, the reader still has a question unanswered: Is it ever right for a person to pick up a gun and fire at an advancing aggressor? Becuase that's what war is.If you argue against the parades and the high talk of dying for honor or for liberty, or handsome uniforms, or ribbons, you are back to propaganda. That's really what Trumbo rails against in his book.But when you talk about the Nazis battering at the gate and having the opportunity to pick up a gun and drive them off, then you're talking about war. Trumbo fails to discuss this idea with any depth.I don't know why this book is considered a classic. If he'd taken half the length to say what it says, it would have said just as much with perhaps more power. But because he over-hammers his point, the reader swims in overt emotional mnaipulation. And the book begns to lose its effectiveness well before the end.There are reasons to reject some wars and refuse to fight. But this book never gets to those reasons. At best, it shows us that it is really stupid to listen to wartime propaganda and sign up to fight just because everybody else is doing it. Granted, that much is true. So I would call it an anti-propaganda book. But did you really need an entire book to tell you not to fall for propaganda?"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Brilliant but primitive agitprop, designed to scare the slack-jawed set.

Even though at times it may seem a little unrealistic and out-dated, believe me; it still is very relevant today (especially with the current Iraq/Middle East situation).

Although I was running out of time for studying for a final exam, every paragraph,page,chapter,and section of this book would not let me go. Once the nightmare begun, I had to finish it.I finished the book 7 hours after starting it. That night I was hoping I would not dream about it once I went to sleep. The existence of the main character is haunting;his thoughts and dreams always weaving a mesh with no dicernible beginning or end, reality and dreams are all the same. However,I you get abosorbed by this book and you will become the &quot;hero&quot; of the story: his disillusion, frustration, and helplesness will become your own.If you ever felt patriotic,or gung-ho,then read this book. I guarantee you too will question the theology of patriotism,or the falsity of its preachers. Like those who wave flags and appeal to the patriotism of others, asking them to risk their lives in wars while they stay home and watch the war unfold in the evening news. The hypocrisy of politicians,pundits, and other so-called leaders are conspicously brought to bear and they are mercilessly indicted by Joe Bonham, the protagonist of the novel.However, this is an indictment of a mind that although alive, it lives in silence and darkness. The stream-of-conciousness narrative of the novel goes deeper and deeper into the nothingness of an existence which has been completely cut off from the physical world. With no eyes to see, no ears to hear, no tongue to speak: just total,coplete and unending nothingness; just him and his thoughts.In the book, Joe Bonham wants to die and live all at once. He is continously trying to keep himself busy by trying to figure out the time of day, what country he is in, the schedule of nurses. In short, trying to regain a foothold in the real world, while skating at the edge of insanity.Just thinking about the novel is maddening,the final pages of the book alone make it one that I know will haunt me every night for the next few nights,along with every quiet moment I may have, just like it did right now when I decided to write this review. I just hope I don't ever dream about this book, reading it alone was enogh like a nightmare. Its like the dream sometimes people have where they are suffocating, drowning or unable to breathe; only to wake up and realize their face is pressed against the pillow. If you ever had a dream like that one consider yourself lucky you woke up: In this book, Joe Bonham never did."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Every thinks that going to war is an honor, and so did I until I read this book. This book really makes you think and gives you a whole different perspective. You do so much for your country, pay taxes, go by the law (well most of us) honor and respect fellow citizens, and what does your country do? They force you to leave everything you ever loved to go kill other people that had to leave their loved ones also. Thanks to this book, I've realized how important it is to try to prevent war. Thank you. I definitely recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"&quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; can mean different things to different people. I felt that this book was worth the time that we took to read it. It exposed us students to what the war was like. Joe's condition was a little over exagerated but it made me aware that people are not all the same. The beginning was slow and the ending could have been better, but what was all in-between, was decent."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"&quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; is a book written to express the pain and suffering that war inflicts on its soldiers. I think that the message in this book is, don't fight in a war unless you absolutely have to, it is not worth it. Although I feel that Joe Bonham believes this, his thinking is affected by the fact that he was left without arms, legs, and a face. He turns sour and sarcastic to everybody and everything because of his situation. In the beginning, it is almost impossible to not get lost in the memories that Joe recalls. Overall, the book does get better as it goes along, but the ending is disappointing."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I thought the book &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; was an okay book but nothing too spectacular. Johnny's attitude toward the war and government in general really disappointed me, though. As a person who's had and has family in the military, I feel that his attitude that we're fighting for things we can't see is biased and one-sided. I am forever in debt to not just my family but many others for fighting for things we can't see. These men and women gave and would give their lives to give others all the things Joe was complaining about. I also feel that his attitude of self-pity was pathetic. Many others have been and will be injured in wars and I hope and have faith that their attitudes won't be like Joe's."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book held some interesting parts and views, but as a whole it was extremely BORING. I read this book in senior english and I had to force myself through 90% of it. Anit-War? More like anti-freedom. The character of the book was unbelievably prejuiced against waht many hold dear. Trombo has hit a book that I refuse to recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Joe Bonham wakes up without knowing what has happened to him. It takes some time for him to fully assess the damage and then, to learn how to move forward - how to live. Unless you have no heart, as you travel with Joe on this journey you'll laugh and cry along with him and share the joy of his triumphs along with the despair of his setbacks.This is not an \\"anti-war\\" book. At least not the typical such one that you'd think of. The red meat anti-war sentiment expressed in the book is that of Joe's, not the author. Given Joe's perdicament, in him it is understandable, but if you want to know what the author thinks of war, then you have to read the introduction. You'll find its much more sober.Read this book, particularly now just before Christmas. The season's greeting delivered therein has the power of a thousand Hallmark cards. Out of fear, I waited many years to read this book. Don't you make the same mistake."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book, which I read of my own accord while in High School, changed my life. It is incredibly powerful, and the narrator's stream of consciousness writing style is penetrating.The person talking about Trumbo's support of communism and pulling the book from the shelf - that is untrue. Trumbo was blacklisted and fled to Mexico; that is why this book was put out of print. He was not a supporter of communism, he was a supporter of Socialism...there is a big difference there, my friend."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Is life worth sacrificing for the sake of a principle? What, in fact, do terms such as \\"liberty\\" and \\"democracy\\" mean? And when the unquestioning soldier enlists out of ignorance, or is sent against his will to die (or worse, return home to find his world shattered as a result of his experiences) on the battlefield, whose \\"freedom\\", if anyone's, is he sanctifying?These are just some of the questions posed by Dalton Trumbo's powerful kafka-esque novel, written shortly after the first world war and not published until the second, about a young soldier who returns from combat and wakes up to a discovery infinitely more nightmarish and horrific than any Kafka's fevered imagination could have devised: instead of finding himself transformed into a many-legged insect, he finds his soul crushed and his body destroyed to an almost unimaginable extent (in short, virtually all his major appendages are missing: eyes, ears, nose, mouth, arms, legs, with only his mind left, endlessly pontificating the obvious. He is, as he describes himself memorably in one scene, a slab of meat, a dissected frog lying in a glass case, which, though outwardly maimed and disfigured beyond recognition, is still heartbreakingly alive beneath it's grotesque exterior). The action of the novel takes place entirely on the protagonist's hospital bed, where he is stranded, so to speak, over the course of several years, during which time the story alternates freely between past and present in the form of flashbacks illustrating pre-and post-war experiences. Trapped in what can only be described as a limbo-like state, or, as the author puts it, \\"dead-while-living\\", the soldier alternately seeths with rage and muses poetically on the folly of war, thus turning the novel into an inner monologue of sorts, utterly sincere but never didactic, by turns poignant and illuminating, filling the reader with shock, pain, nausea, and most of all, righteous indignation at the frequency with which these atrocities occur, as well as those in power who allow them to continue unabated (that's right, I'm talking to you, George W. Bush, you piece of @#$$!!, you vile soldier-killer, you ignorant, apathetic squanderer of human life! God curse you and all your wretched ilk! (The narrative structure of the novel, though, can be somewhat confusing at times, especially at the beginning, which is a kind of hallucinatory, choloroform induced flashback as the protagonist, Joe Bonham, lies on the operating table, attended by doctors' about to amputate his limbs (half-consciously the patient senses that his arm is being severed, and resents that the finger containing his engagement ring will soon be lost forever).It is only when Joe wakes up and somehow explores the contours of his \\"face\\" (if it could still be justifiably referred to as such), that the full extent of his tragedy/nightmare becomes clear, not only to himself, but to the reader as well."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Everyone must read this book, everyone who believes war is glamorous and glory is worth risking their life, everyone who takes their hands and feet for granted. Joe Bonham will change your perspective on life, death, and war. He will humble you to the point where you are thankful you have eyes and ears and a mouth. He gives voice to the poor guys who have fought and died for liberty and other men's ambitions since the beginning of time, and tells you what medals and honor mean to a dead man. Joe has no arms and no legs. World War One left him in a hospital room deaf, blind and dumb. Mr. Trumbo's gruesome novel was banned in America during several wars, but today his unforgetable anti-hero cannot be silenced. Joe screams without a mouth to tell us the only freedom worth fighting for is the freedom to live."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Joe Bonham is one of literature's greatest figures. Based, most horribly, on a real person, Joe does not let us forget. Trumbo has done a most amazing thing--he has somehow gotten inside the mind of a man who is as close to dead as he can be, but who still thinks, still exists, albeit in such mangled form. Trumbo has created a passionate, artful, scream that cannot be argued with.One critic has written it is impossible to review this book without being guilty of hysterics or understatement. Indeed. It is so. Joe is nightmare and reality and dream, and it is a book of tempered pain, as well as a suggestion in the cold dead war field, of how to get by the rest of one's life without having to buy a pair of shoes ever again, or clothes, or glasses, or existence.To be captured in a box of blackness. To know. To realize inch by inch what has happened to him. To be filled with the uttermost reaches of hell. To say this is what war is. What war always is. And the silenced man thus makes his plea. It is finally heard. And he is silenced even a little more.With war talk and with war all around us, it is good to remember Trumbo's Joe Bonham who only wanted to live his life, to marry his girl, to find a place in the world, to strive for happiness. Trumbo says old men have always made war, then they send the young men out to die for God usually, or something else they've made up. And young men die, or almost die, or die beyond what is death. And they remember Kareen who wants them to put their arms around them and never go because they won't come back.And Joe, realizing too late, too late, that when you're dead, you're less than a bug, less than anything. Trumbo has written the novel of a lifetime. I've read he wrote it in two weeks of fury. How he got into the mind of such a man in such a place shows how shattering imagination is, how profound is the mind of one of our great writers, and how a book will last forever. Because the leaders of war never change. Different names, different accents, different languages, but it's always the same.Johnny is full of blood and loneliness and isolation like I've never read before. Trumbo ends his novel with the admonition to men who dictate war--and how the little guy is always the one to get it in the neck, and someday he will be the one who points the gun. The spare parts \\"boys\\" who don't count and it's okay.I read Johnny first during the Vietnam War. I wanted to scream from the housetops, \\"READ THIS BOOK!\\" I still do, even now, especially now. If there is a God somewhere, and if he is not another warlord, if there is compassion and tenderness and empathy anywhere in the world, and one finds it lacking wherever one turns, I suggest read this book, and be somehow comforted by a man whose face has become the face of war. Take this book into the churches and court houses and the places where men make laws and hand down edicts, and say, here, here is all the proof any sane man will ever need."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is the most powerful anti-war novel taht I have ever read. It should be reuqired reading for all high school students. the fact that Dalton Trumbo was blacklsited in the 1950's is a tribute to how great this novel is.In this society, anyone who expresses a strong viewpoint against war and violence is censured. That is what happened to Dalton Trumbo."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"At first, I repeatedly checked the printing date. This stage tapered off gradually, giving way to something akin to reader shellshock. Never before had I read a book so ahead of its time, so anachronistically unflinching and brutal. It reads more like a bitter, acid-tinged Vietnam expose of several decades later than a 1930's classic--and so it is a very nearly unparalleled book on war and pain.It is trite--and inevitably false at that--but as I finally got around to reading Dalton Trumbo's gritty World War I saga \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\", I was continually struck by the naive certainty that, yes, this must be what it's like; if it were possible to commit the feverish mind games of a deaf/dumb/blind dougboy to paper, this would be the result. Every line is true and horrifying. It will be the natural inclination of many young readers--as this is the audience, rightly, to which the book is often pitched--to turn the pages in anticipation of the 'it was all just a dream' type revelation. But Trumbo is above this, having crafted a fine and necessarily discordant series of aching memories alternating with the painful present, all behind the twisted, gauze-swathed face of young Joe--that is, an entire narrative within a soldier's head.'Johnny' is grisly, to be sure; still, physical grotesqueness surrounding the specifics of Joe's incapacitation don't come close to the emotional anguish he experiences.In short, very few books will affect you as strongly or stay with you as indelibly as this. A typically jaded jackass adolescent male, I was moved (or disturbed) to subtle tears by Trumbo's heartfelt tale, and this remains the only book to give me nightmares--at the age of 20, no less.

In a loneliest world no one could imagine its existence until we listen to him. The author describs the world so vividly and attentively.Any human being with a right mind wouldn't be able to support war after reading his story. I wonder how many Johnnys have been there and out there now.Who are the winner of a war by the way?The ones want to create war.And it is Joe who pays the price."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is an odd book. It's brilliant and vivid and powerful and when it grabs hold of you it doesn't let go until the end. That's uncommon enough to make this novel special. But the ends to which Trumbo puts his novel don't measure up--his message is unworthy of the story.Joe Bonham wakes up in a daze. He can't see or hear anything and he has no idea where he is. Slowly, gradually, he realizes the horrible state he's in. He's in a hospital, he's missing an arm--wait, both arms--and both legs, and his eyes, his nose, his ears, and his entire jaw. He breaths through a tube at the base of his neck, eats through a tube in his stomach, and voids his bowels through another tube. The idea to which he repeatedly returns is that he's a baby--helpless and trapped in a womb, sealed off entirely from all outside sensation but direct touch and the vibration of footsteps through his bedsprings.His reaction, naturally enough, is a mixture of panic, terror, anger, and sadness. He drifts incoherently between sleep, consciousness, and the daydreams that fill in his backstory for the reader. Eventually it dawns on him that, if he can get some sense of time, he can begin to make sense of the world.This part of the novel is some of the best fiction I've ever read. Trumbo takes the unimaginable and thrusts it upon the reader, forcing them into the perspective of a person completely detached from the world and almost unable to cope. The pacing is simultaneously slow and furious--Joe sets about \\"mastering time\\" very deliberately, but the energy of Trumbo's writing makes Joe's slow, painful, and often abortive attempts to understand his world a quick read. And, near the end, when Joe grasps that there remains to him one way he may be able to communicate with the world outside his mutilated body, the book blisters along at a pace as desperate as Joe's perseverance.The problem really comes in the last chapter. Trumbo has an unabashedly political purpose for this novel--the condemnation of warfare--and while that's perfectly fine for any writer of any political persuasion, Trumbo sacrifices the strengths of his story to turn it into a political homily. None of Joe's story--the tender and painful memories of family, growing up, falling in love, and serving in the trenches--matters in the end. Joe is a means to an end, and that end is a surprisingly juvenile Marxist sermon about how \\"they\\" send \\"us\\" to war and how \\"we\\" will turn the tables on \\"them.\\" Joe's story doesn't end, it segues into a sermon illustration. The result is a final chapter that feels like a cruel time-wasting joke.This is a fantastic novel, and I'm very glad I read it. It's one of the most powerful anti-war novels to emerge from the 1920s and '30s, and certainly among the best fiction I've ever read. But the last chapter deflates--without necessarily popping--a great story.Recommended."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Joe is trapped inside his body. A terrible war injury has caused him to lose his arms, legs, sight, sound, and even smell. His only real consciousness of the world outside his head is the vibrations of the nurses who come into his room and the room temperature that helps him tell what time of day it is. Some of the story is about the past, Joe's life before and during the war, but most of the book is about Joe struggling with his own sanity as he tries to create order and sense out of the madness that he is living. Dalton Trumbo is a brilliant writer who puts you so deeply into the main character's mind that you truly feel you are in his dark and lonely world. When Joe discovers a way to speak with the outside world, you feel his excitement and his great disappointment. When Joe begans to sense that rats are feeding on him at night when the nurses are gone, you feel his terror and utter hopelessness. When Joe figures out a medal of valor is being awarded to him, you feel the rage he feels at such a worthless honor to him now.A great book that should be read by all those who send other men off to fight wars for their corporate profit."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In the literature of the consequences of war -- including Stephen Crane'sThe Red Badge of Courage, Remarque'sAll Quiet On The Western Front, Farley Mowat'sAnd No Birds Sang, and Joseph Heller'sCatch-22-- Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun stands apart. There is little about army life, few scenes from the battlefield, not much about incompetant officers and disasterous battle plans. Rather, this intense book is almost entirely the stream-of-consciousness thoughts of a horrifically wounded soldier. That soldier, Joe Bonham, was deprived of his arms, legs, face, and hearing by the explosion of an artillary shell. He is isolated inside his own body; he considers himself the living dead. The novel follows his thoughts from when he regains consciousness through the years to the point where he discovers he can communicate using Morse Code. The writing is free-flowing, nonlinear, at times shocking, other times beautiful.Left to his own thoughts, Joe sees war for what it really is: the sacrifice of the lives of what he calls \\"the little guy\\" for vague notions of democracy, honor, freedom, and patriotism. \\"There's nothing noble about dying,\\" Joe says in his head. Life is what matters, so protect it, keep it away from those who would convince you otherwise.But Joe is not just a symbol or an archetype. He is a fully formed character, with hopes and needs, disappointments and triumphs, a family and a home. And, heartbreakingly, he comes to see that his disabled state would be a cautionary tale to young men everywhere, if only he could get out of his hospital bed.First published in 1939 and describing the First World War, the novel continues to speak today, transcending the specifics of any particular conflict to address war itself. Tellingly, my edition contains a forward by Cindy Sheehan, author ofNot One More Mother's Childand famous for her month-long protest against the Iraq War outside George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas. She explains how much this book spoke to her, the mother of a soldier who died in war 6 decades after this book was written.

The assigned reading bored me to death). It has never left me. It's one of the most searing indictments of war ever written. It's brutal, depressing, creepy, terrifying, surreal, and absolutely fascinating. A book like this never really dates, as it is not about one specific war but about war itself.I'm generally a film person, and I like to rib my literary friends by saying \\"the movie is always better\\", but this is one of those cases where the book is vastly superior to the film (even though the film was written and directed by Dalton Trumbo himself, the only film he ever directed). The film came across as amateurish and pretentious, but the book is searing and shockingly unforgettable. To get inside the mind of a man who is nothing but a stump (no legs, no arms, face shot off, but fully conscious and only able to communicate through morse code by tapping his head on the pillow) is as harrowing as they come. I'm glad my high school had this book on their shelves. This along with the biography of Frank Serpico and Native Son (which was assigned reading) were the only 3 books I enjoyed when I was in prison, er, high school. This is still a shattering book, arguably Trumbo's greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo is a dark tale about a manat war. At first glance, this book can be deceiving because of therun-on sentences that make up the entire novel. There are no commasand adjusting to the new grammar is somewhat frustrating. We followJohnny through the story, watching him learn to live with no arms,legs, and face. He is also stripped of his sight, smell and ability tohear. Although the story is good, it is hard to follow most of thetime because Johnny is constantly slipping between dreaming,reminiscing and being awake. The memories don't seem to have muchsignificance to the story in anyway, maybe only just to let the readerknow more about Johnny's life. The two parts of the book represent thetimes in his mind and the times in the real world. He can only feelwith the remaining parts of his body. He feels the heat from the sunand the vibrations from people walking in and out of his room.

Joe was in World War I and got hisbody parts destroyed by a bomb shell at the battlefield. He realizesthat his arms were taken off in the first part of the book but doesnot fully wake up.

During the second part of the book, heis awake and realizes that he has lost a lot of his important bodyparts. He has also lost a lot of his senses and learns to communicatein only one way that he knows how to.

Because Johnny couldn't see,the only thing that he knew about her is that she had soft, warm,moist hands and that the vibrations of her footsteps were lighter thanthose of his previous nurse. She is a significant character becausethe climax of the story is when she discovers that he understandsMorse code and that the tapping that she does with his head is thecode. The nurse tries to do things for him so that he can be morecomfortable in his surroundings when all he wants is for her tounderstand that he is trying to talk to her in Morse code.Although the story line in this story could seem somewhat darkand depressing, the main theme was really about human connection andliving you're life so that you are happy. In following the maincharacter through his life by means of flash backs, we start todevelop a feel for what kind of person he really was. We watched himgo from his home town to Los Angeles and how he eventually went towar. In each flashback, we witness some sort of lesson about life, beit how you act towards your friends, being kind to the person who gaveyou a job, or the remembrance of a loved one. Although this book had asad premise- that of a crippled young man- its deeper themes are thatof love, life, loss and happiness.Although this book offered many new ponderings, it did showweakness in the desolate feel it sometimes produced of the reader. I'msure that this was an intentional process of the author, however, thisbook's premise is already dark and takes adjusting to. With the lackof human contact that Joe encounters for upwards of five years, itwould have been nice to hear of a happy event that took place in hislife. This point brings me to one of the many strengths of the book.Many people consider the flashbacks to be random and misplacedthroughout the story, however it is my opinion that the flashbacksprovide some sort of solemn comic relief. They provide a break fromthe seemingly endless battle for consciousness and mastery of timewhich Joe is constantly struggling for. The flashbacks provide aflash into a happier time for the protagonist and deliver the audienceinto the happiness of his former life.As far as the technical execution of the book goes, its lack ofconvensional grammar, aides the story in its quest to provide anenvironment which draws the reader in, allowing a bonding with thedecrepit narrator.After reading this book in a literature group, the finalreaction found our group torn into two thought groups: the first wasthat this book was not really good. Overall, it was hard to understandbecause of the insignificant memories and flashbacks that wererandomly placed throughout the novel and the annoying and hard tounderstand run-on sentences. It was also almost painful tohave to hear the descriptions of how horrible Joe's life was. Althoughit was really sad, it was written well in the way that you couldreally feel the pain and frustration that he was going through. Thisbook would be a lot more enjoyable if there were commas and the randomflashbacks were not included.The other opinion was that this book was well written, using theimproper grammar as a way to welcome you into a deaf, dumb, blind,mute amputee's thoughts. The run on sentences helped you acquaintyourself with the character and develop a relationship with the story.The flashbacks were an understated portrait of his former life, givingyou even more of a connection to his character. Whether you were froma big city or small town, you could find some means of connection withJoe. Overall, I consider this to be a well-written story with anoriginal premise worth reading. Although its theme is somewhatmelancholy, its over all themes and quality draw you in and keep thisbook a classic page-turner."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"You don't have to agree with Dalton Trumbo's pascifism to enjoy Johnny Got His Gun. (I am in the military myself.) Anyone who enjoys deep thinking or perhaps wants to examine their own views about war ought to make reading this book a top priority.The book tells the story of Joe Bentham, a WWI soldier who is left as a conscious human vegetable after a shell landed nearby. The book is told in third person but from his perpective as he thinks over his life from his own world that is not quite death and not quite life.This book could have done what many other anti-war books have done and simply described the brutality of war. While there are certainly gorey details in this book, it does not rely on violence as much as you might think. It is much more psychological in nature.Even the most avid war hawk will come away with a shaken faith in mottoes like \\"death before dishonor\\" and \\"these colors don't run.\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In this heart wrenching story the reader will learn about the inner workings of a young man who has been permanently disfigured, without arms, legs, eyes, ears, nose or mouth; he is left as he puts it \\"the link between the dead and living.\\" During this story you will learn about this man's \\"life\\" post-combat and his comparably glorious past . The story is told by this painfully optimistic man, who braves all news with a heart wrenching grace.

I had a vague notion that it was somewhat controversial, now I know why.Wow. What a book. Trumbo's account of a young soldier's gradual comprehension of what has happened to him in the trenches of WWI is absolutely stunning. The book takes its time though, relaying through the soldier's narrative that he has absolutely no clue whatsoever what his situation is.Having lost virtually all of his senses--with the exception that he can feel the vibration of footsteps around him, the touch of (the nurse's hands) on his skin, and the warmth of the sun on his face--he spends much of the first part of the book in a dream-state. Or at least he ASSUMES he's dreaming...quite understandable, given his singularly horrible circumstances.Trumbo does a wonderful job detailing the soldier's gradual discovery of his consciousness, as well as his state of being.Without giving too much more away, I found the scene in which a nurse successfully communicates a message to him, extrememly moving. It was a touching scene, especially in light of the fact that everyone was of the notion that he was little more than a breathing vegetable, incapable of thought or emotion. It was both heartbreaking and heartwarming that so simple a communication carried with it so much meaning."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is my favorite book.

The only other's who have ever come near it are the maker's of the film and Metallica who wrote the song &quot;One&quot; as a tribute. Every page turned will convince you that the plight of this cursed man could not possibly get any worse, yet the pages of suffering keep coming.

To experience the terror the protagonist goes through, 2. For the social commentary, and 3. To marvel at the authors writing style.The first reason is the most obvious. This truly is a horror story, if only because of the horror that the protagonist goes through. It's only human nature to what to read about the experiences others go through, especially when they are terrible experiences. In fact, this desire to see people at their worst is referenced in the book in a very unflattering way. But don't feel bad - wanting to see people at their worst can also be helpful on a larger scale.The second reason is also pretty obvious. Everyone knows this is an anti-war book. Really, for most people this is THE anti-war novel. But until you read it, you won't ever be able to see WHY this is THE anti-war book. To put it simply, Johnny Got His Gun shows the human effects of war.The third reason is less obvious, but still important. The style of writing is unique and powerful.

In that odd sense the most compelling novelistic treatments are either pro-war (for some seemingly rational reason like defending one's country or coming to the aid of a smaller, weaker country, etc.) or neutral to the more physical and psychological dimensions of the situation. A flat out, anti-war (or, to use a more vague term, pacifistic) treatment is usually not successful either because it has a \\"preaching to the choir\\" quality or strikes some false chord. That is not the case with Dalton Trumbo's \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\".Although this novel was written under the sign of the Hitler-Stalin Pact in the late 1930s , reflected in Communist International and American Communist Party political line as one of intense opposition to Western war preparations it brings more home truths than merely another piece of \`communsitic' propaganda and it would be incorrect even for staunch anti-Stalinists to dismiss it out of hand. Joe, the main character here, maimed beyond belief and repair, is every mother's son, every American mother's son. His interior monologue, as he remembers his past, his lost youth, his desires and the useless way he was used in the last days of World War I is almost unique in the way the story unfolds. It certainly is not for the faint-hearted, or the weak-minded. As steps are now being taken to up the ante in Afghanistan, another one of those wars to \`defend' democracy this thing should be required reading for every mother, and every mother's son who seeks to put him or herself in harm's way."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This is the story of Joe Bonham, a young American man, who was dragged to a war that he didn't understand.

Joe's intense, but intriguing journey through his own mind to the ultimate political maturity is amazing.This novel was written over 60 years ago, and it is still relevant to this crazy time of wars, dragging young men into blind killing orgies and splitting people into those blindly loyal to their government, and shocked betrayed citizens.

As soon as Hitler turned on Stalin, Trumbo pulled the book from print and became a strong advocate for U.S. involvement in the war. When several isolationists and pacifists contacted him for support a year after the book was published, he turned them in to the FBI.He only rediscovered his pacifist beliefs and republished the book in 1971 because the U.S. was again threatening communist expansion (in Vietnam).The moral of the book is that no ideal (mainly freedom) is worth dying for. This is a flawed argument for pacifism as many pacifists have died for their beliefs (Ghandi, Martin Luther King). For a better book about pacifism, read Ghandi's autobiography. While Johnny Got His Gun is interesting for it's 1930's language, the book's version of pacifism is nothing but dishonest, shameful propaganda."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"i havent read the book or seen the movie but the song &quot;one&quot; by metallica is based off the book. after hearing the song and watching the extended music video that shows clips from the movie, i really want to see the movie or read the book. i got a general idea of what its about and thats all i need to tell its an awesome story."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"It seems to me that anyone who abdicates a certain worldview has to resort to absurdities to prove their &quot;rationale&quot;. First, Johnny's condition is impossible. Let's review a few things.Psychology of acceptance. First, we do not know that Johnny would be outraged by his condition. The muteness, the inability to perceive objects, the inability to smell. We look upon it with horror, because it is hard for us to imagine living without such things. Recent blindness in people rarely determines suicidal tendencencies, nor do amputations, or sudden loss of hearing. That the human mind is capable of acceptance of such conditions and to conclude that one would beg for suicide or conclude against war because of said conditions is absurd.Then, there is the philosophical leap of saying that no human event, freedom, liberty is ever worth war. Yet, everything in our history, from ancient times to the present, indicates otherwise. That for every one person who concludes this communistic perspective, there are thousands more who are more than willing to sacrifice, no matter what bodily harm. That a man or woman will go to war to save his/her family, to guarantee their way of life (whether it is being able to live to eat rat droppings or to live in a luxurious hotel). This book is completely absent of any darwinian perspective and basically assumes that humans are nothing but purely cognitive creatures. However contradicts itself by saying that this person wants to fight to get his word out. That said ideology is worth fighting for, while proclaiming no ideology is worth fighting for, in conflict, whatever... Thus, it negates itself. Here is the problemata:I hold that all bodily harm is wrong.I hold that all human thoughts are not worth fighting for.I am unwilling to risk harm to my body for the thoughts in my head.I believe that all humans should stop fighting wars.However, I am unwilling to risk bodily harm to stop wars.Since I am unwilling to defend democracy, my right to speak freely, I can not afford to speak out, because that would entail bodily harm.So, if we are to conclude that all war is wrong, regardless of circumstance (like Jews being burned in stoves etc.), then we have negated the very free speech that we espouse our views. This circular reasoning is why this book is utterly rediculous and how liberalism/communism/socialism can never work."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The second review says it all.

But overall I found the book to be a bore and insulting to some of the things that I believe in. I find it hard to believe that a citizen and soldier would have the attitude that Joe portrays. Yes, it stinks to be in his position, but the bias anti-war views are layed on a little thick. To be anti-war is to be anti-freedom. Joe should be proud to have served his country and quit his whining. If anyone is looking for a real war book I suggest &quot; The Red Badge of Courage&quot; that is a book that portrays the horror of war, but also the honor of serving your countries purpose. Avoid Joe's snotty attitude and don't read this book. Daulton Trumbo has to skill to be a great writer, it's just to bad he wasted it to express his extremly bias and whiny views.

Dalton Trumbo embraces this power and takes a chance to reach his audience by the creation of a character named Joe. Joe is a man who suffers the consequences of World War I and is forced to continue life as a stump. Trumbo initially interests you through the life of the ordinarily complacent main character and his happy adolescent memories of growing up in Shale City, Colorado. Soon after the flashbacks Trumbo uniquely enlightens us through the discovery of Joe that he is a man with no arms, legs or face. Can you imagine being sensoryless, no connection to any form of mobility. You feel trapped within the loneliness of your head constantly threatened by insanity. Joe realized that communication with the outside world would be the only solution worth living for. Through patience he found a way to communicate with his nurse. Yet when they do create a link of communication, what he asks for is death, to be released from his misery. Trumbo's use of powerful language helped the reader understand the trauma of Joe. His writing often made me feel like I was his main character who was forced to withstand ruthless thoughts in a silent world, like the world that became Joe's reality. This bizarre topic is presented in a authentic story which also questions how society responds to moral dilemmas. Furthermore Trumbo reminds us of the emptiness felt in solitude through this anti-war novel. I was reminded of the courage and understanding that must be brought to life's challenges, and the stamina required to graciously complete our visions."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I'm usually not one to pick up a classic, but my dad recomended it, and it caught my interest.

For an American novel of that perios, it was ahead of its time (as far as I can tell), in the sense that it deals with war in a naturalistic and individualistic sense, rather than in a collective sense. After all, when the fighting stops and you return home, you are a person again, not part of a company of soldiers, and the soldier in this novel is the extreme case of someone who must &quot;come home&quot; so to speak. If you liked &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; or &quot;The 13th Valley&quot;, then you'll probably appreciate this novel. It's definitely worth a try."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"\\"Johnny Got His Gun is one of the greatest anti-war novels that will wrench your emotions, challenge your values, and open your eyes to the reality of war. Dalton Trumbo is graphic and uncompromising from cover to cover. A must read for anyone who is willing to take the journey.\\""},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I don't need to explain the emotional impact of this book, since dozens of reviews have already done so. What really makes this work so important is that Dalton Trumbo was completely right. And the more criticism he gets, the more right he seems.What was World War I fought for? Not many average people could tell you, because it had no measurable result. It promised to &quot;end all wars.&quot; It didn't. It promised to create &quot;democracy.&quot; It didn't. WWI was simply the end result of imperialist squabbles, and no amount of rhetoric could make it have any higher meaning. After millions of &quot;noble&quot; deaths, the world was not a better place; in fact, it was set up for an even larger war twenty-five years later. Trumbo said it first: &quot;You're dead and you died for nothing.&quot; Harsh but 100% true.The more that people condemn this book as &quot;anti-freedom,&quot; the more it is obvious that their words have lost all meaning. The more that people want to ban this book, just like Trumbo himself was banned from the US during his lifetime, the more it is obvious that THEY are the cowards. Thus, Trumbo wrote a book that has been proved true by its opponents. If that isn't literary genius, I don't know what is.As for calling it &quot;boring&quot; -- I can't help you there. Try reading it when you're older than 12. I read this book on my own when I was 16, then I read it again, voluntarily, for a school paper the next year. Once I pick it up, I can't put it down.The bottom line: this is the most PRO-freedom book you will ever read. A man who cannot even move his body has acheived more mental freedom than entire armies and parliaments of able-bodied men. This book creates hostile reactions because so many Americans are afraid of this freedom. Freedom can be ugly. Freedom can be anti-patriotic. But, in the end, freedom will have no meaning if we continue to enforce it with death."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Just imagine being without most of your senses. How could someone live that way, but Joe has learned to move on with his life and try to figure out how he could possibly communicate with the outside world. This was an interesting book to see how war could effect someone. It told about many factors of the war. But, on other hand it was really wierd to think that someone could actually live that way which is impossible."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"JUST THINK HOW IT WOULD BE TO HAVE LOST ALL OF YOUR SENSES EXCEPT SENSORY TOUCH.TO LAY IN BED AND TO DREAM AND THINK OF WHAT YOU HAVE LOST.

The way he continued to recall the past brought to truth the realities of what he went through, and the things that he was going to miss out on. He would never see, or hear anyone again. While I will probably never read this book again, I would advise everyone to read it at least once. It makes you realize how unglamorous wars really are."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In the novel Johnny Got His Gun , Dalton Trumbo writes an anti-war novel from the point of view of an injured infantryman (Joe Bonham). It is a story of a young man who loses his arms, legs, and his face after the war and still survives. It was a story where readers develop their imaginations the realities of the survivors of the war. The book uses powerful words that give readers a flood of intense emotions. The book was so terrifying, imagining a man without his five senses and still survive was so horrible. Trumbo's novel was very good and I would definitely recommend it for people who haven't read the book, but the only thing that I didn't like was he jumps around in time and place with his characters."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Meet the All-American man, Joe. He was raised like any other American boy born in the early 20th century. He has friends, a girlfriend, and two adoring parents. All of that changes when Joe enters the war and comes out less than the man he was, literally. Enter Joe's mind as he plummets into the heart of his own hell as he realizes the disfigurement an All-American can suffer in war not his own. Dalton Trumbo's &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; brings a rollercoaster of feelings and images as Joe deals with his new being in life. Using as amazing style of run on sentences and repetativeness, Dalton encaptures the reader and sets them into Joe's shoes. &quot;Merry christmas merry christmas merry christmas...He nodded back at her frantically...merry christmas to you merry christmas oh merry merry christmas. He thought to himself with a kind of hysterical happiness four years maybe five maybe six years I don't know how many years but I've been alone through all of them. He thought all my good work is gone all my way of keeping time has been forgotten but I don't care I am no longer alone.&quot; Armed with a bit of dark humor and aimed at educating readers of the causulities of war, Dalton Trumbo's American war classic asks why do we need to go to war? A question each reader must then answer for himself."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I think every person that thinks war is glamourous should read this book. I think all the folks who are living &quot;for today, not tomorrow&quot; should read this book, about a stump. This stump was once a human being and now is a legless, armless, eyeless, mouthless, earless living creature that feels. He once had arms and legs and remembers all the good things that he did with them. We should all just thank god we have our limbs and eyes, nose, mouth and ears.

It is the truth and horror of wartime embodied in one person.

My children will be reading this once they are old enough."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I've just finished reading 'Johnny Got His Gun', and I'm ready to read it again.Reading this book is hopping on a continuous spiralling tug-of-war betweenhope and despair, states of comatose and states of nostalgia.A militant march through one man's stolen freedom.Dalton Trumbo exposes not only his tragic hero to the struggles of acceptingtruth, but also to anyone who reads this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The review: this is a great book. Undoubtedly five star-worthy. If I were a left-wing English professor (that may be a pleonasm), I'd assign it to all my captive undergraduates. Trumbo has created a page-turning, emotionally affecting novel that permeates the reader, and indues him with horror and empathy toward the fate of the protagonist.Artistically, the book is triumphant. The narrative progresses in a fluid, readable, stream-of-consciousness that reflects exactly what I imagine a disembodied intellect would experience in such circumstances. Joe Bonham becomes a real human being, not a contrived figment of some agenda-driven leftist's imagination. (Even if that was indeed the political intent...the sheer talent of Trumbo surmounts what could have devolved into a grotesque morality-play.)I cannot for the life of me comprehend why this book is not on the MLA 100, especially when that list is populated by such duds as On the Road, and Wide Sargasso Sea. (To mention only two.)The polemic: Trumbo had an agenda, no question. Even though Joe Bonham becomes his own character, incipient-Communist Trumbo at times ventriloquizes too ardently.He (Trumbo) rails against jingoism, patriotism, nationalism, sloganeering, etc., and declares that \\"little guys\\" should simply refuse to fight in all wars. He questions why men should fight for abstractions such as \\"liberty\\" or \\"democracy,\\" which, Trumbo asserts, are meaningless platitudes. (I wonder what George Orwell, who volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War for precisely such a reason, and took a bullet to the throat, would have said in response.)I agree that war is evil...and, to quote Orwell, sometimes it is the lesser evil. Joe Bonham was drafted, and coerced into fighting people he had no quarrel with. I agree that being forced to go to war is wrong...yet I think that descendants of American slaves are glad that the rolls were called in the North, the ranks filled with conscripts, and the Confederacy defeated.I also think that a lot of people--including Trumbo himself--are glad that men were sent unwillingly to war in order to defeat Hitler.Yes, some wars--perhaps most--are ludicrous and insane, demonstrating how far the human species is from achieving civilization. But not all. Trumbo does not allow for this distinction; his pacifism is absolute and resolute, and he uses an astoundingly specious argument on page 151 in order to advance his blanket position. Better to live a slave than die fighting for \\"freedom,\\" according to him.(Ironically, Trumbo experienced a profound tergiversation during WWII, when he helped suppress his own book, and refused to lobby for a negotiated peace with the Axis Powers. Of course, Vietnam helped him arrive back at his original moorings.)However, even though the book doesn't make its political case, the artistic level of the presentation and the always-relevant subject matter ensure that it will remain read for the foreseeable future...at least until human beings decide to resolve conflicts without killing each other."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book was a waste of my time. I did not like the story about the antiwar. I did not like Joe it had to much discription. I want to go to war when I am old enough to know the meaning of death."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"This book's author displays all the classical signs of major depression. Just like Salinger did in Catcher in the rye and Huxley in A Brave New World. The book deals very little with war itself and how he was injured or what he saw, but does instead talk non-stop and ad nauseam about the soldier's life before he was injured. He describes his father in sad detail and rethinks all the things he should have done and his lost love. Again, classic major depression and NOT an anti-war book."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"the only reason i read this book was because it was on the top 100 horror books. But it was the worst book i have ever read. The author goes and tells the reader, a man should never fight for anything. honor, freedom, and liberty are just made up by \\"the man\\" so a teenager can go fight and die. The author goes on to say the if a man dies in the process of saving his wife from being raped he was not noble in his actions. I just recently came back from Iraq and fought for freedom....and i'd do it again in a heart beat. for the people who agree with the author maybe you should leave this great country of ours and live some where else."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo's book is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. I have read many books and I can easily tell you this is the most boring, anticlimactic, awful book I have ever read. You have to ask... What was Trumbo thinking when he splurged this book out. What could make the plot better for example???Plot- 10/100I guess what hurt the plot so bad is the absence of excitement. The main character, Joe enters World War I and is badly hurt. Most of the book is spent in his mind, of him thinking to himself about how bad war is. Contrary to the wonderful novel, Catch 22, this book is simply BORING! Other than everything, this is a great book. I read this book for a senior project for my high school English teacher and I told her it was the worst book in history. That's how bad it is.Climax- 10/100Poor Dalton made the end of this book up in 10 minutes. I can't tell you what happens, but it involves a mental climax. You are thinking... Mental climax? Yes, that's right, Joe thinks to himself. The end of the book is one 50 page rant on war. *Screams* He ended the book with a few hundred mixed opinions about war, many repeated constantly.Literary Quality- 50/100The reason why I gave Trumbo 50 on this section is because he ended his sentences with periods. Good job, at least one part of this book is decent, most of the time. Sometimes, I actually stopped to measure how long some run-off sentences were... The longest was a whole page! He repeats ideas many times on one page, and even in one chapter. Awful.Lasting Appeal- 0/100I would not read this book again if you threatened to throw me in a pit of scorpions, mad cows, rat poison, mentally deranged elephants, math professors, sharks, Disney characters, and hydrochloric acid. Think about that. It is THAT BAD! I struggled through every chapter. The only good thing I got out of this was some opinions if I ever decide to be a anti-war maniac. You know, the ones that live in a cardboard box on the porch of the white house. The ones that protest to the first lady about how nobody remembered the alamo. That's how dedicated you have to be to survive reading this. The only reason I read it was that I had to for school.... Suffering through this book was my hardest project ever.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I hated this book.

In fact, the novel is a statement against boosting the economy through war, against sending innocent boys to die, against war in general. And the skill and passion with which Trumbo conveys it are equal to Kovac and Vonnegut. The horrifyingly real imagery and internal monologue of Joe, the soldier who becomes fodder for a cannon and has every part of his body cease to function except his mind, bring the reality of a war which was fought with no real reason and no real conscious to life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is a powerful book written by Dalton Trumbo. It preaches the horrors of war and the casualties of it. Joe Bonham is a victim of the war and ends up as a freak stump lying in a hospital senseless. When he awakes he finds that he is completely metamorphosized into a human block of flesh. He cannot hear, cannot smell, cannot taste, cannot see, cannot move his arms and legs becuase he has none. He is a living dead man. The only thing that makes him different from dead men is that he can still think. Yet this is what tortures him. Imagine his situation. Lying in a bed for the rest of your life and doing absolutely nothing. He finds out over time that he must try to do something to remain part of the living so he decides to try to keep time. But each time he tries to count the seconds, mininutes, hours, and days, he slips into and out of sleep. He can't decipher when he is concsious and when he's asleep. The only time he is sure he is awake is when the nurse checks up on him. But over time he realizes he can tell time, tell temperature, and tell vibrations. And then one day, an idea pops inside his head. He can communicate through vibrations. So he tries tapping his head against his pillow whenever he is conscious. Tap, tap, tap. All day long. This freaks out his normal nurse. And she doesn't know how to cope with this behavior. I know I would be freaked out also if I saw a stump tapping whats left of what seems to be a head on a pillow all day long. His hopes are met one day when a new nurse recognizes that he is trying to communicate. So a General comes in and by useing Morse Code, taps out, &quot;What do you want?&quot; What kind of question is that? Joe wants to get mad, but decides against it. Instead he wants to be an educational exhibit for reasons against war. He taps that to the General, yet the General refuses his only wish. And that crushes Joe's hope. At the end, he blames the makers and planners of war. There's nothing noble about dying. Once you're dead, you're dead. This book was a unique book in that I've never read anything like it. There is little plot, just a bunch of scenes of Joe's previous life. It denounces war, and during War World II, it was banned. Such a book makes the reader think of war and if it is really worth it. I know I'd rather stay home and keep all my limbs than getting blown up in some place far from home. And what's the purpose? I'm not defending my home from savages or anything. I gave this book four stars becuase it was unique and very thought provoking. I recommend this book to anyone who is about to enter a military service and to the planners and makers of war. If they read this, maybe they will have second thoughts about getting blown up."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"It's a shame that the teachers in Leigh, Nebraska allow their students to run rampant on amazon.com , spouting off about books that very obviously elude them.

I'm not sure if it says more about the teachers or the students that most of them failed to grasp the concepts and emotion behind this marvelous work...either way, any and all reviews bearing the source of Leigh, Nebraska should be disregarded as the ramblings of those far too young to really grasp the majority of this book.'Johnny Got His Gun' is as disturbing a story as you will find, never reveling in gratuitus violence or gore, instead immersing the reader in the horrors a mind must endure when the body is all but ruined. Through chaotic hospitol bed ramblings, interlaced with flashbacks and memories of home, Trumbo's anti-war message hits home in the hardest of ways.

Imagine trying to communicate by tapping your head. Dalton Trumbo (who was later blacklisted) wrote this novel in 1939, then accepted its suppression during World War II.

The question that is raised in my mind, &quot;What if I was drafted by the United States Governement to fight in a war?&quot; What would I do?

In this book, we see the anguish, heartache, and regret of a young, innocent soldier turned into an immobile torso. The author does not attempt to shield us from the reality that was shoved into Joe's face from the beginning. In essence, this book strips all euphemisms of the past, and puts the harsh brutality of warfare into perspective for any citizen - war hero or civilian.

By reading this I was able to see exactly how I felt on certain subjects, war especially, considering this book sends a strong anti-war message.

This task is acomplished, thus ending the book. The only part about this book I do not especially like is the ending. I am the type of person who hates authors who leave you hanging to decide what the characters fate is. I want to know how the author thought the end should be.

I can't imagine being able to live the way he did, but I also can't believe his attitude. He thought the whole world was against him, but he didn't help them much by reacting the way he did and I think something could have been done to the ending to keep it from turning out so weak.

Even though it sounds like another sad story about young life being wastedit goes much beyond that. Joe Bonham is a young man froma little town called Cole Creek near Denver. Joe lived with his parents who were leading a life of an average American family. He used to go fishing with his dad a lot when he was younger, while his mom would make jelly at home. Joe also had a girlfriend, Karen whom he liked very much and hwo he liked to. He was a young man just beginning his adult life. And then in 1939 the war had started. World War One in which Joe was drafted along with milllions of other people. Shortly after joining the was Joe gets badly wounded, his legs were blown off, his arms to. He does not have a face anymore, he can not talk or hear or see. he was dead but very much alive. He did not know where he was at or what time it was. Besided not knowing what's going on, no one else could possibly care about him because nobody knew who he was. So joe became a thing, a piece of flesh that could eat, breathe, and think. And then he realized that even though it's too late for him, it might not be too late for others, that he can warn and save other young men, not from death but from this lifewithin death. So he tried to communicate and tried to accept this way of life. He tried to figure out what tim e it was, or was it night or day. He tried to find out how big was the room where he was staying at, and how old was the nurse. For things that would takee the rest of us just a single look it took him a lifetime and a whole philosophy. But the life went on and same things were hapenning every day until Joe got a new nurse. Again He tried a trick with an old Morse Code, and surprisingly it worked. A new nurse responded by drawing the letters &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; on his chest. He established the communication that could not go behind the walls of his room. Trumbo wrote this anti war novel as a warning, or a scare to people. This bookmakes readers think that death in this case is paradise and that life is hell. And while creating in readers mind this paradox trumbo draws attention to the importance of life and communication, and basically the interaction among people, intellectual interaction. This book is very easy to read and to understand and comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Read this book, and thank your lucky stars you're able to."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"It's been a while since I read this, but when I was browsing and it popped up I thought it worth of a review.

This book really made me think about life and death and war. It is really more about war, it is about censorship. Everyone is censored everyday when you can't speak your mind at work because of your fear of the boss and can't say something to someone at school for fear of getting written up or whatever. This book is a must read for students and teachers alike. Anyone thinking of enrolling into the army or any other government funded operation should read this. It makes you think of those who didn't make it back and are still there. You can't just give them away and make it look nice. War is evil and brutal. I think the world should be able to think as one as it was first intended, but this is just a dream of mine as many will say.

His survival however is such that the only thing he is capable of is thinking. In this war he loses both arms, legs, both eyes, both ears his nose and his jaw. He is a living stump. This young man's name is Joe Bohnam, a regular guy who is drafted in the army at the age of twenty, before his life can really begin. Trumbo makes Joe a very real person. He takes Joe and the readers back to Joe's life before the war by using memories that Joe thinks about in the hospital bed. Memories such as when Joe and his father went camping and fishing and he lost his father's prized fishing pole or when Joe was working at a bakery and a co-worker wanted to leave but couldn't because he didn't want to be disrespectful. With memories of his friends and family Trumbo makes Joe's loss all the more real. Towards the end of this book Joe does everything he can to try to communicate with the &quot;outside&quot; and finally suceeds with his new day nurse who understands that his &quot;siezures&quot; are his attempts at Morse code and that he is indeed aware of his surroundings. When she goes to look for someone who can decipher his code Joe starts thinking about how he can spread the message that war is a bad thing and that if you go to war you could turn out like him, a stump. Trumbo uses moments like these and others to tell the reades how gruesome and unromantic war really is. He uses equations such as &quot;...3,000 tons of bone and flesh, 124,000 pounds of brain matter...&quot; to wake us up to the realities of war. Johnny Got His Gun is an anti-war novel that keeps your attention so you can get to know Joe both before and after the war and how this can happen to anyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"The plot behind this story is incredible, however, I found that Trumbo tainted the story with weak writing. In some instances the book almost seemed to be written in the stream of concious style. I found the prolouge to the story far more frightening than the book itself. This book is scary because the plot is believable. I'm sure this novel only begins to break the surface of the hoorors of war. The film version is much more convincing than the novel but I would check out both. I found both the film and novel hard to find until it was re-released by Bantamn books. Also go out on a limb and check out the Metallica home video &quot;Two of One.&quot; The band made a seriously haunting video composed with chilling clips and movie voice overs intermingled with rehearsal performance. A truly frightening message in a compact format."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I remember Johnny Got His Gun from the first time I read it in 1970.The tragedy of war was real then and it's real again today. I was struck recently by news articles describing the injuries and survivors of this second investment by the US in blood for oil. Of the 10,000 and more US military casulties from Iraq--the coincidence of body armor and an improved medical response is giving us a new wave of victims and personal heros like the one Dalton Trumbo writes about.

I was a smart-mouthed, nationalistic, capitalistic teen-ager (most likely headed for the war-machine since I had no trust fund or college $), when someone literally shoved a tattered copy of this book into my hand and said \\"You HAVE to read this book.\\" I didn't. After repeated questioning about what I thought of it, I read a few pages and was immediately drawn into the plight of the protagonist (or 'character' as I would have called it then). Looking back on life, it was the reading of this book, and the thought processes that it stirred, that spawned the complete alteration of my entire view of life. If you are a teacher, parent or human being, I not only suggest reading this book for yourself but strongly encouraging everyone you know to read it for their benefit as well.BTW, I not only didn't join the war-machine, but my life is still devoted to defeating it.Peace,DanielleP.S. - I see from the picture that the current cover has a peace fingers (\\"back in my day\\", it didn't)...but I don't remember any mention of that symbol (which didn't come into symbolism until well after WWI, which the book is set), and I can't remember the word 'Peace' or the like even mentioned in it....I guess the alternative is just so obviously better that they decided to change the cover.

However, coming from a long line of people who served in the military, it was a reality. God blessed my family enough to spare all of our lives in war (WWI, WWII, VietNam and Iraqi), but we were all aware that things could happen. Things like this did happen and reading this book is a slap in the face. Yes, it's sad, but it is something that is meant to send a message. As for what that message is...well, that's up to the reader. Who cares if he was a so-called Communist. He was a great author and had a way of getting under people's skin. A timeless piece.

Trumbo's imagery is frightening, as is the painful stream-of-conciousness format that forces you into the protagonist's head. It's a surrealistic situation that becomes eerily possible when one is caught up in the book.While a powerful antiwar, antipropiganda novel, many don't realize it's more complex then that. It's almost a pro-war novel, too. The main character questions principles such as freedom, liberty; many of the things that some say separate us from animals. One is not forced to agree with the ideas that the protagonist has, and in the end, the question of pro or anti war is not resolved, but left up to the readers' interpretation.(Trumbo himself is not actually anti-war, suprisingly.)Powerful, moving, thought-provoking and utterly painful.

In the Book, &quot;Johnny Got His Gun,&quot; by Dalton Trumbo, Joe was a man who had survived the war. While laying in the hospital, (he didn't know where he was) he noticed that he had no arms, legs, etc. One thing he later noticed that he did have was the sense of touch. The first half of the book was about his memories of family and friends. The second half of the book got more interesting, because he found out he can use his final sense as a way of communicating. I HAD to know if they understand what he was doing, and if they thought he was crazy or not. The ending of the book was totally different from the way I thought it would end. So, I guess, in a way, this book was a good one, if you like books about the outcome of what a war can do."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Book - 5 stars.This edition - 1 star. We don't need the accompanying essays by Cindy Sheehan or Ron Kovic, and Trumbo's 1970 addition adds nothing.I first read \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" as a teenager in the early 1970s. The edition our school library had was pre-1970 so the only bit of editorial blurb was Trumbo's 1959 reflections. For that, I will remain ever-thankful. This edition, with the unfortunate addition of Trumbo's 1970 addendum (there's a reason there is an argument about \\"director's cuts\\"), Ron Kovic's 1990 regurgitation of his Seventies' schtick, and Cindy Sheehan's \\"I stand for every mother\\" ramblings, undermines a book which continues to need no help.I never forgot the book - even as I entered the military in the late 1970's. I'm ending 30+ years in uniform next month and I can assure you I never took the position that war was glamorous, but unlike Mr. Kovic and Ms. Sheehan, I do believe war is sometimes necessary. And with it being necessary, those in uniform and those who love them will undoubtedly suffer.Left to stand alone, \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" is a perfect recounting of the loss of innocence. But the loss of innocence is not suffered by Joe Bonham (Joe \\"Bon Homme\\"?) alone. Perhaps unwittingly, Trumbo chronicles a horrible realization by an entire generation. Of course, the young Bonham doesn't think the generals (or any of the high muckity-mucks) who sent him off to be wasted care a lick, but the reality of the post-World War I era was that EVERYONE was scarred (though perhaps not as visibly as our protagonist). As a rational work, \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" doesn't stand up to scrutiny. It is personal anecdote and pathos at its best. But anecdote and pathos do not a viable public policy make.And here is where I take issue with the Kovic and Sheehan essays. Their essays are less about the book and more about their personal agendas. According to Kovic and Sheehan, war is always wrong. But that clearly can't be true, even to severe pacifists like Sheehan and Kovic. Are they saying that there are no causes worth fighting for, worth suffering loss for? Even if they continued to say that all war is wrong, I can't believe they actually believe it. Even the title of Sheehan's book (\\"Not One More Mother's Child\\") implies that even she would fight (and I mean this literally) for something. Also, how do Sheehan and Kovic reconcile their view of Trumbo and \\"JGHG\\" with Trumbo's \\"Spartacus? Unless Trumbo was nothing but a shill, even he saw the need to fight (I imagine many of Spartacus' gang didn't feel so great about being wounded, crucified, killed). So which is it? Is war utterly wrong (\\"JGHG\\") or is it sometimes \\"right\\" (\\"Spartacus\\")? The problem here is that they are caught on the horns of a dilemma - they are trapped by their own rhetoric as someone's just cause is always someone else's \\"JGHG.\\" So while I don't deny Ms. Sheehan's or Mr. Kovic's losses or seek to minimize their losses, their positions are nothing more than emotional responses to pain and hardly the stuff we should rally around in creating our public policies on self-defense, international affairs, or war. Their views are heartfelt and honest, but juvenile, naive, and fatal.I guess the publisher felt the essays would draw in more readers. But I sense they \\"turn off\\" more than they \\"turn on\\" because \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" has its own appeal and drawing power across the entire ideological spectrum and Sheehan and Kovic alienate at least one-third of the spectrum. Finally, while my views on war, defense, etc. most likely disagree with those whose ideological beliefs coincide with Mr. Kovic's or Ms. Sheehans, can't we all come to the book for our own reasons, enjoy the book without the addition of essays of questionable value, and in the end agree that fiddling with masterpieces generally does nothing to make them better?"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Written in stream of consciousness style, Johnny is powerful, brutally frank, and almost overwhelming in content.

At this point I remembered that Trumbo had never been a soldier and let alone fought in a war. Soldiers do not think like that, I know because I was in the Army. Any of the soldiers I met who were intelligent and unwounded matured after a while and realized that they did not want to fight in a war for any government or politician.

That said, this is a book that screams to be read in this day and age as it was during any other time of war. Trumbo truly shows the horror that the aftermath of any war can leave behind. He asks the question of what is victory? I can answer that for him:Victory is a mirage. A dream. A word we use to shove aside the piles of skulls and rotting flesh that it took to obtain this 'victory'. Upwards of ten million people were killed the world over during The Great War. Tell me, was there any victor? The French Empire suffered 1.3 million dead. Germany suffered 1.7 million dead. Victory is an illusion. Dead is dead.The most notable component in Trumbo's stlye is the complete lack of punctuation in his novel. It is a very effective literary device he uses to disorient the reader, and it works quite well. At first it is very distracting, but over time you come to admire the courage Trumbo had to release a novel written in such an unconventional manner.Many stories are told simultaneously, all involving the character of Joe Bonham, during the course of the tale. However, we read them the way that the paralyzed and demolished Joe recalls them: randomly. Stories weave in and out of themselves as Joe wanes in and out of consciousness. The narrative is very unique and you never can tell the chronology of Joe's life.I honestly cannot say enough about this book. It really put things in prespective for me, especially in these uncertain times we live in. It just seems that we, this world, is on the brink of something very big... and all we need is a spark.I offer you one guarantee and one warning.

Is he saying that it's alright to be a pacifist during a &quot;romantic&quot; war but not in a non-romantic war? In any case, I found his introduction dismaying.

The Bantam paperback includes a fascinating introduction by Trumbo, written in 1959 with a 1970 addendum. The intro notes that the novel itself was written in 1938 and published just after the start of World War II. An \\"About the Author\\" page at the book's beginning notes that the Colorado-born Trumbo was one of the screenwriters blacklisted during the McCarthy era.\\"Johnny\\" tells the story of Joe Bonham, an American soldier who is horrifically wounded and disabled in World War I. The book is told from Joe's perspective as he struggles to understand and cope with his situation. His mind wanders back and forth between his past, including his war experiences, and his immediate condition. Thus we get a non-chronological but full picture of his complete life so far.Dalton's prose style in this book made a strong impact on me. At times he seems to be assaulting the reader without mercy as he shows us the horror of war and its terrible human cost. But the book also includes passages of hope, triumph, and heartbreaking beauty. Joe is an unforgettable character, and this truly disturbing book remains a profoundly relevant work of American fiction."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"There was a time when war was still noble and ticker tape fell freely on the heads of veterans; our American heroes. There was an era in US history when wars ended with extravagant parades while lovers were reunited after years apart. Dalton Trumbo's chilling novel, Johnny Got His Gun, is about that era--but there are no heroes here. This tale has nothing to do with the romantic homecomings and thrilling American victories. Johnny Got His Gun is about the atrocious reality behind the glitzy Hollywood definition of warfare. Set during World War I, Trumbo's novel tells the story of a brutally injured and disabled man. Isolation has never known such lonliness. The main character, Joe Boeham, describes himself as the &quot;living dead man.&quot; He has no arms, no legs, no face, no tongue to speak, no ears to hear, and no eyes to see. This book is the thoughts of Joe Boeham, slipping in and out of time. He describes his past and you can feel the despair in him as he describes his present; his future. The authour's lack of punctuation gives the reader the notion that Joe Boeham has simply a string of thoughts; beginning nowhere and refusing to end. Boeham's goal in life is merely to live. No, not to breathe, not simply to have a steady heartbeat but rather to find in himself some remaining human characteristic. Lying beneath the surface, Dalton Trumbo incorporates Boeham's opinions regarding the draft, warfare in general, and fighting for a word: democracy. A thought provoking, page-turner, Johnny Got His Gun, is not a book you'll soon forget. This is a masterpiece that has touched the masses helping in the struggle to end the glorification of war."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo (1905-1976) was a fascinating person. A confirmed communist in America's Hollywood, he marched in lockstep wherever the Party ordered. He started screenwriting in 1935 as a confirmed anti-Nazi, but when the Russo-German pact was announced, Trumbo embraced pacifism as a way to keep the U.S. from acting against the Nazis. The book \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" dates to this period.After Hitler double-crossed Stalin, and invaded the Soviet Union, Trumbo dropped his pacifism like a live grenade, and worked on such pro-war movies as \\"A Guy Named Joe\\" and \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.\\" When the icy winds of the Cold War began to blow, Dalton moved back towards pacifism, writing the screenplay for the movie version of \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" in 1971, during the height of the Vietnam War.So, if you want an interesting book, by one of Hollywood's great writers, then read this book."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In the extraordinary novel, Johnny Got His Gun, the author, Dalton Trumbo, reveals the truth about war by illustrating the struggles of a crippled man through the use of stream of consciousness. The story describes a man's journey after he is wounded in battle during WWI. The man, Joe, is a paraplegic who has no arms, no legs, and is deaf, blind and unable to speak. His every day struggles and feelings are revealed to the reader through examples of his past and his inner most thoughts.Dalton's fictional character, Joe Bonham, is exactly what his name states, just a regular \\"Joe.\\" Before the war he had a girlfriend and a family that loved him. He went to school, had summer jobs, and hung out with friends, then came the war. He and all the other \\"Joes\\" had to leave behind the ones they loved and go defend a country that could not defend them. Throughout the novel Joe experiences flashbacks into his past. He recalls a summer when he spent a day performing the most grueling labor of his life. At the end of the day he laid there and felt his body ache in anguish as he said, \\"There was nothing real but pain.\\" He then awakes from his past only to realize his present condition, to which he refers to himself as a \\"basket case.\\" Another memory that he described was that of the last night he spent with Kareen, his girlfriend. They both knew that they might never see one another again, so they spent his last remaining hours of his civilian life together. As he awakes from this perfect moment in time he remembers his disable figure, and prays that Kareen or his family would never see him in that state. Dalton uses Joe's thoughts and feelings to paint a picture of perfection and simplicity before the chaos of war.The most evident form of communication throughout the novel is the use of Joe's thoughts, also known as his stream of consciousness. Dalton uses this method to create a character that you can't help but think is real. His wants and desires are the same as every human being, yet he is unable to accomplish them due to his helpless physical condition. In one scene he is lying in his hospital bed and feels the sun shining through the window on his body. He feels a sense of floating. \\"It's fine Kareen floating here. Lie back more like this like that. Isn't it nice Kareen I love it I love you.\\" This is one of his more pleasant thoughts as compared to the gruesome pictures of pain and fear, shall I mention the rats? I didn't think so. The thoughts of Joe are ones of hope and determination, they leave the reader feeling that if a blind, deaf, and mute cripple can accomplish what he did, the By Golly, so can I! Joe Bohnam may not be a real man, but through reading this novel you realize that there are men in this world just like him. His thoughts are what allow the reader to be able to grasp the true feelings and effects of his character.In conclusion, this book creates a controversial sense of both nationalism and disgust. To know that there are people in our country that are willing to die for a cause and yet some of those very people are injured and left completely incapable of a real life. Trumbo's anti war views are clearly expressed in Johnny Got His Gun. He took a normal guy with a normal life and turned it all upside down to reveal the true effects of war. This intense book will make you cry and it will make you think. Trumbo accomplished his goal with me, I challenge you to read the greatest book that I have ever read and see how it will change your own thoughts."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I read this book first almost 25 years ago, when in my early twenties. Recently, I nagged a friend into reading it, and decided to again read the whole book to determine if the considerable effect it had on me in the 70s was simply a reflection of my age at the time.It wasn't.The book is still as powerful as it ever was. I do not see how anyone can read this and not be profoundly affected. A line in the synopsis on Amazon.com indicates the book was written about World War I. Actually, no specific war is ever mentioned - only the initial publishing date would infer that. Rather than 1939, it could have been written in 1959, 1969, or even 1869 - war is war and only the technology changes.The copy I have has an addendum dated 1970 by the author. Read it - it enforces the notion of the waste of war.If I were a high school English teacher, my seniors would HAVE to read this to graduate. Same if I were a college professor. But even more than that, this should be required reading for ANY politician at the national level.Rereading this book at the age of 46 has not changed my opinion - absolutely no other piece of literature has had such a profound effect on my life.Buy it, read it - then pass it on."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN is extremely raw and realistic. Dalton Trumbo's gut- wrenching look at war is very captivating. The plot reveals a war described as a journey to sacrifice, the road to hell, odyssey of suffering, and as a bloody mess. This book is Dalton Trumbo's best work ever. It is a must-read for anyone who has not seen the trials and tribulations of a war vet. Trumbo gives a multi-faceted in-depth at one man's suffering. The soldier comes out of war remembering the repugnant stench of combat, While traumatized and disabled in the hospital, the smell of memories past and his life's distorted direction haunts him. Even though it was written over thirty years ago his rotted view on war remains relevant today. Even if you have not lost a loved one to war this book will make you feel as if you have. As a person with partial paralysis and muscle atrophy, I identify with the soldier and recognize that Dalton Trumbo is an empathetic genius who captures the rage and feelings in a handicapped war vet's struggle to live life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I loved this book. You might find it interesting because I am a Conservative and should be warning everyone about this type of book. Trumbo really gets to the core, the root of war and the feelings it brings up.

Read this, be changed and be informed."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"In \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\", Dalton Trumbo wrote the most powerful anti-war novel of the modern era. Even though the book was written just after World War I and could never have imagined the horrors of modern warfare, the nightmarish scenario seems too vivid and feasible.Joe Bonham regains consciousness in what he percieves to be a hospital. Gradually, he begins to discover that his limbs are missing. A war wound has also seemingly robbed him of most of his face as well as the senses that are centered there. Left in this nightmarshly dark and silent world, Joe is left to explore his mind. Memories and his reasoning about time pass many of the early pages in the book. Almost accidently, Joe remembers the morse code and tries to utilize it. The problem was finding a nurse or somebody that understood him.When Joe is able to communicate with another human, he realizes that his struggles were futile. He could never be taken from the hospital or allowed to communicate with the outside world as he is the ultimate horror of war. This sets Joe on a tirade of the explotive nature of war in a truthful assessment of the government's use of people in war.\\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" is a staggering achievement not only in literary terms, but because this book has survived for so many years despite its controversial nature. During various times since its original publication, it has spent time out of print. Perhaps this is because the author was willing to make a truthful assessment of war, not as a matter of liberty, but as a waste of human life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"War is war. Innocent civilians die, families are ruined and soldiers are smashed to pieces on the battlefield. This book is gruesome. But it also serves as a valuable tool for those who question the wisdom of blindly following leaders into combat.This book is written with a fury. It is also one of the most horrifying accusations against war. To this end, it is arguably one of the best anti-war books ever written. Mothers and fathers should read this book before allowing their children to march off to war.It is the honesty and sincerity of this World War I tale that allows it to pass the test of time. \\"johnny got his gun,\\" is a book that documents the gross stupidity that accounted for nine million corpses."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I read this book just before I saw the movie of the same name. It was the first book I read and the first movie I attended, both within a few days after leaving Vietnam in Oct. 1971. I was home on convalesant leave from a military hospital. I probably should have waited a while to see something like this, but it had been recommended to me by other soldiers who, like me belonged to the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

I strongly suggest reading it for its excellent style, quality writing and brutal evocation of emotions focused on the &quot;human factor&quot;. Look for a depth that reaches far beyond the concept of war, although a war's aftermath is the media through which the author states his message.

This book really makes you stop and think if all of the fighting and war crimes that have taken place throughout the years were truly necessary because this story only focusses on one man's story so you can only imagine what happend to thousands of other people just like him. &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; is about a young man from Colorado who lives a normal teenage life. He goes out at night with his friends and lived a life just like any other teenager does. He tells us many stories of how he used to work in a bakery with all of the other guys and the different girls he has gone out with and how he moved with his family from Colorado to California. There was always one girl, Kareen, who he had a special place in his heart for but little did he know that once he went away from her he would never be comming back. One day when he was about twenty years old he was called to war and had to go fight. He was not crazy about the idea but he knew that he had to go, so he said his good-bye's and got on the train with all of the other men and they were off to go defend their country. As time went on and he fought he was brutally injured, the next thing that he knew he was in a hospital bed blind, deaf, and had half of a face, no legs and no arms. He did not know if he were dreaming or this was real but soon he realized that this was real and that all of this had happened to him and he was going to have to live with it. Not being able to talk, move, or hear made him realize that all he had left in life was hi brain so he began to think, he soon learned how keep track time in his own way, weather or not it was right there was no way for him to know. He learned how to figure the weight and size of his nurses by the vibrations of their footsteps and he would count the minutes between their visit to bathe him and change his sheets. As time went on he began to realize that he was never going to see any of his family or friends ever again and the fact that they probably did not even know where he was or if he were even still alive. He began to replay his entire life in his head and everything he had ever learned or done and he realized that had he have learned more he would have more to think about and had he paid close attention to everythig he had read he would have been able to re-read everything in his head but by now it was too late he was no longer going to be able to read or write or communicate with the outside world and he had one last idea of how he might be able to communicate with the outside. He thought that maybe if he tapped his head the taps would soon have a meaning and then people would be able to understand him. He thought about how boats would use morse code and SOS for an emergency he thought just maybe if I kept tapping my head I too would be able to communicate with others, so he waited until the nurse came in and he began tapping like crazy but she did not understand she just patted his forhead to try to calm him down than he tried it with a doctor and the doctors would just inject him with drugs to make him drowsy, he thought that their was no hope all that he wanted was to go outside and feel the outside air on what little skin that he had left. Finally his chance came and someone understood him but all they said back was that it was against regulations. This story makes me angry because it is not fair that someone so young has to suffer because all he was doing was fighting for his country. So many innocent people lost their lives to war. in Vietnam, WW1, WW2, and many other battles but going beyond war this book also makes you think about violence. Even though right now there is no war taking place their is violence on the streets and in houses every single day a person is shot here and there and it does not seem as though anyone is making any type of effort to do anything about this problem. Just because there isn't a war going on between countries there is a war going on in your own communities and country and it is about time that someone does something about it because &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; is just a small example of what goes on in everyday life."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Johnny Got His Gun is the most captivating and powerful anti-war novel that I have ever read. It is a story of a young American man by the name of Joe Bonham who is drafted into World War I and gets blown up while he is there. Dalton Trumbo, the author, takes his readers through a breathtaking journey of this one man's struggle with life. Joe becomes quadriplegic and he loses all his senses except touch because of the explosion during the war. How could a man survive in such a world in which he could not communicate. Trumbo uses Joe's mind as a reason for this will to stay alive. He takes us through the memories of his life before he entered the war. From meaningful memories of him and his dad fishing together to nonsense memories of when he worked in a bakery and a man named Jose threw cherry pies on the floor. When Joe awakes from his long sleep, he finds himself lying in a hospital bed hopeless, lifeless. Joe begins to realize that even though he has lost all his limbs he's still a human being with feelings, thoughts, and emotions. He can still think for himself and use his mind in a meaningful manner. As he lays there in his death bed he begins to wonder about time, what day it is or how many days have come and gone. Joe begins to use his mind to find out all the things he wonders. He begins to track the nurses schedules be feeling the vibrations from their footsteps, and then he would count the seconds that passed until the next visit. Trumbo shows us how Joe wants to be able to communicate by using Morse Code. After a long hard struggle his day nurse is finally able to understand that Joe is trying to communicate to her. She responds to him by writing letters on his chest over and over again until he gets the word. His day nurse brings in a doctor to see what Joe is trying to tell them. Trumbo shows that Joe wants to explain to the world that war can do to you and how fighting for nothing is pointless and risking your life for nothing is unthinkable. The doctor then informs Joe that his wishes cannot be granted because it is against regulations. His hopes are shattered, all that he has done to try to communicate and try to stay alive and think about all the good that he has done is gone. Joe's world turns black and fades away. Johnny Got His Gun is the most captivating anti-war novel out there. Dalton Trumbo does an exceptional job in explaining to us the life of a young man who lives as a stump because of the tragedy in the war. He conveys to us how to live with your mind and not your body. This intense and emotional book is filled with vivid language and detailed thoughts that will take your breath away. This is a MUST read for everyone."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"To have no arms or legs, no ears, eyes, mouth, nose. No way of interacting with the outside world. The horror of being trapped eternally inside your own head without any chance of escape is the engine that propels Dalton Trumbo's brilliant tirade against the forces that lead us to destroy one another. The images evoked in this novel will keep you up nights, and may even change your outlook on life. It inspired this reader to seek, and I'm happy to say successfully obtain, a discharge from the armed services as a conscientious objector. An awesome and terrifying novel. Five stars."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"According to Dalton Trumbo in Johnny Got His Gun: Absolutely nothing.Only a member of such an infamous and controversial group as the Hollywood Ten could have written such an infamous and controversial novel as Johnny Got His Gun. The book does not rely solely on shock value to produce its effects as countless other controversial novels do; instead, it actually induces brain activity and causes the reader to question his or her views on war, morality, and right and wrong.Having written over 58 screenplays and novels, one would assume that Dalton Trumbo would be a fairly common household name. In actuality, it is not, which may be partly due to the fact that he was blacklisted in 1950 and spent 11 months in prison, or because he moved to Mexico and wrote 30 scripts under pseudonyms. Whatever the reason may be, Trumbo is not well known. However, Johnny Got His Gun-Trumbo's most popular novel that was first published two days after World War 2 began-deserves to be drilled into the impressionable minds of high schoolers and other such individuals the world over.A harrowing anti-war novel, Johnny Got His Gun tells the tale of Joe Bonham, an American soldier who drifts in and out of consciousness so repeatedly it's almost indistinguishable whether or not he's hallucinating at any given moment. Frequently throughout the book, the reader and Joe are equally confused with not only themselves but with each other. This allows for an interesting trip, to say the least. An example of a standard scene from the book is Jesus walking through the desert from Tucson and then later perching on top of a speeding locomotive, screaming like a train whistle.To say the book is well written would be a flagrant lie. There is only one comma in the entire novel; the book is made up of thousands of run-on sentences, amounting to an English professor's nightmare. However, it makes perfect sense why the book is written in this particular style. Thoughts, like the words in Trumbo's novel, flow freely through the stream of consciousness. There often is no distinguishable beginning or end of Joe's train of thought, and the middle usually does not exist. One must become accustomed to this style, or he or she will not be able to get past the first page.Although understanding the style of the book is hard to overcome, it is well worth the task. Underneath all the run-ons and gibberish is a truthful, enduring message. The book illustrates that war is indeed hell and should be avoided at all costs. It questions the basic values that the majority of Americans possess, such as the love of freedom, patriotism, and the need to defend democracy. Johnny Got His Gun also forces one to look inside oneself; what one finds there might be more hideous than Joe himself.So what is war good for? Trumbo fiercely defends his opinion in Johnny Got His Gun, and one will find it extremely difficult to disagree."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I didn't know who Dalton Trumbo was until I read the book, he was accused as a communist, he was an idealist, and he was against war in any possible way. All that you see in TV commercials about joining the army for defending your country and all that bull, they don't prepare you for the things that you have to confront, the losses, the deaths,etc. Ask any veteran if the war was worth it in any way. The most incredible aspect about this book is that you can apply it any given time, for example the war on Iraq. It's heartbreaking how many lives had been lost, how many families have been torn apart, how many men under 25 have died, leaving their wives with their little babies, for what?????? Read the book and you'll see beyond what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"It's that time of year again!That time of year when so many of us become stressed out trying todecide what would be an appropriate gift. One gift I am giving thisyear is a book that has been a favorite of mine since I first read itas a freshman in HS. It is one of the most compelling books everwritten and its theme is very appropriate for these times. The bookis entitled \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" by Dalton Trumbo.For those of you who have never read the book, it is a raw, riveting,gut-wrenching, anti-war novel that should be required reading foranyone advocating war with Iraq. This is an emotional book, whichputs the reader face to face with the human cost of war. It does sowithout any of the slickness which we have come to expect fromsources such as CNN, Newsweek or Time - all of which portray apossible war with Iraq in cold, detached, almost clinical terms. Therealities of war are explored in this book minus the buzzwords, whichare used today to elicit our unquestioning support for a war. Wordslike \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" \\"regimechange\\" \\"terrorism\\" \\"protect our way of life\\" areall absent fromthis book.This is the story of Joe, \\"average American\\" Bonham and howhis lifewas forever changed by the ravages of the war he was asked to go offand fight and did without question. The book is narrated by Joe andstarts with a description of his life before the war. A rich life,which was, filled with family and friends as well a girlfriend. Likewe all do, he had plans and dreams for his future. Then he wasasked to go off and fight in order to \\"make the world safe fordemocracy\\". The publisher writes:\\"This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safefordemocracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered--not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruinedlives...This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takesthe easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible,uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome...but so is war.\\"How chilling that paragraph becomes when you inject today'scurrentbuzzwords into that paragraph:\\"This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safefrom terrorists and weapons of mass destruction. And if the worldwas made safe from terrorists with their weapons of mass destruction,then nothing else mattered---not the millions of dead bodies, nor thethousands of ruined lives, not even our civil liberties.\\"An excerpt from the book reads:\\"They were always fighting for something, the bastards...if theyweren't fighting for liberty they were fighting for independence ordemocracy or freedom or decency or honor or their native land orsomething else that didn't mean anything...the most important thing is your life little guys. You're worth nothing dead except for speeches. Don't let them kid you anymore. Pay no attention when theytap you on the shoulder and say come along we've got to fight forliberty or whatever their word is there's always a word.\\"Those four sentences from this powerful book make crystal clear in away nothing else ever has, why we as citizens, have an obligation todemand from our leaders that the case for war be made clearly andhonestly. We are entitled to know, minus the buzzwords, what we arefighting for, what the desired outcome is and what the cost will be.By reading this book you will come to understand that when soldiersdie in a war they are not \\"thinking of democracy and freedom andliberty and honor and of the safety of home and the Stars and Stripesforever.\\" The loss of their lives and their families are probablyfirst and foremost in their thoughts as they face death in a foreignland amongst strangers.The pages inside of this little book have the power to change thehearts and minds of people regarding war. They have the power tomake people pay closer attention to the events unfolding around usand to demand better from those who would lead us into war. Ibelieve it has the power to save lives. If it can do that, thenthis little book will be the most important gift I will ever give.Elizabeth PresleyModerator&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"I first read Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun in 1971 when I was 16. The memory of that reading experience remains seared in my consciousness. Trumbo was a gifted and inspired writer; his accomplishments as a Hollywood movie script writer are a testament to his immense talent.However, anyone who picks up this novel, especially teachers who present this powerful piece of fiction to young readers, need to be aware that Trumbo was a Communist. The base-ulterior motive for writing Johnny Got His Gun was to support the insidious and despicable non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and Stalin's USSR. The Communist Party line (scripted by Stalin) was to support the alliance with Nazi Germany. It is ironic that this much esteemed novel was in fact written to manipulate American public opinion against U.S. intervention in WWII even as Nazi bombs were raining down on England. Only after Hitler's surprise invasion of the the Soviet Union did Communists, and that includes Trumbo, suddenly change their collective 'pacifist' tune. Suddenly the war against Hitler was a righteous cause.Now I realize Trumbo remains a popular figure and perhaps he was a highminded idealist but his political ideals led him to support one of the 20th Century's most sinister villians: Stalin. I was an impressible teenager when I first read this novel in 1971. But the novel is not only didactic and manipulative, it is also simplistic in its attitude towards war. As George Orwell (who not only witnessed firsthand, but managed to survive Stalin's purges in Spain)stated in 1941, \\"The choice before human beings is not between good and evil but between two evils. You can let the Nazis rule the world; that is evil; or you can overthrow them by war, which is also evil . . .\\"Tolstoy's War and Peace, Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, the Civil War stories of Ambrose Bierce, Orwell's Homeage to Catalonia,and Joe Heller's Catch-22 are so much more credible in their depiction of the human experience with war."},{"Title":"Johnny Got His Gun (A Bantam Windstone Book)","review":"Dalton Trumbo is the most famous member of a group known as the Hollywood Ten, writers and directors who were blacklisted during the crazed days of the McCarthy Era. Yet, it is not his decades of writing Academy Award winning screenplays that has secured his reputation as a writer and spokesman for generations. It is his anti-war novel, Johnny Got His Gun, the epic story of a World War One soldier who lies, half-dead and senseless in an army hospital confronting the bleakest of futures. This book was so powerful that it was widely banned in the run up to World War Two-the author himself pulled the novel from publication because he did not want it to influence the outcome of the war. It is simply the greatest anti-war novel ever written. It is not an easy book to read and readers should know, going in, that they will come away from the story, sickened, repulsed, and very, very angry.

Fabozzi Series)","review":"This volume like so many Fabozzi-edited books is rather hit and miss in providing useful information. I did like the book enough to give it three stars because I found it to be a good basic refresher on some topics that I as a practioner haven't dealt with directly in some time and the case examples helpful in reinforcing the ideas. Unfortunately since each chapter is written by a different practioner who is focusing on their area of expertise, the chapters usually do not complement each other sufficiently to give a novice a full understanding of a topic. This book like most of its Fabozzi kin runs the gamut with a couple basic financial statement analysis chapters followed by a couple chapters covering high-yield bonds, a couple more covering emerging market debt, one on municipal debt and then 9 chapters covering the various ABS/MBS markets as well as related prepayment/default analysis. The book then has 18 rather brief case studies relating to the topics covered. The case studies tend to be qualitative and none provides a full blown financial examination. This is a book best checked out of a university library because it is unlikely to be a reference volume that one would repeatedly turn to for guidance. If you are looking for in-depth coverage of credit analysis topics, the Fabozzi series has much better tomes covering municipal bonds and MBS/ABS securities. SalomonSmithBarney have their name on a good MBS/ABS book as well. White,Sondhi&Fried's volume on basic financial statement analysis is thorough and used in the CFA program.

As has been noted by others, the book recounts the relationship between Edmund Gosse and his father, a member of the Christian sect generally known as Plymouth Brethren, but who was also a member of the Royal Society and one of the foremost marine biologists of his time. The narrative tends to break down into a number of definite segments: the author's birth until the death of his mother; life with his father until the time of the publishing of Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES; the move of the Gosses to the coast of England; and young Gosse's schooling and gradual growth away from the religious teachings and expectations he had received from his parents.A number of powerful impressions evolve over the course of the telling. First and foremost, one is left with an impression of how overwhelmingly Gosse's childhood was stripped of nearly all fun by his parents' puritanical and stern religion. Gosse's father is presented not as a cruel, vicious, and hypocritical. Instead, he is shown as a caring parent, a completely earnest practitioner of his religion, but fanatically concerned to eliminate all activities that do not lead to increased religious devotion and moral seriousness. Unfortunately, this resulted for Gosse in a childhood from which all possibility of play and fun and delight had been eliminated. Near the end of the book, I was left wondering if Gosse would have been inclined to leave Christianity if he had just had more fun as a kid.The section of the book dealing with his father's reaction to Darwin's ORIGIN OF SPECIES was for me the most interesting part of the book. His father's scientific standing was such that Darwin actually contacted him before the publication of his theories, and asked his response. Gosse notes that his father instantly understood that the scientific evidence clearly supported Darwin's theory. His reading of Genesis, however, indicated to him that the world was created in six days, which precluded the scenario articulated by Darwin. He therefore concluded that god created the earth in six days, but in so doing implanted fossils and geologic strata into the earth. In this way, his father was able to explain both the apparent evidence for eons long development of the earth and homo sapiens and yet retain his belief in the belief that Genesis taught a six day literal creation.There are any of a number of reasons to read this work. It is a classic autobiography, an important source for one response to the reception of Darwin, and a magnificent evocation of puritanical religious life during the Victorian age. Most of all, it is a disturbing account of the distortive effect that intolerant and narrow-minded religious upbringing can have on an individual."},{"Title":"Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Father and Son is the story of two men, Edmund Gosse (the writer) and his father, Philip Gosse. Philip was a biologist, a contemporary of Charles Darwin. The story covers a period of about twenty years, from 1849 to about 1870, during which Edmund grew from infancy to university student. Edmund Gosse became a well-known English man of letters. Among his works is a biography of his father.Speaking of his parents' faith, he writes ...They called themselves 'the Brethren', simply; a title enlarged by the world outside into 'Plymouth Brethren'.Given that there is no mention of John Darby in the book, and that the book follows the 1848-49 schism that resulted in open and exclusive brethren, and that the assemblies described in the book seem essentially autonomous, I assume Gosse is referring to the 'open brethren' when he speaks of Plymouth Brethren.Readers raised among any of the groups that have evolved from the Brethren groups that began in Dublin in the 1820's will find much familiar material.The book is worth reading at least twice. I've just read it again after owning it for a year and am struck again at how well he describes life among the brethren and the incredible stress parents can put upon their children in the name of faith."},{"Title":"Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"There are few works of autobiography that lay bare the author's soul as convincingly and seeringly as this. In an astonishing tour de force Edmund Gosse, by then a substantial Edwardian homme des lettres, remembers his childhood and adolescence in his father's house and his indoctrination into a Victorian, evangelical, creationist, scientific, wilfully unliterary way of life and his growth out of this via Shakespeare, Marlowe and some decidedly morbid poems. What is so astounding about this book is the kindness with which Gosse remembers his past which is always present and never tempered with dishonesty. There are moments when we cannot but find fault with Gosse senior (when he writes to his son in London invoking his mother's memory to try and force him back to the brethren) but with the Edmund Gosse painting so loving a picture of him we could never see him as, for example, the father of Samuel Butler's &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; (a great and loosely autobiographical novel which is often metioned alongside &quot;Father and Son&quot; as expressing the same painful differences between the evagelical Victorians and their children) - that is desicated, corrupted, and malicious. There is one killingly funny moment where Edmund Gosse reads from Marlowe's &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; to his stepmother and the idea of the straight laced little saint reading aloud about Leander &quot;His bodie was as straight as Circes wand,/ Jove might have sipt out Nectar from his hand./ Even as delicious meat is to the tast,/ So was his necke in touching, and surpast/ The white of Pelops shoulder.&quot; to the god fearing wife of his god fearing father, minister to the brethren, and not expecting a strange reaction, is as bizarre as it is amusing. A most endearingly human work most warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"Edmund Gosse's FATHER AND SON is legitimately considered one of the highpoints of Victorian autobiography. As has been noted by others, the book recounts the relationship between Edmund Gosse and his father, a member of the Christian sect generally known as Plymouth Brethren, but who was also a member of the Royal Society and one of the foremost marine biologists of his time. The narrative tends to break down into a number of definite segments: the author's birth until the death of his mother; life with his father until the time of the publishing of Darwin's THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES; the move of the Gosses to the coast of England; and young Gosse's schooling and gradual growth away from the religious teachings and expectations he had received from his parents.A number of powerful impressions evolve over the course of the telling. First and foremost, one is left with an impression of how overwhelmingly Gosse's childhood was stripped of nearly all fun by his parents' puritanical and stern religion. Gosse's father is presented not as a cruel, vicious, and hypocritical. Instead, he is shown as a caring parent, a completely earnest practitioner of his religion, but fanatically concerned to eliminate all activities that do not lead to increased religious devotion and moral seriousness. Unfortunately, this resulted for Gosse in a childhood from which all possibility of play and fun and delight had been eliminated. Near the end of the book, I was left wondering if Gosse would have been inclined to leave Christianity if he had just had more fun as a kid.The section of the book dealing with his father's reaction to Darwin's ORIGIN OF SPECIES was for me the most interesting part of the book. His father's scientific standing was such that Darwin actually contacted him before the publication of his theories, and asked his response. Gosse notes that his father instantly understood that the scientific evidence clearly supported Darwin's theory. His reading of Genesis, however, indicated to him that the world was created in six days, which precluded the scenario articulated by Darwin. He therefore concluded that god created the earth in six days, but in so doing implanted fossils and geologic strata into the earth. In this way, his father was able to explain both the apparent evidence for eons long development of the earth and homo sapiens and yet retain his belief in the belief that Genesis taught a six day literal creation.There are any of a number of reasons to read this work. It is a classic autobiography, an important source for one response to the reception of Darwin, and a magnificent evocation of puritanical religious life during the Victorian age. Most of all, it is a disturbing account of the distortive effect that intolerant and narrow-minded religious upbringing can have on an individual."},{"Title":"Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"In 1907, this \\"study of two temperaments\\" dramatized religious convention opposed to rational modernism. Edmund's father, Philip Henry Gosse, ran a Plymouth Brethren household. His wife died of cancer, and the son movingly documents her own demise, drawing from her diary, and enriched by his own recollections. After she dies, at twilight, he seeks his father's embrace: \\"I used to turn my face up to his, patiently and wonderingly, while the large, unwilling tears gathered in the corners of his eyelids.\\" While the severity of his parents' attitudes has been challenged by scholars of Edmund's dramatic and eloquent narrative, the power of the clash of tradition and innovation at intimate levels during the mid-nineteenth century's encounter with Darwin's revolutionary theory can be felt.As a naturalist, Philip tried to reconcile the new doctrine, arguing in the book \\"Omphalos\\" that as Adam added a navel thanks to God's intervention, so His plan allowed for fossils embedded to look as if a more antiquated cosmos had been intended from the beginning. Philip thought his argument would reconcile atheists and believers, but he was shattered when his book met with dismissal and was ignored. He popularized the Devon tide pools, and Edmund recalls with bittersweet detail the wonders that the shores once held undisturbed in his youth--until his father's studies and illustrations convinced many others to visit the beaches, and to ruin the fragile ecosystem irreparably.Therefore, in its environmental as well as creationist themes, you can see the relevance a century later of this account. He describes the Victorian conventional mindset well. \\"People would, for instance, go on living over a cess-pool. working themselves up in an agony to discover how they had incurred the displeasure of the Lord, but never moving away.\\" He also engagingly portrays the shift to an \\"extreme\\" Puritan and fundamentalist sensibility as he and his father--soon with a stepmother--live in a hamlet in Devonshire. There, away from the city, the foibles of trust in those deemed upright and righteous turns sad, or subtly satirical. A spinning top or a plum pudding, the word \\"Carmine\\" all loom large in the young child's mind, and can terrorize as deviations from the approved mentality.While he's precociously allowed to be baptized before adulthood after being grilled by the elders, he finds the \\"mechanical address\\" and empty language of his prayers a telling revelation. Like a pot that surrounds an already growing plant, he feels as if he's trapped, and tries to grow up around the suppressing weight of the pattern imposed. He grows apart from the faith of his father, and in the final section breaks away as a maturing man from Philip. \\"The incidents of human life upon the road to glory were less than nothing to him,\\" a man of belief.Seeking a truer criterion of \\"moral justice\\" than that of the Christian Judge, Edmund refuses to sanction an Almighty who would condemn millions for \\"a purely intellectual error of comprehension.\\" So, individualism, the ability to think for himself, takes control. He refuses to compromise, and no truce, he concludes, could have been acceptable between son and father.

This novel has stood the test of time, and continues to be greatly admired and appreciated as a classic piece of literature. Perhaps, this is due to the book's gritty characters that portray the struggle between romanticism and realism. This epic is lived out on the pages of Turgenev's classic in the form of two conflicting generations; between the younger and older. But the understory will come in the form of two friends, whose ideas will clash when old sentiments are trampled upon. This will be expressed in the departure of Arkady from his nihilistic mentor Bazarov. In this paper, I aim to show that (in the case of Arkady and Bazarov) friendships are not as important as family, and fondness is not really love. I will make this evident by showing that Arkady's departure from Bazarov comes as a result of his bond to his family, and as a result of his love for a woman.My first agenda in writing this paper will be to provide some context that leads us into the main thrust of the book. Then, I will examine Arkady's slow departure from Bazarov's nihilism by showing points in the book where Arkady begins to break from Bazarov. I will conclude with a final assessment of this break along with a summary of the storyline.From the narrator's description of Arkady's childhood, one can only imagine that Arkady's early years were filled with happiness. Arkady would have grown up witnessing (and partaking of) the love with which his father had toward his mother. The depiction of this love is felt deeply when the narrator states, \\"The young couple lived very happily and peacefully; they were scarcely ever apart; they read together, sang and played duets together on the piano\\" (Turgenev 4). The narrator goes on to describe Arkady as having grown up, \\"...in the same happy and peaceful way\\" (Turgenev 5).At first glance, Arkady still appears to bare the relics of a happy and fun loving childhood. With his young, beardless, and dusty boyish face he greets his father Nikolai with the endearing title of Daddy. But something has changed with this young boy. Perhaps, this is the very change that boys go through when they are no longer boys; when they are somewhere in between manhood and childhood; when they are searching for an identity of their own, but unsure of what this identity is supposed to look like. This becomes evident in the narrator's description of Arkady, when he shares, \\"...he seemed a little confused, a little timid\\" (Turgenev 6).Regardless, there can be little doubt that Arkady is very fond of his relatives. For certain, he tries to hide it, but the narrator exposes his secret when he says of Arkady, \\"...in spite of the genuine, almost childish delight filling his heart, wanted as soon as possible to turn the conversation from the emotional into a commonplace channel\\" (Turgenev 8). But after having discovered how long his loving father waited for him to return, Arkady's true feelings burst out as he \\"...turned round quickly to his father, and gave him a sounding kiss on the cheek\\" (Turgenev 8).There is no doubt that Arkady loves his father. He is also very fond of his uncle Pavel as well. He seems to hold a very high view of his uncle and describes him to Bazarov by saying, \\"He was a great swell in his own day, you know...He was very handsome, you know, used to turn all the women's heads\\" (Turgenev 15). Now, although Arkady admires the achievements of his uncle, he also feels sorry for him. The introduction to this sentiment comes in the Arkady's words to Bazarov, when he defends his uncle by replying, \\"You will see he's not the sort of man you fancy. He deserves pity rather than ridicule.\\" (Turgenev 25)As far as Arkady's view of Bazarov is concerned, one could make the case that (at the opening of this book) Arkady borders near the point of idolatry in his admiration of his teacher. He opens up to his father by pleading, \\"Please, Dad, make much of him. I can't tell you how I prize his friendship.\\" (Turgenev 8) He goes on to describe Bazarov to his father by saying, \\"His chief subject is natural science. But he knows everything.\\" (Turgenev 8)Throughout the opening chapters of the book, Arkady continually jumps at opportunities to try and please Bazarov and earn his approval. This is demonstrated when Bazarov (appearing to want to interrupt Nikolai's attempt to recite a poem) yells to Arkady, \\"Will you have a cigar?\\"(Turgenev 12) Arkady (perhaps not wanting to disappoint his idol) affirms the invitation by lighting the black cigar, causing his father to turn away because of the \\"...strong and pungent odor of cheap tobacco...\\" (Turgenev 12)Again, Arkady's admiration for his new mentor is affirmed in his description of Bazarov - when he says proudly to his uncle and father, \\"A nihilist is a man who does not bow down before any authority, who does not take any principle on faith, whatever reverence that principle may be enshrined in\\" (Turgenev 21). In reading these words, one can almost sense the ooze of delight that Arkady exuded in his description of his nihilistic companion.Now although it is certain that Arkady was very fond of Bazarov, and at times appeared to worship the ground he walked on, this relationship would slowly begin to morph into something altogether different. The causes of this change will come when Bazarov's ideology grinds into Arkady's sentimental values. These values include his family and his budding love for Katya. On top of this, Arkady will eventually become repulsed by Bazarov's blearing self-conceit. All this will lead to a less than stellar split of the two, as Bazarov will acknowledge correctly that they have become \\"...tired of each other\\" (Turgenev 163).The tension begins because of Arkady's family, particularly his uncle. Bazarov very much dislikes Arkady's uncle Pavel and makes no scruples to hide it. Ironically, being a surgeon, Bazarov cuts into their friendship with a small incision by stating, \\"Your uncle's a queer fish...\\" (Turgenev 15). He then goes on to make fun of Pavel by stating that Pavel's aristocratic upkeep of his hygiene is ridiculous. Arkady responds with, \\"Perhaps it is; but he's a splendid man, really\\" (Turgenev 16). After this, Bazarov goes on to condescend to Arkady's sentiments toward his father when he says, \\"But your father's a capital fellow. He wastes his time reading poetry, and doesn't know much about farming, but he's a good-hearted fellow\\" (Turgenev 16). Arkady responds by saying, \\"My father's a man in a thousand\\" (Turgenev 17). This does not stop Bazarov from undermining Nicolai and Pavel's \\"old idealists\\" ways.The tension continues to mount after Bazarov and Arkady's uncle (Pavel) get into a heated discussion at the breakfast table one morning. After a hot exchange of words, Pavel leaves the table feeling insulted by Bazarov. Arkady, recognizing this, says to Bazarov, \\"I must say, Yevgeny (Bazarov), you weren't nice to him...You have hurt his feelings\\" (Turgenev 25). Arkady then goes on to tell Bazarov about Pavel's story of heart break and rejection. He concludes by defending his uncle by saying, \\"So you see, Yevgeny...how unjustly you judge of my uncle! To say nothing of his having more than once helped my father out of difficulties, given him all his money...he's glad to help anyone, among other things he always sticks up for the peasants... his heart is very good. And he's far from being stupid... In short, he's profoundly unhappy, believe me; it's a sin to despise him\\" (Turgenev 30). Although this exchange was a significant departure from Arkady's standard approach toward Bazarov, it would only be the beginning of his departure from Bazarov's crude ways.The break between these two will become even more evident as Arkady starts to fall in love. The case could be made for Arkady first falling in love (or at least being infatuated) with Madame Odintsova. Later, Arkady will sense that Madame Odintsova has taken an interest in Bazarov. This becomes evident to Arkady when Madame Odintsova takes Bazarov away, and placates Arkady by having her younger sister Katya entertain him with music. It is here that the narrator uncovers Arkady's true sentiments when he says, \\"Katya went unwillingly to the piano; and Arkady, though he certainly was fond of music, unwillingly followed her; it seemed to him that Madame Odintsova was sending him away, and already, like every young man at his age, he felt a vague and oppressive emotion surging up in his heart, like the forebodings of love\\" (Turgenev 79). Soon enough, love will begin to pull Arkady away from his nihilistic friend, but it will not be his love for Madame Odintsova that does this, but rather, his love for her younger sister Katya.As a means of consoling himself over his unreturned affection for Madame Odintsova, Arkady began to spend more time with Katya. At one point the narrator reveals hints of common interest between the two of them when he states, \\"Katya adored nature, and Arkady loved it, though he did not dare to acknowledge it\\" (Turgenev 84). Although he was afraid to admit it, the signs of his departure from nihilism were evident. This becomes even more apparent in contrast to the narrator's description of Bazarov, who was \\"...rather indifferent to the beauties of nature\\" (Turgenev 84). It is during this time that Arkady begins to grow distant from Bazarov, as each would spend significant time with the sisters; Bazarov with Madam Odintsova, and Arkady with Katya.It was near the end of this time, that Arkady gained an awareness of Bazarov's devilish conceit. It appeared that in a moment of self-awareness, Arkady saw what he had been blinded to all along. Perhaps in a memory flash, Arkady remembered when his uncle Pavel was having a sharp dispute with Bazarov in his presence. Pavel, hitting on Bazarov's conceit and pride began to address the shortcomings of the younger generation. In doing so, Pavel said to Bazarov, \\"First a pride almost Satanic, then ridicule--that, that's what it is attracts the young, that's what gains an ascendancy over the inexperienced hearts of boys! Here's one of them sitting beside you, (speaking of Arkady) ready to worship the ground under your feet. Look at him!\\" (Turgenev 50). At this, perhaps ashamed of his idolatrous admiration for Bazarov, the narrator tells us that \\"Arkady turned away and frowned\\" (Turgenev 50).Perhaps it was this very instance that shot into Arkady's mind when Bazarov made an incredible claim. Speaking about the sudden appearance of Sitnikov, Arkady asks, \\"What the devil made that fool of a Sitnikov turn up here?\\" (Turgenev 101). Sitnikov, is another admirer and disciple of Bazarov. He is a younger man who (sort of foolishly) attaches himself to every popular cause. In response to Arkady's remark, Bazarov replies, \\"You're still a fool, my boy, I see. Sitnikovs are indispensable to us. Do you understand? I need dolts like him. It's not for the gods to bake bricks!\\" (Turgenev 101). In this one sweeping statement, Arkady sees himself in Sitnikov, and makes an estimate of Bazarov's impression of him. We see this in the following exchange, \\"...in a flash all the fathomless depths of Bazarov's conceit dawned upon him. Are you and I gods then? At least, you're a god; am not I a dolt then?\\" (Turgenev 101). Bazarov replies to Arkady with an affirming, \\"Yes...you're still a fool.\\" (Turgenev 101). At this moment, Arkady seems to realize that Bazarov sees himself as superior to him in every way. He also realizes that perhaps, he has allowed himself to become just another follower of the master, as his uncle Pavel had so keenly perceived. Although this is a profound moment in the rupture of their ties, it would take a little more to make the break complete.The last wedge driven into the stump of their friendship comes when Bazarov (irritated by Arkady's likeness to his uncle) calls Pavel an imbecile. The following exchange traces out this inflamed conversation which almost ends in a physical fight. In response to Bazarov, Arkady replies, \\"What did you call Pavel Petrovitch?\\" (Turgenev 122). Bazarov answers, \\"I called him, very justly, an imbecile\\" (Turgenev 122). Arkady, heart stricken states, \\"But this is unbearable!\\" (Turgenev 122). Bazarov shot back with, \\"Aha! Family feeling spoke there...I've noticed how obstinately it sticks to people\\" (Turgenev 122). After a short discourse, Arkady, fed up with Bazarov's insults states, \\"Don't, please, Yevgeny; we shall really quarrel at last\\" (Turgenev 122). After some threatening words from Bazarov, the heated exchanged is cooled by the sudden appearance of Bazarov's father. At this point, the reader begins to notice that the fight was not the only thing quenched that day. Here, it becomes evident that blood is thicker than water, as Arkady's love for his family runs deeper than his admiration for his friend. Now, although this is a serious blow to any lasting remnants of intimacy between the two friends, we will see that Arkady's love for a girl will ultimately be the deciding factor.Like magnetism, love is a force that can attract and repel. It will be Arkady's full flourishing love for Katya that will ultimately cause him to grow tired of Bazarov's company. We read of this when the narrator states, \\"...in former days he would simply have shrugged his shoulders if anyone had told him that he could ever feel dull under the same roof as Bazarov--and that roof his father's! But he actually was dull and longed to get away\\" (Turgenev 133). His release will come in the form of some letters that his father Nikolai retained from Madame Odintsova and Katya's deceased mother. These letters will provide Arkady the excuse to go back to their house and spend time with them, and hence get away from Bazarov.It is during this time that Arkady's love for Katya is fully disclosed in a moment of nervous, yet passionate revelation. One day, Arkady reveals his heart to Katya and later asks for her hand in marriage. She responds in the affirmative, which is the catalyst to Arkady's break from his nihilistic views of marriage and hence, from Bazarov. The final exchange comes as Bazarov, broken over his love for and rejection from Madame Odintsova, gives condescending approval to the marriage by saying to Arkady, \\"Well, it's a capital thing\\" (Turgenev 172). Arkady, baffled by his former mentor's response says, \\"...why are you a humbug yourself, calling it \`a capital thing,' as though I didn't know your opinion of marriage?\\" (Turgenev 172).The separation is made final as Bazarov describes why they must part ways. In short phrases (describing the life of a nihilist) Bazarov places Arkady into a category other than himself. The divorce of ideas is finalized in this last exchange. But sentiments between the two are not all together extinguished. In the end, although Arkady does not seem to retain a nihilistic perspective on life, he still retains a fondness for his friend Bazarov. The reader will be moved to sadness as the parting of these two friends comes swiftly as they both go their separate ways.In this paper I have traced out the steady decline in the bond between two friends. We have seen that the bond was weakened by Arkady's love for his family, and later severed by his love for Katya. Although the two retain a sense of friendship at the end, Arkady has distinctly departed from Bazarov in many ways. By the end of the book, it appears that the once confused and timid Arkady - finally finds out who he is as a man. And who he is as a man, cannot be separated from who he is as a son, and as nephew, and as a husband. And for this reason, by necessity, he had to separate from the nihilist. So as can be readily seen from the preponderance of evidence, blood truly is thicker than water."},{"Title":"Father and Son: A Study of Two Temperaments (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)","review":"&quot;Father and Son&quot; is widely reckoned as the most brilliant work of Edmund Gosse whose delicate use of English, no doubt, partly accounted for his literary success. To attach too much literary importance to the book may, however, obscure its main purpose, which is an attempt of the writer to vindicate his attitude towards his father. The attempt failed, to put it mildly.Gosse lived in an age when people held very high standard of propriety; any departure from rules of behaviour would be seen as an offence. But conflicts between fathers and sons, or between their respective thoughts, are as common nowadays as they were in ancient times. Gosse revealed in his book the differences between his father and himself mainly in their beliefs as to how life should be lived. The book caused a sensation upon release not because of the revelation but because of the daring publication of the differences - Gosse did as people at that time were not bold enough to do. As such differences were common, though they might not be voiced, many people shared the writer's experience and the book became instantly popular.Nevertheless, to explain the success of the book in so few words as those said above will not do justice to Gosse. It is, in Bernard Shaw's words, one of those immortal pages in English literature. These might be extravagant words. Even so, Gosse, indeed, earned himself a place in English literature by such a bold attempt as mentioned earlier. But the attempt need not have been made - two men of widely different ages look at each other from different angles; the gap between them is only natural; it need not be alluded to nor elucidated. Any attempt which need not have been made cannot succeed."},{"Title":"The Joy of Drumming: Drums & Percussion Instruments from Around the World","review":"This book is a fine introduction to the world of drums and Rhythms.Part one deals in general with drums and rhythms and how they affect us in many ways, part two is a small encyclopedia of drums and part three deals with other sounding instruments that are often used in rhythmic music, there is one mistake there though, on page 117 he describes a Bullroarer, but what he is descriping is a Whirlie, for a good description of a bullroarer see Mickey Harts book Planet Drum and you can hear a nice sample of how a Bullroarer sounds on the first track of Santanas Borboletta, played by Airto Moreira, for an example of how a Whirlie sound see the book and the CD Gravikords, Whirlies and Pyrophones by Bart Hopkins, and listen to the track by Sarah Hopkins, you can check both of these out on the sound samples on Amazon.Of course this is a minor point but still I wanted to point it out.In part four he deals with rhythm basics, the three, four and five beat pulse and gives some exercices for rhythmic independence, polyrhythms and the claveThen in part five he gives examples of some rhythms mainly from Africa and Cuba and some tips on how to play the conga and the shekere.As said this is a good introduction to the world of drumming and rhythms and if you go through this book you are well on your way to being , at least a decent drummer with some good knowledge of the basic principles of rhythm.Also recomended are Rhythm book by Alan Dworsky, Peter Magadini, Sule Greg Vilson, Reinhart Flatischler and videos by Kalani, Paulo Mattioli, Alex Acuna and Airto Moreira."},{"Title":"A Rich Young Man, Saint Anthony of Padua","review":"Yes, I know this is an older book, but get it anyway.The writing is sprightly and fast-paced, and gives you a truly amazing glimpse of a saint.St Anthony of Padua was not just \\"A Rich Young Man\\", his family was the richest and most powerful in Portugal. He stood to inherit a tremendous amount of land and power from his father, and he was not just the first born, but the only child.It would not be easy, given his station, to choose to become a priest. Yet that's what Anthony did by entering a monastery, and renouncing all titles and money from his family.It was while he was in the monastery that his talent for speaking was discovered. He was a small man, thin, and not prepossessing; yet when he spoke, everyone else fell silent, so golden was his talent at speeches.It was some time after he had become a priest that he learned about the friars minor, those men led by St Francis of Assisi, who gave up everything and lived the most humble of lives, begging for their living.The effect that five Franciscan martyrs had on everyone, deepening their faith, made Anthony long to quit the monastery and become a Franciscan martyr himself. Eventually, he did become a Franciscan, one of the few priests among the friars minor. And he did sail off to become a martyr. But a severe illness nearly killed him.It was while he was ill that \\"a new light shone in his mind. What had been the purpose of his preaching...Because he loved God? -- or because he had hoped to lift himself toward God on the words of those who heard him?....He had set his own mind and own desires above the advice and counsel of others\\" (p 161-2).He had cut off the strands that tied him to the world, one by one. This last revelation would lead him to great holiness, and some surprising miracles."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Robert Tanenbaum's new novel, \\"Fury,\\" is the seventeenth in his Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi series. Butch Karp is now the interim Manhattan DA in a city filled with racial and political tension. In spite of the pressures of his job, Butch is not complaining. Much to his relief, his wife of twenty-five years is no longer involved in her usual wild and dangerous escapades. In fact, Marlene is trying to keep a low profile, and she seems content to spend more time at home with her family. For a change, everything seems to be going smoothly for the Karps. Little do they know that trouble is brewing on several fronts.First, a group of black men, who have been nicknamed \\"the Coney Island Four,\\" are suing the city. They claim that they were railroaded into confessing to the brutal rape and beating of a female jogger named Liz Tyler. Although the men spent time in prison, they are now free and have the support of an opportunistic lawyer named Hugh Louis who loves to play the race card. Michael Denton, the Mayor-elect of New York, and Richard Torrisi, the attorney for the Police Benevolent Association, ask Butch Karp to step in and represent the city as special counsel. Denton and Torrisi want a man of known integrity at the helm, and Butch reluctantly agrees to help.\\"Fury\\" also deals with Middle Eastern terrorists who are planning a major strike against Manhattan on New Year's Eve. There is also the high-profile case of Sarah Ryder, who claims that her Russian professor, Alexis Michalik, raped her after drugging her drink. Michalik, who is happily married and awaiting the birth of his first child, vehemently denies Sarah's charges. As usual, Karp and his family get involved in all of these story lines and Butch once again wages war against corrupt cops, lawyers, and judges.Tanenbaum throws in a host of both new and familiar characters, including the aforementioned terrorists, Russian gangsters, \\"mole people\\" who live under the streets of New York, John Jojola, a spiritual police chief from New Mexico, and a Vietnamese man named Tran, all of whom play key roles in the novel. Ace reporter and snoop, saucy Ariadne Stupenagel, is still nosing into Karp's business, and Butch's old cronies, Ray Guma and V. T. Newbury, are on hand to lend Butch some much needed assistance.Not only has Tanenbaum attempted to do too much this time around, but he also goes over the same ground that he has covered many times before. Although there is a bit of romance and cutesy humor to lighten things up a bit, \\"Fury\\" is dizzying, much too complicated, repetitious, and extremely implausible. The overburdened narrative eventually sinks under its own enormous weight. Butch, Marlene, and their children again play the roles of superheroes, as they have so many times in the past.There is no question that Tanenbaum knows New York, and he always deals with timely themes in a lively manner. He captures the earthy dialogue of the city's streetwise denizens, and he is intimately acquainted with the ins and outs of the criminal justice system. His courtroom scenes are as entertaining as ever. However, at almost five hundred pages, \\"Fury\\" is a bloated tome featuring cartoonish characters involved in far-fetched situations. Let's hope that book number eighteen, which Tanenbaum sets up with a cliffhanger ending, will be more streamlined and believable than this one."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Like Hoax, a dreadful book.

The only reason I slogged through this mess is that I have read and enjoyed all the other Karp/Ciampi outings.The characters in this book are reduced to charicatures The bad guys are Snidely Whiplashes in that they leer, sneer, sweat like pigs and have no redeeming characteristics to humanize them at all. When they get their comeuppances, which one can forsee the instant they are introduced, there is no satisfaction for the reader because the end is so obvious.Butch is tired, Marlene got boring, Lucy is barely there and what's up with the cowboy and the mystic??? Morlochs and mole people, oy, give me a break!The plots, there are 3 or 4 or - who can keep count? - are totally without subtlety and verge on the preposterous.To sum up: too much, too little, too bad. Are we sure Robert Tanenbaum really wrote this book?"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I have read nearly all of the Tanenbaum mysteries with great pleasure, often finding them compelling in a literary sense beyond what is usually achieved in the mystery genre. That is why I was particularly disappointed by the sodden mess that is \\"Fury.\\"First of all, the book is littered with spelling and usage errors which make one suspect the professionalism of the writer. Secondly, every time a character is re-introduced, we are presented with an extensive retelling of his or her entire story. Thirdly, we are imprisoned by long, disturbing rants about the New York Times, date rape, and criminal suspects that seem utterly out of character for the morally subtle Karp we have come to know from previous books. Fourthly, and most disturbingly, sensationalistic and supernatural elements are handled without the economy and grace which have characterized previous books.Jump cuts in time, place, and point of view make the story more difficult to follow than necessary. Bloodbaths are used to solve plot problems at the end. It appears to be easier to kill off characters than to make them speak and act convincingly. The last paragraph contains a cheap phone call cliff-hanger which destroys any resolution which might have been achieved. But the most fatal error is the unbelievability of the transformation of Karp's character from the stern moralist of earlier books to an equivocating master of politics as the art of the possible.The Murrow/Stupnagel characters make a welcome appearance in some of the best writing in the book. But the plot is too complex and the number of characters too dizzying to be handled gracefully.I read this book without knowing about the ghost writer dispute. My advice to Mr. Tanenbaum is bring him back or kill the series."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed each book in the Butch Karp series until Tanenbaum tried to write without the assistance of Michael Gruber. I didn't realize quite how accurate the dedications in the earlier books were (in which Tanenbaum thanks Gruber, \\"yet and yet again\\" for the excellence of the books.) Tanenbaum is lost on his own. Too many idiotic and intertwined plot twists and turns.Also, Tanenbaum has stopped telling an interesting story and somewhere along the line he decided that Karp's children are more interesting than the other workers at the DA's office or Marlene's Vietnamese sidekick. Unfortunately, it's not true (why should any adult reader care if Lucy Karp is \\"saving herself\\"?) And Marlene is so close to a nervous breakdown/suicide and without a shred of moral limitation that she becomes an annoying characature. And how, exactly, can Karp continue to overlook Marlene's various illegal acts? What was at one time a subtle moral shift (\\"Ever more Sicily, ever less Smith\\") has broadened into wholesale illegality under the guise of spirtual sensitivity.Tanenbaum has unlimited ideas for plots but is in desperate need of someone, if not Michael Gruber, how about an editor, to bring some discipline and sophistication to his out of control writing."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Have been an avid fan of Butch and Maureen but I'm sick of reading filler and old history. The last two books have been real bad about draggin'. Two thirds of the story could have been written by a 70's word processer.

As a long time fan of Robert Tanenbaum, the man who was taking credit for these wonderful books, I was flabbergasted to discover he was using a ghostwriter (Michael Gruber). Since they ended their agreement, the last two books have been totally disappointing. I read Fury just to see if the old spark might have returned. . .but no. The writing style is juvenile. . .the prose is flat. . .and the wry humor is gone. The only reason to read this book is to marvel at how truly abominable it is. Rest in peace, Butch and Marlene."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"It is truly a bad sign when you're on page 296 and are still hoping that the book will, at some point, start getting good. When an author believes that those fans who have read every book in this series need to be told about every character in every previous novel, that is also a bad sign. When characters suddenly act completely out of character (Lucy's decision, for example), that is another bad sign. The only good sign is the sticker on the front of the book that says \\"Sacramento Public Library,\\" which means I didn't waste any money on this book, only several hours of my life. I am going back to reading Ken Goddard."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"For the first time, I put down one of Tanenbaum's book without finishing it. I found his characters stereotyped (I wouldn't be surprised if Rev. Sharpton sued) and plot lines absurd. I had a similar but not as strong reaction to Hoax. After reading some of the reviews here, I discovered that he had a co-writer who may have been the heart of his previous books. Too bad Mr. Gruber isn't around anymore."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I've always enjoyed Tannenbaum's books, but this one is an exception. Simply put, it seems to be a rather amateurish rewrite of his earlier book ''Resolved''. The plots are very nearly identical, which is bad enough, but the writing is not up to Tannenbaum at all...the similes are contrived and unnecessary, the plot drags badly in spots and the antagonists are like the antagonists in a bad Clint Eastwood movie -- no redeeming features at all.There is a terrorist plot to blow up half of NYC with ammonium nitrate and gasoline (Resolved) - a crooked DA (Resolved -- altho' this one is in Brooklyn, and in this case, a judge is also involved), a crooked attorney on his own staff (Resolved), Karp shoots down the crooked lawyer and a lying witness or two with skillful courtroom badinage and procedural manipulation (Resolved) -- there's a fight in the sewers of Manhattan and Lucy's homeless friends are involved (Resolved) .One gets the feeling reading this book that Tannenbaum's publisher was pounding on his door demanding a new book NOW so the book was rushed....either that, or there's a new developmental editor at work here. In either case, ''Fury'' is not worth the paper it's written on (my opinion), and if you're expecting a typical Tannenbaum novel, you won't get it in this book."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Tannenbaum does an extraordinary job of developing each character such that you feel you know each of them personally. Fury was full of the quirks I have come to love about his characters. If was full of action and suspense. I love the way he weaves together a number of sub-plots with the main story. This is a must read and if you are a first time Tannebaum reader, prepare to become hooked!"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I was disappointed. The plot jumped all over the place, and at times was downright ridiculous. I have been a long time Tanenbaum fan, and I looked forward to each new installment of the Karp/Ciampi saga, but this one left me wondering what went wrong."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I disagree with all of the negative reviews. I've read all of the Butch and Marlene books and only hesitated with Fury because of the \\"terrorists blow up New York\\" plot. However, I just finished Fury and have to say it is by far my favorite of the series. The emotional angst of Marlene and Lucy is missing, finally. I lost track of how many characters (most of them known to readers of the series) and storylines involved in the book, but acknowledge the talent of RKT that not only could I follow the plot(s) but that they all meshed and were resolved at the end. Even the cliffhanger at the end, which I imagine will be the basis for the next book, does not detract. So if you're a fan of the series, Fury is a must."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"What to sub-terranial \\"mole people\\", Middle-Eastern terrorists, Cowboys and Indians from New Mexico, Russia mob bosses, convicted rapists and their victims, WMD, college profs and their students, Vietnamese war veterans (from Vietnam), and NY District Attorneys - all have in common? They are in this book. That's all. Sound Random? It is. Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Excellent book, one of his best, didn't want to put it down,would recommend 100%"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This book is color coded. If Tanenbaum says someone has blue eyes, they're good; \\"swarthy\\" means they're Middle Eastern, so they're clearly terrorists, aren't they all; black means evil, bad, but say some of those boys sure can play basketball. But don't be deceived. In this book you will learn that if an African American studies hard enough to become a high school valedictorian, he's actually just putting on a show for whitey, and his real goal is to rape and murder.Street people are crazy, disgusting, and smelly, but some of them are so cute they can't enunciate: this is to show what a nice guy Tanenbaum is deep down.This book is so full of mindless \`patriotism' that even Russian gangsters love the US Constitution. I thought, Why does the author declaim such great love for the Constitution while he so obviously idolizes the very administration that is working so hard to trample that very same Constitution? Based on what I learned from the book, I quickly rebuked myself, What's wrong with you, thinking like that, don't think! what are you, some sort of bleeding heart liberal? A bleeding heart is better than no heart at all.This book has very little heart or head to it. Once you figure out the outlines of the plot, there is little suspense beyond wondering who is going to play what role as the implausible melodrama unfolds. I have read a couple other Tanenbaum books, when nothing else was available, and felt that his writing is about as subtle, sophisticated, and believable as a Batman comic book. That observation in mind, I was amused to note several times in this book the author does indeed invoke the Dynamic Duo.A couple minor details I was curious about. One of the bad guys (didn't have blue eyes) is named Radinskaya; I thought an ~aya ending was a woman's name, but I'm not sure about this. Tran says \\"Em vui ve gap lai,\\" but in Viet Namese, em is the pronoun used by young women.Tanenbaum's not a bigot, oh no. One of the young men is described as \\"a brooding, dark-visaged throwback to man's primitive past.\\" Tanenbaum should just come out and call him a gorilla and say he thinks black people are evil and inferior, instead of just insinuating. He does more than insinuate; he states clearly that the evil-doers were \\"Middle Eastern, Asian, or black. Not a Hispanic or a white among them.\\" Hispanics are sort of white, I guess. I can't believe that any African-American or Muslim would enjoy reading this book. I didn't.The funniest part of the book is near the beginning, where righteous Karp believes that the attorney should \\"seek justice, \`not win at any cost.'\\" The back flap says Tanenbaum \\"has never lost a felony case.\\" Hmmmm."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Twelve years ago five Bedford Stuyvesant teenage gangbangers were convicted of raping twenty-eight years old new mother Liz Tyler when they caught her jogging from Brighton beach towards Coney Island; they left her dead under a pier. After a decade behind bars for four of them, the one who turned witness had died; Enrique Villalobos, a lifer at Rikers Island, confessed to the crime as the lone assailant; Kings County DA Kristine Brennan admits that the only DNA found at the crime scene besides the victim matched that of Enrique. Politically ambitious attorney Hugh Louis demands the immediate release from prison of the Coney Island Four and persuades the oldest Jayshon Sykes to sue the city for $250 million.Since Brennan capitulated, Mayor-elect Denton demands New York's Acting District Attorney Butch Karp to defend the city. Meanwhile, Butch's wife Marlene Ciampi, defends visiting Russian Professor Alexis Michalik from the rape charge of NYU graduate student Sarah Ryder. While the married couple struggles with highly visible cases, they hear rumors that murderer David Grale, thought dead, is alive, and that terrorists plan to blow up Times Square at midnight on New Year's Eve.The seventeenth Karp-Ciampi legal thriller is terrific when the story line focuses on the two rape cases; on the other hand the terrorists and Grale subplots seem cartoonish and unnecessary in comparison. The lead duet remains as fresh and solid as ever as they work difficult cases under the media spotlight and the heated political reactions to the negative publicity of being on the accused side of both fights. Though the ending is obvious, fans of the series will cherish this installment and look forward to the next one, already set up.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I just finished reading Robert Tanenbaum's Fury, the latest in his Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi saga. All I can say is WOW! Having read every book in the series (and some, especially Corruption of Blood, more than once), I was not disappointed, except when the experience was over. Fury has everything: Cowboys and Indians, terrorists and totems, and the scathing, often hilarious dialogue that I have come to know and love from Mr. Tanenbaum. Marlene baiting the Rat Man and Zak mouthing off to Al-Sistani were two of my favorite scenes. I love the courtroom scenes, and the bar mitzvah classes. I read the speech where Karp explains why he is going to take the Coney Island case over and over again because it reminded me of how I felt when I started my freshman year in college; it also reminded me of why I chose to work in the legal profession.In addition, there are new aspects of the Karp/Ciampi relationship that have seldom been presented before, specifically, the family histories of the two main characters. We readers have had brief glimpses into the young lives of Butch and Marlene, but this time, Tanenbaum gives you more information than ever before into both Karp's and Ciampi's family histories and how Karp courted Marlene. The Concetta Ciampi story is heartbreaking, and captures what it must feel like to watch this (Alzheimer's Disease) happen to your parents, or your spouse. There was lots of background material about Karp. You get to see a touching, personal side of Karp in his acute discomfiture at Lucy's becoming a woman.The two boys are a fascinating study of the twin phenomena, and it has been satisfying (and oh so entertaining) to watch them grow up. I feel like I know them, as I do Butch and Marlene. Zak jumps off the pages at you, he is so real and full of life. Reading Fury was like visiting family, the Karp extended family, and I was very sad to finish it. The cliffhanger ending, also a new twist in this series, left me wanting more. I can't wait to read his new book, Counter Play, when it is published later this year.Many thanks to Robert Tanenbaum for the thrills, laughs and giving us the satisfaction of seeing justice prevail."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Acclaimed voice performer Lee Sellars gives a tense, don-t-want-to-miss-a-word-of-it reading of Robert Tanenbaum's 17th thriller featuring Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi.Tanenbaum is once again at the top of his game and on top of the news - he includes a subplot concerning the grabbing of a Karp family member by an Iraqi who plans to blow up Times Square on New Year's Eve.As if that weren't enough to worry about, Karp (now acting District Attorney) is looking at a million dollar suit filed by rapists who were originally convicted but later set free. Karp's sure corruption is rife within his own office as well as on the part of the lawyer who was instrumental in getting the rapists off. The media are on Karp's back, and terrorists trail him.Wife Marlene isn't at home eating bon-bons - she's working to exonerate a college prof accused of rape and she's also pitching in to help Karp who seems assaulted on every front.Tanenbaum has never set such a rapid paced scenario for this pair, and listeners will love it.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I thought this was a highly entertaining novel. The way Tanenbaum entertwined 2 or 3 major plots is the sign of a skilled author, and I thought he did a fantastic job. International terrorism, rascism, courtroom drama, family drama, all of this and more, make for a compelling and enthralling story with a very high 'entertainment value'. I thought this to be one of his best. I guess books are like movies as far as taste goes. Some will love it and some won't.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This book may not be the best of the Karp series (though I personally think it ranks in the top three), however, be careful of those \\"critics\\" writing in who completely trash it. My crime book club was contacted after Hoax by \\"friends\\" of the former ghostwriter, who is apparently very bitter about the split with Mr. Tanenbaum (though he happily accepted the paychecks). They were trying to organize Karp fans against the new writer by sending in bad reviews--we were told without bothering to read the books!! Pretty shoddy. Anyway, I thought this book was wonderful. Yes, it is quite complex with a half dozen threads woven around the central theme of our heroes's fight against injustice in the justice system--particularly a case that expertly mirrors the infamous Central Park jogger case. However, I think anyone who slights the book for that is simply more comfortable with pulp fiction and the tired, lackluster final books in this series by the former ghostwriter (if you doubt this, just go try to wade through one of the books written under his own name ... small wonder he and Tanenbaum split). The characters in these last two, Hoax and Fury, are MUCH more complete than they were formerly with motivation and \\"real\\" lives behind the action scenes. The humor is better--more in keeping with a couple growing older together, as well as their family's maturation (will Lucy marry the cowboy?) Any of the former books could have practically been set in the same year, heck the same month except the writer occasionally told us how old everyone was. But don't even believe me (or these so-called critics), go read it for yourself and then write an honest critique. I have only one complaint--Fury leaves us with a cliffhanger and now I have to wait another year to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"only tonight did i learn of co-writers. i guess this may explain the unfortunate change in tone and plot of the last few books. characters i came to know karp/marianne, lucy, tran have become cardboard cutouts. the plot is totally obvious; no twists or surprises here. totally hack writing. too bad."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Others have reviewed this book and said Tanenbaum has gone to the well once too often. True, but worse in my judgment, he has slammed the NY Times with ad hominems and without reason. If he wants to write a novel in which the NYT is, reasonably, the villain, ok. But no more Tanenbaum for me."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I know this review is very much after the fact, but I couldn't not write one. Unfortunately, I read an earlier Tanenbaum book about Butch and Marlene immediately before this book. That only served to highlight the differences (and they're not good ones) in the new book. It's like a completely different author wrote the new book (and from previous reviews, I'm gathering that it really WAS a different author!). The tone is completely different. The relationship (especially the humor) between Karp & Marlene, which made the books absolutely delightful for me, is totally absent. I'm sorry, but I loved the renegade part of Marlene. Gone. I realize that some readers don't like all the personal details, but that was what made the books a cut above the usual legal and detective fiction for me. A big disappointment."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"More than half of the book was spent introducing a dizzying array of characters with remote connections. The last part of the book read like a mad dash to pull together all of the sub-plots and characters into a single picture. There were allusions throughout of what I can only guess were previous books, but those references only made it more complicated and caused the book to lose whatever sliver of focus it had. Finally, the book was completely ridiculous in some spots (think James Bond) and didn't leave enough mystery to want to keep you going."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Fractured trash. Impossible to read and keep straight. meaningless sub-plotsstay away!!"},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I have been a Robert K. Tanenbaum reader from his first legal thriller. I always enjoy the books. His characters are well drawn and interesting - the Karp-Ciampi menagerie is improbable but highly entertaining. The action in the books is suspenseful and topical. And that is part of the problem with the latest entry - the topicality seems forced instead of being integral to the plot.I believe the main plot revolves around the \\"Coney Island Four\\" and the trial in which Butch Karp defends NYC against a civil rights suit brought by the \\"wrongly-convicted\\" rapists. This plotline gets lost among those involving the crazed, vengeful ex-boyfriend of Karp's daughter, a group of Arab terrorists intent on bombing Times Square on New Year's Eve, an alleged rape involving 2 ex-Columbia University basketball players, another alleged rape involving a grad student and her professor, the Russian Mafia, New Mexican shaman, etc. It'snot that these diversions aren't interesting - they are - but at some point I became lost as to which was the main plot, the one I should care about more than any of the others.Another problem with the Karp-Ciampi books is the injection of their family directly into each of these disparate plots. Earlier books meandered somewhat, but the action involved tangential characters who were connected to Butch or Marlene indirectly. The most recent books have the Karp-Ciampi tribe intervening in each of plots and sub-plots - a veritable group of superheroes waiting to save NYC and their assorted friends.Finally, one of the things I always enjoyed in these books was the emphasis on the realities of the law. This, too, is dissipated. It is as if Law and Order\\" suddenly spent more time on police shoot-outs rather than police procedure.So, on the whole, this is a fun beach read but don't rush out to your local bookstore to buy it."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Like others on this page, I've been a big fan of this series and have read each book. After reading Hoax and Fury, I have to wonder how much knowledge Mr. Tannenbaum has about his characters. Two examples leap to mind: Karp's \\"bum knee\\" returns in Hoax; Marlene's father switches from a retired plumber to a retired produce-store owner in Fury. Minor things, to be sure, but the lack of continuity is jarring. Hopefully this doesn't foreshadow a scene in the newest offering in which Karp's knee goes out at an in-opportune moment (again).Aside from that, there is a definite change in tone from earlier books, and not for the better. Fury lacks those subtle instances of humor in earlier books and reads more like a legal brief with footnotes imbedded in the body of the document instead of at the bottom of the pages.If this is your introduction to Butch and Marlene, do yourself a favor and grab any of the earlier books, especially the pre-Lucy ones. You'll see how Tannenbaum has been able to release so many books with these characters."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This was my first Tanenbaum book and is likely to be my last. The dust cover blurb looked interesting, but once I started reading... There are so many things that preclude this from being a good book: the EXCESSIVE description in so many places added at least an unncessary and annoying 25% to the length of the book; none of the characters was especially appealing or likeable; the kitchen-sink theory - too many plots that detracted from what should have been a straight-forward story (what the HECK was the point of 'the Mole People' and the Arab terrorists and the ex-Vietcong 'mafia' considering the supposed storyline blurb??); the immense dip in the 'main' story line about the Central-Park-jogger-like case - the full middle section of the book basically swept this away and picked up a few short chapters towards the end with the condensed and trite resolution.And - it is bad form to literally end the last paragraph of the book with a cliffhanger that won't be resolved for the reader for another year until the next volume comes out. This doesn't affect me, since I wasn't impressed with this book and certainly won't be awaiting the next installment, but it seems cruel to those who might be."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I am posting this late, but I can't be silent. \\"Fury\\" is dreadful. For Karp-Ciampi fans, it is sad to see how favorite characters have become caricatures of their former selves. The lengthy past-perfect back-stories and annoying flash-back devices, along with the preposterous plot recycled from past books make the story almost impossible to follow.Dip into the book at random and you'll come up with ham-handed, hackneyed and sloppy prose, like this, where, Karp fondly contemplates his wife's matured body: \\"the once-perky [breasts] no longer pointed up like flowers following the sun. But neither had they wilted, and if she had to work a little harder to keep that fine rear end as round and solid as a pair of bowling balls, he was well aware from her exuberance of the night that she was as passionate a lover as ever.\\"The author annoyingly overuses the word \\"apparently.\\" The narrative is salted throughout with little fragments in quotations supposed to be the thoughts or voices of characters, but it only comes off annoying. Clich&eacute;s like \\"In the blink of an eye,\\" \\"To her horror;\\" villains' eyes that \\"glitter with hate,\\" and shots that \\"rang out,\\" - make the book read like the Hardy Boys.Other passages are clumsy: \\"But suddenly there was a sound like angry bees, and his men crumpled to the ground.\\" Or ridiculous: \\"He knew that [the legal case] was a load of crock,\\" the author writes.There are many repetitive scenes. Rachman repeatedly gathers her papers and stalks out of meetings. The Russian mob decapitation dinner is played twice. Characters' fond memories of \\"wolfing down\\" Nathan's hot dogs are related at least three times - was Tanenbaum paid for product-placement, perhaps? Did anyone edit this thing?The author doesn't seem familiar with his characters and their history. That scion of Olde New York V.T. Newbury is described as being descended from New England Pilgrims. Tran is suddenly quite fluent and appallingly pompous in English. The once tee-totalling Karp is quite the drinking man. The twelve-year old twins behave like far younger children - the \\"little monsters\\" \\"scamper\\" and \\"tumble around on the floor,\\" greedily grabbing for toys. Has the author actually observed any twelve year old boys? Marlene's family history is completely different than told in the other books -her Sicilian great-grandmother immigrated in the 19th century, rather than her parents in the 1940's, and her father is a plumber, not a greengrocer. And her mother's name is Teresa, not Conchetta!The clumsily depicted ethnic stereotypes are offensive. Irish cops call one another \\"boyo\\". African Americans talk about \\"the Man\\" and \\"burn baby burn,\\" or use contrived language like \\"dawg\\" and \\"homes.\\" The Muslim characters are defamatory.The bad guys are ruthlessly bad, without a shred of humanity, and every person or institution they've encountered along the way has been equally bad. So, not only is Hugh Louis a despicable character, but so are his mistress, his wife, his alma mater, his clients and all of his associates. Ryder is a nightmarish witch, and DA Rachman is a stereotypical angry feminist. Most of the female characters besides the heroines (who are all insufferably noble) are depicted with a grotesqueness that reveals a rather nasty hostility toward women - the judge, the anchorwoman, Guma's stripper girlfriend, and the weak sister DA.Some of the plot is simply ludicrous. The Ryder character's motivation made me laugh. This young woman perjures herself and willingly fakes painful sexual battery to what end? To get a Master's degree in English! Puh-leeze!I am grateful for one thing - that the author has abandoned the unfortunate metaphor over-used in \\"Hoax\\" to depict Karp's sexual urges, the \\"little man that lived in his crotch.\\" Thank goodness that little man is gone from \\"Fury.\\""},{"Title":"Fury","review":"The plotting is nonsensical and racist, the writing hackneyed and often laugh-out-loud clumsy, the bad guys stereotypical. Once upon a time, Tanenbaum had a ghost writer who has evidently given up the Ghost. This book is so bad that I hate myself for reading the whole thing. I've read all the Tanenbaum/ghost writer books but this is definitely the last."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"I'm going to second the motion of the reviewer who wishes he had the time back that he wasted on this novel. There are brief flashes of the old Tannenbaum, but they are brief indeed. The terror plot was laughable. The courtroom drama was non existent, staffed with cartoon characters and deus ex machina device. To say that Tannenbaum has lost 'it' would be an understatement."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"While I hear Tannenbaum just a bit, these new co-authors stink.

I can't stomach reading this book. People still think this way? This is sick, I will never touch another of his books."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This is my first read of the Butch Karp series. It starts out as an captivating, well-written legal story involving a case about four young rapists aka The Coney Island Four. (A parallel to the Central Park Jogger?) The political and legal intrigue was going along just fine until too many other sub-plots entered the picture. The Islamic bombers, the native American Vietnam vet having visions, the underground people, Butch's daughter's cowboy-quick-draw boyfriend, the former Vietcong guerrilla, the corrupt police, the union boss, the street people, the sleazy defense lawyer, etc. I got lost somewhere along way and kept wondering about the rape case. The voices of Lee Sellar kept me entertained. Though I was still left with that \\"what the heck happened?\\" kind of feeling about the whole book."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Maybe it's because I am from New York that I see the resemblance of the main plot here to the case of the Central Park jogger - a young woman who was running alone in the park and was attacked and brutally beaten. She, too, was terribly injured and was unable to go back to her career in finance or her hobby of piano-playing. She, too, was so traumatized (and in a lengthy coma) that she could not testify about her attackers. Nevertheless, a group of young African-American men were convicted and sent to prison, only to be released years later when some other man confessed to being the lone attacker. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and other leaders in the African-American community trumpeted loud and long about the innocence of the original group. Tannenbaum has used all of these facts in the book and given a twist to what was and wasn't made public at the time.The author has taken just a few liberties with these cicrumstances and constructed a complex tale of vengeance, prison gangs and the lasting effects of crime. I liked the interweaving of the Russian mafia, the street gangs and the legal system's corruption. Very cleverly done, even if the lead characters (whom I didn't know since this was my first Butch and Marlene book) seemed rather flat. On the other hand, the investigative and courtroom action was well-done and moved quickly.Unfortunately, the author decided to include two additional subplots: a sexual harassment suit against a college professor and a terrorist plot on Times Square. [Note: I am writing this a few weeks after the unsuccessful terrorist plot at Times Square.] While I am all for solid plots, these two elements really were not well-connected to the main plot and seemed to come out of nowhere. Plus, the characters introduced were, well, to put it kindly, unbelievable. I skimmed a great number of those pages in the middle of the book, with no loss to the exciting final scenes that resolved the main plot."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This story about Butch Karp and his wife Marlene and their brood, is a complete and total mess. What was a good story about NYC politics and back room dealings, that are based on a brutal rape, was a good premise. Then we have to have all of these subplots, including a Native American characters \\"dream\\" about a terrorist plot with a dirty bomby in Time Square. A visit to \\"underworld\\", as a tribute to HG Wells, and I wonder how drunk the author was when he wrote parts of this. I listened to the audio CD and Lee Sellars performance is very good, despite the subject matter. The fact that he takes this ridiculous story into a tease for the next book, makes me want to puke. Completely improbable situations compounded one upon another."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"My husband actually questioned what I was reading as I was laughing out loud. The imagery was so great! I love details and this book has details about the feelings of the characters. I don't want the book to end 'cause then I'll have to find another book to read and hope it's as good as this one. Since this is my third Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi, I think I'll get them all and start at the beginning."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"This is the second book not written by Michael Gruber, and I was unable to get through it. The wonderful, deep, three-dimentional characters so beautifully developed through the first 15 of the series have been compressed into cardboard cut outs and are as dead as Julius Caesar. I barely got through the previous \\"Hoax\\" (what an appropriate title), but the buck stops here folks. Mr. Tannenbaum, or whoever is doing his writing for him these days, has mistaken depth of character with gory, vivid detail that will give any woman nightmares. Avoid this book. I cannot recomment highly enought the Karp/Ciampi books by the real author Michael Gruber but stop when you get to \\"Resolved.\\" Then start on Michael Grubers new series which are terrific."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"Mr. Tanenbaum is a talented author BUT he took what could have been an interesting crime suspense and involved too many side plots, with too much detail about those side plots, that it completely detracted from the central story. By the time I was half way through the book I started tallying who was involved: the Bloods, the Russian mob, the DA for Manhatten as well as other NY political figures, Al Quaeda Islamics, an American Indian sherriff/spiritual leader, underground street people that have a whole society/army living in the tunnels under the city, a cowboy, and oh yeah, the Vietnamese crime ring! If only he had somehow squeezed in the Italian mafia, the Nazis, and an appearance by the KKK, then it would have really heated up. It was so implausable that it was disturbing even for fiction. To have so many seperate groups involved almost borders on sci-fi to me. Way too much time and detail was wasted on the sleezy college co-ed trying to set up and press charges against her, coincidently, Russian professor, who is coincidently related to the head of the Russian mob. Guess who else is coincidently related to the Russian mob? Karp himself! Next book they'll discover that Karp's wife, Marlene, isn't really Italian, she's really Russian also and happens to be Karp's fourth cousin twice removed or something.He also spent way too much time through out this book recapping past books about the characters. I don't have to go back and read his past books, he amazingly and annoyingly incorporated them into this one.In spite of all of that it was actually an ok read since I didn't actually spend money on it. It would be perfect for checking out of the library and using as mindless reading at the beach or by the pool. Well, except the part about trying to keep straight how so many diverse groups are tied together."},{"Title":"Fury","review":"\\"LIAR!!!!\\". And then shots rang out in the courtroom.Tannenbaum's New York City legal thriller's plot somewhat resembles John Grisham's A Time to Kill except the victims' and the perpetrators' skin color has switched. Loved both books. The Coney Island five, not the Coney Island four that the press touts, had been in reality the Coney Island six when the brutal beating, near murder, and gang rape of the victim occured 12 years ago. That all changed when one of the accesories to the crime confessed and told the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The six became 5 when this brave soul was shot dead in California, 3000 miles away in a \\"gang related incident\\" some years after, of course. The camera loving prosecutor Hugh Louis resurrects this case so that 4 of the \\"victimized\\" can walk free and urges everyone to love justice, and be color blind. Well, if one had all the facts, no one in their right mind, black, white, blue or green would want these thugs back in their neighborhoods. Enter Manhattan District Attorney \\"Butch\\" Karp to set the record straight. The plot in this is so thick, with plots and subplots and subsubplots. In the end you'll be furious, but you'll love the ending. Probably doesn't happen in reality, especially in New York City, that in all cases, right and truth win and liars, murderers, perverters of justice are had. I imagine that maybe Robert K. Tannenbaum is hoping that the power of suggestion put to good use will turn some tables in people's minds. I devoured this book and I haven't even mentioned half the people or cases that come Karp's way in the one month and a half, near 500 page book covers.At his twin sons' bar mitvah training, Karp thinks to himself: \\"but old Pontius Pilate was just the most famous judge who gave into popular sentiment rather than doing the right thing. There would be many others.\\""},{"Title":"Fourth Mansions","review":"An incidental remark about allegories reminded me of this little volume by R.A. Lafferty. In many ways, I think it is his finest, although all of his efforts are remarkable. Whatever your preference, 'Fourth Mansions' remains the most unusual of its genre, an allegory that refuses to take itself seriously.When Freddy Foley, newspaperman and innocent, discovers that certain people seem to reappear at irregular intervals he insists on investigating and soon finds himself hip deep in a metaphysical odyssey. He discovers that there is not one, but four separate subcultures that share the world with humanity. The best of these are the badgers that guard the entrances of the human domain. The worst are the toads, the ones who sleep and are reborn. These are dedicated to keeping the world from evolving to the next level. Every time things get better they make sure they really get worse.Then there are the snakes whose wild mental energy runs out of control. For them the rest of us are toys to play with, energy to use up. Finally, there are the unfledged falcons. Well intentioned, they are the premature warriors, champions of violent solutions. Best to worst they spell little good for Freddy, whose truth seeking will lead him to the tops of mountains and the cells of asylums. 'Goof gloriously,' the snakes order poor Freddy, and so he does.Lafferty performs an unexpected deconstruction of the mythology of man's progress, and creates an entirely unique narrative for inner progress. Foley is Everyman (Foley = The Fool) on a journey towards a higher plane of being, impeded by creatures that symbolize his own weaknesses. The tale is told tongue-in-cheek, a burlesque parody of one pilgrim's progress. Filled with more mad characters than all of 'Canterbury Tales,' the reader is often left unsure whether to laugh or take notes.Of course, this is the great flaw of allegory; it never loses the taint of lecture. Plot serves message unforgivingly. 'Fourth Mansions' is only partly fiction as we progress from lesson to lesson. The good news is that Lafferty refuses to fall into the trap of being tedious, and, instead, allows the allegory to parody itself. Still, this is unusual entertainment, and not meant for everyone. Full of mind games and obscure symbolism made garish, it is a child of the late 60's, although I think it's intent is more valid now then it was then. Nowadays I sometimes wonder if the toads have managed to win after all."},{"Title":"Fourth Mansions","review":"One of the quirkiest science fiction novels ever written, Fourth Mansions reveals Lafferty's story-telling prowess in novel-length form. This is the timeless tale of reporter Freddy Foley, in a way a strange sort of Everyman, on the trail of things that ought not to be known. And they will not be known if a shadowy group called the Returnees have their way. Foley's misadventures lead him to a tangled web of bored suburbanites who concoct a mindweave to snare unsupecting souls. When the weave takes on a life of its own, demanding ever bloodier sacrifice, Foley is drawn toward a meeting with destiny that will take him into the secret world of the Returnees. Along with Past Master, Arrive at Easterwine, and Annals of Klepsis, I rate this book among Lafferty's best, and reread it often to remind myself that no matter how odd the world gets, it doesn't get odder than Lafferty."},{"Title":"Fourth Mansions","review":"R. A. Lafferty writes like Schrodinger theorizes. FOURTH MANSIONS is perhaps the greatest novel-length work by Lafferty. Lafferty gives the impression of a sort of bumbling, provincial rube, but underneath the strategic humility is a steel-trap mind and a terrifying erudition. Lafferty seems to know everything there is to know, and he'll mention it all offhandedly. He also casually and constantly throws off words that have me scrambling for the dictionary-- but they aren't pretentious, five dollar words, they're usually gorgeous, old, almost forgotten slang terms. Lafferty was an electrical engineer who started writing at a rather advanced age. I am convinced that in his technical work he must have been involved in some pretty otherworldly stuff-- maybe he took a couple rides with Otis T. Carr or something. Unbelievably brilliant, but if you don't know what you're looking at, or if you don't have a capacious American-style sense of humor, you might not get it."},{"Title":"Fourth Mansions","review":"First of all, I gave this book the good ol' college try: I read it very carefully and took notes, getting all the characters and secret societies straight in my head, etc. Having been warned that it is considered a difficult book, I paid strict attention and did not read it in the bathtub.Normally I'm not a science fiction guy, but I had heard this book referred to reverentially a couple of times in that film about the guy who tries to find Dow Mossman, \\"The Stones of Summer.\\" Intrigued that people whose opinions I respected would be speaking so highly of a book I had never heard of, I determined to find out more about it. Then there was the internet: more lauds, such as those from the other reviewers on this page.So I read it. Currently I'm mulling over whether I should read it again, because at this point, to my shame, you'll have to append my name to the list of those who simply didn't \\"get it.\\"It's a pretty trippy book, and that, for me, is part of the problem: I'm not an alternative realities-type guy. And this book is very much in the vein of William S. Burroughs or the author or \\"Valis,\\" whose author Amazon is uncomfortable with my naming. I would recommend it for anybody who would be a fan of the Illuminati Trilogy, or \\"The Crying of Lot 49.\\"The plot is more than a little baffling, but I'll try to help you with that. The story follows an everyman-type reporter, Freddy Foley, as he slowly becomes aware that human history is being influenced by secret, powerful forces that have been around for generations. He travels all over the U.S. in an attempt to meet with people he suspects are involved in these conspiracies. As he gains more understanding, though, he himself actually begins to have superpowers of a sort, but then, towards the end of the book, we begin to suspect we shouldn't have trusted the narrator: was he even Freddy Foley to begin with? Is he crazy? Was he even a man? Has he actually even been traveling anywhere? Is this the story of a man slowly proceeding from sanity to insanity, or the reverse? Etc.So what's my beef? First of all, a mind-bending book like this one should have done a lot better with characterization. I feel Rafferty is poor at this. Other than their names, all characters basically feel the same. Further, they all talk the same: you certainly can't tell them apart with dialogue. Moreover, all the settings of the book feel the same (mainly because Rafferty eschews much description of place). It's hard to remember where Foley is geographically at any particular point in the book because you don't really feel you're \\"with\\" him, and for a book that plops you in the middle of all sorts of nutty scenes, conveying a sense that you were \\"with\\" the main character is sort of the sine qua non.Lastly, the whole thing is massively implausible. It would be one thing if it started out familiar and gradually blew your mind, like that movie \\"Vanilla Sky\\" with an ending that upturns everything. But this novel starts crazy. Right from the first page, you'll see why people consider this to be daringly original.But daringly original doesn't necessarily mean good. I'm not surprised it's out of print.As I say, though, to be fair, I ought to read it again without delay. Only by doing so can I be confident in my opinion. Preventing me from doing that, though, is my suspicion that whatever wisdom Lafferty has to impart to me upon a second reading is not worth the trouble. I'm skeptical there was much wisdom imparted on the first go-through.Thus I only offer my initial judgment for what it's worth. Here's at least one guy who wasn't so taken with the thing.[UPDATE:] Okay, I just finished reading this twice. Something drew me to it, perhaps not its rumored excellence so much as the challenge of sorting everything out.This second time I read it more carefully than the first: the most careful reading I give to books: bolt upright at my computer, outlining in Word all the characters and places, double-checking everything on Wikipedia, etc.Here's how I'd characterize the experience of reading this book: it's like you've got this storyteller buddy. You get him totally wasted on LSD and make him tell you a long story without giving him any time to prepare. Meanwhile, you transcribe his ramblings using careful grammar, spelling, and punctuation. That's what it felt like.Yeah, it's definitely a head-trip of a book, but I'm not sure that necessarily makes it good. As Bill Hader wrote in the NYT about Lafferty's short story colleciton, \\"Nine Hundred Grandmothers,\\" \\"You get the feeling like it's a guy just writing to amuse himself.\\"It's possible that my present sense of satisfaction with the book is merely satisfaction with myself for sorting the whole thing out. I can't think of much I like about the book, but I can think of a couple of things I don't:1. I believe Lafferty (here, possibly elsewhere) is not so great with characterization. All of the characters basically talk and emote the same. Those who don't, such as Letitia Bauer and Miguel Fuentes, are given hardly any lines. You'd never be able to identify a character merely from a line of dialogue in this book. Even Freddy, the main character, has got virtually no character other than being stubborn. I know he's supposed to be an everyman, but you can still have an everyman without his being so flat. (I'm thinking of several of Jimmy Stewart's many roles.)2. Regardless of how carefully you pay attention, much of the novel will remain opaque, as Lafferty jumps right into the middle of things without building up to them or letting you come up for air. Before the book even begins, Freddy has been touched by the weave and has therefore begun to obsess about Carmody. Also, Biddy was his girlfriend who gradually got more and more involved with the Harvesters. By the time the novel opens, she's fully involved. Meanwhile, though, Freddy's powers continue to grow until he can receive instant messages in his head and then transport himself anywhere he wants without having to travel conventionally. Further, characters seem to know each other who haven't met, and Freddy suddenly knows things that the reader knows he didn't know yet hasn't seen him learn. (E.g., Are the Harvesters literally snakes or not? Or both? And why on earth would Tankserly care about \\"O'Claire,\\" for example, and how was it that Freddy abruptly knew he was a patrick, or even what that was? From conversations with Biddy? Where were those?) Things like this are gonna be seriously disorienting on first reading. The way I reckon it, you're gonna hafta read the thing once just to see what people are talking about, a second time to figure out what just happened, and a third time to actually enjoy it -- if possible.3. There's a lot of digressions that you're patient with the first time, but the second time since you know they have nothing to do with the plot, you realize it's just the author being undisciplined. Things like (just to take one example) how Southern river cities are all \\"mean.\\" That had zero to do with what came before or after, so you'd think that in such a carefully-wrought masterpiece, asides like that would be excised. But they're not, casting suspicion on how carefully this was written to begin with.Others have claimed there is essentially a T.S. Eliot-style message buried under all the craziness (modern life is jejune; let's get back to our spiritual and mythological roots), but if so, I couldn't detect it.My advice if you're in to this kind of thing is to make instead for G.K. Chesterton's \\"The Man Who Was Thursday,\\" which is another mind-blowing book about conspiracies (also written by a Catholic) that shares much of Rafferty's sense of humor. It covers much of the same ground as \\"Fourth Mansions\\" does but is not so head-breakingly difficult to navigate.Final judgment: uncertain this was worth the effort I put into it. \\"The feeling that the whole thing was a hoax.\\"[Update II] Well, I've read this a third time -- not sure why. On the first couple of readings I suspected that \\"Fourth Mansions\\" was essentially a densely-written gimmick, but it took three successive readings before I was able to resolve the question to my satisfaction. Three readings! And I don't even really like it! Some applause, please.Certainly this book is the ultimate mind-eff. You might think you've had experience with an unreliable narrator (Borges, Eco, Joyce, Marquez, etc.)? Hah! Mere provincials! You haven't tasted hide nor hair of what it's like to have an unreliable narrator until you've taken a heady quaff of Lafferty's \\"Fourth Mansions.\\"At its deepest levels I would assert that the book is an extended mediation on the nature of knowledge: how it is that, at least in a book, one knows what one knows. What can be trusted? What is real? What makes you so certain of this or that? The book invites you to assume something, then merrily smacks you about when you do. (Plan on writing \\"WTF?\\" in the margins many, many times.)To be sure, the book is very carefully written. At first it appears to be the story of a reporter on the trail of secret societies. Then you realize it's the story of a sane man's descent into madness. And then you realize you had no good grounds for assuming he was sane to begin with. Ultimately it dawns on you that there is no solid ground anywhere in the book on which to base any of those interpretations, and, further, that there is no aspect of the book whatever that cannot be called into question -- starting with the name of the protagonist!Here's how I'd summarize the experience of reading this book, using Melville as an example:\\"I'm gonna tell you the story of a man who goes to sea on a whale-boat. His name is Ishmael. He meets a captain who's lost his leg to an enormous white whale. Now he seeks revenge against this whale. The whale could symbolize many things: evil, fortuity, animal instinct, beauty, the absence of meaning in the universe, etc.\\"Here's where you go, \\"Okay, tell me more about this whale.\\"\\"What whale?\\"\\"You said there was a whale being hunted by this captain.\\"\\"There might not be a whale.\\"\\"Then what is the captain seeking revenge against?\\"\\"Uh, he might not actually be a captain.\\"\\"Well, what about the sailor Ishmael?\\"\\"That may not be his name.\\"\\"Well, at least they're on whale-boat, for Christ's sake!\\"\\"I never said anything about whaling . . .\\"And that's what it's like reading \\"Fourth Mansions.\\"On the one hand, Lafferty, I suppose, is doing his job insofar as his book gets you talking about it and constantly re-thinking it. For me, though, I found myself not so much pondering the applicability of Rafferty's insights to the world at large as whether the book were nothing more than a humbug, trying to be a bugbear.That is why, although brilliant, \\"Fourth Mansions\\" is also a bit silly. Any insights you gain from the book won't leave the book. In other words, the book's insights are circular: the only thing reading \\"Fourth Mansions\\" is good for . . . is for reading \\"Fourth Mansions\\" some more! Unlike the wisdom of Melville, you'll find little to take home with you.In closing, I note with no little embarrassment that, upon re-watching \\"Stone Reader,\\" I see that the guys who were waxing enthusiastic about this did say they were in 11th grade at the time.Er, whoops."},{"Title":"Day Star","review":"So many things in this novel reflected the journey of faith that I immediately drew an analogy with Christendom.

The stories in this volume are great, a thinking person's short story (but then, isn't this the genre for the thinking person?)

In &quot;Absolutely Brilliant,&quot; he contributes two pieces, including what may be my favorite short story of all time: &quot;Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.&quot; In &quot;Guess&quot; Conover weaves UFO and Roswell lore into modern politics and pop culture, throws in a measure of Heavy Metal and turns it all into his own wonderful, twisted world.

His work in Empire of Dreams and Miracles was sensitive, suspenseful and thought-provoking; in Absolutely Brilliant in Chrome, he is all of that, but also deft, a little sly, and irreverently funny.I think Douglas Adams would approve of the rollicking satire of Guess Who, but there is more of a nod to John Irving in Conover's other submission, Perfect for Each Other. Anyone who has read Irving's Garp or The 158-lb. Marriage knows he can be surgically precise in identifying the heart of a troubled relationship, and Conover uses the same incisive intelligence in describing the genetically superior, but emotionally crippled characters in his story.I read both wanting to know what happens next at the end of the stories, and I eagerly anticipate publication of a full-length novel by this smart, funny, talented writer."},{"Title":"Absolutely Brilliant in Chrome, Vol. 1: Phobos Galaxy","review":"This is a solid ten collection anthology by seven individuals (Daniel Conover, Carl Frederick, and James Maxey submitted two tales each) who have won Phobos Fiction contests and considered by editor Keith Olexa as some of the future breed of superstars.

The fact that Chahin chose to start from here (circa 1300 BC) is significant enough, considering that many scholars choose to ignore Armenian history until the late medieval era (circa 900 AD), when the Bagratuni Kingdom was established. And yet, he devotes roughly 2/3 of the book to Urartian history, richly describing the cultural and political legacy it left behind and showing that, far from being a weak state subject to the whims of the Assyrians, it always provided to be a thorn in the soft northern belly of Assyria, and, at certain points in its history, as well as its regional equal.There were only a few faults I found in this book: I was a little distressed of how Chahin broached the topic of the transition from Urartian to Armenian rule. Chahin takes the word of ancient historians, most notably Herodotus, at face value, and concludes that the Armenian people must have been colonists from Europe. This may be easier to forgive since new studies proving that Armenians were original inhabitants of the region only came to light in the 1980s, and that this book was published only in 1987. Chahin could have also devoted more space to the other kingdoms of Armenia; i.e., the Yervanduni, the Artashesyan, the Arshakuni, the Bagratuni, and the Cilician kingdoms. In the grand scheme of things, 230 pages on the Urartian kingdom seems significant, but it falls somewhat short when 1500 years of history is summarized in a space of only 90 pages. Nevertheless, it's an engaging read and a great introductory tome on the little known kingdoms that were founded in the Armenian highlands."},{"Title":"Loosed To Love","review":"Loosed To Love by Dr. Rita Twiggs was not only inspirational but totally written and inspired under the annointing of the Holy Spirit.

I was a little disappointed about a guy and really wasn't focused on GOD the way I should have been. This book came the day after I decided to put him out of my life and I needed the release this book gave me. It told me first and foremost, where all my energy and faith should like as a single woman. I could go on and on but I just would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Loosed To Love","review":"The chapter &quot;Entering the Holy of Holies&quot; presents a thorough understanding of the way mankind should approach God according to His word. This chapter teaches us that there is a Pattern for Worship, the same pattern that God gave the Israelites in order for them to come to Him and worship Him. I have been under the impression that the Old Testament was done away with or those who followed Christ was no longer under the Old Covenant because when Christ came He changed all of that and the New Covenant was presented to us. Thanks to the author for explaining the Pattern of Worship and also the symbolic meaning of the furniture in the tabernacle. God is order!"},{"Title":"Loosed To Love","review":"I found this book to be generally very interesting as stated earlier. Especially how Dr. Twiggs explained the Tabernacle and how our worship is to represent the various aspects of the tabernacle. However, the book to me did not have one major theme the author tended to switch to other topics and that i thought didn't help the overall impact of the book on my life."},{"Title":"Playboy Magazine, Tomb Raider Nell Mcandrew A.k.a.

After some 200 pages, my attempts to shake off growing annoyance at the author's cynicism and derision faltered. While I was open to the possibility that Mother Theresa might have had the same human frailties that we all share, I was disappointed that the author couldn't just accept that and move on. Instead, he seems to revel in gleefully attributing the most profane and egotistical motives to the reverend Mother's actions and words, but only rarely supplies any evidence to support his speculations. It seems at times that he is truly perplexed at the subject's motives, and thus failing to understand them, he merely constructs what he thinks should have been the rational approach. In the end, I don't really care what Paul Williams thinks of Mother Theresa...I want to know objective facts. I'll be more than happy to come to my own conclusions."},{"Title":"Critical Lives: Mother Teresa","review":"The only book that presents the true story of Mother Teresa.It is shocking and provocative."},{"Title":"Owls of the World","review":"I've had a copy of this book for several years, and although it is not cheap, it's well worth the money. It is a very good reference book, but not couched in language which is too techgnical for th4e average reader."},{"Title":"Owls of the World","review":"I was rather disappointed when the seller of this book, \\"Owls of the World\\" emailed me to tell me she couldn't locate it so had to re-imburse the payment.It was to be a June birthday gift for my grandson. Now I can ony hope I can find another copy for sale in time to give as a gift."},{"Title":"A History Of World Society, Volume B Sixth Edition","review":"I had to use this book as a course textbook for a college class last semester. One of the things that I really liked about this book is that it is very interesting; it really presents history in a fascinating way - one that draws you into it as you read. However, one of the bad things I found is that with this approach, it is very difficult to read to find specific information (although the quite-extensive index does definitely help). If you want a book you can skim, I wouldn't recommend this one - yet if you have the time to really delve deep, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"The only gifts we exchange in my family during the holidays are gifts of the heart. So, I decided to surprise my 33 year old daughter -- who now has her own young son -- by reading from the book \\"that I had read more times from cover-to-cover than any other book in my life.\\" When I reached into my bag and pulled out \\"The Best Nest,\\" tears of joy came to her eyes. Then, much to my surprise she jumped up and pulled her own old tattered copy from her bookshelf, which I had read to her so many times nearly 30 years ago. Yes, the book may have a few stereotypical notions about the roles of Mr. and Mrs. Bird; however, my daughter -- who is now a professor of Women's Studies -- still loves this old friend as much as I do."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"I bought this for my niece because I always liked PD's other books as a child and this is one I hadn't seen. I previously bought her \\"Flap Your Wings\\" which is a great, fun little story, so I thought this book would be as good. It's not. It's kind of dumb, really, and there are a few things that I really don't like for little kids. First, Mrs. Bird says she \\"hates her nest\\" and she gets her way and they move. Teaching kids to say they \\"hate\\" something to get their way? Nope. Second, toward the end, Mr. Bird thinks his wife is DEAD. He thinks she's been eaten by a cat. Wow. That's bad for little kids, right? No warning there, as PD's other books involve dogs in race cars, teaching an alligator to fly, or looking for your Mom. Dead wife? Yikes. Why couldn't he just wonder where she went? Why make him think she's been digested by a cat? It's not even consistent with the story!I should have read the book before reading it to my niece, but there was a time crunch. I give it a 3 because even though I'm not sure it's so good, she really likes it. The second time I read it to her, I edited it so that it wasn't so harsh. She's 2.5 years old, and even after 1 reading she could answer questions about the story. So as a learning book, it's right on par. I just wish they would edit it a bit. Change Mrs. Bird's objection, and take out the cat page, and it's a much better book for toddlers!But honestly, I would recommend \\"Are You My Mother\\" \\"Go Dog Go\\" and \\"Flap Your Wings\\" and say leave \\"Nest\\" for another day..."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"My daughter enjoys this book, but the gender stereotypes make me cringe. In this book, Mrs. Bird complains and bosses her good-natured husband around so we have the typical nag and hen-pecked husband. For some reason, gender stereotypes sometimes both me more when they are in animal books than when actual people are depicted."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"THIS BOOK WAS BOUGHT FOR ME WHEN I WAS A CHILD.

My mother also knows it by heart because she had to read it to me over and over when I was a child. It was a joy to share this book with my niece and it will be a joy when I have children of my own to read this a thousand times like my mother did. I still have my old copy, and my neice has her brand new copy I bought for her on the day of her birth.

It's a fun read. This book has a great rhythm to it. The kids sign a long when I sing Mr. Bird's song. \\" I love my house. I love my nest. In the all the world this nest is best.\\" MUST HAVE BOOK! I loved this book as a child. My daughter loved and now my daycare kids love it.I disagree with the reviewer who said the book had the gender stereotypes.

After having read its Amazon reviews, I now know I wasn't the only little kid that HAD to have it read to them all the time! The illustrations are so memorable and the moral is priceless. At 23, I still remember the line \\"I love my house, I love my nest, in all the world my nest is best.\\" The book resides at Grammas house and will continue to be read to generations to come."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"I love these beginner books the binding is so sturdy on them. The story is so cute and what an adventure these birds have in their quest for a new home. They set out cause the wife decides she just can't stand their old place so off the couple go trying things from a hole in a tree, to a shoe, to a mailbox but all those places are already occupied by a raccoon, to a foot, to a pile of mail!! So the wife finds a beautiful bell tower and says \\"this is the place to make our nest\\" and the little hubby bird is at first a little hesitant thinking the place is just too big but she says 'oh no I like this big place\\" and so they settle and get busy at seeking out items to make their nest and this is where the book gets really funny cause they get things from'horse hair to mattress stuffing to human hair to sweater string and right off the people!! The expressions on the people they take from are just a hoot even my daughter yells \\"Hey their taking hair from his beard!\\". And at the end of the day the couple have built themselves one beautiful nest and the hubby bird is so happy he goes out of the bell tower (of course neither knowing it was a bell tower) and he gets up on the very top to sing his little song \\"I love my home I love my nest in the all the world my nest is best\\" and while hes whistling away all gleeful he fails to notice the man who comes to ring the bell everyday and all the sudden you just hear \\"ding dong ding dong ding dong\\" and of course the mother bird is RIGHT under the bell (cause thats where she built herself the best nest) so she flies out of there like lightening! The hubby bird returns to a big old mess the nest is destroyed and his wife is missing and he starts searching for her high and low in chimneys in trees everywhere he can possibly think of and just as he's starting to lose hope it gets worse he sees a \\"big fat cat with a big fat smile\\" and a few little feathers right by his \\"big fat smile\\" and thinks \\"Oh no that fat cat got Mrs. Bird\\" and so he's so upset and is flying around all frantically and a storm rolls in and he's so upset but he has to stop and rest and BOOM slams right into his old birdhouse \\"that old nest Mrs. Bird hated\\" and gets himself inside and there is Mrs. Bird! singing his song \\"I love my home I love my nest in the all the world my nest is best\\" and he's shocked \\"who, you, what are you doing here I thought you hated this old place\\" and she's had a change of heart and tells me \\"Not me cause even a mother bird can change her mind\\" and shows that she's sitting on a new big blue baby egg. The only qualm I have with this book is the wife bird uses the word hate and I prefer not to introduce that word to my toddler so I just edit it out when I read it! Its a great little short story especially if your little one is a bird watcher like mine. I also recommend \\"P.J. Funnybunny\\" by the same author that book is so fantastic!"},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. I had it memorized by the time I was 2.

Amazon is the only place I found it."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"Humorous story that teaches a lesson in \\"looking before you leap\\" and what can happen when decisions are made without the proper consideration. A pair of birds try out different homes and eventually discover they prefer their original nest to anywhere else. Perfect for the kindergarten/first grade level reader. My kids have liked every PD Eastman book we have read, for the way he draws the pictures, and the story content."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"I loved this book as a child and I love it now as an adult, having read it to other young children.

I still have my somewhat tattered copy in my home library and now I plan to order a copy for my twin 2-year-olds. The story is a true classic with the underlying message that we should appreciate our home and our loved ones. The story is all told through the eyes of Mr. & Mrs. Bird who grow tired of their old nest and go through many challenges trying to find a new one until something horrible and wonderful happens that makes them appreciate the simple things in live. A must read for all little kids. Grown-ups might enjoy it too!"},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"Both my daughter and I enjoy the tale of finding your own current home to be the best. Eastman's illustrations are always so wonderful and distinctive."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"For me, reading books to children, I really like to enjoy the book as well. My children' love this book - but I find myself fairly ambivalent towards it as a book. It is a simple story about two birds finding a new nest. The mother bird wants a new nest so they fly around trying different places, including a boot and (unfortunately) a church steeple. Finally when they have tried everything else they realise just what the best place to have their nest really is - and that is home.It is a nice story - and yes it does have gender roles in it - mother is defined with a head scarf and being disatisfied with her nest so she makes the father go out with her and find somewhere new. However, I don't think this is really problematical - you can actually look at is being a)indicative of the time it was written, b) indicative of some families - after all not all families are the same. I think most children will realise that most birds don't go round wearing hats anyway!It is a children's story - not a particularly inspiring one I think, but one children really enjoy and one with some really good messages to get across - ie, be happy with what you have!"},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"This is the book you remember from your childhood! A Classic! Great to read aloud, or great for a beginning reader to read to you."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"By far, The Best Nest was my FAVORITE book growing up. My mother would read it to me every night before bed, singing Mr. Bird's songs. Quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"...I have to agree, Philip Dey Eastman's \\"The Best Nest\\" definitely raises some questions in the modern adult's mind about gender stereotypes. Aside from putting the thrust of the story into motion- unnecessarily- Mrs. Bird is bossy, demanding, critical of her husband's judgement (while not possessing any better judgement of her own), irresponsible (she forces her husband to search for her), prone to change her mind on a whim, and completely unapologetic about all of the above. One can almost imagine the \\"Ain't that just like a woman?\\" snicker. As an adult, one can recognize that the book is a product of its era (it was first published in 1968), but the question definitely needs to be asked: \\"Can my child make that kind of distinction? Or am I teaching something about the interplay between men and women, and married couples, that I would prefer not to?\\"For myself, I'll say the bouncy wording and bright illustrations would probably appeal to very young children, and children over ten (if they're still interested in things at this level) probably *are* capable of recognizing that the characters are just characters and not role models. But I might hesitate to read this to a child in between those ranges... I'd much rather go with _One Fish, Two Fish_, or _The Sneetches_, or even Eastman's own _Go, Dog, Go!_.If your child's game of \\"house\\" gets a lot bossier after this book becomes their favorite... You've been warned."},{"Title":"The Best Nest","review":"Bought this for an upcoming baby shower.
